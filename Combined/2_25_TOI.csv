The film will be directed by YouTuber Vijay Kumar Rajendran (of Eruma Saani fame).Says Vijay, “It is a college-based script, inspired by a real story, and the entire film will take place within the premises of a college. Since Arulnithi plays the role of a college student, he has knocked off nearly seven kilos for the role. In fact, we were all quite surprised when he came for the shoot. He looks very young.”Apart from directing the film, Vijay will also essay a role in the film. “I play his friend,” he says, adding, “We have just begun the shoot of this film.”Arvinnd Singh, who’s the cinematographer and the producer of the film, tells us, “I have been working with Arul since Demonte Colony. We go back a long way. I met Vijay during the shoot of Natpe Thunai. It was then that he spoke to me about this script. I suggested Arulnithi for the lead, and as I expected, he liked the script.

1,['25/02/2020'],"Shoot at Site: Kabadadaari, a murder case is re-investigated","We were welcomed by a riot of colours at ARS Garden in Porur, where the team of Kabadadaari was busy filming a crucial scene from the climax. The set was decorated using flowers, maavilai toranam and plantain leaves. There were over 200 people on the spot, including junior artistes and the production team. The first sequence that was being planned was about honouring a powerful politician. The team had also planned to shoot a scene that showed the crowd raising slogans in support of the politician after he completes a ceremony at a temple that was erected there. A short dance number with folk artistes was also on the cards. No wonder director Pradeep Krishnamoorthy, cameraman Rasamathi, protagonist Sibiraj and producer Dhananjayan Govind were extremely busy that day, going through rushes and setting the stage for all the scenes that had to be shot.“This is a very interesting scene. It is coming out well,” smiled Pradeep, visibly excited with the way this remake of the Kannada film, Kavaludaari, was shaping up. It’s also being made simultaneously in Telugu, with Sumanth in the lead.“We will wrap up the entire project in two weeks’ time. What is left is a pivotal flashback scene. An infamous incident occurs in the time period 1975-77. What happens when the case is reinvestigated after 40 years forms the crux of the story,” Pradeep said.So, what kind of changes has he done for the remake? “Ours is a trimmed version, though the essence of the original remains unchanged,” he told us, “It was interesting to shoot both the Tamil and Telugu versions. The major difference between the two is the protagonist. Though it was a unique experience, this posed some challenges, too. Both the versions require different nativity and I believe we have managed to pull that off.”Pradeep is also doing a cameo in the film, and the director is unfazed about handling multiple roles on the set. “We had roped in an artiste to play the antagonist’s aide, but he couldn’t do it for some reason. So, the producer insisted that I play the role in both the versions. That is how I ended up working in front of the camera and behind it at the same time,” he told us.I have worked with Pradeep in Sathya — he knows both my positives and negatives. I play an IPS officer in Walter, and a traffic cop in this one. I thought there wasn’t much difference between both, except for the uniform. But I learnt so much about traffic cops only when I started shooting for the film. Unlike an IPS officer, a traffic cop requires a subtle body language. I completely followed the script and the director’s requirements.— Sibiraj, actorIt's a suspense thriller and we have worked hard to set the right mood with visuals. We’ve tried a different lighting pattern. I think this version will be technically much better. Both the Tamil and Telugu versions will have the same colour tone.— Rasamathi, CameramanWe have planned 40 days’ shoot for both the Tamil and Telugu versions. We have given more detailing to some of the characters and avoided spoon-feeding. Almost 75 per cent of the Tamil version is done; there’s just 10 per cent of work left in the Telugu one.— G Dhananjayan, producerIt's been a while since I did a Tamil film and I’m happy that my role in this one is a meaty one. I play a journalist who runs his own press, and belongs to the lower-middle class strata. He is frustrated with failures in life and has gone through several hardships.

6,['25/02/2020'],Govt panel to consider granting green clearance for new Parliament today,"This story is from February 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: The expert appraisal committee of environment and forest ministry will take up the application for granting environmental clearance for the new Parliament project on Tuesday. Sources said, meanwhile, the housing and urban affairs ministry will soon undertake renovation of Janpath Hotel, which is now lying unused, for temporary relocation of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art (IGNCA).

Relocating IGNCA is crucial as government plans to build the first office block on the plot occupied by this government-funded arts organisation. This will pave the way for shifting of offices from the existing buildings and expediting the redevelopment works. Sources said the construction of new office buildings will be taken up in a phased manner so that there is less displacement of people.

As per the Central Vista redevelopment plan, IGNCA will be finally shifted to the area where Jamnagar House hutments are currently located. Sources said the offices operating from these hutments and other such complexes in the area will be shifted to a new building, which will come up on a vacant plot on the Kasturba Gandhi Marg and some of these offices will also be shifted to an office building in Africa Avenue area in south Delhi. Officials said a proper work plan has been prepared to ensure that the entire redevelopment work is carried out smoothly.

Meanwhile, sources said that the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), has bid out the work for shifting of the present reception area and other facilities at Parliament complex. They added the makeshift reception will move close to the existing Parliament. “We need to free up more space for construction of new Parliament. The relocation of reception area will start soon,” said a source.

According to the application filed by the CPWD with environment ministry, the new Parliament will be constructed in 260 days and this will involve nearly 200 permanent and 3,000 temporary workers.

7,['25/02/2020'],Govt in a fix over uniform interest rate for land compensation across sectors,"This story is from February 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government seems to be in a fix over giving compensation to property owners whose land is acquired for public purposes. Sources said different infrastructure development agencies want the government to allow them to pay 12% annual interest on the total compensation amount as is done by the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ).

Sources said the issue was being discussed at the highest level involving all major agencies which acquire land for building infrastructure. NHAI has the giant share of land acquired by such agencies.

TOI has learnt that other agencies, including railways, have told the government that farmers want them to give interest on the compensation amount as the affected parties feel government entities are not following a uniform norm. The notified circle rate is taken as the base for calculating compensation.

As per the land acquisition law of 2013 (known as RFCTLARR), minimum compensation is to be a multiple of the circle rate, plus value of the assets attached to the property and a solatium equal to 100% of the total value of the property being acquired. The law also says that the circle rate notified on the date of the first notification by the government under Section 11, which corresponds to Section 3A of NH Act, will be taken for calculating the compensation amount. With such notifications, the government announces the intent to acquire land.

The land acquisition law specifies that in addition to the market value of the land, the collector (land acquiring authority) shall award an amount calculated at the rate of 12% per annum on such market value for the period commencing from the date of notification of social impact assessment study.

“Since the need to get land quickly is crucial for infrastructure projects for public good, cumbersome procedures (social impact assessment study) under the RFCTLARR don’t apply to 13 laws. The road transport and highways ministry had taken the opinion of Attorney General before coming out with a comprehensive guideline on how to arrive at the compensation,” said a government official.

Officials said the high expenditure on account of land acquisition has become a cause of concern for the government. They added in several cases, the share of land cost is 40-50% of the total cost of projects. In some highway projects, the compensation is higher than the total construction cost.

The PMO has asked the NHAI to come up with solutions of how to reduce the upfront burden on government for acquiring land for highway development.

8,['25/02/2020'],Setback for FC Goa as Edu returns home,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Panaji: FC Goa are waiting anxiously to hear whether Edu Bedia will have any more role to play in this season’s Indian Super League ( ISL ).

The Spanish midfielder missed training on Sunday and the team dinner later in the day at a restaurant in north Goa after he was granted special permission by the club to return home due to a personal emergency.

“Hello guys, unfortunately for personal reasons I have to go back to Spain. Best of luck for the next game and see you soon. Come on!!!,” Edu posted in the team’s WhatsApp group.

Edu has failed to make it to the starting eleven this season as former coach Sergio Lobera opted for Hugo Boumous who has been in irresistible form. The former Barcelona player, however, provides for an interesting option on the bench and possibly remains the strongest substitute.

Whether it’s Ahmed Jahouh or Boumous, Edu is a straight-forward replacement and even when interim coach Clifford Miranda wanted to see out the game after taking a 2-0 lead against Jamshedpur FC in the concluding league clash, he chose the Spanish midfielder while pulling out star striker Ferran Corominas.

Club sources said they are hopeful that Edu will return and help the team in the return leg of the semifinal at home on March 7.

Goa will have to wait till the end of the league phase on Tuesday to know their semifinal opponents. It could be Bengaluru FC, who they haven’t defeated since 2017, or if Chennaiyin FC can’t manage a win in their concluding league clash, it will be time for Goa to confront the team who robbed them of the title in 2015.

Meanwhile, club sources said reports and social media chatter that Edu has signed a pre-contract with Jamshedpur FC are incorrect. “He will never sign without talking to the club first, and even if he chooses to leave, Jamshedpur will be his last option,” said one official.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/setback-for-fc-goa-as-edu-returns-home/articleshow/74291765.cms
9,['25/02/2020'],I-League stars to face national team,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Panaji: I-League may have lost its top-league status to the Indian Super League (ISL) but players from the lower division will be handed a chance to impress national coach Igor Stimac .

Stimac watched Churchill Brothers FC face Mohun Bagan in Goa last week and was impressed with a few players. He has watched Indian Arrows take on the might of East Bengal too, while assistant coach S Venkatesh has been keeping track of players and reporting to Stimac on a regular basis.

While it may be too soon to expect Stimac to handpick a player from the I-League – someone who he hasn’t seen at the camp so far – for the next World Cup qualifier against Qatar in Bhubaneswar on March 26, they will be handed a chance to impress during a friendly against the national team on April 18, most likely in Imphal.

The friendly will be preceded by a three-day camp.

“We are working very hard on one very important point which was never done in the past. We will choose the best performing players from the I-League at the end of the season and play a friendly game against the national team. We are trying to fit that game in our schedule on April 18. I already have a list of players. It’s a big one and needs to be pruned down,” Stimac told TOI at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda last week.

It is unlikely that any of the I-League players will be summoned for national duty against Qatar. “It’s too soon because they haven’t adjusted their games calendar to Fifa schedule. They are playing games throughout and I will not disturb that. Once the league is over, some of the players will be part of the national camp,” said Stimac.

Since taking over the team in May last year, Stimac has not had a player from the I-League in the national team. While it’s also true that most of India’s best players are playing in the top-tier, Stimac said he will handpick a player without looking at the division.

“One of the reason we sent Venky to Arrows was because he could scout all the players from other teams (in I-League). He provides me with quality information. We are also trying to educate Indian coaches about the high standard of professional football so that we can work in different directions and improve.

“I have sent a very clear message to all I-League teams, players and people when I presented myself at the launch. The message is clear. They are part of my work and very much involved in what I am planning to do. If they work hard, play well and catch our attention with their quality and behaviour, they will find themselves in the list for the national team,” said Stimac.

14,['25/02/2020'],Dempo reaping benefits of investment in academy,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Dempo’s time and energy is now mostly spent at the Residential Football Academy at Ela in Old Goa.

PANAJI: Dempo Sports Club’s success at the national level can be measured by their record five league titles between 2005 and 2012 when they were unarguably the best club in India. It’s a record that has made everyone envious, and even though the club has now opted out of the top-tier, the record has remained intact.

Protesting the roadmap that made Indian Super League (ISL) the top-tier league and relegated I-League to the second division, Dempo, along with Salgaocar FC and Sporting Clube de Goa, opted out. They don’t hit national headlines anymore but haven’t stopped tasting success, even if its at the youth level.

Dempo’s time and energy is now mostly spent at the Residential Football Academy at Ela in Old Goa. They have dominated the states league and all three teams qualified for the AIFF Sub-Junior, Junior and Elite League this season. With such a strong foundation in place, club chairman Shrinivas Dempo wasn’t surprised to see the results.

“The fact that we have invested so much of money, time, energy on this segment, I think has paid us, not fully but started to pay us off. The vision is much more bigger and broader, but I think this is a good beginning,” Dempo told TOI.

Former technical director Karnagaran Naidoo from South Africa was instrumental in setting up the Academy. Katz, as he was popularity known, sowed the seeds for Dempo before he passed away in December.

Last season, only the under-16 side managed to qualify and take part in the All-India playoffs. They reached the main round, but were eventually knocked out in the semifinals. This time, Dempo have done much better. They won the GFA U-14 and tasted success with the U-16 team too, both remaining unbeaten in the league.

Dempo have now qualified for all the I-League junior tournaments from the zonal phase, remaining unbeaten in the Sub-Junior League and Junior League. In the Elite League (U-18), they lost only once and finished second as FC Goa topped the group with a better head-to-head record.

Even at the all-India level, Dempo have made a contribution. Four of their players -- Shameek Vas, Delmon Rebello , Shayne Don Afonso and Clarance Fernandes -- were called up for national camps. Shameek was even included in the India squad for the AFC U-16 championships and the SAFF Cup.

“Almost four or five of our boys have joined the India camp. Our vision in general is to see that the same team, our U-20 team, qualifies for Second Division I-League and go into I-League,” said Shrinivas.

Dempo have entrusted that responsibility to their new technical director Anju Turambekar, one of the first in Asia to now direct a men’s football club. Dempo are also targeting to improve their three-star rating to five-star among the AIFF academies. They have also planned to introduce the pay-in model in the next two years and are already getting inquiries.

“We are working on that now and once we are absolutely sure, we will start because the pay in boys will have different expectations. Once we stabilise completely, then we will have the pay in model,” said Dempo.

Having impressed many this season, the club has already started planning for the next. A talent identification camp for the AIFF under-13 Sub-Junior League and GFA League will be held next month at Duler and Nagoa.

“Katz laid a very strong foundation and was extremely disciplined. He built a culture of unity and developed the coaches. A lot of credit goes to him. Now, Anju is building systematically on that,” said Dempo.

Dempo may be out of sight at the national level, for now, but at least in Goa, they’ve not been out of mind.

15,['25/02/2020'],"In first of its kind, I-League stars to face national team","This story is from February 25, 2020

Stimac at Fatorda for an I-League game last week.

PANAJI: I-League may have lost its top-league status to the Indian Super League (ISL) but players from the lower division will be handed a chance to impress national coach Igor Stimac .

Stimac watched Churchill Brothers FC face Mohun Bagan in Goa last week and was impressed with a few players. He has watched Indian Arrows take on the might of East Bengal too, while assistant coach S Venkatesh has been keeping track of players and reporting to Stimac on a regular basis.

While it may be too soon to expect Stimac to handpick a player from the I-League – someone who he hasn’t seen at the camp so far – for the next World Cup qualifier against Qatar in Bhubaneswar on March 26, they will be handed a chance to impress during a friendly against the national team on April 18, most likely in Imphal.

The friendly will be preceded by a three-day camp.

“We are working very hard on one very important point which was never done in the past. We will choose the best performing players from the I-League at the end of the season and play a friendly game against the national team. We are trying to fit that game in our schedule on April 18. I already have a list of players. It’s a big one and needs to be pruned down,” Stimac told TOI at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda last week.

It is unlikely that any of the I-League players will be summoned for national duty against Qatar. “It’s too soon because they haven’t adjusted their games calendar to Fifa schedule. They are playing games throughout and I will not disturb that. Once the league is over, some of the players will be part of the national camp,” said Stimac.

Since taking over the team in May last year, Stimac has not had a player from the I-League in the national team. While it’s also true that most of India’s best players are playing in the top-tier, Stimac said he will handpick a player without looking at the division.

“One of the reason we sent Venky to Arrows was because he could scout all the players from other teams (in I-League). He provides me with quality information. We are also trying to educate Indian coaches about the high standard of professional football so that we can work in different directions and improve.

“I have sent a very clear message to all I-League teams, players and people when I presented myself at the launch. The message is clear. They are part of my work and very much involved in what I am planning to do. If they work hard, play well and catch our attention with their quality and behaviour, they will find themselves in the list for the national team,” said Stimac.

Hundreds of people thronged the streets at Rana Pratap Marg on Sunday to show their active participation at the 4th Awadh Queer Pride Parade . Although the turnout was not as much this year than last year, the enthusiasm and energy among the LGBTQIA members was at an all-time high.

17,['25/02/2020'],"‘India-US no longer just any partnership, it’s far closer’","Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the 'Namaste Trump' event at Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad. (PTI)

AHMEDABAD: India and the US were “natural partners” and their ties and cooperation would play a big role in determining the world’s direction in the 21st century, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said here on Monday in an unprecedented and unabashed public celebration of the bilateral relationship.“In the 21st century, when new alignments, new competition, new challenges and new opportunities are laying the foundation of change, Indo-US ties and cooperation will play an important role in determining the world’s direction. I firmly believe India and the US are natural partners. We can make an effective contribution to peace, progress and security not just in the Indo-Pacific region but in the world as a whole,” the PM said before a crowd of over a lakh at Motera Stadium, the world’s largest cricket arena.Modi’s remarks came after US President Donald Trump ’s speech hailed India and its people while taking a sunny view of ties with India. Reciprocating the optimism of his guest, the PM said, “The next phase of India-US ties is beginning... we believe in a long-term vision; bilateral economic ties and digital cooperation will grow and we will be able to fulfil our common dreams.”Earlier, in his introductory remarks before Trump spoke, Modi said, “India-US relations are no longer just another partnership, it is a far greater and closer relationship. The title of this programme, ‘namaste’, has a deep meaning. Its sense is that not just the individual but the divinity inside is being saluted.”Live updates: Donald Trump's India visitThe two speeches and, more crucially, the teeming crowds that filled Motera to its gills and lined up the entire 22km route from the airport marked a new high point in the growing bilateral ties. While it is now close to two decades since the two democracies overcame “hesitations of history” to end the long spell of estrangement, the public celebration of ties marked another peak. The advice that he should not get into a tighter clinch with Trump in the year of presidential polls in the US was no deterrent, as Modi made the throng shout “long live India-US ties” at the beginning of his speech.The continuing divergence over trade issues — something that Trump alluded to by terming Modi a “tough negotiator” — was not a dampener either.Modi referred to Trump’s comments on the US’s leading role against the so-called Islamic State and said, “In defeating terrorism, the US and the leadership of President Trump have served the cause of humanity.” He described Trump as a “singular (vilakshan) leader” and a “unique (ananya) friend of India”. The PM said it was significant that Trump was visiting India at the beginning of a new decade.Modi emphasised the upward trajectory of India-US relations and said, “Whether it is a matter of individuals or nations, the basis of their relationship is trust... to trust one another.” He quoted a Sanskrit phrase to say “friendship is where trust is unshakable” and added, “Our trust is at a historic level. I have seen this trust grow in my visits to the US. When I first met President Trump, he said India has a true friend in the White House.”The PM dwelt on several economic and welfare measures taken by the government, saying India had the biggest health assurance scheme in the world and it was also working towards accelerated financial inclusion. “Whether it is infrastructure or social sector, we are working on global benchmarks,” he added.Modi referred to laws on transgender rights, abolition of triple talaq, facilities for disabled, and maternity leave of 26 weeks for women. He also said India was the US’s largest trading partner and biggest research partner. “Ties in defence, energy, health and information technology... every area is expanding,” he said.Reciprocating Trump’s view that a growing US offered opportunities for India, he said the same was true for American investment in India. “The US will have more opportunities as India’s manufacturing grows and presents the US with new possibilities. Industry 4.0 and digital growth will mean investment for US,” he said.The PM took note of Trump’s reference to Indian icons, noting that the US president had spoken with reverence about Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda and Sardar Patel . “You said a lot about the capabilities of Indian people, you spoke a lot about me, I am grateful on behalf of all Indians,” he said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74291899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-308668,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-us-no-longer-just-any-partnership-its-far-closer/articleshow/74291850.cms

19,['25/02/2020'],US will always be faithful and loyal friend to Indian people: Trump,"AHMEDABAD: In a relationship-defining speech at a packed Motera Stadium on Monday, US President Donald Trump declared that his country would always be faithful and loyal to Indians, and enthusiastically embraced the entire gamut of India-US ties, saying shared democratic beliefs had forged an enduring friendship that brought the two nations together as powerful defenders of peace and hope.“It is faith in free society, confidence in your own people, your trust in your own citizens and respect for dignity of every person that makes the US and India such a natural, beautiful and enduring friendship,” Trump said.In a fulsome appreciation, Trump said, “The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress and a miracle of democracy, extraordinary diversity and above all a strong and noble people. India gives hope to all of humanity. It has become an economic giant, largest democracy and one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world.”In a speech lasting 27 minutes, Trump praised PM Narendra Modi as an “exceptional leader”, a living proof of what Indians can achieve by hard work, referring to Modi’s humble beginnings as a “chaiwala”. He asked the PM to “stand” and shook him by the hand. He said Modi was a leader who worked for India night and day and who he was proud to call his “true friend”.“We will always remember this remarkable hospitality. From this day on, India will hold a special place in our hearts,” Trump said. Referring to the PM, he said, “Everybody loves him but I will tell you this, he is very tough” and chuckled at his observation, adding Modi won a landslide in the largest democratic election to be held anywhere in the world.Live updates: Donald Trump's India visitTrump’s speech signalled strong confluence on major issues of India’s concerns. “US and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists and to fight their ideology,” he said. He added that his office was working in a “very positive way” with Pakistan to crack down on terror organisations and militants in Pakistan. “It is thanks to these efforts we are seeing some signs of progress with Pakistan and are hopeful of reduced tensions and more harmony for all nations of south Asia,” he added.“India and the US are committed to defend our people from radical Islamic terrorism ,” Trump said, while holding up India as an example of multi-faith tolerance. “India embraces individual freedom, rule of law, dignity of every human being and where people worship side-by-side in harmony,” he said.Trump dwelt at length on the burgeoning defence ties as he highlighted joint military drills and sale of American weapons — “the best and most feared military equipment on the planet” — to declare the “US should be India’s premier defence partner”. He emphasised that the US military had been “rebuilt” and that Washington was quickly revitalising its alliances and friendships all around the world and referred to India-US land, air and sea military exercise while announcing a joint commitment to a “free and open” the Indo-Pacific.The speech came against the backdrop of criticism of India over alleged rise of intolerance and erosion of inter-faith amity. But Trump showed no sign that the charges had resonated with him yet as he launched into fulsome praise for “one great Indian nation” despite diversity of faiths and beliefs. “Your unity is an inspiration to the world,” he said.“All Indians — Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Jews, rich and poor — must take pride in glories of the past, and a bright future,” the president said. Emphasising India’s democratic traditions, he said there was a difference between a nation that rose by coercion and one that rose by setting people free, and added that India would soon be home to the biggest middle class anywhere.Trump struck an emotional connect when he expressed warm approval for people of Indian origin in the US who he said were contributing to American life in every field. “They are titans of business, the biggest, the best, pioneers of science, masters of arts,” he said.The president took on opposition at home and spelt out why he thought there was great potential in India-US ties, and said US unemployment was low and the economy was booming. “A booming America is a great thing for the world,” he said, adding that he had shown how reduced taxes and regulatory burdens had worked and that Modi was also carrying out reforms at a record pace.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74292605,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-222392,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-will-always-be-faithful-and-loyal-friend-to-indian-people-trump/articleshow/74291975.cms
20,['25/02/2020'],E-way to take you from Delhi to Dehradun in 2.5hrs okayed,"This story is from February 25, 2020

DEHRADUN: An elevated expressway that will shrink the distance between Delhi and Dehradun from 250km to 180 km got an in-principle approval from the Centre on Monday.

A communique from the office of Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat confirmed this after National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) chairman S S Sandhu met him in Dehradun. “With the completion of the elevated road, the distance can be covered in as little as two and a half hours,” the CM said.

It now takes five-six hours to drive from Delhi to Dehradun. While the existing road between the two cities passes through Meerut , Muzaffarnagar and Roorkee , the elevated one will touch Baghpat and Saharanpur .

Terming the project as a major initiative for boosting connectivity to the Himalayan state, Rawat said, “The elevated road will give a major fillip to tourism and prove to be a big factor in the the state’s economic development.”

NHAI officials gave a presentation to Uttarakhand chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh about the elevated expressway project, which will be executed in three phases.

The first phase, as per information made available by the chief secretary’s office, will be 31.2 km long, connecting Akshardham in Delhi and eastern peripheral expressway, which will include a 18 km stretch of elevated road. The total estimated cost of the first phase has been pegged at Rs 3,250 crore.

The second phase, which is the biggest among all the phases, will connect eastern peripheral expressway and Saharanpur. The 118-km-stretch will be constructed at a cost of Rs 4,830 crore.

The last phase of 20.7 km will connect Ganeshpur to Dehradun. This phase will include construction of a 1.8-km-long tunnel, an additional tunnel of 400 meters near Dehradun's Daat Kali temple and an elevated road of 6.8km.

As part of the mega project, a new tunnel at Mohand has also been proposed, the NHAI chairman informed Rawat. Sandhu said some part of the proposed elevated expressway passes through neighbouring UP and he requested the UP government to expedite the forest and wildlife clearances so that the construction work of the expressway can start soon.

22,['25/02/2020'],"Hospital, library also on 5-acre mosque site","This story is from February 25, 2020

LUCKNOW: UP Sunni Central Waqf Board on Monday decided to constitute a trust to construct a mosque as well as amenities such as a charitable hospital and a public library on the five-acre alternative land allotted to it by the UP government following the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case.

After a meeting of the Board in Lucknow, chairperson Zufar Ahmad Faruqi said the trust would also build a research centre to showcase the Indo-Islamic culture of several centuries and other facilities for all sections of society.

In its edition on February 21, TOI quoted Faruqi as saying the Board “never had the liberty to reject” the alternative land once it had said it would abide by the apex court’s verdict. On Monday, he told newspersons the Board had decided to accept the land, located in Raunahi village under Sohawal tehsil in Ayodhya district.

“The trust will soon be constituted and names of its office-bearers will be shared with the media,” Faruqi said, adding it was undecided whether the new mosque will be named after Babri Masjid . “These decisions will be taken after the formation of the trust,” he said.

Faruqi said the Board was satisfied with the plot of land allocated to it since there is a sizeable population of Muslims in the area. “This will ensure the mosque’s safety and no further disputes arise. The size of the mosque will be decided according to the local requirement,” he added.

Faruqi had earlier told TOI that Babri Masjid was built on just a third of an acre (0.307 acres to be precise).

Two of the eight members of the Board — advocates Imran Mabood Khan of Allahabad and Abdul Razzaq Khan of Lucknow — did not attend the meeting.

While Imran has not attended a single Board meeting in the last eight years because of differences with Faruqi, Razzaq was the lone dissenting voice in the last Board meeting, held on November 26, when it was decided to follow the SC verdict. Razzaq had then protested against the Board’s decision not to file a review petition after the SC verdict.

Besides Faruqi, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Junaid Siddiqui , Adnan Farrukh Shah, Mohammad Juneed and Maulana Syed Ahmed Ali alias Khushnood Miyan attended the Board’s meeting on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Giving an indication of a joint space programme with India in coming years, US President Donald Trump , during his speech at the world’s largest stadium Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, said the “US and India will be friends and partners on a voyage to stars and space”. He also hailed Indian Space Research Organisation’s Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission.

The US president said, “America is looking forward to expanding space exploration with India as you (India) are pushing the limits, including in the realms of human spaceflight (Gaganyaan). That is a great thing.” Hailing Chandrayaan-2 mission, Trump said, “You are making exciting progress on your Chandrayaan lunar programme. It is moving along rapidly far ahead of schedule. It is truly extraordinary what this nation has achieved... under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi .”

According to US space experts, data and images of Moon’s south pole region from Chandrayaan’s orbiter will help US space agency Nasa plan its 2024 Armetius manned mission to the unexplored territory of Moon much effectively. Isro chairman K Sivan had told TOI that data from the orbiter will be shared with Nasa.

In fact, Nasa had sent its payload laser reflector array on board Vikram lander that was meant to track the lander’s location on Moon and calculate the exact distance between the Earth and Moon. Unfortunately, the payload got damaged when the lander crashlanded. Soon after the lander setback last year, Nasa had offered India to launch a joint exploration of the solar system, tweeting, “We commend ISRO’s attempt to land their Chandrayaan2 mission on the Moon’s South Pole. You have inspired us with your journey and look forward to future opportunities to explore our solar system together.”

Former Nasa administrator Major General (retd) Charles Frank Bolden Jr recently told TOI, “Isro in collaboration with Nasa can send a team of Indian astronauts to International Space Station (ISS) where the Indian team can perform various space experiments.”

Currently, Isro and Nasa are working together on a highly advanced Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite mission. The satellite, due to be launched in 2022, will be useful for various applications like assessing soil moisture, flood monitoring, coastal erosion and changes in ice sheet.

25,['25/02/2020'],Lawyers of J&amp;K students charged with sedition in K’taka attacked,"This story is from February 25, 2020

HUBBALLI/DHARWAD: Two Bengaluru advocates, representing the three Kashmiri engineering students charged with sedition for raising pro-Pakistan and azadi slogans, were heckled and their car was attacked inside the premises of a Dharwad court where they had gone to move bail applications on Monday.

The principal district and sessions judge in Dharwad refused to admit the bail applications citing a procedural lapse that was highlighted by members of the Dharwad Bar Association . Judge Eshappa Bhute asked advocates Maitri and Narendra to file the applications afresh with necessary documents.

The advocates left the court premises to an undisclosed destination amid tight police security.

The advocates offered to appear for the three KLE Institute of Technology students after they were arrested on February 14 on charges of sedition for raising ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans. Within days, the Dharwad Bar Association passed a resolution ruling out legal help to “anti-national elements”.

The advocates reached the Dharwad district court complex amid tight police security provided on the high court’s directive. As a precautionary measure, police did not allow any advocate to enter the court hall. This provoked advocates to raise slogans against the police and accused them of meting out VIP treatment to those representing the anti-nationals. The members of the Bar shouted slogans against the advocates and tried to block their entry into the court hall.

When the car ferrying advocates was about to leave the court premises, miscreants hurled stones on the vehicle and damaged its window. More than 300 police personnel deployed at the court swung into action and controlled the situation.

Advocates Sanjeev Badskar and Ashok Anvekar said any legal representation to those facing sedition charges will embolden others to raise slogans against the country.

26,['25/02/2020'],"For case under SC/ST Act, offence must be in public: Allahabad HC","This story is from February 25, 2020

Representational photo.

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Monday set aside an order of summoning under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, saying that for constituting an offence under this act, public view is mandatory.

If the offence has allegedly been committed behind closed doors - where no witness is present - the SC/ST Act cannot be applied, said Justice RK Gautam while quoting a Supreme Court ruling and disposing a petition filed by a Sonbhadra resident against the order of Duddhi judicial magistrate in Sonbhadra.

Petitioner KP Thakur was probe officer in a departmental inquiry against one Vinod Kumar Tanay . According to the petition, Thakur had called Tanay to his chamber for recording of evidence on the day of incidence. The latter had brought a colleague MP Tiwari along with him. Thakur asked Tiwari to go out of his chamber as it would have hindered the process of recording, the petition says.

Following this, Tanay moved a petition before the judicial magistrate against Thakur under SC/ST Act and other sections of Indian Penal Code . After the court summoned Thakur, he challenged the order in high court.

While partly allowing the petition filed by Thakur, the court observed: “The door was locked form inside. It was a chamber of the enquiry officer (Thakur), where presenting officer (Tanay) and enquiry officer were present and it can never be said to be a public view. Even if any occurrence took place at that place, it may never be said to be a public view and it has been verified by the apex court. Hence, the very ingredient of offence punishable under Section 3(1)(X) of the SC/ST Act was missing”.

The court quashed the summoning for offence punishable under the SC/ST Act. However, the judge made it clear that for rest of the offences, no relief was given to the petitioner.

The case was sent back to the Duddhi judicial magistrate to be tried under Sections 323 (simple hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code.

28,['25/02/2020'],Bhima panel to summon Sharad Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis?,"This story is from February 25, 2020

MUMBAI: The Koregaon Bhima inquiry commission has decided to summon NCP chief Sharad Pawar and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for examination as witnesses in the caste violence case.

However, the state recently gave an extension to the commission until April 8, 2020 and made it clear this would be the ‘final’ extension. Given the number of cross-examinations already pending (nearly 50), it is unlikely Pawar could be examined as witness by April 8.

On Monday, the cross-examination of IPS officer Lakhmi Gautam was completed. The commission has planned the next hearing of eyewitnesses in Pune in March. During Gautam’s cross- examination, advocate Pradip Gavade referred to the application he has submitted before the commission on behalf of a Pune resident, Sagar Shinde, demanding that Sharad Pawar be summoned for examination.

In his application to the commission, Gavade stated that Pawar had, in a recent press conference (February 18, 2020), alleged that right-wing activists Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide had created a certain atmosphere at Koregaon Bhima and its vicinity in the backdrop of the violence. “Pawar also alleged that the role played by the Pune police was doubtful and must be investigated,” according to the application.

It further stated that the NCP chief’s statement is within the purview of the terms of reference of the commission and therefore relevant. “Pawar has certain relevant and additional information relating to the violence in Koregaon Bhima. Therefore, in the interests of justice, the applicant prays to the commission to issue summons to Pawar and require him to depose before the commission in person,” the application stated.

JN Patel, the head of the two-member commission, said that Pawar would be summoned for examination as he has already submitted an affidavit in the matter. Patel also mentioned that among heads of political parties, the NCP chief is the only one who has responded to the commission.

“Not only Pawar but former CM Devendra Fadnavis too and, if required, other political leaders will summoned by the commission,” Ashish Satpute, advocate for the commission, told TOI.

Pointing out that the tenure of the commission is only up to April 8, Satpute said, “It is difficult to complete the process of examining political leaders (by April 8) as many cross-examinations are pending. Pawar may be examined only if the state gives further extension to the commission, but the commission will not be seeking an extension. It is the responsibility of the government to give ample time to the commission to give justice to the case.”

The event to mark the 200th anniversary of the Koregaon Bhima battle in Pune district was marred by violence on January 1, 2018. During the violence, one person from the Maratha community was killed.

RANCHI: The BJP’s state unit on Monday unanimously elected former chief minister Babulal Marandi as its legislative party leader at a meeting convened in the presence of BJP’s central observer Muralidhar Rao , less than a week after Babulal merged his party, JVM-P, with the BJP.

With this, Marandi, MLA from Dhanwar, will now become the leader of opposition in the state assembly. “I thank the party for the responsibility and warmth accorded to me,” Marandi said after his election.

Arun Singh, BJP national general secretary, said soon after the meeting: “Rajmahal MLA Anant Ojha moved a proposal to appoint Marandi for the post and the proposal was backed by all our 25 MLAs through a voice vote as well as a written undertaking. As per protocol, the party will formally apprise the assembly speaker about the appointment.”

Singh added that given his experience, Marandi fits the role of the leader of opposition and would rejuvenate the BJP by taking on the Mahagathbandhan government, the JMM-led coalition which includes the Congress and the RJD.

“He (Babulal) has years of political and administrative experience. The entire party leadership acknowledges his capabilities,” Singh said.

BJP hopes Marandi, one of the tallest tribal leaders in the state, will counter the Mahagathbandhan government during the month-long budget session scheduled to begin on February 28.

Two former chief ministers — Raghubar Das and Arjun Munda (now Union minister for tribal affairs) — congratulated Marandi. Das said, “Marandi’s return to BJP and taking on the mantle of the leader of opposition will go a long way in reviving the party in the state. He has always been vocal on public issues.”

Arjun Munda later met Marandi at the party office and presented a bouquet to him.

Chief minister Hemant Soren also congratulated Marandi on his appointment as leader of opposition. In a tweet, he said, “Babulal ji, I congratulate you on your appointment as leader of opposition in Jharkhand assembly. I have full faith that under your leadership, the opposition will play a meaningful and constructive role.”

Om Mathur, BJP national vice-president, who played a crucial role in convincing Marandi to return to the saffron fold, said Marandi’s appointment was the correct decision taken at the right time by all stakeholders.

“Even though he left the party in 2006, his politics revolved around BJP’s ideology. We may have lost the election last year, but we won over a dedicated party worker who will help strengthen the party and bring it back into focus,” Mathur said.

NEW DELHI: NGO ‘Association for Democratic Reforms’ through advocate Prashant Bhushan told the Supreme Court on Monday that RTI responses had revealed the Commission had destroyed all Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips of the 2019 general elections even though the rules said they had to be retained for a year.

The NGO and Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra have filed petitions seeking publication of various forms that inform the candidate about the number of votes polled, rejected, NOTA and how many the candidate got. The SC had issued notice to the EC on December 7.

Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant , Bhushan said the Conduct of Election Rules mandated that VVPAT slips collected from EVMs should be retained for a year unless the EC decides otherwise. “Why should the EC decide otherwise for destruction of VVPAT slips when there is so many instances of mismatch between EVM vote count and VVPAT slip counts?” he asked.

Appearing for the EC, advocate Amit Sharma said Bhushan was arguing an issue which did not find mention in the pending petitions. When Bhushan said he would file a supplementary application raising this issue before the court, the bench said, “As of now, the issue is not before the court, so reserve your arguments till the time the issue comes before the court.”

Sharma said the EC would file a comprehensive response to both the petitions and the bench adjourned hearing for four weeks.

LUCKNOW: The menace of stray cattle in Uttar Pradesh took political overtones on Monday when state parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna said that the people living across the borders in Congress-governed MP and Rajasthan were releasing their herds into the state.

""The entry of stray cattle from MP and Rajasthan should be looked into,"" he said, while responding to a query raised in the UP assembly by Congress MLA and UP party state chief Ajay Kumar Lallu who sought to ask what steps the state government was taking to curtail the menace which is damaging crops of farmers.

""The farmers have been left with no option but to guard their fields. There have been a number of instances where in stray cattle entered the fields of farmers and damaged their crops,"" he said.

Khanna said that the state government was taking various steps including setting up of cattle shelter homes. ""We also need to consider the fact where these stray cattle are coming from. They are being left on the borders of MP and Rajasthan from where they enter into UP,"" he said.

His response led to a fracas in the assembly with Congress slamming the state government of making its failure a political issue. Leader of opposition and SP MLA Ram Govind Chaudhary said that the menace of stray cattle has only grown after Yogi government came to power. To this, animal husbandry ministry Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary said that during the previous SP regime the bovine were subjected to illegal slaughtering. ""All that has now stopped,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of tribal affairs on Monday held a review meet with states to establish the number of land ownership claims under the Forest Rights Act 2006 that have been so far rejected, accepted and those that are pending. The ministry plans to compile the data and accordingly issue directions to states.

The ministry is of the view that if and when the matter comes up in Supreme Court where the case has been going on, the Centre wants the states to be ready with their updates.

TOI had reported in August last year that in a big relief to lakhs of tribals and traditional forest dwellers who are facing eviction from forest land after state governments rejected their claims, several states have now admitted before the Supreme Court their fault in passing adverse orders against them and decided to review their decision.

The apex court had on February 13, 2019 asked states and Union Territories to implement their own orders rejecting 11.8 lakh claims over forest land by scheduled tribes and OTFDs and pass eviction orders to free lakhs of hectares of forest land. This order created a stir across the tribal belts as fears of large-scale evictions were raised.

But the court subsequently stayed the eviction order after doubts were raised on the legality of procedures adopted by the state authorities to reject the claims.

The court had directed the states to file a comprehensive report on how the claims were decided.

MUMBAI: The government presented supplementary demands of Rs 24,723 crore in the legislature on Monday, earmarking the largest chunk, Rs 15,000 crore, for the crop loan waiver scheme. Supplementary demands are additional expenditures that are not part of the main budget. The amount presented by the MVA government is one of the highest in recent years and will further widen the state’s fiscal deficit, which, according to the finance department’s estimates, will be over Rs 90,000 crore by the end of the current financial year.

Of the total supplementary demands, Rs 18,719 crore will be spent towards planned works and the rest towards committed works. Monday saw the release of the first list of crop loan waiver beneficiaries under the scheme: the list contains 15,358 eligible farmers from 68 villages across the state; disbursals will be made to their loan accounts within two days. “This is a trial list. We took a small number to test the procedure set up for the scheme. If the process proves to be smooth, the second list which will be released on February 28. It will be a much longer list,” said revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat (Congress).

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena), on video conference, asked at least two beneficiaries per district if they faced issues availing of the scheme. Officials said information on 34.8 lakh farmers’ accounts has been obtained by the state and details of another 1.61 lakh accounts is expected. Under the scheme — officially called Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Shetkari Karjmukti Yojana — which was announced by the MVA government in December 2019, crop loans of up to Rs 2 lakh outstanding till September 30, 2019, will be waived off. The scheme was Thackeray’s pet poll plank and is his government’s biggest welfare scheme yet.

Of the Rs 15,000 crore the government has budgeted as part of supplementary demands, Rs 10,000 crore will be used to recoup an advance drawn from the contingency fund for the scheme. The government had taken a decision to dip into the contingency fund to be able to pay for the scheme. The remaining Rs 5,000 crore has been budgeted to be used under the scheme till the next budget comes into effect from April 1 onwards.

Apart from loan waiver, Rs 16.2 crore will be spent on welfare schemes for the next of kin of farmers who committed suicide, Rs 3,523 crore has been earmarked for the revenue and forests department, and an equal amount for projects under the public works department.

Also, Rs 6.5 crore will go towards the Shiv Bhojan scheme, which is aimed at providing a meal to the poor for just Rs 10. For the urban development department, Rs 679 crore has been budgeted, including Rs 103 crore for the Pune Metro.

Farmers who had obtained loans of over Rs 50,000 and those whose loans exceed Rs 1 lakh are likely to get waiver in three to four instalments. The government’s decision to waive off loans of small and marginal famers in instalments had drawn a lot of criticism last year.

The government allocated Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal for the crop loan waiver scheme but did not release any money for crop loan waiver till now.

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Monday directed the UP DGP to identify and take action against the policemen who were involved in stray cases of damaging motorcycles and unnecessarily caning the apprehended students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest in last December.

Passing the order on the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Samit Gopal directed the state police chief to adhere to the report of the rights body. Last month, the high court had asked the NHRC to probe the allegations levelled in a PIL filed by Mohammad Akram Khan .

After the probe, the NHRC recommended that a suitable action might be taken against identified cops as per rules that exist for subordinate officers in UP Police . “The police force should be sensitised and special training modules be carried out to inculcate professionalism in handling such situations,” it added.

Hearing the PIL, the HC took the NHRC report on record and directed the UP chief secretary, the DGP, the CRPF, the vice-chancellor and registrar of AMU to adhere to its recommendations, including payment of compensation to injured AMU students. The court has sought a compliance report on March 25.

Earlier on January 8, the HC had directed the NHRC to probe the allegations levelled in the PIL by Mohammad Akram Khan, who accused cops of unleashing brutality upon students. The petition was filed requesting the court to pass several directions, including setting up of a ‘court monitored committee’ to have a judicial inquiry into acts of violence and arbitrary detention of students by the state police and para-military forces at AMU from December 12 to December 15.

Following the court’s direction, a six-member team of NHRC enquired into the matter and submitted its report before the court.

The report also recommended that the court may direct the AMU V-C, registrar and other authorities to establish a mechanism for better communication with students so that they are not influenced by outsiders.

HYDERABAD: Bikers wearing helmets with the message ‘turn off engines at traffic signals’ and ‘donate blood and be a hero’ can be spotted on city roads. A group of about 20 techies, part of two teams, have hit on a novel idea to spread awareness on these issues. They have printed the messages on their bikes or helmets, urging other commuters to make small changes that could have a massive impact.‘Team Suri’ named in memory of a college student Surender who passed away in 2017 has been active across the city. “We started the campaign to save fuel about two weeks ago. We want people to understand that if everyone switches off their vehicles at traffic signals, it will save a lot of fuel as well as decrease pollution levels,” said Akhil Velagandula, who works for an IT firm in Hi-Tec City.Sharath Kumar Mariyala, another volunteer, said, “Initially I felt some discomfort at having to turn off the engine every single time, but then I soon got habituated to this.” He said what would help in the endeavour is if timers are kept at most signals. “This would help motorists know how much time they spend at the signal and help them turn the key off during extended waiting time.”This team was inspired by another group called ‘Team Asraya’, which not only came up with the idea of saving non-renewable resources, but also has been raising awareness on blood donation . Members of ‘Team Asraya’ drive around the city with their blood group printed on their vehicles. “Once while driving, a motorist stopped and asked me what the purpose of the campaign was. We exchanged details, and when someone was in need of blood, he stepped up and donated,” said Kedarnath Gujjulwar, a team member. Incidentally, ‘Asraya’ in Sanskrit means ‘providing shelter’.Both the teams now plan to work together to promote carpooling. Shiva Reddy, a volunteer, said: “In the west of the city, we see several commuters heading to work alone in their four-wheelers. We want to urge them to take to carpooling which will significantly cut pollution levels and traffic.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74293832,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-techies-team-up-flaunt-helmets-with-messages-on-fuel-saving-blood-donation/articleshow/74291192.cms

SURAT: Police investigation into the incident of firing at a jewellery showroom at Mini Bazaar area of Varachha revealed on Monday that shooter Vijay Karpada was given the contract by Lawrence Bishnoi to threaten the jeweller. Police are yet to confirm if the firing was an extortion attempt or a plan to threaten the jeweller over some dispute.

Vijay Karpada, nabbed from the spot by staffers of Amar Jewellers on Sunday, was arrested on Monday and will be produced by police in court on Tuesday. Karpada had come to the spot on a scooter with two other persons who, however, managed to escape from the spot. Karpada had earlier claimed that Dinesh Shukla and Mayursinh Jadeja were with him but during detailed questioning, he named Kapil alias Bavo and Mahendra alias Mando as the two persons who had accompanied him to the showroom.

Police have recovered the scooter which was abandoned by the accused from Swarg Residency in Kholwad near Kamrej. All the three accused had been staying at Shubham Society in Kholwad for the past few days. Police investigation revealed that the scooter belonged to a person named Lalbhai and was registered at Rajkot RTO.

Karpada informed police that he was put in touch with Bishnoi, a history-sheeter from Rajasthan, by Shukla and Jadeja, with whom he had escaped from Limbdi sub-jail on January 12. Bishnoi had offered the contract to Karpada to carry out firing in the showroom, police said.

The accused claims he was asked to fire in the air to threaten Nitesh Vavaiya, owner of Amar Jewellers. However, police are not convinced since Karpada had fired at Vavaiya. But the bullets hit Sanjay Patel, an employee of the showroom. Patel suffered two bullet injuries.

""The accused is not revealing the exact reason behind his opening fire in the showroom. We cannot reveal the details of investigation now due to sensitivity of the case,"" a police officer said.

Addressing a joint session of the state legislature in the central hall, the governor said, “Providing a fearless society to the people by establishing rule of law is the top priority of the government.

Varanasi: Kashi Vishwanath temple has offered it’s 40 bigha (10 hectare) land in Mirzapur district to Tata Memorial Centre for establishing an international standard hospice for cancer patients in their final phase of the terminal illness as well as a research centre for incorporating Ayurveda in cancer treatment.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) regarding the same was signed by divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal and TMC director Dr Rajendra A Badwe on Sunday night.

Giving details about the two projects, Badwe told TOI, “We have a hospice in Mumbai where family members of the patients in their final phase of terminal illness are imparted two-week training to take care of the patients focusing on their comfort and quality of life. As palliative care provides support to patients in reducing their sufferings, we had been planning an international standard hospice in Varanasi after opening of Mahamana Pt Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre (MPMMMCC) and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH) here.”

Regarding incorporating ayurveda in cancer treatment, Badwe said, “Ayurveda has medicines to support in cancer treatment but they have not been tested. We have decided to study ancient Indian medications as patients often ask about adopting or supplementing their modern medicines with ancient Indian medicines. Thus a need of establishing a research centre to explore the possibility of including ayurveda in cancer treatment was felt.”

A team of TMC was recently in Varanasi to search land for these projects, said Agrawal. “As finding land for these projects was difficult in the limits of Varanasi, the TMC was offered KVT ’s 40 bigha land available at two different areas in Kakrahi village of Jamalpur area in Mirzapur district, for the hospice and research centre. The village is just 30 km away from the city. The TMC officials, after visiting the site, agreed to accept the offer.”

It was decided to sign a MoU between KVT and TMC, said Agrawal, adding that, “Now, KVT and TMC will table this proposal before their boards for final approval after which further conditions and provisions will be finalised. We are of the view that Sri Kashi Vishwanath should remain as prefix in the names of the proposed hospice and cancer research centre.”

“It will be over 80-bed hospice where apart from providing training to relatives of patients for their care at home, facility of staying till last breath if wished by any patient, will also be available, said Badwe.

46,['25/02/2020'],Shopkeepers oppose AMC’s parking and hawkers policies,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Aurangabad: The newly-announced parking and hawker zone policies of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) have been opposed by the shopkeepers from markets like Paithan Gate, Tilak Path and Gulmandi.

According to the shop owners, the new policies will have a negative impact on their business. On Monday, a delegation of shopkeepers met mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad, asking them to roll back the policies.

The Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh and Paithan Gate-Tilak Path Vyapari Association have also submitted different memorandums of their demands. They stated that for the past 10 years, the hawkers and street vendors have been conducting business on spaces in front of their shops in the market areas of the Old City that is affecting their business.

“We have been making requests to the commissioner of police to free the market space from the hawkers as it obstructs the customers from visiting their shops. Due to this inconvenience, people are not willing to visit the markets and it eventually affects our business,” a memorandum submitted by Paithan Gate-Tilak Path Vyapari Association said.

Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh president Jagannath Kale said the AMC has recently decided to charge a fee from the hawkers and give them licenses to run their business on the road in front of their shops.

“We object to this move and demand that until space is provided to the hawkers, the AMC should not collect fee from them otherwise the businessmen will suffer heavy losses,” he said.

Yusuf Mukati, secretary of Paithan Gate-Tilak Path Vyapari Association, said that allowing vehicles to park on the road will also affect their businesses. “Separate parking should be provided before implementation of the policy,” he said.

Ghodele said a committee, comprising AMC officials, traffic police officers and representatives of businessmen, will carry out feasibility survey of both the policies and will submit a report in eight days. “The policies will not be implemented until the report is received,” he said.

47,['25/02/2020'],20-mark projects to help ’22 ISC students score higher,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Kolkata: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), in keeping with the pattern followed in the majority of the subjects at the ISC level, has decided to introduce a 20-mark project in Indian languages, English and mathematics from the 2021-2022 academic session. The theory examinations will, hence, carry 80 marks.

The change will be applicable for students promoted to Class XI this year. Internal tests, project viva or internal evaluation — ranging between 20 and 30 marks — is taken by ISC candidates in several other subjects, including physics, chemistry, biology, history and geography. “Now there will be parity among all subjects,” said a principal of a city school.

A teacher pointed out that there have always been grievances among students regarding the method of scoring in Plus-II. “The students felt that in the absence of internal marking, English, other Indian language subjects and mathematics became more difficult to score marks in. With the introduction of the 20-mark internal evaluation, it will be convenient for students to secure higher scores in these subjects too,” the teacher added.

Some educationists pointed out that introduction of projects was aimed at giving students an edge during the Board examinations.

“Many CISCE students felt they were at a disadvantage since there was less scope to score high. This problem will now be addressed. The projects will also give students an edge since the projects will expand a students domain of understanding the subject. Most boards already have such a system for mathematics,” the teacher said.

For mathematics, students may be asked to derive a solution based on Theorems while in English language, they may be asked to write essays. For English literature, student may be asked to sketch a character they have come across in their text books. “Apart from getting an opportunity to score more marks, the projects will test the students’ knowledge,” a teacher said.

Starting this year, the CISCE circular added, for subjects with more than one paper, ICSE candidates will be able to apply for a recheck of their individual papers instead of the subjects as a whole. Thus, for science, candidates will have the option of applying for a recheck of their individual physics, chemistry or biology papers.

Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: Several ATMs in the country continue to run on Windows 7 , even though Microsoft ended support for its decade-old operating system in January.

According to industry sources, many banks have not yet discussed an upgrade with their management service providers although an RBI circular in June 2018 mandated using supported versions of operating systems in ATMs. Given that the Indian banking industry has deployed over 2 lakh ATMs, the cost of an upgrade is expected to run into hundreds of crores.

“Support to Microsoft Win 7 is not available from January 14, 2020. Hence, it is important that all existing terminals running on Windows 7 are upgraded to Windows 10 . Alternatively, Microsoft has offered extended security updates for terminals currently running on Windows 7. However, in a case where neither of these options are availed for any terminal, the latest OS security patches will not be available for those terminals, thereby exposing them to higher security risks,” said a spokesperson for AGS Transact Technologies, which manages ATMs on behalf of banks.

“Banks would have saved a lot of money had they moved to Linux , which is preferred by Indian manufacturers over Windows. This would have also encouraged Indian manufacturing of ATMs,” said Mani Mamallan, founder of Electronic Payments and Services, which manages ATM networks on behalf of several banks.

Bankers point out that most ATMs are simple electro-mechanical devices and do not really need a high-end operating system as most functions are basic. Among other things, Windows is used in ATMs for its graphics capability. Even in cases of upgrade to Windows XP, banks continued to run the older operating system on their machines till 2019 although support had ended in 2014.

Apart from RBI regulations, the payment card industry’s data security standards (PCI-DSS) requires that operating systems should receive security patches regularly.

Mumbai: State Bank of India ( SBI ) chairman Rajnish Kumar indicated that efforts are on to ensure survival of telecom sector, stating “nobody wants to kill the sector”.

Speaking to newspersons on Monday, Kumar said the bank has not heard from the government on the issue of adjusted gross revenue ( AGR ) dues of telecom companies. The firms owe the government Rs 1.47 lakh crore by way of outstanding licence fees and spectrum charges.

State Bank of India has a loan outstanding of Rs 29,000 crore from the telecom sector and another Rs 14,000 crore in bank guarantees, which can get invoked in case of a non-payment of dues by the telcos.

The Supreme Court has set a deadline of March 17 for telcos to repay their dues. Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman, Aditya Birla Group , promoters of Vodafone Idea, had indicated the company may have to close shop if forced to pay all the claimed dues.

“Nobody wants to kill the sector, let me be very clear,” Kumar said, when asked about the problems being faced by the telecom industry.

51,['25/02/2020'],Facebook eyes minority stakes in Indian startups,"This story is from February 25, 2020

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Facebook is looking to back more startups as a minority investor in India, participating with traditional venture capital and private equity investors. The move is a first for the social media major, which typically invests for majority control or acquires 100% stake in other startups in the US and other markets.

“Facebook does not do minority investments anywhere in the world. This is an extremely unique Indian programme, where we are making consistent minority investments. The idea is to accelerate this even more,” said Facebook India VP & MD Ajit Mohan. He told TOI that the Menlo Park-based company, with a market capitalisation of $600 billion, will increase its pace of investments in new-age companies here.

India is the largest market in terms of customers for Facebook, which has about 260 million users as of January based on data from Statista . Messaging application WhatsApp , which is owned by Facebook, has 400 million monthly active users.

According to Mohan, Facebook does not have any constraint on the size of investments. But underlying themes would be startups that are uniquely Indian, focused on inclusion, and delivery of internet’s benefits beyond the large cities. This comes after Facebook invested in education technology startup Unacademy, along with General Atlantic, in a $110-million round last week. It had also backed social commerce startup Meesho in June last year, along with Naspers (now known as Prosus). But its first deal in India was in 2014 when it acquired Hyderabad-based performance analytics startup Little Eye Labs.

According to people aware of the matter, Facebook, for now, will largely be writing $20-25 million cheques for startups. It will focus on growth-stage startups while remaining sector-agnostic. Facebook did not comment on the investment size. Typically, these startups rely on Facebook or its group companies — WhatsApp and Instagram — for multiple aspects like building a network, advertising and marketing.

Mohan highlighted how both Meesho and Unacademy see large parts of their users being from tier-2 and -3 markets. In terms of engaging with early-stage startups, Facebook also runs its venture capital brand incubator programme where it has tied up venture capital funds like Fireside Ventures and SAIF Partners.

Mohan said he is working with many new-age ventures as part of his day-to-day mandate as many of them “disproportionately gravitate towards Facebook platforms” for various needs. On top of that, he is working along with the corporate development team, which specialises on the minority investments of Facebook in India. He did not share the details of this team.

While large Chinese internet companies like Tencent and Alibaba have emerged as active investors in multiple unicorns (worth $1-billion and more) in India, US technology majors like Google and Facebook have not been as active as investors in startups. Investors tracking the space said Facebook taking a more collaborative approach will help them partner with more startups.

“In general, good things happen to companies that have good customer engagement and are creating real value. Facebook’s entry as a minority investor is a good one since it is not looking to run these companies and founders will also be more open to having them as an investor as this is non-threatening to them,” said Prime Venture Partners managing partner Sanjay Swamy.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das (File photo)

MUMBAI: New laws for resolving troubled financial institutions is on the anvil. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank will have an integrated framework for resolution of finance firms. Das also said the banking regulator will soon issue guidelines on corporate governance in banks.

According to Das, a new framework is on the works although the government has notified section 227 under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ), which provides for bankruptcy proceedings to be initiated against non-banking finance companies. One of the key issues in resolving troubled financial sector companies is that there are many retail creditors.

The government had earlier introduced the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, but had withdrawn it in 2018 after concerns over the ‘bail-in’ clause. The clause provided for retail depositors sacrificing their dues to get a lender back on track. According to reports, after hiking the deposit insurance cover to Rs 5 lakh, the centre is working on the FRDI Bill again.

“On the resolution front, some progress has been made in terms of the notification issued by the central government under section 227 of the IBC. We may, however, expect to have an integrated framework for resolution of financial firms operating in India in the near future. The implementation of this reform is of particular importance for having a resilient financial system in India,” Das said. He was speaking at Mint’s annual banking conclave in Mumbai.

Reiterating that the RBI would issue draft guidelines for corporate governance in banks, Das said the strength of a banking system depended on that of corporate governance. He pointed out that the RBI has already issued several instructions on corporate governance. These include norms for compensation of senior executives, rules for internal control systems to identify emerging risks and revised rules for conducting a concurrent audit.

CCI is investigating if MakeMyTrip abused its dominant position in online hotel booking in India for predatory pricing and high commissions.

The existing probe has been ongoing since October based on a complaint filed by the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI). Treebo has alleged that MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in its market with 63% share and its “vertical integration” with Oyo creates “significant barriers of entry given the network effects”. The complaint says Oyo controls 89% of the budget and franchised hotels space.

Calls and messages to Treebo’s co-founder Sidharth Gupta did not elicit a response till the time of going to the press. MakeMyTrip said it is reviewing the “prima facie” order passed, which does not have any final or binding observations. “We are confident of demonstrating compliance with the principles of competition law, while providing our partners and consumers the best-in-class services,” a MakeMyTrip spokesperson said.

The issue started in February 2017 for an investment by MakeMyTrip that would involve Treebo listing its hotel exclusively on the OTA. As part of the negotiations, top MakeMyTrip executives, including then India CEO (now global CEO) Rajesh Magow, turned into “a threat” that Treebo would be removed from the platform, the complaint alleges. The talks then fell through and Treebo was delisted from MakeMyTrip in March 2017, but decided to list back in six months by entering an “exclusivity agreement” as it “incurred excessive losses”.

After relisting on MakeMyTrip, Treebo has faced restrictions on listing properties on other platforms like Paytm and Booking at a lower price as part of the “exclusivity arrangement”. Another issue is that Treebo was not allowed to list properties on Paytm and Booking for three days before check-in in 29 cities, including Bengaluru and Mumbai, and for 30 days in another 25 cities, which includes Delhi and Goa. Treebo said it had “no option but to accept the conditions” in the exclusivity arrangement.

The move effectively gave control to MakeMyTrip over Treebo’s inventory, according to people familiar with the investigation. “65-70% of the business in the budget hotel chains happens three days before the check-in date,” an industry executive told TOI.

Other players in the budget hotel space are also joining the CCI investigation as potential witnesses. In an order earlier in the month, the commission said it is satisfied that Fab Hotels has a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings and that it is necessary to allow it to present its opinion in this matter for a meaningful investigation.

Fab Hotels ($50 million in total funding) and Treebo ($57 million in total funding) competed with Oyo, which has been backed by Japanese investment giant SoftBank and has raised over $3 billion in funding.

“We have the utmost faith in our administrative and judicial processes. We will continue to engage with honourable CCI. We are also thankful for the CCI’s recognition of the fact that Oyo is a hotel chain and for dismissing certain prima facie allegations against the company. We have nothing more to share at the moment,” an Oyo spokesperson said.

RAJKOT: The Rajkot Urban Development Authority (RUDA) has finalized the town planning (TP) scheme for posh Ghanteshwar and Parapipariya areas that are set to be merged in the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), paving way for more development projects in the area. A notification regarding merger has already been issued by the state government.

Parapipariya is where the new All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is coming up.

RUDA has also proposed a new 10-12 storey building for itself as the current one had become old and lacked enough space. The building has been proposed in Mota Mauva area at the coast of Rs 25 crore.

The proposed TP scheme for Ghanteshwar and Parapipariya is likely to come up for discussion along with the new building proposal, on February 27. It has been proposed to convert the TP for Ghanteshwar and Parapipariya into a preliminary scheme from draft.

The draft TP was sent into the state government in 2018 for approval but it was sent back in December last year. The RUDA has to give it’s final opinion on the TP scheme. According to RUDA officials, after draft TP gets converted into the preliminary scheme, they can reserve the plots for various purposes like school, garden and other housing and development works.

With regard to the new building, chief executive officer of RUDA, Chetan Ganatra, said, “We will propose to appoint an architect to give us an estimate for the new building during the board meeting.”

“The current building is 22-years-old and it’s very congested. As the work load has increased, we are recruiting more staff. But we need more space for that,” he added.

Chirag Paswan

PATNA: LJP chief and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Monday wrote a letter to CM Nitish Kumar and demanded a CBI probe into the alleged paper leak in the police sub-inspector recruitment examination conducted by Bihar Police Subordinate Selection Commission (BPSSC) in December last year.

Around 5.86 lakh candidates appeared for the preliminary test (PT) for altogether 2,446 posts of sub-inspector, sergeant and assistant superintendent jail, held at around 495 examination centres across the state on December 22 last year. The PT results were published on January 28 this year.

“During my recent visit to different places in the state, I was informed by the aspirants that the question papers were leaked before the examination. Applicants had also held protests on December 26 and 30 last year,” Paswan has said in his letter.

“The aspirants went to the BPSSC office on January 7 and submitted certain proof of the paper leak to the officer on special duty (OSD) at the commission. The OSD assured the aspirants that an inquiry would be conducted on their complaint and they would be invited during the probe. But without conducting a proper investigation, the PT results were announced. Because of this, applicants called for a ‘Bihar Bandh’ and held demonstrations on February 4, 13 and 20 this year demanding a CBI investigation. The police resorted to lathicharge and many applicants were injured. Some of the agitating aspirants were sent to jails,” Chirag has stated in his letter.

“I request you to look into the demand of the aspirants and take necessary step for a CBI probe into the matter. I also demand immediate release of the arrested aspirants,” Chirag said.

Earlier on Saturday, Chirag supported the agitating contractual teachers. He said the demands of niyojit (contractual) teachers of the government schools, who have been on an indefinite strike since February 17, would be included in his party’s manifesto for the upcoming assembly elections due later this year.

Around 4.5 lakh teachers of the government schools have been on strike with their eight-point charter of demands, which include ‘equal pay for equal work’.

58,['25/02/2020'],Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot asks Centre to increase its share for water projects to 90%,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has requested the union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to increase the Centre’s share from 50% to 90% in the Jal Shakti Mission project , considering Rajasthan ’s difficult climatic and topographical conditions.

In a letter to the union minister, the chief minister said, “Rajasthan has been included in the category of states like Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh where the Centre and states share 50:50 ratio for the project but the climatic condition of Rajasthan varies widely from these states. Rajasthan is the largest state and availability of water here is the lowest.”

Gehlot pointed out that about 85% of the state is now in the dark zone where underground water has gone down drastically.

The CM wrote that in desert areas, the villages are scattered and located in far flung areas due to which the drinking water projects are highly expensive compared to other states. Since the Union minister hails from the state, he is aware of the issue of water crisis and the ground situation in the state, he mentioned.

Gehlot said in 2013 under the national rural drinking water programme, the Centre was initially bearing 90% of the cost for the desert state but this was later reduced on a 60:40 ratio and now to 50:50.

The CM said in the 13 districts in eastern part of the state where water crisis is the worst, providing five litres of water per person is an impossible task without a river linking project. But that involves huge investment. He asked the Centre to assist the state liberally to execute such a project.

59,['25/02/2020'],PSC to act tough against coaching centres,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) will ask the state government and the police to initiate measures against those misusing the name of PSC to run ‘PSC coaching centres’. The decision was taken at a board meeting held on Monday in the wake of growing complaints against coaching centres run by senior government employees and their alleged nexus with PSC staff for leaking question papers.

The meeting chaired by chairman M K Sakeer also entrusted PSC’s regional and district officials to identify coaching centres across the state, which are misusing PSC’s name, and to recommend action. The chairman, on Sunday, had clarified that PSC had nothing to do with these private coaching centres, and the board’s decision would mean that these centres will no more be allowed to advertise or function as ‘PSC coaching centres’.

Meanwhile, vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB) questioned the two government secretariat employees against whom vigilance probe was ordered for running PSC coaching centres. The VACB on Sunday had raided two centres in Thampanoor — Lakshya and Veto — allegedly run by these employees working in the general administration department.

The raid was conducted after GAD principal secretary K R Jyothilal ordered a vigilance inquiry against the employees on a request by the PSC secretary who had received complaints against the duo from a group of PSC candidates. The vigilance team is also inquiring into the assets of the two employees against whom the allegations have been raised.

The employees are learned to have dismissed the allegations that they have any connection or influence over the PSC staff for leaking question papers. One of them produced documents to prove that he has the required permission from the government to publish guides for candidates appearing for PSC exams.

During Sunday’s raid, the VACB’s special unit 2 team led by DSP Prasad could gather preliminary evidence to prove the employees’ connection with the two coaching centres, besides catching red-handed a fire and rescue department person who was found giving lectures at one of the centres.

Mumbai: The sensex recorded its second-biggest fall this year on Monday in line with global markets as the coronavirus infection spread to Italy, Iran and South Korea. Risk-averse investors turned to gold, which hit a lifetime high of Rs 43,250 per 10gm in Mumbai (for 99.5 purity). The gold price for 99.9 purity was Rs 49,500.

The 30-share index fell 807 points, or nearly 2%, to close at 40,363. The fall in equities was led by stocks of automobiles, pharmaceuticals and consumer durables over fears of disruption of supplies from China, which accounts for 14% of India’s imports.

In the foreign currency markets, the rupee fell 34 paise to close at a more than three-month low of 72 against the dollar, as there was flight to safety.

In Europe, early trades saw Britain’s FTSE 100 fall nearly 3.5%, while the CAC 40 in Paris as well as Germany’s DAX lost almost 4%.

The Dow Jones was down nearly 3% after opening on Monday but slipped further by over 1,000 points (see graphic). South Korea’s Kospi fell 3.9% with 231 new cases of the virus being reported on Monday. Earlier in the day, Sydney’s ASX/200 lost 2.3% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.8%.

Auto companies, represented in the BSE auto index, were hit the most with the index declining 3.3% on fears of disruption of supplies from China. Tata Motors and Eicher Motors were down 5%, and so were Maruti Suzuki (4.2%), Hero MotoCorp (2.5%) and Mahindra & Mahindra (2.2%).

“Headline indices are down around 2% across all market cap categories, suggesting that the broad-based sell-off is largely in response to weakness in sentiment across the region and spilling over into European trading,” said Emkay Global Financial Services head (sales trading) S Hariharan.

“News around the spread of the coronavirus and its concomitant impact on trade and activity levels have been the strongest driver of daily moves in the last few sessions and would continue to be a major factor. The auto sector has been the worst hit over the last two weeks, driven primarily by concerns on supply chain disruptions,” he added.

Banks were hit hard over fears of fresh non-performing assets with the government digging in its heels over its demand for adjusted gross revenue dues from telecom companies. ICICI Bank was down 3% and Axis Bank 2.4%. “We believe new forms of stress are emerging (for banks). On the retail side, we have stress from agriculture and commercial vehicle space, and on the corporate side there is stress in real estate, telecom and small and medium enterprises/mid-corporate space,” said Macquarie Capital Securities research analyst (financials) Suresh Ganapathy.

Kolkata: The city woke up to a light drizzle on Monday under the impact of a cyclonic circulation. As the day progressed, the cloud cover receded and the drizzle stopped, but it brought the maximum temperature down by around three degrees to 27.1°C. The Met office predicted that it could remain overcast on Tuesday and the city could receive light to moderate showers during the day.

A cyclonic circulation — that has triggered rain — reached east Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on Monday. It is set to move towards north Bengal on Tuesday, leading to moderate rain across the districts of Malda, North and South Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Darjeeling. South Bengal, on the other hand, could receive light to moderate showers till Wednesday afternoon.

“Some parts of the city could receive steady drizzles on Tuesday, but heavy showers are unlikely. Since the circulation is moving towards north Bengal, the sub-Himalayan districts could receive moderate rain,” said G K Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.

The rain will provide temporary relief from the early summer heat that has started setting in. Last Thursday, the day temperature had soared past the 30-degree mark for the first time this season. With the cool northwesterly wind having stopped, the mercury will now rise steadily, the weathermen said.

62,['25/02/2020'],Cash growth slow since DeMo: RBI,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Mumbai: The RBI has said that if notes in circulation had grown at the same pace as pre-demonetisation levels, the currency in circulation would be Rs 3.7 lakh crore higher than it currently is.

The RBI said notes in circulation increased at an average rate of 14% between October 2014 and October 2016, in a report on the progress of digitisation of payments. “Assuming the same growth rate, notes in circulation would have been Rs 26 lakh crore in October 2019. However, it was Rs 22.3 lakh crore, indicating digitation and reduction in cash usage helped reduce notes in circulation,” the RBI said.

According to the report, retail digital payments have registered a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% since December 2015 to hit 325 crores in 2019. In value terms, the CAGR has been 30% during the same period.

However, the report notes that share of cash in the Indian economy continues to be high. “India continues to have a strong bias for cash payments. Demonetisation and active growth in GDP brought down the cash in circulation as a percentage of GDP to 8.7% in 2016-17. This increased to 10.7% in 2017-18 and 11.2% in 2018-19, which, however, is less than the pre-demonetisation level of 12.1% in 2015-16,” the report said. It added that the rate of increase is lower, indicating a perceptible shift away from cash.

The high dependence on cash is reflected on the cash withdrawals from ATMs, which have increased over five years. While India is next only to China in terms of the cash withdrawals from ATMs, the percentage of cash withdrawals to GDP has been constant in India at around 17%. Also, with a CAGR of 9% in terms of volume and 10% in terms of value, the growth has been slow when compared to digital payment transactions (which grew at a CAGR of 61% and 19% in terms of volume and value, respectively), indicating a shift towards digitisation, the report said. Further, ATMs have grown at a low pace (CAGR of 4%) in the past five years.

Representative Image

PATNA: Teachers of primary government and government-aided schools would hold protest march near the collectorates across the state on March 5 and submit the memorandum of their demands to the district magistrates concerned.

Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS) convener Brajnandan Sharma said on Monday that all primary schoolteachers would hold ‘Aakrosh’ march to collectorates in support of the contractual teachers’ demands of equal pay for equal work and old pension scheme among others. Sharma said the decision was taken at a meeting of primary schoolteachers’ associations in Bihar.

“On February 27, protesting teachers would hold dharna at block headquarters with their family members whereas on March 1, they would gherao the government bungalows of legislators to press for the revocation of the termination of regular and niyojit teachers,” Sharma, who is also the president of Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association, said.

Around 4.5 lakh teachers of 32 associations or organizations have been on indefinite strike since February 17 under the banner of BRSSSS. So far, two regular teachers — Manoj Kumar and Mohd Mustafa — in Patna have been terminated for not reporting to the examination centre for invigilation duty whereas over 250 niyojit teachers have been served show-cause notices for the same reason.

Meanwhile, around 40,000 teachers of secondary and higher secondary schools would also join the indefinite protest from February 25 by boycotting the evaluation duty of Intermediate examination, which is scheduled to begin the same day.

The high schoolteachers’ demands include service conditions for niyojit teachers, not to involve them in non-academic activities and remove the discrepancies of salary payment.

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: The representatives of Muslim religious bodies and social organizations on Monday urged chief minister Nitish Kumar to pass a resolution by the state legislature against National Population Register (NPR) in the present format and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) in Bihar.

The religious bodies and social organizations making such demands included Imarat Shariah, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulema, Khanqah Munimia and Loktantrik Jan Pehal. Their representatives said they will go against NPR, if not implemented in its old format.

CM Nitish Kumar, however, has already said in Darbhanga on Sunday that he would allow the NPR in Bihar only in its old format and there was no question of implementing NRC in the state.

“We welcome what chief minister has said in Darbhanga and expect only the old format of NPR to be used in Bihar,” said Maulana Shamimuddin Ahmad Munemi of Khanqah Munimia, Patna City. “If new format of NPR is implemented then we will go against that,” he added.

The state president of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Maulana Rizwan Ahmad Islahi, said the condition of country has deteriorated since the new CAA came into existence and discussions on NRC and NPR began. “We want the gazette notification of NPR to be recalled and reverted to old format. We request our CM to listen to the voice of people and pass a resolution in the House in this regard,” he said.

Imarat Shariah (Bihar, Jharkhand and Orrisa) acting general secretary Maulana Shibli al-Qasmi appreciated Nitish’s announcement in Darbhanga and called CAA a black law.

Loktantrik Jan Pehal convener Satyanarayan Madan said in the last Census, people were not asked to show documents, but in the present format of NPR they have to show various documents. “This is the beginning of NRC. Nitish should take some substantive steps, instead of giving political statements. He (Nitish) should pass a resolution in the House not to implement NPR in its present format,” said Madan.

He further said Assam government had asked for authentication of 73,019 citizens from Bihar government staying there and a letter in this regard was sent by director of land acquisition department to all the district magistrates on October 12, 2018. “The DMs were asked to verify the names on the list sent by Assam government. But only 17,227 could be verified and over 55,000 people lost their citizenship in Assam. Even if they are given citizenship under CAA, they will be treated as refugees,” said Madan.

Others present at the press conference were Jamait-e-Ulema state general secretary Alhaz Husn Ahmad-Qadri, Sajjadanashi of Khanqah Shah Arzani Syyed Shah Anzar Hussain, Swaraj India member Rishi Anand, state general secretary of Majlis Khutba Amamia Maulana Syyed Amanat Hussain, state general secretary of All India Majlis-e-Mushawarat Anwar-ul-Hoda, Bihar Rabta Committee secretary Afzal Hussain and Maulana Khurshid Ahmad Madni of Jamiyat-e-Ahle Hadis.

Later, through a press release, Maulana Qasmi extended support to the Vidhan Sabha march organized by CPI-ML against CAA, NRC and NPR from Chitkohra on Tuesday and asked people to participate in it.

The Economic Survey 2019-20, based on the achievements made in the 2018-19, noted that the potential of the primary sector (agriculture) needed to be tapped to give a boost to the rural economy and, thereby, through it to the state’s economy itself.

The Economic Survey report tabled in both the Houses of state legislature on Monday, has noted that foodgrain (rice, wheat, maize and pulses) production in the state stood at 163.12 lakh tonnes in 2018-19.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who tabled the survey report in the state assembly, later said the state has won Krishi Karman Award twice from the Centre for the record production of maize and wheat.

The Economic Survey has noted that as the farmers of the state are faced with extreme weather conditions arising from climate change, the state government has launched the ‘jalvayu ke anukul krishi’ (climate resilient agriculture) as part of the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali campaign. The stress is also on restoring underground water resources by recharging and ponds and wetlands were being revived and renovated for that.

While the state has been making headway in foodgrain production and other cash crops (like vegetables), it has made a remarkable achievement in poultry farming, as egg production increased in the state from 111.17 crore in 2016-17 to 176.34 crore in 2018-19, Modi said, adding that even fish production increased from 4.79 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 6.02 lakh tonnes in 2018-19. Poultry and fish farming are considered an allied activity in the agriculture sector.

In tune with the trend, the government took to promoting organic farming of vegetables in 12 districts — Patna, Buxar, Bhojpur, Nalanda, Vaishali, Saran, Samastipur, Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Khagaria, Bhagalpur and Munger. A sum of Rs155.88 crore had been earmarked to extend support to the farmers concerned who take to organic farming, said the report.

It has also pointed out that the operational agro-based factories in the state have registered an annual growth rate of 16.4% over the last 10 years, compared to only 3.3% at the national level.

The report noted that Rs742.54 crore was invested in food processing industries during 2017-18 and 2018-19, which is the “highest among all the industries classified as the high priority sector.”

Kalaiarasan

TIRUVANNAMALAI: Five two-wheelers were torched after a dalit youth was stabbed to death, allegedly by a group of vanniyars, at Vilvarani near Polur in Tiruvannamalai district on Sunday evening, police said. More than 150 police personnel were deployed in the village’s dalit colony.

Demanding compensation to the family of the slain youth, Kalaiarasan, 25, and action against the gang, including prime accused Dayalan, members of the dalit colony blocked Chenagam-Polur Road, disrupting traffic till Monday evening.

Superintendent of Police M R Cibi Chakravarthi told TOI that a case was registered under various sections of the IPC and the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act against 11 accused. While Dayalan and his friend Dilipan, 27, were arrested, a hunt is on for the others including a final year UG college student, he said.

A senior police officer said ahead of former chief minister J Jayalaithaa’s birthday, rural games were organized for schoolchildren on Sunday evening, when a few vanniyar youths including Dayalan of neighbouring Ambavaram Thoppu were chided by people in the dalit colony for teasing girl students.

The argument led to a scuffle and Dayalan was injured after he allegedly abused the dalits by their caste name. Dayalan left in anger and returned a few from his community, the officer said. They began attacking the dalit, stabbed Kalaiarasan, who was present in the crowd, and fled.

Kalaiarasan, son of M Maheshwari, 48, a widow, was rushed to Government Tiruvannamalai Medical College and Hospital where he died.

69,['25/02/2020'],HUL sets up wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary,"This story is from February 25, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ) is perhaps the first large company to take advantage of the lower corporate tax by announcing setting up of a 100% subsidiary for greenfield manufacturing. The FMCG major on Monday said its board of directors approved a proposal to form a 100% subsidiary to help the company “become more agile and customer-focused”.

The government had slashed the corporate tax rate from 30% to 22%, and for new manufacturing entities the corporate tax rate was brought down to 15%. HUL, which is a market leader in several FMCG categories, falls under the 22% corporate tax bracket. Any new manufacturing undertaken by HUL would be taxed at this rate.

However, new manufacturing units set up by the wholly owned subsidiary, which is yet to be named, would attract a lower tax rate of 15%. The company has a window to set up manufacturing units under the new subsidiary before March 2023.

HUL CFO Srinivas Phatak told TOI, “The move is in alignment with the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and it will also create new employment. We will explore all possibilities in manufacturing under the new subsidiary. It could also mean that some of the products that are currently imported, could be manufactured locally.”

The new subsidiary will have an authorised share capital of Rs 2,000 crore. It is expected to become operational in 12-18 months. An initial investment of Rs 500-800 crore is expected to go into setting up FMCG manufacturing units under the new entity. “The law on the new tax regime is clear and there is a thrust on investments,” said Phatak.

Other manufacturing companies may follow the example of HUL. Tax and corporate law advocate Mohamed Nawaz Haindaday said, “Under the new corporate tax regime, a company opting for the tax rate of 15% can look forward to improving its margins or profitability at the cost of forsaking the carry forward of unutilised depreciation and set off losses. Such corporates would lose on the MAT (minimum alternate tax) credits which they would have otherwise paid and accumulated under the higher tax rate regime.”

HUL has 28 manufacturing units across India. The Rs 38,000-crore company employs about 18,000 people. According to the company’s annual report for 2018-19, HUL has 10 wholly owned subsidiaries and one in which HUL has 80% ownership.

Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has requested the union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to increase the Centre’s share from 50% to 90% in the Jal Shakti Mission project , considering Rajasthan ’s difficult climatic and topographical conditions.

In a letter to the union minister, the chief minister said, “Rajasthan has been included in the category of states like Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh where the Centre and states share 50:50 ratio for the project but the climatic condition of Rajasthan varies widely from these states. Rajasthan is the largest state and availability of water here is the lowest.”

Gehlot pointed out that about 85% of the state is now in the dark zone where underground water has gone down drastically.

The CM wrote that in desert areas, the villages are scattered and located in far flung areas due to which the drinking water projects are highly expensive compared to other states. Since the Union minister hails from the state, he is aware of the issue of water crisis and the ground situation in the state, he mentioned.

Gehlot said in 2013 under the national rural drinking water programme, the Centre was initially bearing 90% of the cost for the desert state but this was later reduced on a 60:40 ratio and now to 50:50.

The CM said in the 13 districts in eastern part of the state where water crisis is the worst, providing five litres of water per person is an impossible task without a river linking project. But that involves huge investment. He asked the Centre to assist the state liberally to execute such a project.

VIJAYAWADA: With the petitions challenging the bills establishing three capital cities and repealing Capital Region Development Authority Act to come up for hearing on February 26, agitating farmers of the capital city region have pinned their hopes on the high court. On Monday morning, the farmers formed a human chain at the Seed Access Road from Venkatapalem to Rayapudi and held up placards pleading the judges, who use the road to reach the court,to do justice.

The capital region farmers continued their protests for the 69th day on Monday.

While farmers alleged that aides of Suresh attacked the women protesters, YSRC workers held a rally at Amaravati condemning the attack on Suresh. Women at Thulluru formed a human chain on their knees and demanded the arrest of Suresh under Disha Act for unleashing brute force on women protesters. The YSRC has denied the allegations and counter-alleged that, in fact, Suresh and his gunman were attacked by TDP workers in the guise of farmers.

Mumbai: With every sector from hospitals to hotels embedding technology in their systems more than ever before, building tech capabilities will be the defining factor of the coming decade, said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella .

Speaking at a Microsoft-organised ‘Future Decoded’ summit in Mumbai on Monday, Nadella urged organisations to build their own tech intensity.

Some 150 India Inc leaders, including Kotak Mahindra Bank VC & MD Uday Kotak, Tata Steel CEO T V Narendran, Hindustan Unilever CMD Sanjiv Mehta, Pidilite Industries MD Bharat Puri, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar and McCann Worldgroup India CEO Prasoon Joshi, attended the event.

“Our mission is to empower organisations to achieve more — on how we can help you build your own independence,” Nadella said, while adding that 72% of job openings for software engineers come from outside the tech sector. Microsoft hires the second-largest number of engineers from India.

In a fireside chat with Nadella, Reliance Industries CMD Mukesh Ambani said, “The opportunity that we have for India really is the opportunity to become the premier digital society in the world.”

“I have no doubt that we will become among the top three economies in the world. We can argue about whether it will happen in five years or 10 years, but it’s going to happen. When that happens, our opportunity will be to see if we can be the most tech-enabled society,” said Ambani, who has entered into a long-term alliance with Microsoft to accelerate digital transformation.

Nadella’s visit coincides with Donald Trump’s maiden India visit as US President. “As we are speaking, President Trump has arrived in Ahmedabad, and the India that he will see in 2020 is very different from what President (Jimmy) Carter or (Bill) Clinton or even (Barack) Obama saw. I can easily say that the mobile networks in India now are better or on a par with anybody else in the world. And that’s the big change,” said Ambani.

Commenting on Nadella’s career trajectory, Ambani said, “You joined Microsoft in 1992, when India was a $300-billion economy. Today, India is $3-trillion.”

Lucknow: The Gomtinagar police station is earning notoriety among police officials for instability and short tenures with as many as 18 station house officers being shunted out within months of posting in last five years.

On an average, one officer served for just three-and-half-months at the police station in the city’s VIP area.

In comparison, among the other police stations falling in VIP areas, 10 Vibhutikhand SHOs were transferred in five years, while five were shifted out in Hazratganj, as per records accessed by TOI.

Besides, records also show that Gomtinagar police station has the highest pendency of around 1,200 unsolved criminal cases in last five years, followed by 400 in Vibhutikhand and 396 in Hazratganj in the same period.

In most transfers of SHOs from Gomtinagar police station, police administration had cited spurt in crime due to laxity and poor supervision as the reason. However, despite frequent reshuffling, the crime rate did not come down.

The Gomtinagar police station saw the arrival and departure of three SHOs in 2015, two others in 2016, five in 2017, five more in 2018 and two in 2019. Among these SHOs, Amber Singh was suspended and shifted in March 2018, within a month after joining, because he did not register a missing complaint. His successor, Jitendra Pratap Singh, was also given marching orders within a month for failure in controlling a mob angry over the death of a child in road accident.

Triloki Nath Singh, who took charge in October 2018, was shifted following 20 thefts in the area within a month.

Syed Mohammed Abbas enjoyed the longest tenure as SHO Gomtinagar in five years, and served for eight months from January 2015.

“Gomtinagar is a sensitive posting since top politicians, judges, bureaucrats, businessmen and advocates live in the area. You can understand the kind of pressure we deal with,” said a senior police officer, who has served as Gomtinagar circle officer.

Chennai: The demand for metal castings has seen a fall of 10%-15% due to slowdown in automotive sales, more particularly tractors, senior official at Indian Institute of Foundrymen (IIF) said on Monday. “However, we do expect demand to pick up in next 6-9 months of 2020-21, especially with the proposed scrappage policy round the corner,” said Sanjay Shroff, president, IIF. On the other hand, the foundry industry has seen about 200% increase in demand for exports from the United States and Europe who are looking at an alternative source for supplies — that otherwise come from China — given the instability caused by coronavirus breakout.

“Though this sudden demand is a welcome trend, there is a higher demand and supply gap. At present, we have only 30%-40% supply to meet this sudden demand,” said SRV Ramanan, managing director of Sri Venkatachalapathy Alloys.

With the roll out of BSVI powered automotive vehicles from April 1, the foundry sector is optimistic about seeing a pick-up in demand from the auto industry. “The foundry industry can grow at 8%-10% YoY keeping in view the Government policies — launch of electric vehicles and BSVI-compliant vehicles — and stable interventions and investments in technology (induction melting, greener technologies in sand reclamation, semi-mechanization for better production, IT & simulation software), skilling and focussing on value addition. Production is also expected to go up to 19-20 million TPA (compared to current 13.4 million TPA currently) and turnover is expected to improve at $29-$30 billion for the sector (compared to $20 billion currently),” Shroff said.

Demand from railways is expected to grow by 10% on yearly basis, while it consumes 4.5-5 lakh TPA of castings currently. Similarly, the defence sector is expected to drive demand for highly value added complex castings of special metallurgies for critical applications. There are about 4,500 foundries across India incuding in Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Belagavi, Kolkata, Sholapur, Rajkot, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and are largely in the MSME category employing over 2 million people.

Kolkata: To curb the menace of illegal night parking on city roads, the civic authorities are asking the transport department to withhold their certificate of fitness (CF) and pollution-under-control certificate (PUC). KMC officials have discussed the issue with the transport department and the state pollution control board and urged PVD to share data on vehicles with contact numbers of the owners. The data will be incorporated in an app that is under development to help bring down illegal night parking.

Car parking department officials said that while there are specified night parking lots in the city, a large number of commercial, as well as private, vehicles are usually parked outside these spaces to avoid payment of night parking fee.

“When civic staff conduct raids, they face resistance. Once the data of various departments are integrated and renewal of several key documents are stalled, the owners of these vehicles will be bound to toe the line and pay the fees,” an official explained.

The KMC expects the initiative to lead to a substantial increase in revenue. At present, the department earns arou-nd Rs 5 crore a year from night parking.

The Economic Survey report 2019-20 tabled in the state assembly on Monday has noted that the state’s male workforce found employment mostly in agriculture, forestry and fishing (44.6%), construction (17.1%), wholesale and retail trade, repair of vehicles (12.3%) and manufacturing (9.3%) sectors.

On the other hand, the female workers largely concentrated on two areas for employment and engagement — agriculture, forestry and fishing (53.6%) and education (25.7%).

The report has also pointed out that Rural Self-Employment Training Institute (RSETI) produced skilled workers by training slightly over 1.38 lakh candidates. Of them, 45% were males, 54% females and around 1% transgender. It has also noted that of the total trained persons, 74% were able to get gainful employment in various economic activities.

The wholesale and retail business across the state has been facilitated by the laying of a network of roads and burgeoning expansion of the transport sector, which registered growth of 11% from 2011-12 up to 2018-19.

The physical infrastructure of roads expanded with a massive investment that tripled from Rs5,988 crore in 2012-13 to Rs18,677 crore in 2019-20. Bihar had the credit of becoming the sixth highest state in building additional road length of 1.30 lakh km during 2008-17, and the total paved road in rural areas increased from 35% in 2015 to 75% in 2019.

As a result of this, as many as 11.89 lakh vehicles were registered in the state during 2018-19, in comparison with only 5.53 lakh in 2013-14. The increased registration of vehicles also yielded increased revenue — from Rs835 crore in 2013-14 to Rs2,067 crore in 2018-19, an annual growth rate of 20%.

Similarly, the contribution of the air transport sector to the gross state domestic product (GSDP) increased from Rs31 crore in 2011-12 to Rs252 crore in 2018-19, when as many as 40.61 lakh passengers availed themselves of air travel during 2018-19.

BHAGALPUR: Providing fillip to the movement for conserving nature and restoring underground water resources, the District Bar Association (DBA) of Bhagalpur has issued directive to fresh law graduates to plant at least two saplings in order to get registered with the DBA for starting legal practice in the courts.

The saplings can be planted on public parks, on roadside, farms or even private properties with the tag mentioning his or her name.

Christened as ‘Green & Clean Bhagalpur’, the DBA initiative is perhaps the first among the legal fraternities in the country to encourage the budding lawyers towards tree plantation and conservation of nature besides motivating people to check spreading trash at public places.

Apart from planting saplings, the law graduates would also have to protect them for one year so that it grows into trees. The DBA committee would also do spot verification of the saplings and make inventory before providing certificate of registration besides checking the growth of the saplings for at least one year and beyond as well.

Inspired by the state government’s Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Abhiyan, the DBA initiative is being talked about in Bhagalpur. Along with the planting of saplings, the DBA has also taken initiative to protect and preserve the old trees on the court campuses as well as on the roadsides.

Bhagalpur DBA general secretary Sanjay Kumar Modi said development comes with a cost. Trees are cut for the construction of roads, buildings and other developmental activities and it is everyone’s duty to make efforts to conserve nature through intensive tree plantations besides checking the use of plastic, he said.

“We are also introducing rainwater harvesting system at DBA premises and other court premises in order to conserve groundwater resources,” he said and added: “We are also writing to the bar associations across the country to take initiative for tree plantation on the lines of Bhagalpur DBA and also to introduce rainwater harvesting system inside the court premises”.

85,['25/02/2020'],Kolkata: ‘Touts’ fleece motorists parking in Wood St area,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Cars double-parked on Wood Street

KOLKATA: On the Wood Street-Short Street stretch in south central Kolkata, close to Park Street, new parking rates have been set by attendants, whom cops have termed “parking touts”. Instead of the sanctioned rates of Rs 10/hour, car owners have to pay Rs 20 if the vehicle is double-parked and Rs 30 if the car is in an illegal slot — termed “police parking”.

Kolkata traffic police’s Facebook page has received many complaints in this regard. “This incident took place on Wood Street-Short Street crossing around 7pm. I had parked my car near Lifeline Nursing Home behind Vardan Market. While leaving, a person in civil dress came to me and asked for parking fees. I asked him how much and he said it had been more than an hour so I should pay Rs 30. Before giving him the money, I asked for the parking slip and he said there was none. When I asked how that was possible, another attendant told me that it was a police-parking slot. He harassed me into paying the amount without any receipt. When I asked him to show his parking ID card, he refused. I was in a hurry so I told him to take down my number and report it and left without paying anything. I hope, like always, Kolkata Police shall look into this matter,” wrote Gaurav Dugar.

Following up on this complaint, TOI visited the spot on Monday and found the rates were indeed higher. TOI also found cars parked in double lines. A parking attendant, who introduced himself as Mihir Purkait, said what they were doing was legal. “This is a fixed rate here. You find out which are the KMC slots and pay Rs 10. Do you think that with so many cars parked here, anyone will find a KMC slot?” he asked.

When contacted, officers of the south traffic guard said double parking was not allowed anywhere in the area.

“This must be a one-off incident that you are referring to. As for allegations of police parking, let us assure you there is no such thing. Since you have brought the incident to our notice, we will definitely increase patrolling. If indeed there are touts using our name, we will not spare any one of them,” said an officer.

Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has requested the union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to increase the Centre’s share from 50% to 90% in the Jal Shakti Mission project , considering Rajasthan ’s difficult climatic and topographical conditions.

In a letter to the union minister, the chief minister said, “Rajasthan has been included in the category of states like Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh where the Centre and states share 50:50 ratio for the project but the climatic condition of Rajasthan varies widely from these states. Rajasthan is the largest state and availability of water here is the lowest.”

Gehlot pointed out that about 85% of the state is now in the dark zone where underground water has gone down drastically.

The CM wrote that in desert areas, the villages are scattered and located in far flung areas due to which the drinking water projects are highly expensive compared to other states. Since the Union minister hails from the state, he is aware of the issue of water crisis and the ground situation in the state, he mentioned.

Gehlot said in 2013 under the national rural drinking water programme, the Centre was initially bearing 90% of the cost for the desert state but this was later reduced on a 60:40 ratio and now to 50:50.

The CM said in the 13 districts in eastern part of the state where water crisis is the worst, providing five litres of water per person is an impossible task without a river linking project. But that involves huge investment. He asked the Centre to assist the state liberally to execute such a project.

Sita Sahu

PATNA: The empowered standing committee (ESC) of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Monday approved the tentative annual budget of Rs3,800 crore for 2020-21 fiscal. The final budget will be tabled at the 40th PMC’s board meeting by March-end.

Patna mayor Sita Sahu, who chaired the ESC meeting, said the annual budget amount is likely to exceed up to Rs4,000 crore with minor changes to be made by the standing committee members. “The revised budget would likely to be tabled in the standing committee meeting with some additional proposals within the next 15 days,” she said.

PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma, while addressing the mediapersons, said the proposed budget has been planned to expedite the development process with focus on earning revenue through establishing malls, cafeterias, parking slots and hotels.

“We have continued some projects in this budget as well like construction of malls or supermarkets, vending zones and vending shelters for hawkers, Nali-Gali yojana, construction of affordable housing for economically weaker sections and providing basic amenities at Ganga riverfront, among others,” Sharma said.

Altogether 11 proposals were passed in the meeting, including construction of drains in areas with no drainage system and schemes under ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ mission.

Sahu said drains are to be constructed in areas which had suffered severe waterlogging last year. “The ward councillors and engineers would identify the locations where drains are to be constructed. These areas include Rajendra Nagar, Kankarbagh and Kadamkuan,” she said.

“Besides, the PMC would also find out the reasons behind the poor functioning of ‘online building plan approval system’ (OBPAS). Only 13 maps were passed through this portal since September last year even though the PMC received 81 maps for approval,” Sahu said.

“To make OBPAS more user-friendly and transparent, the urban local body would empanel a private agency for fast and efficient execution of work,” she said.

The PMC is to remove six parking spaces from ward number 2 as it causes inconvenience to commuters.

PATNA: The construction of enclosures for wild animals at the upcoming wildlife safari in Rajgir was in its final stage, said forest department principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh on Monday.

“The construction of administrative blocks, restaurants, ticket counters, waiting area and other facilities are underway,” Singh added.

The project, which entails a total expenditure of Rs 60 crore, will have facilities like butterfly area, walking trails, trekking, observation towers and accommodation for the convenience of the visitors.

Nalanda district magistrate (DM) Yogendra Singh told this newspaper that the safari was targeted to be completed by August and would be thrown open for the visitors after that. “Roads in between the inner and outer peripheral boundaries are almost ready. Vehicles of several departments, including animal husbandry, fire and water among others, will use the them to move along the jungle safari,” he said.

The DM added, “Rajgir and Nalanda already witness major footfall of tourists, both Indian and foreigners. With the jungle safari, we are expecting an even higher footfall.”

Nearly 110km from Patna , Rajgir is situated outside the reserve forest area and is in the foothills of the Jethian Hills. Adjacent to it is the Rajgir forest reserve where the jungle safari is being developed. “The jungle safari is totally different from zoos, including Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, where animals are kept in cages with limited space. Over here, huge spaces have been allotted to the enclosures and wild animals can roam around freely in their natural habitat,” forest department principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh said.

He added, “The safari, which is spread over an area of 480 acres of land, has altogether five enclosures for animals, including lions, tigers, bears and leopards. Besides, there will be several well as herbivores in an 80-acre enclosure.”

Singh also said visitors would be allowed to watch wild animals in special vehicles. “Keeping in mind the safety of visitors, around 30 special vehicles will be procured for them,” he said.

GAYA: With the expected arrival of about 100 CISF personnel to strengthen the existing manpower, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) now gears up to operate at Gaya airport in two shifts. As of now, about 160 CISF personnel provide security to the airport. The present strength is inadequate for two-shift operations.

According to AAI sources, Ministry of Home Affairs has cleared the deployment of additional forces and if everything goes as per plan, they are likely to be deputed there before March-end. Refusing to share details, Gaya airport director Dilip Kumar said the airport would be soon in a position to handle air traffic in two shifts. As of now, the airport operates in a single 8-hour shift from 8am every day.

The AAI also needs another 25 officials, including those skilled in air traffic control, communication navigation and fire fighting etc for two-shift operations. Regular personnel for these positions are required, an AAI official said. The airport director said getting more skilled manpower would not be a problem.

Earlier in November, 2019, a SpiceJet team conducted survey to start operations on the Gaya-Delhi route. However, the airlines, according to sources, has not as yet formally applied for a time slot. Two-shift operations may give impetus to private operators to introduce more flights via Gaya.

As of now, there is only one direct flight on the Gaya-Delhi route. It may be recalled that earlier IndiGo sought an afternoon slot for its proposed Gaya-Delhi flight. But on account of congestion in the afternoon slot, the airlines was advised to seek a time slot between 9-12 in the forenoon, which it did not find suitable.

During its November survey, SpiceJet is also learnt to have studied the viability of introducing a flight for Dubai/Jeddah. Though, sizeable number of workers from Bihar and Jharkhand work in the Middle East, there is no direct air link for these countries from anywhere in the two states.

Gaya is the only international airport in Bihar and Jharkhand and does have the immigration and customs facility to handle international passengers.

SURAT: Even as inquiry by a three-member woman committee is probing the alleged stripping of probationary women clerks, the state-government run New Civil Hospital (NCH) waded itself into the row with its superintendent addressing media persons on the issue on Tuesday.

The incident had happened in SMIMER which is run by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), but NCH superintendent Preeti Kapadia addressed media persons in her office and justified undressing of women for fitness and medical test.

Even as she denied having approval from her department to address media when the inquiry committee is already doing its work, Kapadia claimed she had been asked by municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani and explain how the tests are done. Pani, however, categorically denied having asked anyone to hold a press conference.

It is learnt that theprobe committee had sought response from SMIMER regarding rules of fitness test for women.

When contacted, Kanani told TOI: “Why is she holding press conference in NCH on this issue? It is a matter related to SMC and SMIMER. She has not been authorised to speak on this issue by the health department. She cannot do this even if it was done in the capacity of NCH superintendent Kanani said he will inquire and take action if necessary. “I have been asked by the municipal commissioner to call media and explain them that how these fitness tests are conducted. He was to remain present but due to some reason he could not come,” Kapadia said to a question. However, Pani said, “I have not asked anyone to hold a press conference. NCH officials could have requested SMIMER superintendent. I have no role to play in this. I am also not aware that SMC's PRO department made calls to media persons to attend the press conference.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The government has sanctioned funds for wet-leasing a helicopter for multiple purposes including troop deployment and aerial survey in deep forests, rescue and reconnaissance missions and VIP movements .

The home department issued an order sanctioning Rs 1,70,63,000, for the chopper, which is being leased at the rate of Rs 1.44 crore per month, and an additional 18% GST.

The twin-engine AS 365 Dauphin N3 helicopter that has a seating capacity of 10 persons is being leased from Pawan Hans Ltd, a public sector undertaking, and includes 20 hours of flying every month. However, every additional hour of flying beyond 20 hours per month would incur Rs 67,926 in addition to the fixed cost. The government had considered proposals from Pwan Hans and private operator Chipsan Aviation Private Ltd before choosing Pawan Hans.

The financial as well as technical parameters of the proposals received by the government were analyzed and the committee constituted for the purpose had observed that Pawan Hans, being a public sector undertaking, is more efficient and effective in dealing with emergency situations. The committee, headed by the chief secretary, also includes finance and transport secretaries, secretary in charge of aviation and representatives of Indian Air Force. The decision was taken after a series of meetings of the committee.

The police had given its requirements that it should be a twin engine helicopter, the load factor, the equipment carrying facilities and the altitude up to which it can fly, etc, aimed at mid-air operations like air dropping troops.

Bareilly: “Raped” repeatedly for nearly three months on the pretext of marriage by a minor boy of her locality, the 15-year-old was allegedly thrown off the roof of her house when she protested ""advances"" by her boyfriend’s cousin in Bareilly on Sunday night.

The accused are on the run, while the girl is recovering at the district hospital, said the SHO.

“The sexual relationship with a minor girl is considered rape. The main accused has been sexually assaulting the girl for the past three months. Even his cousin tried to take advantage. After the girl resisted, he threw her off the roof. Fortunately, the girl didn’t receive serious injuries. The girl’s medical examination was completed on Monday. In her statement recorded to police, the girl said that as her friend had promised to marry her, she did not reveal her sexual relationship with her parents.

100,['25/02/2020'],5 centres of excellence planned,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Times News Network

Jaipur: In a major thrust to technical education, the state technical education department has announced to establish five centres of excellence in its five engineering colleges.

The engineering college in Bikaner will become a centre of excellence on energy sector, while the college in Barmer will become a centre for ceramic science. The engineering college in Ajmer will become the hub for computer science. The aim is to increase enrolments by providing exclusive courses.

The idea was mooted by technical and higher education secretary Suchi Sharma.

“Developing centres of excellence in our colleges has multifold objectives. Its primary aim is to create expert learning centres on subjects which has huge job potential and scope for research. It is also targeted to channelise our limited resources at a particular place for optimum utilisation of resources. Finally, the department sees it as a stepping stone to revive the technical education in the state,” said Sharma.

The state has chosen five colleges in the first phase while the remaining eight government engineering colleges will be taken up in the next phase. The government engineering sector in Bikaner has been chosen to create a hub for energy sector which focusses on clean and green energy.

“Experts are being roped in for designing the subjects making it job oriented. The idea is that students should get the job as soon as he/she completes the course,” said Sharma.

Experts have hailed the idea. “Upgrading or improving the existing institute is a well thought decision taken by the government instead of announcing a new institute. It will certainly attract quality students which has been missing from institutes in the state,” said Puneet Sharma, an educationist.

The state has been drastically loosing enrolments in its engineering colleges from the past few years. The situation has become so grim this year is that out of 50,000 seats, barely 12,000 students take admission in engineering colleges.

File photo illegal construction Praja Vedika being demolished

AMARAVATI: Nearly eight months after the demolition of Praja Vedika, the CRDA has decided to auction the furniture left at the spot. CRDA will accept applications from bidders to pick-up the furniture from Praja Vedika till March 3. Auction will be held on March 4.

The conference hall was constructed with nearly Rs 9 crore during the TDP regime. The Jaganmohan Reddy-led YSRC government razed it in June last year as it was an illegal structure. Although,a few social activists had approached the high court seeking a stay on the demolition, as it involved a large amount of public money, the high court had declined as the petitioner himself had stated that the structure was illegal.

The CRDA, which bulldozed the structure, has left many valuable utilities including air-conditioners, chairs and tables at the spot.

Following the decision to auction the Praja Vedika furniture, former minister and TDP senior leader Nakka Anand Babu said, “The government should have auctioned the remaing furniture immediately after the demolition. They would have got at least a few crores then. The CRDA might not get even 10% of what it would have got eight months ago,” said Anand Babu.

The plight of Eluru Canal on Monday

VIJAYAWADA: The end of the Kharif season has exposed the state of Vijayawada’s canals. Heaps of plastic and other garbage can be seen floating in the city’s canals and clogging its lock gates. Campaigns and special drives conducted by Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) have failed to stop people from using them as dumping grounds.

Vijayawada city is also known as the Venice of Andhra Pradesh as a large section of it lies among three irrigation canals, Eluru , Bandar and Ryves canals. These canals not only water the fields and boost groundwater level, but also adds to the city’s beauty. But given the apathy of the irrigation department, rather than adding to the beauty, the dirty canals are now marring the look of the city.

Speaking to TOI, former city mayor Jandhyala Shankar said VMC authorities should utilise the canal bunds as marketplaces. “Canal bunds are used for dumping construction debris and other garbage in the city. Fruit vendors and small business units are major culprits in polluting canals with plastic and solid wastes. During my term in office, we did a detailed study on canals and proposed to construct markets on both sides, so that people stop polluting the canal bunds. Encroachments on the canals can be accommodated on the markets constructed on the bunds. This will also enhance the beauty of the canals,” Shankar said.

Krishna district administration and VMC, which cleared around 1,200 tonnes garbage in canals as a part of ‘Nenu Saitham Krishnamma Suddhi Sevalo’, are now preparing to start a canal beautification drive. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy directed officials to develop parks and green belts on canal bunds.

Speaking to TOI about the issue, district collector Mohammed Imtiaz said, “We have kept a special focus on protecting canals. We have already installed a fences on the bridges and barring people from dumping garbage in the canals. VMC authorities are preparing designs to restore canals and beautify the canal bunds.”

Around 1.30am, the couple was woken up by some sounds from the rear side of the bungalow. Before they could react, they were surrounded by the dacoits who had gained entry by breaking open the rear door of the bungalow. One held a revolver at Homai while the others, armed with sickles , knives and iron rods , assaulted Rohinton on his right eyebrow and back.The dacoits demanded the keys of the cupboard in the bedroom. Rohinton, a retired chikoo farmer, and Homai pleaded with the dacoits to spare them and handed over the keys. The dacoits ransacked the cupboards in the bedroom and near the dining table and fled with cash and jewellery worth Rs 6.6 lakh. They also stole the digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV and the cable box.It was only after the dacoits fled that the couple came out of their bungalow to find the canines had been poisoned. While one of them was already dead, the other survived as it vomited. Two hens were found dead too.Rohinton said, “While we are lucky to have been spared by the dacoits, my licensed revolver, which I had surrendered to the police ahead of the zilla parishad elections, would have helped scare away the dacoits.” It was returned to him after the dacoity.The couple that lives alone had installed the CCTV a few years ago.

Varanasi: Despite registration of over 20,000 cancer patients in past two years after Tata Memorial Centre run- Mahamana Pt Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital became operational in Varanasi, many patients still run to Mumbai hospitals. In an alarming revelation, TMC’s population-based cancer registry programme shows gall bladder and liver cancer emerging as unique problem in the Gangetic belt of Varanasi.

Talking to TOI, deputy director, Centre for Cancer Epidemiology at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Pankaj Chaturvedi said, “On an average 20,000 cancer patients from Varanasi and adjacent regions reach TMH Mumbai. Despite registration of over 20,000 patients after HBCH and MPMMMCC became operational, the number of patients coming to TMH Mumbai has not reduced. We are expecting a decrease in cancer patients from east UP region in coming two-three years once MPMMMCC becomes fully functional.”

Chaturvedi signed an MoU with Varanasi Municipal Corporation for cancer prevention awareness campaign. TMC, in collaboration with Banaras Hindu University and state government, had conducted a population-based cancer registration study in Varanasi in 2017. Covering over 40 million population, including 57% of rural belt, the study revealed that incidence of mouth cancer among males is 19 per one lakh population and goes upo to 24 if mouth, tongue and lip cancer are combined. One in every 35 men is at oral cancer risk.

JAIPUR: The MBM Engineering College in Jodhpur is set to run as a petroleum and earth sciences university from the coming session aimed at tapping the growing demand for engineers in the sectors related to crude oil. The Gehlot-government’s pet project, the Barmer oil refinery, is in the same region and has given high hopes about employment to the local youth.

The Barmer oil refinery is being set up in the region close to this college has been the motivation for the university. This will be state’s second subject specific university after Rajasthan Sports University in Jhunjhunu.

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday reserved orders in the petitions seeking Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into Y S Vivekananda Reddy’s murder. While petitioners argued that the special investigation tseam (SIT) constituted by the state government failed to make headway in the case and in identifying the perpetrators, the state government argued that the SIT investigation is at an advanced stage of completion and CBI probe is not necessary.

Vivekananda Reddy’s wife Sowbhagyamma and daughter Sunitha raised doubts in their petitions over family members, including chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy. The counsel for Sunitha argued that the memo filed by Jaganmohan Reddy to close his petition cannot be accepted as it is not in the form of an affidavit.

He also said that in his earlier affidavit, Jaganmohan Reddy had raised doubts over the state police and the same police are now investigating the case. “Although the ruling party has changed, the government is a continuous process and the doubts expressed by Jaganmohan Reddy still stands valid even now” he said.

Continuing to argue for a CBI probe, the counsel said, when five people moved the court over the same issue and raised the same contentions, even if one petition is withdrawn, the contents of the affidavit stand valid in the court. “The chief minister announced that he will hand over a rape and murder case of a girl to CBI after the parents gave him representation, why he is reluctant to do the same when his sister is asking for the same in case of her father’s murder case” he said.

Arguing on behalf of Jaganmohan Reddy, senior counsel Vivek said the earlier petition was moved as the then chief minister had made public statements about the investigation of the case, giving directions to the police. The circumstances have changed and as the investigation is going on in an impartial manner, there is no need for a CBI inquiry.

On the other hand, advocate general S Sriram submitted the case diary and general diary to the high court. Upon hearing the arguments of all the parties, the high court reserved orders.

112,['25/02/2020'],Spl teams to crack down on tax evasion by traders,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Amaravati: The state government has launched a special drive to detect tax evasions by traders following allegations of malpractices.

Sources said chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has directed the officials not to spare fraudulent traders. The CM asked the commercial taxes department to constitute special teams to unearth malpractices after massive tax evasion by a trader in Visakhapatnam was found out. The officials have slapped a criminal case against the iron merchant for duping the government with bogus returns to claim input credit.

The state has reported decent growth in GST revenues during the current fiscal. The GST revenue in January reported nearly 9% growth over the corresponding period in the last fiscal.

While the state mopped up Rs.2159 crore during January, 2019, it fetched Rs.2,356 crore during the last month. Although many states reported a growth rate of 11 to 16% in GST collections, AP’s 9% growth rate is considered to be decent keeping in view of the slowdown in economic activity in the state.

However, the state government believes revenue could go up if malpractices are contained. The government has taken serious note of the complaints received from different sections that some traders were resorting to malpractices to avoid taxes thanks to cooperation from officials.

Besides tax evasion, some traders believed have been claiming huge amounts from the government as input credit.

“We got some information about our own officials’ connivance. The CM has directed us not to spare the officials who are helping the fraudulent traders,” said K Narayana Swamy, deputy chief minister (commercial taxes). Swamy said he had asked the commissioner to look into the issue.

Sources said that the commercial taxes commissioner Piyush Kumar had conducted surprise inspection of field offices to detect the role of insiders. Piyush Kumar was surprised when officials in Sattenapalle failed to open the keys of the office iron safe when he went there on an inspection. Suspecting that the officials had deliberately misplaced the keys to avoid the inspection of the records, the commissioner suspended three officials.

Suresh Khanna

LUCKNOW: The menace of stray cattle in UP took political overtones on Monday when state parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna said that the people living across the borders in Congress-governed MP and Rajasthan were releasing their herds into UP.

“The entry of stray cattle from MP and Rajasthan should be looked into,” he said, while responding to a query raised in the Assembly by Congress MLA and UP party state chief Ajay Kumar Lallu who sought to ask what steps the state government was taking to curtail the menace which is causing damage to crops of farmers.

Khanna said that the state government was taking various steps including setting up of cattle shelter homes. “We also need to consider the fact where these stray cattle are coming from. They are being left on the borders of MP and Rajasthan from where they enter into UP,” he said, adding: “Sarkar ko badnaam karne ke liye yahan par chhurwa rahe hain (They are letting loose their cattle here to defame the government).”

His response led to a fracas in the assembly with Congress slamming the state government of making its failure a political issue. Leader of opposition and SP MLA Ram Govind Chaudhary said that the menace of stray cattle has only grown after Yogi government came to power.

Those booked include advocate Mirza Fazal Ali Beg, who allegedly fired in the air from his licensed pistol.

Besides Beg, FIR has been lodged against Imran Haider, Kamil, Aizaz, Akram and six unidentified men. Beg and Haider were arrested by police and while Beg got interim bail, haider was sent to jail. The FIR was lodged by police itself because no party came forward to lodge complaint. “Since there was firing and violence during the clash that endangered public life, we had to lodge an FIR,” said police commissioner Sujeet Pandey. “Two groups, one led by Kamil and the other by Aizaz, had first clashed over a petty dispute on Sunday. Beg came in support of Aizaz and allegedly fired in air to scare the rival group,” said Station House Officer, Thakurganj, Pramod Kumar.

NEW DELHI: The Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) on Monday told the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) that restaurants and roadside eateries at Murthal in Haryana were operating without approval from the state pollution control boards and extracting groundwater without permission.

The apex pollution monitoring body, which along with Haryana state pollution control board and the municipal corporation inspected the eating outlets, told a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel that the units need to take necessary permission from state pollution control boards for operating roadside eateries and restaurants.

“The state boards should ensure that these roadside eateries or restaurants obtain necessary permission from them as per the state policy. No unit should be allowed in areas in which such facilities are not available and should be closed down or shifted to areas where such facilities are available,” CPCB said in its report.

It also recommended that the state boards should ensure that necessary infrastructure with respect to collection and treatment of sewage and solid waste was provided prior to granting permission to such units.

“The state board must have robust mechanism to evaluate compliance with norms of such units at least twice a year,” it added.

BHOPAL: Despite decline in the number of casualties reported in road accidents in the city last year, the number of ‘black spots’ (accident-prone zones) has increased from nine to 16. After analysing the road accident data of past three years, traffic police have identified seven new black spots.Accident-prone zones, which are black spots for traffic police, are not new but rectifying the problems after identifying these zones still remains a problem with the agencies assigned to address road safety.A senior traffic police personnel, wishing anonymity, said that steps to reduce accidents in accident-prone zones are taken up by the traffic police, but negligence by ‘other agencies’ responsible for rectifying the problems in these zones leads to delay and the risk of accidents remains unchanged.In order to identify black spots, police took into account 300-500 metres of road stretches on which five or more major accidents have occurred or 10 people or more have lost their lives in the past three years —- from 2017 to 2019, he added.The seven newly identified black spots include the 400-metre stretch of road at Ratnagiri trisection in Piplani where six severe road accidents took place in the past three years, leading to the loss of four lives. Two fatal accidents were reported at the same spot this year in January in which two persons, including a 48-year-old woman central excise inspector and a 21-year-old lab assistant, lost their lives.Among the other black spots, the 500-metre stretch at KN Pradhan Square near Professor Colony has been included where four casualties were reported in six severe road accidents. The 500-metre stretch at Anna Nagar Square has also been classified as a black spot this year where four casualties were reported in five serious accidents. Another black spot identified was the ITI Trisection where five fatal accidents were reported on the 500-metre road stretch, killing three people.At the 500-metre stretch of Chanchal Square in Bairagarh, there were three casualties in five severe accidents. The 500-metre stretch of Golkheri Square in Eintkheri is also identified as a black spot where four casualties were reported in five serious accidents. Similarly, the 500-metre stretch of Hoshangabad Road at Surendra Palace main road in Bag Sewania has been identified as a new black spot, where four people lost their lives in five road accidents in the last three years.The traffic police have taken some measures at the black spots, such as installing boards of speed limits, installing stoppers, deploying police personnel and urging that traffic signals be put up. But the rectification cannot be completed fully until the road construction agencies, including Bhopal Municipal Corporation, PWD, CPA and others take required measures by constructing dividers, putting up traffic signals, resizing the rotaries and other steps.Sources in traffic police department said that police identify the black spots and temporarily make dividers using barricades. The construction agencies are expected to complete civil work for rectification, but they do nothing, he alleged. Giving an example, the traffic source said that ever since the Chetak Bridge was widened, there has been an immediate need to construct a divider. Police temporarily kept barricades to make a divider. But despite repeated letters and reminders, the divider is not being constructed. Similarly, temporary dividers were made with barricades at Bhadbhada Square, 6-Number Market, Rajbhawan Road and other places.The source said that except police control room, road construction agencies concerned did nothing to rectify the nine black spots identified last year.Speaking on the issue, DIG Irshad Wali said police have identified seven new black spots this year. The details of work needed to rectify these black spots have been forwarded to agencies concerned and appropriate action will be taken soon.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74298936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61372,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/killer-spots-on-city-roads-remain-dangerous-seven-more-added/articleshow/74291245.cms

HYDERABAD: Protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens have spread to smaller town in Telangana as a large population of Muslims joined a demonstration in Sathupalli on Sunday, shouting slogans.

The protest was led by Jamaat-e-Islami Hind women wing. Ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and Congress party functionaries extended support to them.

JIH functionary Khalida Parveen said during the protest, ""Women should emulate the Shaheen Bagh protests against CAA and NRC. To create division between castes and religion is anti-constitutional. If someone asks us about our documents in NRC, we would tell them to take our DNA tests. It is an insult to ask us to prove our nationality. We will continue our protests till NRC and CAA re withdrawn.""

TRS local functionary Matta Dayanand also spoke against NRC and CAA. National Christian Council local members extended support to the protest, attended by more than a thousand women.

A top intelligence official of Telangana police said that the anti-CAA protests are spreading to the towns. ""The fear among the minority community is increasing. We are anticipating more serious protests,"" he said.

Sathupalli inspector of police Ramakanth told TOI, ""Hundreds of Muslim women took part in the rally that went on peacefully. I have no information on whether they have taken permission for the rally.”

Visakhapatnam: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy inaugurated the state’s second Disha police station in Vizianagaram town on Monday. The police station will have a staff strength of 40 and will be headed by a DSP rank officer. The state’s first Disha police station was also inaugurated by the CM in Rajahmundry earlier this month.

Addressing a public gathering on the occasion, Jagan said the government was working on transforming all villages in the state into self-sufficient and self-administered units. “All facilities would be available for people living in the villages, with each village secretariat catering to the needs of 2,000 people,” he said, while urging the staff of the 11,158 village secretariats to serve the public sincerely and honestly.

“All government schools would be transformed into well-equipped and well-manned English medium schools under the Nadu-Nedu programme, which would allow locals to send their children to government schools and not private ones. Rythu Bharosa centres would also be set up in all village secretariats soon. Besides, the government also plans to establish village clinics to cater to the health needs of local residents at the secretariats,” Jagan added.

He also urged the ‘mahila samrakshana karyadarsis’ (women secretaries dedicated for the protection of women at village secretariats) to crack down on people running belt shops and selling arrack in their areas. Their reports would be directly sent to the DGP, home department and CM’s office, who would take a call on the action required to be taken, he said.

The CM also officially launched the Vasathi Deevena scheme at Ayodhya maidan. Under the scheme, over Rs 2,278 crore will be deposited in the accounts of parents of all deserving students across the state. While Rs 10,000 would be provided to those pursuing polytechnic, Rs 15,000 would be provided for undergraduate courses and Rs 20,000 for those pursuing higher courses. The amounts would be deposited in the accounts of parents of all deserving students.

“Poverty is one of the main reasons why many deserving students do not go for higher education. This scheme would help such students realise their dreams,” Jagan said. Pointing out that the government was spending close to Rs 6,000 crore on students alone, he said another Rs 3,000 crore would be spent on Amma Vodi scheme. He also added that the government plans to start bridge courses to help students realise their dreams.

JAIPUR: The police have arrested two Nigerians for allegedly peddling drugs from Apex Circle in Malviya Nagar area under the Clean Sweep Operation late on Monday night. Twenty one grams of cocaine have been recovered from them.

The accused have been identified as 23-year-old Abbas, a resident of Ajaro of Nigeria and 29-year-old Ibrahim, a resident of Kano state, Nigeria. Police have been keeping an eye on both for the past couple of months.

According to police, Abbas came to Jaipur for studying in 2016 from Nigeria. He got admission in a private university on Delhi Road for graduation in Geography. But, he left the city after studying for two semesters. He went to Haryana and he came back to Jaipur in 2019 and lived in a PG hostel, police said.

The police said that they investigated into the matter and found that Abbas was not studying in any college or university and he was not doing any job in the past two years. He was found frequently around the private university spending most of his time in cafes. The police said that they are investigating to find out if he was part of any drug cartel.

Ibrahim, who has also been arrested by the police, had come to Rajasthan for studying B. Pharmacy in 2015. In 2019, he managed to get a degree in B. Pharmacy. Ibrahim was illegally living in an apartment which has already been acquired by the LIC.

The police said, while investigating into the matter, they found that the cocaine which was found from their procession was provided to them by another Nigerian national. The police have launched a search for the person who provided them the drugs.

Picture used for representational purpose only

MUMBAI: City doctors have removed giant kidneys weighing 7kg and 5.8kg from a Goan man living with a life-threatening genetic condition. While a normal kidney weighs 120-150 gram and is 8-10cm long, 41-year-old Roman Pereira’s were nearly 26cm and 21cm in length.

Pereira suffered from kidney failure due to a genetic condition called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), where normal kidney tissues are replaced by cysts. Though he was living with the condition since a decade, it had gradually begun to disrupt his life, often leaving him breathless and weak to walk since the past one and a half years. His haemoglobin levels, too, had begun to deplete. In November last year, though, his condition turned serious after he began to bleed.

Nephrologist Dr Bharat Shah of Parel’s Global Hospital said ADPKD was an uncommon condition seen in around 5% of patients who develop kidney failure.

Renal transplant surgeon Dr Pradeep Rao said since the kidneys were of a gigantic size, they could not take the laparoscopic approach and instead had to do an open surgery. “Through a single incision, we could remove both kidneys which weighed 12.8kg in total,” he said.

Pereira’s life could be saved through a swap transplant. While his wife Placima wanted to donate a kidney, her blood group was incompatible with him.

Doctors found a match in Amravati couple Nitin and Radha Tapar. Radha, too, could not donate to Nitin as they had incompatible tissue types. “We transplanted Pereira with Radha’s kidney and Nitin with Placima’s in December. Both are well,” said Dr Shah.

Petitioner Shantanu Pareek, an advocate by profession, had filed a PIL against the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 passed in Parliament. The Act has criminalised the practice of triple talaq.

The petitioner stated that the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court in the case of ‘Shayara Bano’ had set aside the practice of triple talaq and had declared that it is also not recognised by Shariyat and thus has no legal sanctity and status. “The PIL has been filed since passing of the Act is a clear violation of Article 21of the Constitution as it also makes ‘triple talaq’ void.

The bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice NS Dhadha dismissed the petition saying the petitioner had no locus standi in the case. The court also observed that the petitioner was not affected directly or indirectly by the law.

LUCKNOW: Courageous and timely action by a woman led police to nab two youths passing comments and misbehaving with her on-board a UPSRTC bus on Monday.

The youths were intercepted at Rudauli police station and nabbed by police. The 21-year-old woman thanked the police and CM for quick action.

The woman, a law student, had boarded an AC bus run by Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) from Lucknow for Basti. At Kaiserbagh, two youths—later identified as Rizwan and Mohammed of Faizabad—boarded the bus.

“On finding the woman sitting alone, the duo got seated beside her. They first asked for her phone number and then passed lewd remarks,” said Faizabad SSP Ashish Tiwari.

The woman, sensing their intentions, decided to teach them a lesson, said the officer.

“She first quietly made a video and then posted it on Twitter, tagging UP Police, UP chief minister and UPSRTC, seeking help. The CM office immediately alerted us and we swung into action,” said the SP.

125,['25/02/2020'],Row over police action at guest house of vernacular; minister orders probe,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Jaipur: Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal on Monday ordered an inquiry into reported police action at a vernacular daily’s guest house for playing loud music during a birthday party. Leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria raised the matter during Zero Hour in the state assembly alleging that the police led by the commissioner entered the campus in Civil Lines area on Sunday night.

Kataria said two policemen could have gone to stop the music being played after 10pm and questioned the presence of the police commissioner at the guest house. He alleged that the police action followed as the venue was near the chief minister's residence and added that women guests were asked to stand in a corner but there were no women police personnel.

When contacted, Jaipur police commissioner Anand Srivastava said action was taken for playing loud music in night hours. He denied he was present at the guest house.

As per the regional paper’s news report, a birthday party of a Jaipur-based bank owner’s son was going on in the guest house and the police team misbehaved with the women guests there. It questioned why the police do not act on neighbouring marriage gardens that routinely play loud music after 10pm.

The opposition leader alleged that the Congress-led state government was annoyed with the vernacular as it was running news reports against the present dispensation.

Minister Dhariwal strongly refuted the charge. He said it was the previous BJP government that stopped advertisements to the newspaper. Dhariwal said an inquiry will be conducted into the incident by officer of a rank higher than the police commissioner.

126,['25/02/2020'],Former Prashant Kishor aide joins N Chandrababu Naidu’s team as key strategist,"This story is from February 25, 2020

N Chandrababu Naidu

HYDERABAD: After working as an independent and full-time campaign manager for Priyanka Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh, Robbin Sharrma, a former associate of Prashant Kishor, is now assisting Nara Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP as a strategist.

TDP is facing a tough challegenge to keep its flock together while Naidu is caught in legal battles.

Sharrma has already started his work. He sits in an office on the third floor of NTR Bhavan in Banjara Hills (TDP headquarters) where he is reportedly focusing on building a social media platform for the party.

Sharrma was the co-founder of Kishor-led Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG) - which ran a successful campaign for Narendra Modi in 2014 - and Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC). “We have no idea about his nature of work. But, we are hoping he will work wonders for the party,” a TDP leader on condition of anonymity told TOI.

Party sources said young MP from Srikakulam K Ram Mohan Naidu is working closely with Sharrma. “To begin with, it could be on establishing a social media platform for the party,” said a former party politburo member.

Some leaders said Sharrma should focus on working out strategies to beat the ruling YSRC in Andhra Pradesh in the forthcoming civic polls. “However, his prime focus will be ensuring a TDP victory in 2024 assembly elections,” a senior leader said.

For now, Sharrma leads a small team, which has started visiting some places in AP to get an idea as to where TDP stands. Party sources said it would be a huge challenge for Sharrma and his team to counter the “caste image” created around TDP by the ruling YSRC in the 2019 election campaign.

Interestingly, Kishor-led IPAC first approached TDP in last year’s election before it started working with Jagan’s YSRCP. Since IPAC is closely associated with YSRC, TDP sources said Sharrma’s team would work independently with Naidu’s party.

It is also learnt that a teaching professional Srikanth, who was a close associate of former planning board member Srinivasulu Naidu, has also started working with TDP.

Kanpur: A Smart Grid Control Centre, set up at IIT-Kanpur, was inaugurated by joint secretary, ministry of power, Mrityunjay Kumar Narayan along with director of IIT-Kanpur, Prof Abhay Karandikar and director, National Smart Grid Mission (Project management unit) NSGM-NPMU, AK Mishra here on Monday.

The centre has been set up as part of the smart grid pilot project titled 'Development of R&D platform for smart city pilot projects in the Indian context' which was equally funded by the ministry of power (MoP) and IIT-Kanpur.

The Control Centre has a state-of-the-art facility to monitor IIT-Kanpur's distribution substations through the SCADA system. It also has advanced metering infrastructure integrated with meter data management system, smart meters, along with home automation and rooftop solar PV integration. Using this control centre, the institute will carry out various researches, demonstrations and training activities in the Smart Grid area.

Recently, the institute had also signed MOU with National Smart Grid Mission, ministry of power, to start a series of training programmes in Smart Grid area for utility, R&D and industry professionals.

The first such training programme on 'Smart Grid Components and Technologies' is organised by Prof Saikat Chakraborty and Prof Ankush Sharma in Smart Grid Control Centre. The training programme was also inaugurated by Mrityunjay Kumar Narayan, Prof Abhay Karandikar and AK Mishra.

The main objective of the training programme is to familiarise the participants of utilities from industries and R&D organisations about different concepts and developments in Smart Grid Technology. This will help them to understand the role of modern information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure in helping to monitor and control the power systems more effectively.

With an increase in penetration of SGT in power systems, there has been a growing demand of real-time visualization, monitoring, and control of the power system. Further, the present-day electricity sector is witnessing increased share of renewables, storage, EV charging stations, microgrids, intelligent sensors and controllers, automation, and smart metering at different levels in the network.

This leads to transmission and distribution networks requiring cyber-secure Advanced Energy Management System (AEMS) and Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) tools. The large penetration of renewables, being intermittent in nature, will pose system stability and power quality concerns, which will require proper compensation and controls. The above challenges faced by the power system network will be discussed in detail in this course.

VARANASI: A team of archaeologists from BHU ’s department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, have claimed to have found remains of a 3,500-year-old human settlement of sculptors on the city outskirts at Babhaniyav village situated along the holy Panchkoshi route.

“During the field survey of the area, we found several evidences, including a pillar with inscription in Brahmi script and a number of stole sculptures and idols of deities of Kushan and post-Gupta periods,” said project director and head of the department professor Onkar Nath Singh.

“Discovery of idols and Shivlingas, both complete and incomplete forms, suggests that there might be a settlement of sculptors. After these findings, we sent a proposal to the Archaeological Survey of India for excavation, which was accepted,” he added.

“We are going to begin the excavation from February 26 at the village,” said professor AK Dubey, a team member. “As the antiquity of the surface evidences belong to the period of around 1500BC, it could be safely said that it is contemporary to Harappan civilization,” he said.

Former additional director general of ASI, BR Mani, too, endorsed the observation of BHU archaeologists. “I visited the site in Babhaniyav village which could be at least 3,500 years old,” Mani told TOI on Monday.

The antiquity of Babhaniyav village came to notice during the survey of holy Panchkroshi route for documentation under a UGC project, said Singh. “After we found ancient stone sculptures all around in the village, we decided to go into depth to unearth something meaningful,” he said.

131,['25/02/2020'],"With TA out, opinion builds up to open Sitabuldi Fort for public","This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: With 118 Territorial Army (TA) having moved out, the general opinion in the city is that the Sitabuldi Fort should be opened for public daily, and developed into a tourism spot like Daulatabad Fort, Red Fort etc. City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari and West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre are likely to take up this initiative.

After TA moved out from the historical Sitabuldi Fort to Bhusawal in November 2018, the grade-I heritage fort houses the HQ Uttar Maharashtra and Gujarat Sub Area (UMANG). TA stayed at the fort for over 80 years with a huge posse of personnel and ammunition, which was the main reason for Sitabuldi Fort not being opened for the public on daily basis. TA used to permit public entry on Independence Day, Republic Day etc.

In 2018, Gadkari took up the issue with the then defence minister late Manohar Parrikar, who was in favour of opening the fort for public even when TA was occupying it. The process was started to open the fort to public on Saturdays and Sundays. Unfortunately, the process stopped after the demise of Parrikar.

Sources from Gadkari’s office told TOI correspondence with the defence ministry will begin now that TA has moved out, and the fort does not have any defence related sensitive issues.

Thakre said he had also made up his mind to approach the state’s archaeological department to take over the fort, operate, maintain and open it for public like Daulatabad Fort and other places. “Archaeological department can keep a nominal entry fee and spend it on development, operation and maintenance,” he said.

A controversy erupted recently over the fort with activists staging demonstrations at Samvidhan Square alleging UMANG was planning a club house inside the fort. However, UMANG clarified they are planning only to permit existing mess services to ex-servicemen.

BJP city president Pravin Datke said the defence ministry under Parrikar had given consent to open the fort for public on Saturdays and Sundays. “Defence ministry was positive for water fountain cum cascade proposed by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) inside the fort facing Morris College T-point. The fort has historical significance due to battles, martyrs and stay of Mahatma Gandhi. It also is a big part of the city’s history. It is very important to open it for public so the next generation has knowledge about our history and importance of city. Also, city does not have fort related tourism spots,” he said.

Even the Heritage Conservation Committee feels the fort should be opened for the public. Member and architect Ashok Mokha said there is no significance and meaning of heritage structure if it is closed for people. “Heritage structure will lose its character and deteriorate if not in regular maintenance. It is unfortunate that we have to teach students about Sitabuldi Fort on paper despite it being situated right in the middle of the city. Even walking tracks and gardens can come up around the fort,” he said.

At the same time, retired TA personnel and some activists are demanding bringing back of 118 TA to Sitabuldi Fort instead of keeping it under UMANG.

The demand for opening fort for public had first been made in 2002. The then MP Vilas Muttemwar had raised the issue in Parliament in 2002 and 2007.

Lal is survived by his mother, wife and three children (two daughters and a son). “We have not informed his mother about his death. His father had passed away some 10 years ago and he was the eldest in the family,” said Shekhawat.

The villagers have demanded ‘martyr’ status for him. They also demanded that the government school in Tihawali should be named after Lal. Youths gathered at Tihawali gram panchayat after they recieved the news.

The villagers demanded that the state and the Centre should announce benefits that are given to a martyr. The villagers are also demanding that Lal should be consigned to flames with full state honours.

“Almost each and every house has a policemen or an army men in the village,” said Sunil Chaudhary, a social worker of Tihawali village.

Police said the deceased Niraj Kumar Mishra (40) was a resident of Malak Har Har and had been missing since Saturday evening. His family last saw him leaving home to purchase medicines on Saturday. Police recovered his body on Monday morning.

“Mishra and Patel were at loggerheads over a property dispute, which eventually led to the former’s murder,” said SSP (Allahabad) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj. The accused Vipul Patel had a dispute with Mishra over a piece of property worth Rs 2 lakh. “The accused told the police that the two had entered into an agreement over an year ago.

Fed up of Mishra’s antics, Patel hatched a plan to kill him.

On Saturday evening, the accused called Mishra and told him to come to his field to have a few drinks. Patel’s field is located in Atrampur in Bahoripur village. The accused then asked the property broker to fetch an item for him. As soon as Mishra turned, Patel shot him. The accused later buried the body i his own field.

Meanwhile, when Mishra did not turn up till late night and his mobile phone was switched off, his family approached the police on Saturday evening.

The police then approached the chemist, where Mishra went to. The shop’s owner told the police that the victim had come to his shop along with an unidentified youth. Police later came to know that Mishra was last seen with Vipul. He was spotted riding pillion with the latter on his motorcycle to an unidentified location.

Police then arrested Patel and recovered Mishra’s body.

Allahabad: A day after they kidnapped a minor boy from a primary school, a 21-year-old youth and his aide were arrested following an encounter with the police near Auwar Bridge Road in Pratapgarh on Monday.

The accused were identified as Anirudh and Kallo alias Suraj (20). Two of their aides are currently absconding. While Anirudh is a resident of Johlapur, Kallo is native to Sipah Maheri.

According to police, Ritesh Kumar (10) was kidnapped by four men on Sunday afternoon in Sipah Maheri village, under Kotwali police station, while he was playing cricket. The boy is a student of class III and was playing on the premises of a primary school in the village.

Police said that after kidnapping the boy, the accused sought a ransom of Rs 10 lakh from the boy’s father Ram Sundar Pal, a retired Indian Railways employee.

SP (Pratapgarh) Abhishek Singh said, “Pal approached the police and a case under sections 364 (A) of the Indian Penal Code was registered. We were able to trace the whereabouts of two of the accused and intercepted their bike near Auwar Bridge Road.”

The accused had the child with them at the time of the encounter and where moving to a different hideout when the police started chasing them.

“When the police challenged the kidnappers, they opened fire. Anirudh was injured in the exchange of fire. We were able to rescue the child safely,” said the SP.

During interrogation, Kalloo told the police that he knew Ritesh well. “The two went to the primary school and lured the child on the pretext of gifting him a new ball,” Singh said.

The accused convinced the child to accompany them and took him to a hideout on their motorcycle. They first took Ritesh to Gajehara forest and then decided to relocate to another hideout in Antoo area.

The accused used a stolen mobile phone to make the ransom call. Police said that Anirudh was shot in his left leg and is undergoing treatment at the district hospital.

Police also seized a 0.32 bore country-made pistol, two live cartridges, a motorcycle and a mobile phone from them. Police have also been looking for two of their aides — Ritik and Shiv Pujan Saroj, both residents of Raniganj.

MADIKERI/HUBBALLI: A day after Karnataka agriculture minister BC Patil sought a law that enables authorities ""to shoot at sight"" those chanting pro-Pakistan slogans, Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan (BJP) echoed his words on Monday. After inaugurating a new building at Somwarpet Government Primary School, Ranjan said: ""Shoot down people who raise pro-Pakistan slogans.""

Amid these developments, fresh trouble brewed elsewhere in the state when the walls of a government higher primary school on the outskirts of Hubballi in Karnataka were on Monday morning found scribbled with 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans. Villagers staged a protest and demanded that the miscreants be promptly arrested.

The statements by the minister and the MLA come in the wake of pro-Pakistan slogans raised by Amulya Leona Noronha , 19, during an anti-CAA event in Bengaluru last week.

Ranjan told the students: ""Every citizen must protect and preserve the nation's rich culture. However, many are involved in anti-national activities. These people are using resources, including food and water, provided by our country and then raising slogans against the nation. Such people must be shot down immediately. They must be exiled and sent to Pakistan. No advocate must fight their cases in court.""

Rajiv Kumar, SHO, Binawar police station, said, “On the complaint of the boy’s family, an FIR was lodged against Mohit under IPC sections 377 (unnatural offence), 511 (attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) and provisions of the POCSO Act.”

Chandrapur: Almost a week after detaining 26 trucks found unloading subsidized coal at a private depot, the local crime branch registered offence at Ghugus police station on Monday evening.

LCB team led by police inspector OG Kokate had detained the trucks at a private coal depot near Nagada village. The coal was allocated by Maharashtra State Mining Corporation (MSMC) at subsidized rate to seven different small-scale industries.

Four teams were sent to the industries for verification of records regarding lifting of subsidized coal, stock and usage. Two companies whose coal was detained were found closed.

Offence was filed against one of the closed industries, its transporter and the depot owner. Ghugus police station PI Rahul Ghangurde confirmed this.

Sources said MSMC allocates a monthly quota of thousands of tonnes of coal to around 250 private industries. Companies are supposed to lift their quota from the designated mine. It is suspected that some of these companies could be selling their quota of coal in the open market at higher rates with the help of coal mafia.

Kokate could not be reached for his comment.

Lucknow: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found discrepancies in mining and execution of excise policy causing a consolidated loss of over Rs 2,300 crore to the state exchequer between 2012 and 2017.

The CAG report, which was tabled in the UP assembly on Monday, categorically took into account the period when the Samajwadi Party was in power.

According to the report, the state government erred on a payment of around Rs 698 crore on recovery of value of minerals extracted through mining. The report said that on various instances, the state government conducted mining without taking mandatory permission of the environment department causing a loss of over Rs 100 crore.

Likewise, the UP government also faltered in recovering royalty brick kilns and allowing them to operate without taking due environmental permission. The CAG noted that the state government incurred a loss of around Rs 150 crore under the two heads.

The chief auditor has also indicted the then state government for not taking license fee during a set period and not acting against the defaulters, causing a revenue loss of around Rs 1391 crore. Similarly, the state government has also been found erring on recovering of licence while allowing them to operate. This caused a loss of around Rs 38 crore to the state exchequer over a period of five years.

Similarly, the state government has also been found faltering in recovering licence fee from model shops causing a revenue loss of around Rs 10 crore.

Kanpur: A 20-year-old girl, student of Dayanand Girls’ College, committed suicide by hanging herself with the ceiling in her room at MG Hostel in the Civil Lines area of the city on late Sunday night.

The deceased, identified as Ishita Mishra, was a native of Lakhimpur Kheri district. She was in B.Sc second year at Dayanand Girls’ College in Civil Lines.

Police said that they found a suicide note from the room in which she had apologised to her parents over some issue. The incident came to light when the girls staying in adjacent rooms found her room locked from inside. They later informed the warden who saw her hanging from a ventilation window of her room.

He immediately alerted the Kotwali police which rushed to the spot and broke open the door.

The incident has sent shockwaves in the hostel.

According to inspector Kotwali, Sanjiv Kant Mishra, the deceased student was alone in her hostel room.

“A friend had made a call on her mobile phone on late Sunday night. When she didn’t respond, her friend asked the other hostel inmates staying in the adjacent room to check her room. When other girls of the hostel came, they found her room bolted from inside. When repeated knocks failed to get any response, they informed the hostel warden who peeped through the ventilation window and found her hanging. Immediately, her body was brought down and after preliminary investigations by the police and forensic experts, was shifted to the mortuary for the postmortem examination,” the inspector said and added, “Her parents have been informed about the incident.”

While Bharadwaj represents Greater Kailash, Balyan is the MLA of Uttam Nagar.Some MLAs even shouted “Jai Bajrangbali” when Bharadwaj took oath. Later he said, “It is up to an MLA to take oath in the name of the God of his choice. I decided to take oath in the name of Lord Hanuman, an incarnation of God.” He ended his oath with a “Jai Hind”.A few BJP MLAs, however, alleged that Bharadwaj’s oath was a diversion from the dignity of the House procedure. “The assembly is a place to solve the problems of the people of Delhi, it is not a religious place. That is why I objected to it,” Gandhi Nagar MLA Anil Bajpai said later.Taking a dig at BJP, Bharadwaj tweeted, “Why is BJP objecting to the name of Lord Hanuman?

145,['25/02/2020'],Puducherry: Nigerian youth held for fixing PIN-capturing device at ATM,"This story is from February 25, 2020

PUDUCHERRY: The Puducherry police arrested a Nigerian on Friday on charges of fixing a skimmer and a camera to record PIN at an ATM of a nationalized bank.

Jasher Celestine, 28, from Nigeria, has been staying at Mambakkam in Chennai for the past three years, police said. Police have launched a search for Miller Aleksandrov Hristov of Bulgaria and Milton Vladimir Cornel Zambrano of Venezuela, Jasher’s accomplices in the crime.

Senior superintendent of police (law and order) Rahul Alwal said Jasher had fixed a PIN-capturing device to the ATM and added he might have planned to install a skimmer later. “The fraudsters fixed PIN-capturing devices above the ATM keypads and skimmers near the card slots. The device has a camera and records PINs keyed in by unsuspecting customers while the skimmer collected the card details. The video and card details got stored in a memory card. They removed the devices later and made duplicate debi’, credit cards with the stolen details using a magnetic strip writer. They then siphoned money from the victims’ bank accounts,” said Alwal. He said two gangs worked together in such crimes. “One gang collects PINs and details of the cards and sells the information to other gang over the Darknet. The other gang makes bogus cards with stolen card details and steals the money,” he said.

Alwal said Jasher mainly collected card details and passed the info to Miller and Milton, who operate internationally. “The absconding suspects belong to an international gang that makes bogus cards. The two used to visit Jasher often to collect card details. We have sent their photos to the respective countries to nab them,” he said.

The issue came to the light when the ATM coordinator lodged a complaint with the cybercrime cell stating that he found a PIN-capturing device fixed above the keypad during his routine supervision.

Jasher confessed to the crime. Police have booked the three under Sections 379 and 511 of IPC and Section 66 C and D of IT Act, 2000.

147,['25/02/2020'],Beyond the investigation: Rot in TNPSC runs deep,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Chennai: A series of scams have rocked the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission in recent years, the latest one being alleged irregularities in the conduct of Group IV exams held in 2019. Despite a number of investigations, malpractices continue.

The rot in the TNPSC had set in decades ago, said a senior bureaucrat. ""During the tenures of past chief ministers, recommendation calls used to go from the chief minister’s office to the commission’s chairman to clear certain candidates. Invariably, all of them used to get selected,"" said the official. Taking serious note of the malaise, MGR, when he was CM, asked his staff to suggest an upright person to be appointed as TNPSC chairman to clean up the commission. ""MGR’s condition was that the person should not even heed the CM’s recommendation. People suggested his own secretary T Lakshminarayanan be made the chairman. MGR did it and till Lakshminarayanan was heading the commission, only those with calibre got selected,"" said a bureaucrat who worked in MGR’s core team.

It is futile to blame and take action only against candidates for tainting the system. It is the duty of the chairman, secretary and controller to ensure the selection process is fair. Even TNPSC members are powerless. The framework of the commission is such that the authority is vested with the chairman, secretary and controller. But surprisingly, no top brass of the commission has landed in the police net despite half-a-dozen investigations being carried out since 2012. ""What action was taken against key officials in the past,"" asked the official. Former TNPSC chairman R Sellamuthu and the members of the commission during his tenure were the only ones who had to resign on charges of corruption in 2012. During vigilance searches on Sellamuthu’s premises, officials stumbled upon several documents relating to malpractices in selection.

A report sent by then member secretary of the commission T Udhayachandran to the TN chief secretary said the commission members had forced him to provide the selection list well in advance. When the secretary refused to part with the selection list, the chairman, allegedly, sent circulars to the commission staff to bypass the secretary and deal with the members directly. Based on Udhayachandran’s letter, the DVAC raided the premises of the chairman and other members.

The commission handles recruitment of four categories of government staff. Under Group I, it recruits deputy collectors, deputy superintendents of police and assistant commissioners of commercial tax. Under Group II, it recruits deputy commercial tax officer, municipal commissioners, junior employment officers, sub-registrars and assistant inspectors of labour. Under Group II-A it recruits assistants in revenue administration in various departments, personal clerks, typists in legislative assembly and accountants in treasuries. And under Group IV it recruits junior assistants, village administrative officers, clerks and typists. Government recruitment being a sensitive task, when the commission’s credibility comes under a cloud, the integrity of its officials and the candidates it has recruited also become suspect.

A retired government official said integrity of the authority and fear of punitive action are crucial for the commission to regain its stature. ""Only when T N Seshan assumed office as election commissioner, did anyone take note of the commission’s existence. Till then, it was an agency at the mercy of the government. Seshan earned respect for the commission by exercising the powers vested with the commission,"" he said, adding that the state needs someone like him to head the TNPSC.

Though a chairman is posted for a six-year term, the upper age limit is 62 years. Since most people get the assignment post retirement from government service or closer to their retirement, most chairmen in recent years have served only for 1.5 years to 2 years. A person takes almost a year to understand the functioning of the commission. Hence, short terms for the commission’s chairman and its members hardly serve any purpose. A major cause for concern is that most people are appointed members and as chairman of the commission owing to their proximity to political executives.

So far, major malpractices have been reported in Group II-A and Group IV recruitment, for which there are only written examinations. Even in Group I selection process, there is very little scope for manipulation in the interview, because a candidate cannot be given less than 45 and more than 75 out of 100 marks for the interview. Hence, if manipulation happens it is in the written examination, said a former member of the commission.

Pilibhit: Following orders of the court of the chief judicial magistrate, the Madhotanda police on Sunday night booked six persons, including a woman , for allegedly murdering a 65-year-old farmer one year ago.

According to the deceased’s son, his father Jarnail Singh had married Preet Kaur, 45, two years ago. The couple lived in Bamanpur locality in Puranpur city under Puranpur Kotwali police station. Jairnal’s son, Satnam Singh, is a resident of Kalinagar under Madhotanda police station. Jairnal died on April 30.

It was while Satnam was going through his father’s papers after his death that he came across a letter written by the latter in which he accused Preet of trying to usurp his property. Her actual name was Leelawati and she hailed from Dehradun.

Satnam also learnt that Preet had married three other times. She had allegedly changed her name to Anita Sharma to marry one Prakash Sharma. She called herself Leela Khatri to marry one Vijay Khatri. Then , she married one Gurvinder Singh of Purvi village in Puranpur. She allegedly duped all the three men of their valuables before marrying his father, he claimed.

His father’s letter revealed that Preet was trying to poison him and she had forced him to sign the property papers in her name. She was helped by five others to do so, alleged Satnam.

When Satnam challenged his father’s will in court in August 2019, Preet and her accomplices -- Sajjan Singh, Soni, Rana, Gopi and an unidentified man -- barged into his house and assaulted him.

Satnam claimed that his father had been killed by Preet and her accomplices. But when he approached the concerned police station, no one paid any heed to his complaint. It was only after the court order that an FIR was registered against Preet and others.

Nagpur: MSEDCL has filed a petition in Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) urging the Commission not to levy any penalty on it for failing to meet renewable energy targets, till 2022-23. The discom has claimed that despite repeated efforts by MSEDCL to procure power through renewable energy sources but was not receiving responses from the bidders.

MSEDCL had earlier Commission’s proposal to revise the solar target to 13.5% by 2024-25 from the present 2.5%. The discom contended that it was quite stiff and that despite best efforts, it would not be able to achieve it. Total solar capacity of 12,500MW would be required by 2024-25 to achieve the target against the present capacity of 4,200MW. The competitive bidding process to expand the capacity takes a lot of time and there were many other factors beyond its control, the discom had said.

Some weeks ago the company had floated tenders for buying 1,350MW with a cap of Rs3.15 per unit but got bids for only 5MW. The discom increased the maximum price to attract producers. It increased the cap to Rs3.30 per unit and floated the tender again. MSEDCL has through this petition urged MERC to revise the ceiling tariff rate for solar projects with capacity 2 to 10MW at 11 kV level. The hearing on this petition was slated to be held on February 18 put has been postponed indefinitely.

On one hand, MSEDCL is unable to meet its solar target and on the other, it is opposing solar rooftop consumers by proposing an astronomical grid support charge (GSC).

Amaravati/Tirupati: YSRC leader and Bapatla MP Nandigam Suresh on Monday accused TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu of orchestrating attacks on him and called for his arrest. Stating that Naidu has a history of vindictive politics, Suresh said the TDP leadership is jittery after the state government set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe irregularities in land pooling and insider trading.

“Naidu has been using women cadres as shield while his party workers carry out attacks on YSRC leaders. Unless Naidu and his son (Nara) Lokesh are arrested, the sponsored agitations, pre-meditated attacks would not end. It’s high time the misplaced arrogance of Naidu is brought under control,” said Suresh.

He said a 300-strong mob was at the police station by the time he reached there to lodge the complaint. “If elected representatives are stopped and attacked by mobs, chilli powder is sprayed, filthy language is used, it is clear that Naidu is the chief conspirator,” he alleged, while adding that those involved in insider trading were also sponsoring the attacks. “Naidu is concerned only about his community and their real estate business.”

Suresh also showed a video of the attack in which the mob is shouting and spraying chilli powder on the MP and his staff while shouting pro-Amaravati and pro-Naidu slogans. “I am being repeatedly targeted because I am a Dalit. Naidu might be thinking that only his community should rule the state and Dalits should serve them. Some people from the US are also calling me up late in the night and abusing me with filthy language,” he alleged.

Varla Ramaiah, TDP politburo member and Dalit leader, condemned Suresh’s allegations. “The YSRC is using Suresh as a puppet to implicate Amaravati farmers in false cases. Why is the Bapatla MP frequently touring Amaravati which is not even part of his constituency?” Ramaiah asked.

Meanwhile, Naidu accused chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy of stalling development in the state. “The situation is so grave that people are unable to raise their voice against the government which is registering fake cases against anyone opposing it,” he said at a public meeting in Kuppam, his home constituency where he reached on Monday as part of his ‘Praja Chaitanya Yatra’.

“We are not against the development of Visakhapatnam. But if the government has such an intention why is it that Adani and Lulu groups have backed away from their investment plans?” Naidu asked. He also slammed the government for setting up a SIT to probe the alleged misdeeds of TDP government. ”A SIT can be appointed to probe a particular issue, not all issues over the last five years. This decision will send wrong message to investors. The state has already lost about Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the last nine months. Now many more investors will go back.”

Telangana BJP state president K Laxman

HYDERABAD: The Telangana unit of Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is all set to make some structural changes by appointing a president as well as a working president, on the lines of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC). The move comes in the backdrop of party’s top brass deciding to give equal responsibilities to both old timers and juniors.

While the prime contenders for the post of working president are Jitendar Reddy and DK Aruna , the latter is expected to be made the working president with the support of national leaders. “Since Aruna had strong support from some of our national leaders and comes from the Reddy community, she may have better chances of being appointed as working president,” top sources said. They added that the proposal has come from party president JP Nadda .

For the post of the state unit chief, central observers on Monday took feedback on six names.

Two sitting MPs D Arvind and Bandi Sanjay are eyeing the post, along with current president K Laxman . Apart from these senior leaders, Perala Sekhar, a former TRS leader is also in the race.

Though Karim Nagar MP Bandi Sanjay was not keen on contesting for the post initially, he is seeking support from party bigwigs now. “The main contenders are Bandi Sanjay and current president K Laxman. Interestingly, both belong to Munnuru Kapu community,” said a top leader.

The process to take opinions of more than 40 senior leaders on the contestants began at 11 am and continued till 5 in the evening. K Laxman has reportedly received the support of many. “While Sanjay had the support of the RSS, it seems like K Laxman will be announced as the party chief,” sources said.

The final announcement is expected to be made within a week.

Indore: Miscreants broke into a house at Dravid Nagar in Annapurna late on Saturday and made away with cash and jewellery worth lakhs .

Annapurna police said that the exact worth of stolen items will be ascertained once the family returns from Pune.

The incident took place at the house of 60-year-old Komal Porwal, who used to work at a shop in the cloth market.

The matter came to fore when a neighbour found his door locked from outside.

“We were suspicious that this might be done by some thief and since we knew that Porwal was not at home, we went to check and found that the lock was broken and the house was ransacked,” a neighbour Ajit Jain told TOI.

Jain and other neighbours informed police about the incident.

Annapurna police station in charge Satish Dwivedi said that they were looking at the CCTV footages of nearby areas.

Porwal had gone to Pune to stay with his son who lives there. He stays with his wife and often goes to Pune. Someone must have kept an eye on his movements, said neighbours.

Nagpur: Transporting rods, pipes, bamboo and other goods protruding out of a vehicle’s body is illegal. Yet, the traffic police allow such vehicles to ply freely. At the most a challan is issued. The vehicle is not stopped from further journey as should be the case.

On Monday morning, traffic police deployed at Japanese Garden Square caught a vehicle with iron frames and tin sheets jutting out of it. Two cops issued a challan to the driver but allowed him take his vehicle. The iron frames were jutting from both front and rear sides. As per rules, material should be confined within the body of vehicle and there should be a red sign on the back to alert other motorists. This vehicle had no such sign.

As per Motor Vehicles Act , 1988, it is a punishable offence under Section 190 (2), with a fine up to Rs2,000 and provision to detain the vehicle too. Sadar zone traffic police issued a challan for Rs200 only.

Speaking to TOI, the cop admitted vehicles transporting material should not be allowed to ply until the goods are unloaded. He could not explain why he allowed the vehicle to move on without unloading the goods. Drivers were taking advantage of this practice as the traffic police cannot fine them again the same day for the same offence.

TOI also found a cycle rickshaw carrying bamboo in similar way crossing busy Bole Petrol Pump Square on Amravati Road. The rickshaw puller also jumped the red signal.

Deputy commissioner Chinmay Pandit maintained the traffic policemen always took action against such vehicles. In 2019, they penalized 63,514 vehicles for either loading goods exceeding the height of the vehicles or having goods jutting out.

Traffic activists say this is not enough. Allowing drivers to transport goods in such an unsafe way, besides being a threat to other road users especially two-wheeler riders, is also contempt of apex court’s order.

Pandit admitted such vehicles should not be allowed to ply and assured to look into the matter.

Bareilly: Four persons were arrested in Bahedi area of Bareilly on Monday for trying to smuggle a red sand boa snake to Nepal. The reptile is commonly referred to as two-headed snake due to the shape of its tail.

The accused who were travelling in a sedan were arrested near Bahedi bus stand on the basis of a tip-off. The accused were planning to sell the red sand boa a dealer in Nepal who would have then smuggled it to China. This non-venomous snake is in great demand in China for preparing medicines. Its skin is used for preparing handbags, wallets and jackets. Each snake fetches a price ranging between Rs 5-25 lakh. In UP, this snake is commonly found in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich districts.

The accused arrested were identified as Monis Ali, Meharbaan, Inshtiaq Ahmad and Akhlaq Ahmad. Monis and Meharbaan belong to Moradabad district and had caught the snake from a forest area in terai region with the help of the other two.

Pankaj Pant, SHO of Bahedi police station, told TOI, “The forest department has been informed about the recovery of this endangered snake while an FIR has been filed against the accused under provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and 207 Motor Vehicle Act. The rescued snake weighs nearly 1,700 gm and was expected to fetch a price not less than Rs 10 lakh in Nepal. The accused also told us that the price of the snake depends upon its age and weight.”

CHENNAI: Anti-CAA protestors cannot be called ""anti-nationals"" as they are exercising their democratic rights to express their views, BJP national youth wing vice-president A P Muruganandam said on Monday, in a sharp deviation from the line towed by his seniors in the party.

Muruganandam, 44, who has been a BJP member for more than two decades, told TOI , ""Calling the anti-CAA protesters as anti-nationals is unfair and not right. They are exercising their democratic rights to air their views. But I will say that the persons, who are misusing the platform of anti-CAA protests to raise slogans against India are anti-nationals.""

On whether Tamil Nadu - historically a Dravidian land - is a fertile land for BJP and its Hindutva politics, he said Tamil Nadu is the land of temples, but what is happening in the state is quite in contrary to that. ""The Dravidian parties were defaming Hindu religion and some people were enjoying it. But, that generation is gone. People now want growth and employment.""

Asked if the absence of a state president impacted the party, Muruganandam said, ""The appointment [of a state president] will give momentum to the party's political activities. But the absence has not affected the party in anyway... The party is working hard and reaching out to more people. The party's popularity is growing.""

KT Rama Rao

HYDERABAD: Stressing that the TRS government is committed to transforming towns, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said Pattana Pragati had been taken up to not only bring an awareness among people on sanitation and greenery but also on the new Municipalities Act.

Urging people to take an example out of Indore where residents keep their surroundings and roads clean, KTR said people, elected representatives and officials have equal responsibilities in this endeavour. The minister kicked off the 10-day Pattana Pragati programme in Mahbubnagar along with district minister V Srinivas Goud on Monday. KTR said segregation of wet and dry waste was important and the sanitation staff would not collect waste unless it was cleaned. Pattana Pragati is being conducted in all 141 municipalities and 3,456 wards in Telangana.

“Mahbubnagar has 1.80 lakh population and it is not possible for just 600 sanitation staff to clean the entire town. Every citizen has to do his or her bit to keep the town clean. Ward members should come up with a ward-level sanitation plan,” KTR said while addressing the people. He later interacted with people and inaugurated various developmental works.

KTR said an innovative programme ‘Parichayam’ was taken up in Hyderabad by involving residents and sanitation staff, which had yielded a good result. Talking about Sircilla experiment, the minister said MEPMA members had been earning Rs3 lakh a month by segregating wet and dry waste and compost and wanted officials to replicate it in Mahbubnagar too.

Meanwhile, chief secretary Somesh Kumar and principal secretary of municipal administration Arvind Kumar participated in Pattana Pragati at Ibrahimpatnam.

Rampur: Additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail petitions of Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan, his wife Tanzeen Fatimah and their son Abdullah Azam in connection with a forgery case.

The accused have been chargessheeted under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

On January 3, 2019, local BJP leader Akash Saxena had lodged a complaint against the trio, alleging that Azam and his wife helped their son in obtaining two fake birth certificates — one from Lucknow and another from Rampur — following which an FIR was registered at the Ganj kotwali.

Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Ram Autar Saini told TOI, “The court rejected the anticipatory bail applications of Azam, his wife and son in three separate cases related to Abdullah’s date of birth certificates, PAN cards and passport.”

“Azam was, however, granted bail in a case related to enemy property. The court, meanwhile, ordered the MP to surrender his passport to the police, but added that Azam could travel abroad after seeking its permission,” added the ADGC.

A local court had declared the trio as “absconders” and issued non-bailable warrants against them after they failed to appear before it.

Nagpur: In a major raid, the authorities seized banned plastic items worth Rs1.5 lakh on Monday.

Acting on a tip-off, the crime branch unit 4 of city police laid a trap at Chinchbhavan on Wardha Road, where a vehicle was transporting around 1,000 kilograms of banned polythene bags. The team led by police sub-inspector PS Mohekar intercepted the vehicle.

According to police officials, Wardha Road has turned into a hotspot for illegal transportation of banned plastic items. Interestingly, the seized vehicle and arrested accused are all from Wardha.

The two arrested are 30-year-old Ravi Adani and 32-year-old driver Girish Adani. As per the law, police also imposed a fine of Rs5,000 on them.

The police handed over the seized plastic to the Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s Nehru Nagar zone. This is the first time that the city police have taken action against banned plastic. Earlier, such raids were carried out by the NDS and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).

In March last year, MPCB along with other civic authorities had seized around 3,500kg of banned plastic items. The consignment was transported to the city from Gujarat and contained very thin plastic bags below 20 microns. In October 2018, the authorities had seized 2,385kg of banned goods valued at over Rs10 lakh

MPCB has reportedly shut down all manufacturing units of the banned bags in the state.

167,['25/02/2020'],Thiruvallam traffic chaos: Police pass the bucks to NHAI,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Fed up by the traffic chaos at Thiruvallam Junction where accidents have become a daily affair, the police have sent a letter to the National Highway Authority of India ( NHAI ) to take necessary rectification measures.

The NHAI, meanwhile, is planning to direct the consultant of Kazhakkoottam–Mukkola national highway project to prepare a report suggesting measures to manage the traffic issues at Thiruvallam.

Though NHAI constructed a bridge here parallel to the old bridge to ease traffic, vehicles from Poonkulam-Venganoor Road are defying the one-way rule to take the Ambalathara route to reach East Fort easily. Also, many of the vehicles coming from Kovalam side and heading to East Fort too take the wrong way.

In the letter sent last week, DCP (law and order) R Karuppasamy has asked NHAI to take necessary measures such as erecting caution boards, traffic signs and signal system at Thiruvallam to manage the traffic situation.

But, sources in NHAI said that caution boards and signal systems are not a solution to the traffic issues in the stretch. “The consultants of the project will be asked to prepare a detailed report to resolve the issues at Thiruvallam,” said sources in NHAI.

Traffic assistant commissioner (south) S Zulfikar said that the stretch is a major headache for the department. “We have deployed two traffic police officers to manage traffic in the area. Accidents are common, though fatal accidents are rare,” he said.

Zulfikar said that the traffic police and NHAI will conduct a joint inspection to find a solution. “We think that construction of a service bridge could be a solution to the issue. A joint inspection will be held this week or after the Attukal Pongala,” he said.

When NHAI constructed an additional bridge parallel to the old Thiruvallam Bridge, a service bridge was not part of the design. As per NHAI’s design, vehicles coming from Poonkulam-Venganoor side should cross the national highway at the old Thiruvallam Junction (in front of Archana Royal Park Hotel) and proceed through the new Thiruvallam bridge to Kazhakkoottam side. Those vehicles which are heading to East Fort should take a turn at the median opening at Kumarichanta. However, the vehicles are taking the easier, but dangerous route.

Though the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac) has submitted a report to traffic (south), the department has not reviewed it. The Natpac, in its report, has suggested construction of a 7.5-metre-wide flyover connecting main carriageway of the national highway and Ambalathara Road to avoid traffic congestion.

KOCHI: A makeshift godown near Ernakulam South railway station used for storing stationery items was gutted in a major fire on Monday. The fire started around 11.15am. Around nine firefighting units from seven stations jointly doused the fire by 12.30pm. Officials said the fire broke out on the terrace of the two-storey building that houses A3 Associates, a dealer of stationery items. This floor was illegally turned into a godown by covering its top and sides with metal sheets. A short circuit is believed to have sparked the blaze.

“The fire was a major one and its intensity could have been much worse had it gone unnoticed. There were several buildings adjacent but we could contain the fire on the terrace itself before it spread to other floors. The lane where the building is located is not wide enough for the fire tenders so we had to use connected hoses to reach the top floor,” Gogy J S, district fire officer, Ernakulam.

According to officials, the fire was first noticed by neighbouring residents even though the firm’s staffs were present on the ground floor during that time. Though they tried to douse the flames using a fire extinguisher, it proved inadequate and they alerted the fire and rescue officials who reached the spot within 15 minutes. Units from Gandhinagar , Eloor, Thrikkakara, Tripunithura, Aluva, Club Road and Mattancherry fire stations took part in the operation.

The illegal modifications using metal sheets hindered the operation as officials found it impossible to enter the floor. Thick smoke billowed as the fire gutted tonnes of papers, crayons, colour pens and pencils along with bundles of Fevicol packets making it difficult for the officials to see and breathe. They had to break the sheets to pump water into the burning goods. The building is reportedly owned by Johnson C Abraham, executive director of Chavara Matrimony.

HYDERABAD: To counter the Telangana government’s ongoing ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programme, Congress on Monday launched ‘Patnam Ghosha’ (plight of urban dwellers), to “expose the ruling TRS ’ failure in delivering two-bed room houses to the homeless”.

Telangana Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP, A Revanth Reddy , who launched ‘Patnam Ghosha from Alwal in his Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency, interacted with the poor and asked them to list out the problems being faced by them.

“I will collect the list of problems being faced by the people in urban areas, and submit it to the government. I will also release money from the MPLAD funds for construction of toilets,” he told the people.

Stating that the KCR government had spent over Rs 8 lakh crore in the past five to six years (accumulated state budget of the past five years), Revanth said the CM had got a palatial building ‘Pragathi Bhavan’ constructed for himself. “However, KCR has not released funds to complete 2-BHK project because the homeless poor are not his priority.”

On distribution of government land to the poor, Revanth said a large chunk of land was available in survey number 537 in Alwal. He called tahsildar (MRO) on the phone and directed him to prepare a note for distribution of the government land to the homeless poor.

V Hanumantha Rao

HYDERABAD: A delegation of leaders led by former MP and AICC secretary V Hanumantha Rao on Monday submitted a letter to chief secretary Somesh Kumar, urging him to see that Ambedkar statue is reinstalled at Panjagutta crossroads.

In the letter, Rao said members of political parties, Ambedkar welfare associations and civil society groups would resort to dharnas and protests from March 2 if the government fails to reinstall the statue by February 29. Hanumantha Rao later told reporters that police, GHMC officials and the TRS government had insulted Ambedkar and crores of his followers by removing his statue and dumping it in a garbage yard.

He said local youth from Jai Bheem group of Panjagutta had installed the statue at Panjagutta crossroads on the night of April 12, 2019. “The statue was later removed, broken and thrown in the garbage yard at Jawahar Nagar,” he said.

The incident caused anguished followers of Ambedkar and even members of political parties held protests. The police detained protesters. “Even I was taken into police custody for staging a dharna demanding reinstallation of Ambedkar statue at the same spot,” he said.

However, officials said there was no permission to install the statue. Hence, it was removed.

171,['25/02/2020'],"Anti-CAA protesters are not anti-nationals, says TN BJP leader","This story is from February 25, 2020

A BJP member for more than two decades and having held posts at the state and national level, A P Muruganandam, 44, is one of the front runners for the post of the party’s Tamil Nadu unit president. In an interview to TOI, the BJP national youth wing vice-president takes a different line from his seniors, who have dubbed the anti-CAA protesters anti-nationals

Q: Senior BJP leaders have described the anti-CAA protesters anti-nationals. How do you react to this?BJP leaders would have been quoted in a different context. My view is anti-CAA protesters have the right to express their views and calling them anti-nationals is not right. But using this platform to raise anti-India slogans will be not acceptable.

Q: Is TN, a Dravidian land, a fertile ground for the BJP and its Hindutva politics?

Tamil Nadu is the land of temples. But the Dravidian parties were defaming Hindu religion and its rituals and some people were enjoying it. That generation is gone. People now want growth and employment. If they (the DMK and its allies) continue their same old game, it will boomerang. The victory of our party’s candidate, who contested the panchayat councillor’s post in M Karunanidhi’s native place Tiruvarur, is a sign of the growth of the BJP in the state.

Q: Is the BJP equipped to counter protests and campaigns by the DMK and its allies against the Centre over various issues, including hydrocarbon projects?

The DMK wants a villain for their fake campaign. Hence they are portraying the BJP as the villain. We will carry out a door-to-door campaign to dispel this perception and take the BJP government’s welfare schemes to the public. For instance, the Centre had saved more than Rs27,000 crore by direct transfer of funds to beneficiaries of welfare schemes. It is equal to the fund allocated for the health sector.

Q: Has the absence of a state president impacted the political activities of the party? Why the delay in appointing a new president?

The appointment of a state president will give momentum to the party’s political activities. But absence of the state chief has not affected the party in anyway as the organisational activities are going on. If we see a duck swimming, we think it is sailing smooth, but it paddles hard underwater. Similarly, the party is working hard and reaching out to more people. The party’s popularity has also been growing after Prime Minister Modi’s Mamallapuram visit.

Q: Does the BJP have the resource and cadre base in TN to prove their strength in the coming elections?

After the demise of charismatic leaders, the DMK and other Dravidian parties are banking on their party symbols. People in several parts of the state believe they are voting for former CM Karunanidhi by choosing the ‘rising sun’ symbol. It is same with other parties too. So, we are taking up intensive campaigns to take ‘lotus’ symbol to everyone and making a point that the symbol stands for the country’s growth. In the days to come, the ‘lotus’ symbol will be seen everywhere.

Q: If Rajinikanth launches his political party and decides to go alone, will he take away the BJP’s vote bank in the state?

Actor Rajinikanth and the BJP have more or less the same Hindutva ideology. But it will not harm our prospects in any way as we have a core vote bank. Besides, we will campaign to enhance the voting percentage.

Agra: Taking US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania on a tour of the Taj Mahal was a “lifetime's dream come true"", 36-year-old guide Nitin Singh told TOI on Monday.

Singh, who has spent 12 years in the profession and has a license from the department of tourism, was selected for the job after the US embassy had interviewed over 50 guides. Singh has guided several other dignitaries including prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, Canadian premier Justin Trudeau and president of France Emmanuel Macron.

“I could have asked for nothing more than this opportunity, and I thank god for it,” Singh said, describing Trump as an extremely “kind and lively person”. He added, ""I found him very friendly and jovial. He obliged everyone with selfies and photos. He did not say no to anyone.” Trump and his family spent more than an hour at the Taj Mahal. They reached the 17th century monument at about 4.40 pm, coming straight from Ahmedabad, and left around 6.04 pm.

Trump, the guide said, praised the monument's architecture, inlay and stone work, and also the double dome structure. The US president wrote on the visitor's book that “The Taj Mahal inspires awe, a timeless testament to the rich and diverse beauty of Indian culture! Thank you India”.

Trump and Melania asked Singh several questions. ""They said, 'Where did all this marble come from? Where were the workers and artisans brought from? What material was used for making the royal gate?',"" Singh recounted. ""They also wanted to know how the monument was being kept clean and what was the procedure for doing so"".

Singh said Trump was ""impressed"" by the story of Shahjahan and Mumtaz, ""but he felt bad that the emperor was imprisoned for eight years at the Agra Quila"".

Though Trump was with Melania, walking hand in hand through much part of the tour, he was joined by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner when they sat down to see the sunset. ""The president said he 'loved the monument' and added that after his visit many more Americans will come to see the Taj,"" Singh said.

GUWAHATI: Sharjeel Imam, the JNU student booked for sedition, has admitted during interrogation by Guwahati police that he met Assam Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal at his Delhi residence prior to his arrest to discuss the anti-CAA agitation, minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claimed on Monday.

“Not only Ajmal, he had been in touch with many people in Assam over phone. The police are investigating the matter. The state government is tracking developments related to his interrogation and the findings will be revealed from time to time,” Sarma said.

Ajmal is the chief of the All India United Democratic Front, which has 12 seats in the 126-member assembly. Brought to Guwahati for interrogation on February 20, Sharjeel was taken to a hospital here on Monday for a medical check-up after the court of the Kamrup chief judicial magistrate extended his police remand by another four days.

The JNU student was arrested in Bihar after several states filed complaints against him for allegedly inciting violence through his speeches. In one of several videos purportedly showing him making provocative speeches, he is heard saying that the “chicken’s neck” connecting the northeast with the rest of the country should be severed.

“Sharjeel was talking about separating Assam and the northeast from India. So, whoever was in touch with him should be investigated,” Assam BJP president Ranjeet Dass said.

Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi releases the Bihar Economic Survey 2019-20 in Patna on Monday

PATNA: The average growth rate of the state’s economy has been in double digits in the three fiscals from 2016-17 up to 2018-19. It was also reflected in the increased per capita income commensurate with the proportionally increased gross state domestic product (GSDP) during the same period, according to the state’s Economic Survey 2019-20 released on Monday.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi tabled the survey report in the state assembly and water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha in the legislative council on the opening day of the month-long Budget session of the state legislature. The report dealt with the achievements and perspectives of growth with respect to the 2018-19 fiscal.

The growth rate in the state’s economy at 2011-12 constant prices was 8.9% in 2016-17, 10.5% in 2017-18 and 10.5% in 2018-19. The growth figures at current prices for the corresponding fiscals were 13.6%, 14.8%, and 15%.

Later, outside the House, Modi said that the average growth rate of the state’s economy was “higher than the overall growth of the Indian economy” and stood at 10.53% at 2011-12 constant prices and 15.01% at current prices in 2018-19. “It has been achieved despite odds like floods and drought during the three-year period,” he added.

“The per capita income in Bihar increased from Rs21,750 in 2011-12 to Rs30,617 in 2018-19,” said the Economic Survey report. It, however, noted that the “Bihar has the lowest per capita income among the states” in the country, and it was at only 33.1% of the national average (Rs92,565) in 2018-19, implying that the state needed “extra push to increase its economic activity to converge towards the national average”.

The state’s GSDP was Rs5,57,490 crore at current prices and Rs3,94,350 crore at constant prices of 2011-12.

Modi said the main growth engines contributing to the state’s economy, each registering double digit growth rate, were air transport (36%), other services (20%), trade and repair services (17.6%), road transport (14%) and financial services (13.8%). However, the “potential” of the primary sector (land, agriculture and allied activities) had remained “untapped”.

He also said the government adhered to the norms of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, maintaining fiscal deficit of 2.68% of the GSDP. During 2018-19, revenue surplus remained at 1.34% and the outstanding public debt liability of the government was 32.34% of the GSDP. He said as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission for 2020-21, the state’s share in the central pool of taxes has increased from 9.67% to 10.06%.

The survey pointed out that maintaining the old trend, the revenue receipt grew by 12.2%, while the revenue expenditure increased by 21.7% in 2018-19 over the previous year. The receipt from the tax revenue at Rs1.03 lakh crore was 16.8% higher than the previous year.

Given the positive signals in the state’s revenue receipts, as well as tax and non-tax revenue receipts, the state’s capacity to repay public debt increased by 55.4% in 2018-19 over the previous year.

Accordingly, the repayment of public debt was to the tune of Rs7,230 crore in 2018-19, compared to Rs4,654 crore in 2017-18, the report noted, adding that the state’s total borrowing in 2018-19 was Rs18,668 crore, compared to Rs13,169 crore in 2017-18 and Rs21,577 crore in 2016-17.

TIRUPATI: Police arrested five touts for illegal sale of VIP darshan tickets in Tirumala on Monday.

Police arrested Ravi Kishore Reddy, a tout, and his accomplices identified as Damodaram, Janardhan, Jagadeeswara Reddy and Damodaram.

Seven touts identified as Nagaraju, Purushotham Reddy, Tirupati Reddy , Nagarjuna Reddy, Udaya Bhaskar Reddy , Tyagaraju and Nara Yoganand are absconding, said the police. One Town circle inspector Jaganmohan Reddy said the arrests were made after complaints about VIP break darshan tickets being sold at Rs 3,000 per ticket while the price is only Rs 500.

The touts gained access to elected representatives and TTD trust board members and obtained their recommendation letters for darshan at the temple. The police said the gang has been operating at Tirumala for eight years.

Reddy said the VIPs should verify people’s credentials before issuing recommendation letters. He asked devotees not to approach touts for darshan at the temple but avail the Srivani Trust donation linked VIP break darshan scheme launched by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams.

178,['25/02/2020'],Former intelligence chief helped son’s firm: Andhra Pradesh to CAT,"This story is from February 25, 2020

AB Venkateswara Rao

HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government on Monday informed the Central Administrative Tribunal ( CAT ) that former director-general (DG) (intelligence) AB Venkateswara Rao was suspended after an inquiry prima facie found him guilty of misconduct in the process to procure Aerostat and unmanned aerial vehicle or drones worth Rs 25 crore.

“The state’s action is in tune with Rule 3(1) of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules,” general administration department deputy secretary J Venkata Murali, said in a counter filed before the tribunal, adding “they (Aerostat and drones) are meant for anti-extremist and security operations.”

The tribunal, hearing a petition filed by Rao challenging his suspension, had earlier sought a counter from the state. The AP government, accordingly, filed its counter informing the bench, comprising CAT chairman Justice L Narasimha Reddy and BV Sudhakar, member (administration), that Rao’s actions had constituted serious misconduct and that disciplinary proceedings were pending against him. The CAT, which resumed hearing in the case on Monday, posted the case to March 6.

The state, in its counter, refuted the allegation that it was acting against Rao with malice. A preliminary probe, conducted by AP CID, brought out evidence about the grave misconduct exhibited by Rao in his capacity as then chief of intelligence department and the irregularities he had committed, which led to release of a purchase order in favour of an Israeli firm, RT Inflatable Objects Ltd, through the State Trading Corporation (STC).

It also said that Akasam Advanced System Company, whose CEO was Rao’s son Chetan Sai Krishna , was acting as a franchisee for Israeli firm RT Inflatable Objects. “Rao acted with a mala fide intention to ensure unlawful gain to his son,” the counter stated.

Several administrative, technical and procedural irregularities were committed during the process of procurement and, on noticing them, the purchase order issued by STC was cancelled and payment withheld, the GAD official said. The DGP has informed the AP government about the irregularities and requested the state to take disciplinary action against Rao apart from ordering further probe.

The technical specifications of Aerostat and UAV were scaled down and annual maintenance (AM) conditions were dropped during the final tender on the recommendations of a committee, which included IG, SIB, at its meeting on June 26, 2018. Rao attended the meeting and signed the minutes on behalf of the IG, SIB, which was a violation. “He violated Rule 4(3) (a) of AIS (Conduct) Rules, 1968,” it said, adding, “this was done only to ensure unlawful gain to Chetan Sai Krishna.”

“No demonstration of the equipment was carried out prior to the issue of purchase order and mandatory licences from the Union home ministry, Directorate General of Civil Aviation , Directorate General of Foreign Trade, department of telecom (DoT) etc., were not obtained prior to the issue of the purchase order, it said.

On account of these irregularities, the DGP had cancelled the purchase order given to RT Inflatable Objects on December 24, 2018. “Notwithstanding the cancellation, Rao was pursuing the matter and had even written a letter on March 28, 2019,” the state contended.

The DGP ordered a CID probe into the issue and, based on its report, Rao was suspended, the state said. Rao, in his rejoinder, said there was no monetary loss to the state because STC had returned the money on cancellation of the purchase order. “I was pursuing the matter even after cancellation only to improve the intelligence department,” he said. The CAT posted the case to March 6.

Agra: Aligarh police on Monday registered eight FIRs against more than 350 persons in connection with arsons and group clashes that took place in the city a day earlier.

Confirming this, Aligarh SSP Muniraj G said FIRs have been registered under various sections of IPC, including section 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion), 307 (attempt to murder) at Kotwali police station, where the violent clashes took place on Sunday evening. He added about 100 people have been identified and 40 of them are named in the FIR.

He further said the situation is still tense, but under control. No untoward incident was reported from any place during the day, but some women sat on a dharna at Jeevannagar area.

“We are maintaining a tight vigil in the city and things will return back to normal soon,” the SSP said, adding that the police are also initiating confidence-building measures with the help of community leaders to help restore normalcy in all the affected areas.

He told TOI that the police have so far identified 100 persons who were involved in the clashes. “CCTV footages are being screened and evidences are being collected against miscreants,” he added.

According to police, Mohamad Tariq, who received gunshot injuries during Sunday’s violence, is now stable and has been shifted to the ICU at the Trauma Centre of the Jawaharlal Nehru hospital. Doctors have performed an emergency surgery on him.

District magistrate C B Singh told TOI that anyone trying to spread rumours would be firmly dealt with and NSA would be invoked in such cases. He said that Internet services will be restored from Monday midnight.

Earlier on Sunday evening, trouble broke out at the Upper Kot locality when police were trying to evict women anti-CAA protesters who were squatting on the Mohamed Ali Road near the Kotwali police station since Saturday morning.

Some people protested, leading to a scuffle and within minutes, brick batting started from neighbouring areas.

According to eyewitness accounts, the trouble was initially limited to Upper Kot locality where the women protesters were staging the dharna, but after police action against anti-CAA protesters, tension soon spilled over to the neighbouring localities, including Babri Mandi.

Agra: US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump made a FaceTime call to one of her relatives to let him have a glimpse of the Taj Mahal, while she made a stopover at Agra along with her parents on Monday.

This was revealed by her guide Kamalkant Gupta.

Gupta, 47, told TOI that Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner were very excited to be at the Taj.

“Ivanka even made a video call to one of her relatives to make him part of their experience,” said Gupta, who described the couple to be “humble”.

He said Ivanka was thrilled to see the Taj and her first expression on seeing the 17-century marble marvel was “wow”. “Ivanka said that it is unbelievable that someone could make such a monument for someone he loved,” said Gupta.

Gupta said that she clicked several photographs on the Lady Diana seat and was extremely impressed with architecture of the monument. She wanted to see the main mausoleum, but could not, due to protocol.

According to Gupta, Ivanka expressed the desire to visit the Taj Mahal again and her husband was particularly interested to know about the inlay work. He said that the dignitaries gave a chance to almost everyone who were present there to click photographs with them.

“The grandeur and beauty of the Taj Mahal is awe inspiring!” she posted on her Instagram page with several photographs of her with husband. Ivanka visited India to attend the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) in Hyderabad in November 2017, and had dinner with global delegates at the Taj Falaknuma Palace. She praised Modi for proving that “transformational change is possible”.

Gupta had earlier shown the Taj to then US vice-president Joe Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, in August 2007.

181,['25/02/2020'],Plan B: WRD may pump water into Khandepar,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Ponda:With the Dhatwada-Usgao locals continuing to oppose the water pipeline between Dhatwada and Khandepar, it is uncertain if the Khandepar river would be augmented with water from the Ganjem water scheme this summer. Work on laying the pipeline has been halted since February 1.

However, the water resources department (WRD) is ready to pour the required raw water into the Kalem River, which will flow down into the Khandepar River.

A WRD team from Pajimol, Sanguem, has recently carried out the servicing and repairs of two pumps powered by 600 HP motors, vaccum pumps and the sluice valve among other things.

With the water level in the Khandepar reducing, Opa water works had asked WRD officials to get the pumps at the Ganjem and Selaulim Dam ready, in order to rejuvenate the river. Following the commissioning of the new 27-MLD water treatment plant at Opa, the water works now draws over 160 MLD water from the Khandepar regularly.

A total of five water treatment plants at Opa ward in Khandepar village,Ponda, supplies potable water to over 95% of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas. This includes Panaji, Bambolim, Taleigao, Ribandar and the entire taluka of Ponda.

Once the water level in the Opa basin goes down, it receives water from Selaulim dam, Ganjem water scheme, a total of 18 bundharas over the Khandepar and Kalem rivers, from the mining pits in Codli village and the Opa river and its tributaries. The Ganjem bundhara has two pumps that fetch 35 MLD water and two pumps of 600 HP each at Selaulim Dam that together draw 48 MLD of water.

Margao: More than two weeks after luxury cruise liner ‘Diamond Princess’ was quarantined off the coast of Japan, the 135 crew members from India, 50 of whom are Goans, are still spending anxious days and nights aboard the vessel— well after the completion of the14-day quarantine period.

Vivian Raikar, brother of Dhanasth who is among the Goan seafarers on board the cruiseliner told TOI on Monday that the latter called him stating that the situation was getting precarious with every passing day. “Crew members from all other countries have left the ship. The Indian crew members are now feeling dejected and depressed. We appeal to the Goa government to urge the Centre to take urgent steps to ensure the safe return of the Indian seafarers ,” Vivian said.

Dhanasth had earlier told TOI from the ship, soon after the vessel was quarantined, that the passengers were prohibited from disembarking for even a few minutes. “We can’t get any fresh air here,” Dhanasth had said, suggesting that that despondency had begun to set in among the passengers and the crew.

“All the passengers have gone back home. The Filipino crew members, numbering above 500, are also going back in two flights arranged by the Phillipines government. Only the Indians are now left on the ship. All the tests for coronavirus have returned negative. Is the government waiting for us to test positive in order to rescue us?” a crew member wearing a protective mask is heard asking in a video posted on social media.

183,['25/02/2020'],Cheaper Indian device brings relief to patients with narrow aortic valve,"This story is from February 25, 2020

The Indian device is a boon for the elderly, say doctors

KOLKATA: A few weeks ago, a 79-year-old Kasba resident underwent a relatively new procedure called Tavi (transcatheter aortic valve implantation), using the India-made artificial aortic valve, at a city hospital. The procedure involves non-surgically replacing the diseased valve with a prosthetic aortic valve.

Doctors in the city said the procedure is the future for the aged patients suffering from aortic stenosis. While the exorbitant cost of the imported device was a barrier, the India-made device has cut the cost of the procedure by about 40%. Aortic stenosis is the narrowing of the aortic valve. This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, reducing or blocking blood from flowing out of the heart into the main artery and to the rest of the body. If not treated, it could lead to heart failure. Aortic stenosis is related to age.

“This procedure scores over the open surgery of replacing a diseased valve in a number of ways. It is a minimally invasive surgery that takes around two hours and allows the patient quick recovery and, hence, is the best for the elderly with a host of underlying health conditions,” said interventional cardiologist Debdutta Bhattacharya.

Bhattacharya along with cardiac surgeon Atanu Saha had conducted the Tavi on the Kasba resident, a doctor himself. The septuagenarian is doing fine with the aortic valve. The patient had severe aortic stenosis and came to the hospital in a critical condition.

“The procedure has gained wide popularity in the west. Till December 2019, about 70,000 such procedures had been performed in Germany alone. But the high cost the imported prosthesis was an issue in India. Now that we have the indigenous device, which is as good as the imported ones at a more affordable cost, more people can take advantage of the procedure,” said interventional cardiologist PK Hazra who has also conducted two such procedures with the India-made device at AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria.

The package for the procedure using the imported prosthesis is about Rs 25 in Kolkata. But now with the indigenous device, the cost has come down to about Rs 16 lakh.

Tavi is tailored specially for the elderly patients who cannot cope with an open heart surgery that requires breaking open to the breast bone. In this a minimally invasive procedure, in which the doctor inserts the catheter into a large artery in the groin. The valve is implanted in the heart via this catheter.

“This procedure is the future for the elderly. However, as a majority of the elderly people in India do not have medical insurance, the cost even after the using the Indian device could keep many away,” said Sunip Banerjee, cardiologist at SG Cardiac Care. Banerjee, too, had conducted Tavi on a Kolkatan, but at a Singapore hospital a few years ago.

CHENNAI: The boards are here and Class X and XII students, their teachers and parents are in a tizzy. So what, you could say. This is an annual phenomenon. But there is a difference this year. These are the first boards after textbooks for the two classes were revised in Tamil Nadu.So for more than 16 lakh students, it’s like a leap into the unknown. The Class XII exam starts from March 2 and Class X exam starts from March 27. Another 8 lakh students will take the Class XI exams that start from March 4.A topper in a private school said she would have known how much she would score under the earlier system. “But, with new textbooks, even our teachers lack clarity and find it difficult to complete syllabus,” she said.Another student said it was difficult to cover the full syllabus. “Teachers are trying their best. But, the textbooks are new and difficult to understand,” said a student who scored 481 out of 500 in Class X. She expects to score more than 70% in the Class XII exams.“Our students and teachers found the new books heavier than the previous textbooks. But, the new textbooks cover more than 90% of NEET syllabus. So, we are asking students to shoulder the burden,” said B Purushothaman, senior principal of Everwin Group of Schools, Chennai.“We are waiting with bated breath to see the question papers. There is excitement and anxiety among the students and teachers,” he added.“Students are preparing well, but their confidence level is low since it is the first exam,” said G J Manohar, headmaster, MCC Higher Secondary School, Chetpet. “In the absence of a blueprint, it is challenging to prepare the students.

191,['25/02/2020'],Allahabad high court issues contempt notice to MDA for not acting against illegal marriage halls,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Representative image

MEERUT: The Allahabad high court on Monday issued contempt notice to Meerut Development Authority (MDA) and sought details of action taken against 124 unauthorised banquet halls in the city, almost seven months after the court gave the civic body three months to comply with the order. The court has now set March 5 as the deadline to comply with the order.

On July 12 last year, the court had directed the MDA to act against the illegal marriage halls while hearing a petition filed by Meerut resident Sachin Saini. However, the civic body failed to follow the order. The court had then observed, “Having considered all the facts stated, we deem it appropriate to direct Meerut Development Authority to take all necessary penal steps against Baratghars including the Baratghars established prior to 2008, if they are not adhering to norms.”

Reacting to the development, vice chairman of MDA Rajesh Kumar Pandey said, “We have been conducting crackdown on illegal operators. The matter is sub-judice and once we receive the formal order we will reply.”

However, the petitioner in the case, Saini, is not convinced. “A large number of illegal Baratghars (marriage/banquet halls) are still operating in the city. Most of them don’t even have adequate space to park the vehicles. The movement of the marriage procession causes huge nuisance on road and hampers traffic movement, particularly during wedding season.”

After the HC order in July, an association representing banquet halls of Meerut had sought time till November to make infrastructural changes in their establishments to adhere to parking and other norms.

The petitioner had alleged that out of the nearly 248 banquet halls in the district, a majority are running illegally without following the norms.

At present, 163 marriage halls are operational under the jurisdiction of MDA, while another 93 fall under Cantonment and Housing Development Board administration. Interestingly, out of the total 163 halls which come under the MDA, only 24 have their maps sanctioned by the development authority.

In the order issued on July 12, 2019, a bench comprising Justices Vivek Verma and Govind Mathur had observed, “It is also brought to our notice that a Baratghar must have parking space in tune of the standards given in para 16.9 of the norms. In Meerut, 163 Baratghars are operating and out of that 105 were established prior to 2008. Out of all these Baratghars, only 24 were established after getting the map sanctioned by the authority. 139 Baratghars out of 163 are in operation at places which are not having necessary approval from the MDA. These facts indicate gross violation of the norms. The MDA laid down its norms for construction and establishment of Baratghars in the year 2008. But only a few Baratghars are said to have complied with the norms so laid down.”

Chennai: The exam season is back and so is anxiety among parents. To let them breathe easy, several schools in the city are counselling parents.

“This is the first time my child is appearing for boards. I am more nervous than her,” said Ranjita Das, parent of a Class X student.

“It all starts with parents saying, ‘you have to get the highest marks’, ‘you have to stop playing’,” said Shoba Raman, principal of Vidya Mandir. “This contributes to the pressure the child is facing. “We first need to counsel the parents so that children can write the exam confidently.”

Schools like Vidya Mandir, PS Senior Secondary, Chinmaya Vidyalaya and Vael’s are helping parents on ‘exam parenting’. Schools are holding monthly and biweekly meetings, and giving access to teachers.

“Parenting during examination can be stressful and they need to be helped,” said Bharati Lakshmi, principal of Vael’s International. She said teachers regularly stay in touch with parents. “We ask them to relax. We insist that they support their children emotionally and stop doubting their capabilities,” she said.

Chinmaya Vidyalaya met parents of Class X and Class XII students. P Vijayalakshmi, the school’s principal, said she noticed that parents compared children — their marks , studying hours, playtime. “We requested them to put an end to it and focus on the child’s well being,” she said. “I do understand that exam time can be stressful, but it doesn’t mean that you stop children from doing everything they used to do. It will not improve their performance.”

Psychiatrist Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar said parents should create a healthy environment and allow their children regular breaks besides ensuring they get eight hours of sleep and good food. “A child must take a 15-minute break after every 45 minutes of studying. And during the break, they should not be given gadgets because the switch from books to digital screen can strain the eyes and brain,” she said.

KOLKATA: The watch section of the detective department on Monday claimed to have solved a case in which a man, who had gone to meet his kin at a hospital off EM Bypass, was drugged and robbed. A 34-year-old suspect has been arrested.

The incident was reported on February 10 by the victim — Pintu Sardar of Nazhat in North 24 Parganas. He went to the hospital around 8.15am. The suspect was identified as Palash Roy, a resident of Shahid Smriti Colony.

“Among the stolen items were Rs 10,000, 55 Euros, one mobile phone and some documents pertaining to the hospital. The cops have recovered Rs 4,000, the foreign currency and the phone. Roy had been arrested earlier for a similar offence,” said Murlidhar Sharma, joint CP (crime).

“Sardar said that when he went to the hospital, an unknown person came to him and struck up a conversation. He then offered Sardar some biscuits. After eating the biscuits, Sardar felt drowsy and became unconscious. When he woke up around 11.30am, he was lying on a pavement and his bag was missing. We used CCTV footage and our network to nab the suspect,” Sharma said. Roy confessed to the crime and said the biscuits had been laced with Nitrosun-10 tablet, a kind of sedative.

197,['25/02/2020'],"Chennai Metro News: Uncooked meat, seafood not allowed on Chennai metro trains","This story is from February 25, 2020

Representative Image

CHENNAI: If you have just bought some fresh raw seafood from the Chintadripet fish market and have decided to board a metro train at Government Estate station to quickly go home and cook your favourite dish, you could be waiting for a long time as passengers are not allowed to carry raw meat and seafood in metro premises and in trains.

A metro rail official said uncooked meat and seafood are items banned in metro stations and trains under the Metro Railways Carriage Ticket Rules, 2014. According to the rules, officials categorise uncooked meat and fish under ‘carcasses of dead animals or of dead birds’ which fall under ‘offensive material’. “It is prohibited across all metros. You also cannot carry live animals or bird. We are simply following the rules,” an official said.

Among other ‘offensive material’ banned from metro rail services, are bones excluding bleached and cleaned bones, blood dried or coagulated or decomposed whether human or animal.

While commuters can carry packed cooked food into the stations and in trains, they are, however, not allowed to open or consume them while on commute.

Earlier this month in Bengaluru, a passenger was stopped at the entrance of a metro station for carrying uncooked fish back home. The incident came to light after the commuters tweeted about it and said the fish was in a properly sealed cover. Soon, Bangalore metro rail responded that meat is banned in the metro. However, it is allowed if it is properly packed and nothing is oozing out from the package or is emitting a foul smell.

In Chennai metro, commuters are also not allowed to carry unsealed liquor bottles. But those purchased from duty free shops and are properly sealed are allowed to pass through baggage scanners at the stations.

Among a list of items prohibited in metro, commuters cannot carry live animals or birds, gases compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, petroleum and other inflammable liquids, inflammable solids, poisonous substances, acids and other corrosives, weapons, arms and ammunitions and any chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and enhanced conventional weapons which possess risk to passengers or property.

198,['25/02/2020'],High-profile visit puts Agra on pause mode,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Agra: On Monday, Agra held its breath and went on pause mode. By 9am, shops had downed shutters. By 11am, brisk-and-businesslike cops were ordering vehicle owners to take their parked cars out of sight. A sullen cop kicked and floored two mobikes when the owner was slow to react.

It was an afternoon of edgy anticipation. Slowly cars and motorcycles thinned out of the roads. One could only see traffic police receptors, cops in various uniforms on mobikes and jeeps. Some kept watch from rooftops through binoculars. Onlookers were discouraged from peering from rooftops. Noise pollution dipped dramatically, barring the sound of siren. And all this when US President Donald Trump was still making his speech in Ahmedabad.

“Many prime ministers and presidents have visited Agra to see the Taj Mahal. But I have never seen such forceful bandobast (arrangements) before,” said hotel receptionist Faizan Khan.

By 3 pm, it was a strange sight of an empty road and crowded wayside. In a carefully calibrated show, thousands had already lined up along the road to welcome Trump. In the Tajganj area, hundreds of men and women from Brahma Kumaris, a spiritual organisation, stood by the barricades. “We will be waving out when the cavalcade passes by. It is our way of spreading positive energy,” said Manish Agarwal, who like others was dressed in all-white and wore an identification tag.

Trump arrived in Agra at 4.10 pm. Around 4.40pm, the US President’s cavalcade of 20 odd cars, hurtled past Tajganj. And it was no different when the group returned an hour later after gloating over the Taj, a poem in white marble.

To most onlookers, the experience of waiting for the US President was underwhelming. They had been anticipating the event for hours and it ended before it could register in their minds.

A bunch of Class 9 students from Holy Public Junior College, who had waited to wave flags for over five hours, were tired and disappointed. “We expected the cavalcade to pass by slowly. We hoped to wave at President Trump. Forget about seeing him, we hardly had any time to wave the flags,” said student Isha Saraswat. A Class VI student from John Milton Public School fainted briefly due to exhaustion, a fellow student said.

Tourists suffered in various ways. Those who had no inkling of the traffic restrictions had to walk for several kilometres from bus stand and railway station. James Carter, who has come with his fiancée Lesley Smith from Christchurch said, “We had planned to visit a nearby market in the afternoon. But after 2 pm, there was complete lockdown of the route. We had to spend our entire afternoon at the hotel.”

For the past few days, the city had brightened up for the US president. The makeover had continued on Monday morning. Tempo trailers scoured about for ugly spots to conceal with cut-outs of Modi and Trump. Buildings under construction were covered up with banners. Metallic horses and camels wrapped in marigold were set up overnight. Wooden barricades wrapped in saffron and white silk cloth stood as an obstacle between the road and the roadside. Roads were watered to avoid raising of dust.

Early Monday, there was air of expectation in Agra. Men on motorbikes, women in burqa and girls in shimmery dress posed and pouted before the cut-outs of Trump and Modi; the PM being the preferred choice of most. The city was in the midst of a great selfie festival.

But slowly the mood of reverie gave away. Trump left Agra for Delhi around 6.40pm. When Air Force One finally took off from Kheria Air Base, Agra exhaled.

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday conducted searches at multiple locations in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in three cases relating to modules inspired by banned terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS). While 10 locations in Tamil Nadu — including one each in Chennai, Kanchipuram and Toothukudi, three in Salem , and four in Cuddalore — were searched, as many as 15 locations were searched in Bengaluru and Kolar in Karnataka.

The first case, registered by NIA in January this year, involved 10 people arrested and charged with conspiring with an IS member for carrying out unlawful activities and committing terrorist acts in the country by procuring illegal arms, for furthering the objectives of the proscribed terror group.

The second case — IS Khaja Moideen Module — was also registered by the NIA in January this year. Four accused and their associates were named by the NIA in an alleged conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks in Delhi-NCR to further the objectives of IS. During searches at the houses of the arrested accused, documents, including books supporting violent jihad have been seized, the NIA said.

In Karnataka, the NIA carried out searches at 15 locations in Bengaluru and Kolar in connection with an investigation of a case relating to IS Al Hind Module. The locations include houses of the arrested and absconding accused and office of Al-Hind Trust. The case pertains to a criminal conspiracy of killing Hindu leaders, creating communal riots and to carry out “anti-national” activities by forming a terrorist gang inspired by IS.

The members of the terrorist gang conducted meetings at Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and propagated IS ideology, procured arms and ammunition and other incriminating material for executing their plans, the official said.

201,['25/02/2020'],"Stray dog victims’ kin leave village, arm themselves","This story is from February 25, 2020

Jagraon and Khanna: Pushed to the wall, many families in Jagraon and Khanna villages have been forced to take extreme safety measures to safeguard themselves from the stray dog menace. While the family of a victim has migrated to a “safer” area, another has armed itself with sticks and started a vigil to ensure safety of others. As tales of horror echo in small hamlets, some of the victims dread stepping out alone, especially at night.

In a case that sent shockwaves in Khanna, a pack of stray dogs had mauled four-year-old Viraj Kumar to death at Bahomajra village on January 26.

Viraj’s mother Sharda Devi, who worked in a rag collection unit, said the incident left them traumatised and terrorised, forcing the family to shift from Bahomajra to Kauri area. She said she took the decision as she didn’t want her differently-abled daughter Kiran Kumari, a Class V student, and son Vikas, 11, a Class IV student, to meet the same fate.

Recalling the fateful evening when her children were playing outside and she was busy with household chores, Sharda said, “I ran out on hearing Viraj’s screams. I was shocked to see canines gnawing at him. The ferocious beasts had mauled him.”

As she narrated the incident, tears flowed down the cheeks of her son Vikas, who said he will never be able to forget what happened with his brother. Shardha said the government must do something to tackle the problem that has become life threatening for small children.

Meanwhile, an area resident cited accidents on Ludhiana-Delhi highway as one of the reasons for the spike in stray dog problem.

“Vehicles hit stray cattle during night hours and then dogs feed on the carcasses. They attack humans when they fail to find food. The problem is severe in many villages, including Bahomajra, Bija, Kaddon, Daheru, Bhamaddi, Naulri and Libra,” said Raj Kapoor, an area resident.

The family of another victim — 12-year-old Simran in Naulri Khurd area who was mauled to death by stray dogs — is living in fear. “We had heard about the Bahomajra incident wherein a boy was mauled to death, but never thought that our daughter, too, will meet the same fate,” said a shattered Utma Devi, mother of Simran.

“Since that day, we are living in fear, but we cannot shift from this place as we cannot afford rent. Now my husband Jugal and son Preetam, 14, maintain vigil and carry lathis to resist any such attack by stray dogs. My other two sons Rohan, 5, and Vijay, 4, and three daughters are too young to tackle such attacks,” Utma added.

“She was my only child who was getting educated and we had many dreams for her. The government must do something about the problem so that no child falls prey to the menace,” she said.

While the family was talking to this correspondent, Preetam and his sister picked up sticks and ran after a stray dog, which was at a distance.

In the same village, 74-year-old Malkeet Singh said the incident has caused panic and anxiety not only in the village, but also in the neighbouring areas.

“I have two grandsons, Gurjot and Dharamvir Singh, who study in Class V. After this incident, we don’t allow them to go out alone. Fear has gripped the area, especially families that have small children,” said Malkeet.

In neighbouring Badi Naulri village, 65-year-old Kewal Singh said the problem is severe in their village too.

“In our village, there are at least 50 stray dogs who have become a threat to small children. After the recent incident, there is fear in the area,” shared Kewal, a shopkeeper.

Villagers in other areas said the stray dog problem has become alarming in many villages of Jagraon, Samrala, Machhiwara, Doraha, Khanna and Payal.

Close shave

At Akhara village in Jagraon, 11-year-old Veerpal Singh shared his story of how he was almost killed by stray dogs. Following the incident, his sister and younger brother accompany him on most occasions when he goes out.

“I was dragged by stray dogs to old carcass ground. They then started feeding on my head. Hearing my cries, a villager who was passing through the area, alerted other villagers and they rescued me,” said Veerpal, showing injury marks on the left side of his head.

A villager said as the boy belonged to a poor family, villagers chipped in with funds for his treatment. The boy was lucky to survive the incident.

7,619 dog bite cases

RTI activist Rohit Sabbarwal said data obtained under RTI revealed that 7,619 dog bite cases were reported at civil hospital between January 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. He said the number also included cases within the MC limits. Civil hospitals in Jagraon, Khanna, Samrala, Raikot too must be getting dog bite cases, he added.

Sterilization process lacks pace

Additional deputy commissioner Iqbal Singh said in city, the municipal corporation has been entrusted to address the issue, while the administration is making efforts in villages. He said sterilization of stray dogs is being carried out and villagers, too, should get stray dogs sterilized to check the problem.

However, the district administration officials admitted that the process of sterilization lacks pace. In a day, only 3-4 dogs could be sterilized and they are kept under observation for two to three days. They said besides, the government has constituted a committee to find out a strategy to deal with the menace.

Ludhiana: Kila Raipur games could not kick off on Monday, with police denying permission to organise the event.

Visitors as well as participants were left disappointed as cops did not allow the event to take off over orgainsers’ failure to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC). Similar reasons, along with internal tiff, had put off Rural Olympics the previous year too.

Kila Raipur Sports Society Patti Sohaviya, the committee in-charge of organising the event, claimed that the permission was not given due to political interference. The police, however, said the organisers had failed to complete the required formalities.

Ludhiana Sadar SHO Jagdev Singh said, “The organisers had not obtained NOC from the police department to conduct the sports festival. The event will not be allowed on Tuesday too if NOC is not obtained and all formalities met.”

Additional deputy commissioner Jaskiranjit Singh said, “Due to internal issues of Patti Sohaviya, we have denied them permission to hold the event.”

“With more than one panel staking claim to organise the event, there was apprehension of breach of peace, too,” said a cop.

Earlier, the organisers had announced that the two-day event would kick off at Kila Raipur Sports Stadium on Monday without any animal sports.

“Police are not giving us permission due to political interference. This has happened for the second time in a row. We have completed all the formalities and had applied for NOC about 22 days ago,” said Kila Raipur Sports Society Patti Sohaviya president Col Surinder Singh Grewal (retd).

Sources said, “As Kila Raipur Sports Stadium land is owned by three committees, they keep wrangling with each other. It is apprehended that if the event is organized, it may lead to law and order problem. The three committees are Kila Raipur Sports Society Patti Sohaviya, Kila Raipur Sports and Welfare Club Patti Sohaviya, and Grewal Sports Club Patti Sohaviya.”

Tarlochan Singh, a member of Kila Raipur Sports and Welfare Club, said, “We are making every effort to ensure the event is held.”

Ludhiana: The police on Sunday registered a case against an extortionist who fired shots in the air to threaten a villager into paying up.

Amarvir Singh, 26, a resident of Jagraon’s Dholan, said in his police complaint, “On February 18, when I had gone to Jagraon for some work, I received a call around 8.15pm. The caller asked me to ‘go home to see a trailer before the complete movie’. When I reached home, my mother, Jagpal Kaur, said she heard cracker-like sound outside. Two days later, I got another call from a different number. The caller threatened me to pay up Rs 30 lakh. I then realised that those were not crackers but shots that were fired outside my house on the night of February 18.”

Sadar Jagraon ASI Gurdeep Singh said, “The complainant says five shots were fired outside his house. We are checking the footage of CCTVs installed in the area. We have sent the phone numbers from which he received the calls to cyber cell in Chandigarh. The numbers are apparently of foreign country, but can be used in India, too.”

Police said the complainant has land in the district and had recently got a house constructed in Dholan. “We have asked Amarvir to install CCTVs at his house. The family says they have no enmity with anyone.”

A case has been registered under Section 384 (punishment for extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and under the Arms Act.

Accumulation of gas inside the drain is believed to have led to the burst on Monday

Vadodara: A major blast took place inside a storm water drainage line on the busy R C Dutt Road in Alkapuri area of the city on Monday evening. The blast, in which a grill of the drain blew up in the air, is believed to have been caused by accumulation of gas inside the channel.

However, no one was injured in the incident that took place near the Ivory Terrace building when the road was very busy. With several offices located in the area, people were either leaving office for home or had come for shopping.

The grills of the storm water drains in the area have been covered with big nylon bags to ensure that dust and mud cannot enter them.

Sources said that sewage had been released in the storm water drains leading to formation of gases, which got accumulated over a period of time and eventually reached a stage where it burst out. Gases started gushing out of other covers in the area too.

Officials of the Vadodara Gas Ltd also rushed to the spot. Their investigations revealed that the leakage was not of piped natural gas and the gas coming out of the storm water drain had a high quantity of carbon monoxide revealing that the gas could be from sewage.

In October too, a similar incident had taken place in the evening in the same stretch. The damage and the explosion at that time was, however, much louder and cracks had appeared on the road too.

Panaji: The state government is in the process of finalising the Goa police rules under the Police Act 1861 to pave the way for the Goa police manual. Until now, Goa police followed the Bombay police manual as it did not have one of its own.

A manual is aimed at regulating the functioning of the department, including investigation, punishment and appeal matters.

Since there are no police rules, the state has empowered the inspector general of police to take necessary decisions under the Police Act 1861 regarding maintaining records, deciding at what rank officers would be at police stations and how many.

A senior government officer said that the home department has received suggestions from the police on the rules and after incorporating them, the file would be moved for approval. “Once the minister clears the file, the home department will issue a notification. The entire process will take another 15 days to complete,” the officer said.

The officer said that until and unless there are Goa police rules, the state government cannot notify the Goa police manual for the functioning of the force.

The draft manual was ready in November 2018, but had not received government approval.

A convict had approached the high court to challenge the Goa police decision to reopen his historysheet and put him under surveillance, along with his photograph, fingerprints and other personal information. At the hearing, the court held that there was no law covering this aspect of police authority in Goa.

The high court said they had to accede to the request of the petitioner for grant of protection and directed that surveillance on the petitioner will cease.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: Talking tough against Delhi cops , AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi made a serious charge that they were pelting stones along with protestors when pro- and anti-CAA clashes took a violent turn in Delhi on Monday.

“I want to bring to the notice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah that police were pelting stones along with those who were resorting to violence,” said Owaisi while addressing an anti-CAA, NPR and NRC rally here.

“This ( Delhi violence ) is a shame for the entire country. But, I want to emphasise that one of your (BJP) party members at a public meeting had threatened the anti-CAA protesters with an ultimatum some time back,” said the Hyderabad MP.

He said the violence on a day when US President Donald Trump had landed in Delhi was shameful.

Without naming BJP leader (Kapil Mishra), Owaisi said: “I want to tell the Prime Minister that he is growing snakes which would bite him one day.” He condemned the deaths of a cop and a civilian in the incident.

Upping the ante, he urged Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to stop the exercise on NPR. “Passing a resolution against CAA is not enough. I urge the chief minister to stop NPR,” Owaisi said.

He also took pot-shots at state home minister Mahmood Ali. “Mahmood Ali saab, if you don’t believe me, take inputs from an advocate. NPR exercise is to collect data after which people will be branded ‘doubtful’ in NCR. You are home minister of Telanaga and not home minister of TRS,” the AIMIM chief thundered.

Maulana Husamuddin Sani alias Jaffar Pasha, speaking at the rally, also took potshots at Mahmood Ali and Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar.

“Is the home minister powerful or police commissioner powerful? The police commissioner who claimed himself to be secular suddenly said Shaheen Bagh-kind of protest will not be allowed in Hyderabad. What happened to him suddenly? Did Yogi (Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath) come in his dreams? Let us all send bouquets to him,” Jaffar said.

A few hours before Trump’s arrival in India, villagers living along the international border in RS Pura allegedly saw — at around 11.45 am — a Pakistani aircraft flying in Indian airspace. “Panic gripped the border residents on seeing a Pakistan aircraft on the Indian side. The villagers immediately reported the matter to the police,” sources said, adding that the aircraft immediately returned to Pakistani airspace.

There is no official confirmation of the alleged airspace violation from the BSF.

Pakistani aircraft had violated Indian airspace in Rajouri district on February 27, 2019 and the Indian Air Force pushed the Pakistani jets back.

VADODARA: She may not have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi or US President Donald Trump or even the mammoth gathering for the ‘ Namaste Trump ’ event at Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad, but what she experienced at the mega event will be memories for life for this 14-year-old blind girl from Godhra.

Happy Desai sang the famous song ‘Teri laadki main’ with celebrated folk music icon Kirtidan Gadhavi on the stage at the Namaste Trump event ahead of the arrival of Modi and Trump at the stadium. Happy was roped in for the performance only on Saturday.

Happy, who is blind from birth, had started learning music as a five-year-old. She sang at a major event for the first time earlier this year at the Panchmahotsav in Pavagadh here she performed with Parthiv Gohil where she had rendered ‘Teri laadki main’.

Happy’s father Vinod Kumar said that he got a call in the early hours on Saturday asking him if his daughter would perform at Motera Stadium. “I agreed and at around 8.30am, I was asked to reach Ahmedabad by 3pm on Saturday itself,” said Vinod who is a teacher at a government primary school. He added that a rehearsal took place on the same day in the night.

The girl said that she did feel nervous while performing at the event.

“I could feel the crowd. I had never expected to sing at such an event. It seemed as if I was having a dream,” said Happy.

Seeing her interest in music, her father is planning to support her and encourage her.

“I wish she does a PhD in vocal music,” he said.

216,['25/02/2020'],Stipends for MBBS interns hang fire as MCI drags feet,"This story is from February 25, 2020

In many private medical colleges , MBBS students doing internship are forced to work without stipends as the Board of Governors (BoG) of the Medical Council of India failed to act on an amendment to the rules proposed in January 2019 that would have made such stipends mandatory.

After the BoG took over in October 2018, it issued a public notice stating that the MCI was considering including a provision in the Regulations on Graduate Medical Education 1997 stating that all MBBS students pursuing compulsory rotating internship shall be paid stipend on par with that of interns in government medical colleges in the same state.

The BoG sought comments and suggestions from the public on this proposal. This was in response to complaints that had been pouring in over the years from various states regarding non-payment of stipends in private colleges. However, it went silent on the issue thereafter despite several reminders from the medical community and strikes by interns in many colleges.

Talking to TOI, BoG chairperson Dr Vinod Paul said that such an amendment was difficult when there was no provision for stipend in the Indian Medical Council Act. “We are also caught in a quandary because we know that, if we make stipend mandatory, the private colleges will just increase the fees and pay the stipend from the money collected as fees. So, it could lead to an even higher increase in fees,” said Dr Paul.

He added that the BoG’s tenure was coming to an end and this issue ought to be taken up by the National Medical Commission that is taking shape.

“There is no provision for stipend for postgraduate doctors in the IMC Act either and yet the regulations for PG medical education make it mandatory. Further, it was amended in 2008 to include diploma and super-specialty students. While only Parliament can amend the IMC Act, amending regulations is done regularly,” said Dr KV Babu, who has complained repeatedly to the MCI on this issue.

After the BoG took over in October 2018, it issued a public notice that MCI was considering including a provision in the Regulations on Graduate Medical Education 1997 stating that all MBBS students pursuing compulsory rotating internship shall be paid stipend on par with that of interns in government medical colleges in the same state

BJD woman leader Meenakshi Mishra

BHUBANESWAR: Director general of police Abhay on Monday assigned inspector general (IG) Rekha Lohani to probe the self-immolation by BJD woman leader Meenakshi Mishra on the Berhampur SP office premises recently.

Mishra had set herself on fire on February 12 protesting the alleged registration of a false case against her son Raja by Baidyanathpur police and his arrest on January 28. Mishra succumbed during treatment at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar on February 20. Mishra, 41, was a state executive member of BJD in Ganjam district . Though the BJD has been silent on her drastic step, the opposition BJP and Congress had hauled up the ruling party over Mishra’s death.

“I have ordered a high-level inquiry into Meenakshi Mishra’s death following her self-immolation attempt. IG (modernization) Rekha Lohani will conduct the probe. Lohani will find out the circumstances that led to Mishra’s death,” Abhay told TOI.

On February 12, Mishra visited the Berhampur SP’s office and wanted to meet SP Pinak Mishra. After failing to meet the SP, the woman BJD leader met another officer in the SP office and told him about the alleged registration of a false case of assault against her son. She also alleged that the police arrested her son in the false case. Police, however, rubbished her allegation and said Raja was arrested for allegedly assaulting some men during a group clash. “We also arrested five persons for attacking Raja,” another police officer said.

While returning from the SP office, she doused herself in kerosene and set herself ablaze on the office premises. Police sources said she had hidden the kerosene bottle in her bag before entering the SP office. Persons are frisked by policemen before entering SP’s chamber but no checking is conducted at a public office.

Police sources said Lohani’s investigation will focus on different aspects, including the role of Berhampur police. “She (Lohani) will investigate whether Mishra’s self-immolation could have been prevented. The IG will also probe whether or not the personnel, who were present in the Berhampur SP office, timely rescued Mishra,” an officer said.

Family members of Mishra refused to comment on the high-level probe ordered by the DGP. Mishra’s son Raja is currently on interim bail till February 25. A court in Berhampur had granted him interim bail on February 14.

US President Donald Trump speaks during a ""Namaste Trump,"" event at Sardar Patel Gujarat Stadium. (AP)

NEW DELHI: The loudest cheer for President Donald Trump went up when he spoke of US commitment to working with India to fight terrorists and their ideology and working to defend Indian and American citizens from radical Islamic terrorism .

While making an important point from the Indian view, Trump also said the US and Pakistan enjoyed a good relationship and added it was paying off. ""Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one. Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan and we are hopeful for reduced tensions, greater stability and the future of harmony for all of the nations of South Asia ,'' he said.

A part of his remarks was immediately highlighted by Pakistani media though he was quite unequivocal on Islamabad and terrorism, saying his office was working with Pakistan in a ""very positive way"" to crack down on terror organisations and militants that operate on the ""Pakistani border''.

India would hope for an even clearer statement after official talks on Tuesday given its position that no substantive bilateral engagement can take place in view of cross-border terrorism - a stance it has has held after the Pathankot terror attack in January 2016. Trump's remarks may have a bearing on a peace deal with Taliban where Pakistani functionaries have underlined Islamabad's criticality.

Trump's remark on Pakistan also has to be seen in conjunction with comments made by a senior US administration official that the president was very much encouraging a reduction in tensions between India and Pakistan and also encouraging them to engage in bilateral dialogue to resolve differences.

While the official had said the ""core foundation'' of any successful dialogue between India and Pakistan was based on continued momentum in Islamabad's efforts to crack down on terrorists on its territory, he had also said that Trump was going to urge both countries to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Control and refrain from actions or statements that could increase tensions in the region.

For India, though, the real test will be to extract an unequivocal condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the Trump-Modi joint statement on Tuesday, something which India successfully managed in their first summit in 2017. It won't be easy with the US desperate to go ahead with its emerging truce agreement with the Taliban, one in which Pakistan claims to have played a stellar role.

222,['25/02/2020'],Consumer group writes to consumer affairs ministry to reconsider complaints from allottees,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Pune: Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, a state-based consumer group, has written to the consumer affairs ministry to reconsider complaints from allottees regarding residential properties.

The apex court recently dismissed a complaint on the ground that a body which has come into existence by the mandate of law cannot be treated as a voluntary consumer association under section 12 (1) (b) of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), 1986, and, hence, a complaint filed under it is not maintainable.

The apex court had upheld the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in the original consumer complaint.

“The recent ruling on not recognising association of allottees and their demands relating to a developer is a setback for all pending cases in consumer courts,’’ pointed out Mumbai Grahak Panchayat chairman Shirish Deshpande in his letter to the consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan.

The group has requested the ministry to promulgate an ordinance to amend the relevant provisions in the CPA,1986, with retrospective effect and protect all the complaints pending in various consumer courts. “We have also urged similar amendment in the new Consumer Protection Act, 2019,” added Deshpande.

The group in its letter stated that as a result of the SC judgement, thousands of cases pending in consumer courts are liable to be dismissed. This will result in protecting unscrupulous builders who have wilfully delayed obtaining occupation certificates and avoided executing conveyance to the housing societies, the letter said.

Similarly, several such complaints filed by the cooperative housing societies registered under the state cooperative societies act will also be eventually dismissed as a consequence of this SC judgement, affecting individual homebuyers who cannot file complaint for seeking conveyance because the conveyance needs to be executed in favour of the society and not in favour of individual homebuyers, said the consumer group.

“The apex court judgement is thus bound to create chaotic conditions and wrongfully dent the legitimate locus of such housing societies. It may be true that the condominiums or the housing societies of the homebuyers may not be voluntary consumer associations in the strict sense. However, considering the fact that the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, was enacted with an intention to provide for better protection of interest of consumer and being a socially-beneficent legislation, as repeatedly held by the SC in several judgements in the past, such strict interpretation of law was uncalled for, unwarranted and unjustified,’’ added Deshpande in his letter to the ministry.

223,['25/02/2020'],Rise above politics to restore order: Amit Shah,"This story is from February 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah held a meeting on Tuesday with Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and representatives of key political parties to take stock of the situation in wake of violence in north-east Delhi and said a professional assessment pointed to the violent protests being “spontaneous”.

At the meeting, also attended by BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, Congress representative Subhash Chopra, Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik and senior home ministry officials, Shah suggested that the local peace committees comprising eminent citizens and elected representatives be reactivated and their meetings held to defuse the tension, quell rumours and ensure coordination with the Delhi Police.

Shah advised leaders of political parties in Delhi to exercise restraint and refrain from making any provocative speeches. He suggested that all should rise above politics to jointly work towards restoring peace and order.

Patnaik briefed the meeting on the violence witnessed on Monday in parts of Delhi as well as the current situation. Shah said professional assessment was that the violent protests were spontaneous. According to intelligence sources, the violence broke out during clashes between anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and pro-CAA groups in north-east Delhi, which is witnessing 8 of the 19 ongoing anti-CAA sit-in protests across the capital. The immediate trigger, it is believed, was the anti-CAA dharna that led to blocking of a road in Jafrabad.

A source said police personnel on the ground were heavily outnumbered by the clashing anti-CAA and pro-CAA groups, giving leeway to anti-social elements among the warring sides to indulge in stone-pelting, arson and even firing with illegal weapons. “The clashes took a communal colour. Police chose to act with restraint, mindful of the high casualties that any use of force in the densely populated ghettos would cause, and the subsequent ripple-effect this may have in other parts of the country witnessing anti-CAA protests,” said an officer. At least 13 people, including a head constable, have died and many others, including police personnel, injured.

Incidentally, the “spontaneous” assessment cited by Shah runs contrary to MoS (home) G Kishan Reddy’s claims — made to ANI on Monday and in a tweet the later — that the violent protests were a “conspiracy” to create chaos in Delhi and “show our country in poor light” at a time when US President Donald Trump was visiting.

A source told TOI there was no prior intelligence about a possible communal flare-up.

The meeting, chaired by Shah, was told that adequate police deployment in violence-prone areas was being ensured and reinforcements sent where required. Special officers would be deployed in the vulnerable areas. The roads were also being cleared.

Shah reassured the state government and political representatives of Delhi that the city police was doing its job, though while exercising restraint. He cautioned against unwarranted criticism of the Delhi Police saying it could negatively impact its morale and noted that it was adequately empowered to decide on the amount of force needed to defuse tension.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Kejriwal said all parties are concerned over the law and order disturbances in the capital. “We all want violence to stop. Nobody is benefiting from this violence,” he noted. Calling the meeting “very positive”, Kejriwal said everybody resolved to make all possible efforts to restore order and peace in Delhi.

Meanwhile, Shah has cancelled his visit to Kerala.

So did Sandhya Dey and her husband Tapan. The two families had to shift to a hotel after tunnel-borer Urvi resumed burrowing the East-West Metro tunnel last Tuesday.

TBM Urvi has bore past the area without any glitch being reported. KMRC, the implementing agency, had taken a whole lot of safety measures so that there was not a remote chance of a repeat of the tunnelling disaster, in which around 700 Bowbazar residents were evacuated after TBM Chundee punctured an aquifer, triggering large-scale subsidence.

On Monday, the Roys looked particularly relieved. They had to be evacuated twice — first, when TBM Chundee hit the aquifer, damaging their house at 10B Durga Pituri Lane beyond repair. They were shifted again last week from their rented home at 13 Chaitain Sen Lane as it fell on Urvi’s route. “Last time, we had to stay at this same hotel for three months. This time, thankfully, the stay last only for a week,” Sunipa told TOI on Monday evening.

In the second batch, around 50 residents were evacuated on Saturday from three buildings in a row at Chaitan Sen Lane. The TBM is believed have reached below the third structure. The occupants are due to return on Wednesday.

Pune: The Uruli Devachi and Phursungi residents on Monday stopped garbage-laden vehicles from entering their villages, prompting the Pune Municipal Corporation officials claim that only “reject (from the trash) was transported there” and even that would be stopped in a couple of days.

Dnyaneshwar Molak, the head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said, “The PMC has totally stopped garbage dumping at the depot. Only the rejected part from the garbage, which cannot be processed, was being taken to these villages. Its quantity is very small.”

The garbage rejects mostly contain plastic, dry waste or metal parts.

Vishal Harpale, a local resident, said, “We believe the civic administration is not following the court’s orders. They should not put even the reject at the dumping site. So, we prevented the entry of garbage vehicles.”

Some PMC officials claimed they had stopped dumping garbage at Uruli Devachi and Phursungi from January. Garbage was being dumped in the villages for the past 25 years.

According to the PMC officials, the processing of garbage at other areas of the city has been increased. It helped in reducing the dumping at the Uruli Phursungi depot. The capacity of the garbage processing plants at Hadapsar has been augmented.

Harpale said the residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi were unhappy with the PMC’s approach and had staged an agitation demanding ban on the entry of garbage vans. A group of residents from these villages formed a committee “Uruli Devachi Kachara Depot Hatao Sangharsha Samiti”. A group of residents claimed a criminal offence should be filed against those dumping garbage at the depot. A meeting to find a solution to this issue is being planned on Tuesday. The PMC officials, residents and police officers will attend the meeting at the depot.

The civic administration’s data states nearly 2,100 tonnes of garbage is generated in the city per day. Nearly 600 tonnes of it was dumped in these villages till December 2019.

227,['25/02/2020'],Rural police to procure boats to crack the whip on sand mafia,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Pune: The Pune rural police will table a proposal to procure boats to crack the whip on sand mafia operating in the Bhima river basin in the district.

“These mafia use modified fibre boats to take the sand out during the daytime. Whenever the police or revenue officials conduct a drive, they escape via the river route and reach the adjacent Ahmednagar district. We are unable to arrest them as we do not have boats. So, we have decided to procure at least 10 boats to patrol the river and carry out drives against illegal sand mining in the district. We will table our proposal before the district administration in a meeting soon,” Sandeep Patil, superintendent of police, told TOI.

Past investigations have revealed that the boats used by the sand mafia were procured from Gujarat-based firms, a police officer said. The rural police have an anti-sand mafia squad in its Baramati division. “Sand extraction mainly occurs in the Daund and Baramati tehsils. This squad, along with revenue officials, had carried out drives in the last three months and seized sand worth Rs10 crore. But we need to intensify action to curb the menace,” Patil said.

The Bhima river originates in Khed tehsil, flows through Shirur and Daund tehsils before merging with the backwaters of Ujani dam in Indapur tehsil. “The river basin is wide in Daund tehsil, where these sand mafia have established a strong network at the village-level. They have sources in the revenue and police departments and shift their inventories to safe places before the police takes action,” a senior revenue department official said.

The rural police have even invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act against seven sand mafia in the last two years. “Three proposals given for invoking the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act against sand mine operators are pending with the district administration,” Patil said.

Thirupathi Reddy and his daughter Harika

CHENNAI: A 35-year-old man who was being treated for psychiatric problems for a couple of months leaped off his second floor flat at Madhavaram holding his four-year-old daughter on Sunday afternoon, police said. Both died instantly.

Police, who identified the deceased as Thirupathi Reddy and T Harika, said the incident happened in full public view at 2pm at the four-storey apartment complex in Ponniamman Medu, Madhavaram. Witnesses told police that they saw Thirupathi Reddy climb the parapet in the balcony of the apartment holding his daughter and jumped down before they could realise what was happening and respond. The witnesses saw the two lying in a pool of blood and rushed them to a private hospital at Villivakkam where doctors declared that they had been brought dead. A Madhavaram police team then shifted the bodies to Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital for postmortem.

A case was registered under CrPC Section 174 (unnatural death). The bodies were handed over to the family on Monday.

An investigation officer said no suicide note was found on the dead man’s person. Preliminary inquiries revealed that Thirupathi Reddy, a cashier at a garlic godown at Parry’s who had been ailing for the past several months and was being treated at a private hospital, often skipped work and stayed at home. He is survived by his wife Sunitha, a homemaker, and five-year-old son Harish.

Hyderabad: Three labourers died and five others were injured when a mound of earth fell on them while they were constructing pillars at a construction site on the premises of Sirpur Paper Mill in Kumram Bheem-Asifabad district on Saturday night.

233,['25/02/2020'],Outreach programmes to address concerns about NPR drive,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Pune: Officials in all the states have been advised to hold outreach and awareness campaigns about the Census and the National Population Register drive because people’s misgivings about them could hurt the population enumeration exercise.

The authorities believe widespread awareness drives would help address concerns of people about the NPR (National Population Register) data gathering process, prompting them to cooperate with enumerators when they visit homes.

An official in the know of things said, “For sensing the kind of questions that enumerators may face during house visits, the Census officials will have to establish contact with local representatives. An outreach programme has been proposed to ensure that people’s doubts are resolved before the information gathering work begins.”

The house-listing phase of the Census and updating of the NPR in the country would be rolled out simultaneously by mid-April and continue till September. Over 2.5 lakh enumerators would handle the massive exercise in Maharashtra. Senior government officials associated with the Census said once the notification was issued, awareness programmes would be conducted.

The Census authorities in Karnataka recently requested deputy commissioners in the districts to hold outreach and awareness campaigns about the NPR, as they fear misgivings about the exercise could hurt the forthcoming enumeration of population.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has appointed a panel to look into the problems that might arise during the NPR drive.

The general administration department and the home ministry handle the Census operations. Several district officials are said to have raised concerns about the possibility of people refusing to share information when the work on the Census and NPR begins. This would affect the quality of the Census work, they stressed.

There is a fear that many people may decline to share personal information with the officials visiting households in connection with government programmes suspecting them of gathering data for the yet-to-be unveiled National Register of Citizens (NRC), following the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The district authorities have been told to train and sensitise enumerators to tread carefully while gathering information. Enumerators will be told not to demand information by force. For instance, if a person does not know his exact date or place of birth, the enumerator may engage in a conversation with the person that may elicit some anecdotes and roughly establish the year and the place of birth. This is part of the Census manual,” a Census official said.

Another challenge before the officials would be to convince people that the Census/NPR data would remain safe because the information would be gathered and stored digitally.

Santiniketan: Visva-Bharati has informed its employees that their February salary may be delayed “due to paucity of funds”. A formal notice signed by the acting registrar was issued on Monday.

“We had requisitioned for fund (to UGC) in time. This is not only about Visva-Bharati, but several universities are facing the same situation. Our VC is in Delhi and is in constant touch with UGC and MHRD to expedite the disbursement of funds,” VB PRO Anirban Sarkar said. According to university sources, around Rs 22 crore is required for the monthly salary and pension of employees and as on Monday, Rs 7 crore has been disbursed by UGC to VB for this purpose.

According to sources, UGC has been repeatedly flagging its “objections” on excess payment to certain Visva-Bharati employees. UGC, first in October 2019 and again in November 2019, had asked the university to recover this excess payment paid over the last decade. The November reminder by UGC had a three-week deadline. In December, Visva-Bharati issued orders and started to dock excess payments to certain employees. This, however, has hit a legal roadblock with three teachers moving court.

Cars headed to the airport queue up at Sardar Chowk

AHMEDABAD: The VVIP visit posed some expected inconvenience for many passengers travelling out of the city airport on Monday. While most flights operated as per schedule, passengers faced troubles finding cabs or reaching the airport due to road closure.

“Our flight to Goa was scheduled around 1pm but we reached the airport before 8am. We were not allowed inside the terminal building and had to wait outside,” said Bhavesh Shah, a Satellite resident.

Road closure also led to several passengers getting stranded en route to the airport. Especially after 10.30am, there was utter chaos at Sardar Patel Chowk.

“We got stuck in traffic for about an hour. I had to request the cops to let our car go as the flight would be delayed otherwise. After due verification, cops allowed the car to pass through the barricaded road,” said Ashok Panchal, a cab driver who was ferrying a pilot of a private airline.

A Mumbai-bound passenger, Richa Taneja, barely made it to catch her flight. “Thankfully, some senior cops communicated to the police to verify air tickets and allow passengers to move towards the airport,” she said.

Ankur Patel, a flyer said, “I have to reach Mumbai by the 2.20pm flight and have a connecting international flight from there. There is no chance I can afford to miss this flight otherwise, my journey will be jeopardised.”

Many passengers who arrived at the airport also struggled to find cabs. “I’ve come here for a vendor meeting and need to reach in time but I’ve only been waiting to find a cab,” said Gaurav Sharma, who flew from Delhi.

“I doubt if I will make it to the court hearing in the morning because my flight landed at 9am and till 10am, I was only struggling to get out of the airport,” said Alpesh Purohit, an advocate.

Similar was the case of Rajesh Raman, who is in Ahmedabad, with his wife and daughter for a wedding. “Our flight landed late by 30 minutes. We didn’t find any cabs because of the road closure.”

During the afternoon, the roads to the airport were briefly closed again, due to which a number of passengers ended up waiting in a traffic jam. “I am going to Delhi to take an international flight. Thankfully, I had kept enough time margin for reporting to the airport but somehow it didn’t work,” said Chandrika Patel, who was stuck in traffic near Dafnala junction around 3pm.

AHMEDABAD: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams of class X and XII were conducted smoothly amidst all security arrangements made for the visit of US President Donald Trump on Monday.

A large area was cordoned off due to security reasons for the US president’s visit. This area included four schools — Podar International School, Rachana School, KV Shahibaug and KV Cantonment. Around 400 regular and 17 private students sat for their exams in these four centres. Class X students appeared for Gujarati paper, while class XII students had physical education exam.

All students reported early to their respective exam centres and were provided breakfast. They left the exam centres immediately after exams. The biggest challenge was for students who were appearing for exam at KV Cantonment, but this was sorted out by the CBSE. They took permission from army cantonment to use internal roads. Kapil Shah, a class X student said, “The smart move by the board ensured that we left immediately after the exam.” Talking to TOI, Mrugen Shah, said, “CBSE chairwoman Anita Karwal’s telephonic talk with the police commissioner to ensure that students are not stopped on their way to exam centres helped all students in reaching their exam centres on time.”

The civic officials said that they have decided to carry out a drive this week.“Dumping takes place behind the SSPMS college, around Sangamwadi areas. The flood level of Mula and Mutha river may rise due to the dumping of debris. The Naik island’s biodiversity will be destroyed,” Sarang Yadwadkar, an environmentalist, told reporters.He said that the flora and fauna at Naik island and the nearby areas were getting adversely affected due to the dumping. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had given directives that no dumping should take place on the riverbed. Even then such activities go on unchecked. The source of the dumps should be found out and the responsibility fixed. PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said that he along with a delegation of environmentalists had visited the spot. “The officials concerned has been directed to take action. They will chalk out a plan and act accordingly,” he said.Raj Nikam, a local resident and landowner, said that the dumping was going on for years. “The local citizens have supported the PMC on infrastructure development work in these areas. We have given our land for the projects a decade ago. Blaming us for the dumping is wrong,” he said.Nikam added that they have lodged complaints with the PMC.

Pune: Engineering students at the Army Institute of Technology (AIT), Dighi, can look forward to actively engage in research on the latest trends in cybersecurity, besides working on industrial projects, at the institute’s newly developed laboratory.

Southern Army Commander Lt Gen CP Mohanty on Monday inaugurated the Information Security and Digital Forensic Laboratory on the occasion of the 26th foundation day of the AIT.

The institute has hired a private data security firm for training students. “The laboratory aims at fostering interest among students about cybersecurity and preparing them for the job opportunities in this fast-emerging field,” Sunil Dhore, head of AIT’s computer engineering department, said.

Over 70 students from across the engineering streams have enrolled their names for the co-curricular activity, which will be run by industrial experts on the campus. “Topics like ethical hacking, cybersecurity, cyber forensics cannot be taught officially in the college. But through this activity, the students can develop expertise in niche fields of security domain,” AIT director Brig Abhay Bhat (retired) said.

A one classroom-sized facility can accommodate about 20 students at a time. “Our plan is to prepare them for future challenges. We have a pool of listed firms who can give their projects to us. Secondly, our students can go through their internal security system and find out loopholes and provide apt solutions,” Dhore said.

On the institute’s future plans, Brig Bhat said they were moving towards transforming the AIT into a ‘Centre of Excellence’ in cybersecurity. “Our aim is to start certificate, basic and advance courses,” Bhat said.

Lt Gen Mohanty also presented the successful entrepreneur award to Hanumant Gaikwad, chairman and managing director of Bharat Vikas Group (BVG), and young entrepreneur award to Ravi Kumar, cofounder of ‘udChalo’, an air ticketing portal for defence persons.

239,['25/02/2020'],Petrol dealers to sell green fuel soon in Maharashtra,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Pune: Petrol dealers in the state, including those in the city, would soon start selling compressed biogas (CBG) to boost its usage, oil marketing companies stated on Monday.

CBG, produced naturally through anaerobic decomposition from waste or biomass sources, is an environment-friendly alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG) used in vehicles. Sources from oil marketing firms stated that they were inviting applications from entrepreneurs to set up CBG plants.

“The government had envisaged setting up 5,000 CBG plants across the country by 2023. In line with that plan, the Centre has roped in oil marketing companies to market the green fuel produced by the interested parties. Once an entrepreneur gets his CBG plant commissioned and starts the production, we would allot the nearest petrol pump for its dispensation,” an oil marketing company official told TOI.

The official said CBG would be sold to customers for Rs55.25 per kg, close to the CNG price of Rs55.5 per kg in the city.

All India Petrol Dealers Association (AIPDA) president Ajay Bansal said they had so far received nearly 79 applications for setting up of CBG plants in Maharashtra. “The government has plans to provide heavy subsidies for such set-ups,” he said.

Bansal said since Maharashtra had many sugar factories, press mud from the factories could be used for manufacturing CBG. “The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has issued 500 letters of intent to the interested parties across the country,” Bansal said.

“In a recent executive committee member meeting with Indian Oil Corporation, further modalities of this project were discussed,” AIPDA spokesperson and petrol dealer Ali Daruwalla said.

AHMEDABAD: It was a momentous occasion at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport on Monday morning as the flying fortress – the Air Force One – touched down at around 11.35am. The visit of the US president, Donald Trump, is the first for an American president to visit Ahmedabad. As the US president, along with the US first lady, Melania Trump , descended from the airport, Prime Minister, Narendra Modi welcomed him with a warm hug, while professional dancers performed the Hudo dance – a well-known folk dance of Gujarat .

The Indian Air Force, Navy and Army — all three defence wings accorded a tri-service guard of honour to the US president at the airport. The guard of honour was commanded by Major Subhash of Maratha Light Infantry.

Soon after, as the US presidential motorcade, including the luxurious ‘Beast’ – a specially configured limousine, passed the city roads, cheers went up from the crowds outside the airport and waiting on the route all the way till Sabarmati Ashram . Some 28 stages were set up by the civic authorities along the road where troupes performed folk dances.

KOLKATA: A convoy of cars will rally from Kolkata to several places in Bangladesh for a week, starting this weekend, to celebrate the centenary of Bangabandhu Mujibur Rehman, the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh. This is also being touted as the first-ever motor rally between Kolkata and Dhaka and has been christened ‘Moitree’.

Starting from Kolkata, the rally, which is being organised by the Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI), will touch Dhaka, Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong, Mymensingh, Rangpur before re-entering West Bengal through Siliguri. More than 30 cars have already signed up for the rally. The registrations will remain open till February 28, when the rally will be officially announced from the precincts of the Calcutta Club. Almost all the heritage clubs of the city have joined hands with the AAEI in the initiative.

On the Bangladesh side, the deputy high commission here, Dhaka Bank and Dhaka Club are partnering the initiative. Elaborate cultural exchanges have been planned at every place where the rally will stop. “This should have happened long back. We are part of the same cultural skein and still it took us so long to plan this. But better late than never,” said Kaushik Roy, veteran rallyist who has driven across 32 countries already and will lead the rally.

For some participants, it would be a nostalgic trip to the country that their parents belonged to. Take the case of former banker Iman Bhattacharya and his wife Meghmala, who trace back their ancestry to different parts of Bangladesh. “Though I have driven across India and to other countries as well, it is quite another thing to drive to Bangladesh. No boundary can divide the heart, can it? We hope that after this debut rally between the city and Bangladesh becomes a popular route for rallyists,” Bhattacharya said.

The rallyists will also carry the message of Sunderbans conservation with them. Special posters have been designed for this and many interactions between rallyists and conservation experts in Bangladesh have been organised. “Sunderbans is common to both West Bengal and Bangladesh and we will see if some collaborative projects can be drawn up,” said Milan Mukherjee, senior lawyer and chairperson of AAEI.

Hyderabad: The Congress has come out with ‘patnam gosa’ (urban plight) programme to counter TRS government’s pattana pragathi (urban development) programme. Both the programmes will start from Monday.

Telangana Congress working president A Revanth Reddy will launch the programme from Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency. “This is an effort to bring to the notice of the TRS government the problems being faced by the people in urban areas. With an eye on GHMC polls, the state government is trying to paint a rosy picture with pattana pragathi programme . Whenever KCR launches any programme, it is connected with upcoming election,” Revanth said on Sunday.

Revanth charged the state government of not completing the 2-BHK project and diverting Central funds given for housing sector. “There are 10 lakh families in Greater Hyderabad alone who are waiting for 2-BHK units, and another 30 lakh in Telangana. KCR had promised to complete 2-BHK houses in a year or else they would not seek votes,” he said.

Releasing a copy of the answer given in Telangana State Legislative Council about Central government sanctioning houses under Indira Awas Yojana (IAY) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), Revanth said 65,149 houses were sanctioned under IAY in 2014-15 and 56,748 in 2015-16. “IAY was discontinued and the Centre launched PMAY-rural and urban in 2016-17. The funds allotted for housing under IAY and PMAY have been diverted by the TRS government,” he alleged.

He also questioned Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy’s silence even after PMAY funds have been diverted by TRS government. “Kishan Reddy should raise the issue in the Parliament or else it can be assumed that TRS-BJP are two sides of a coin.

Revanth further slammed Kishan Reddy for his comment that the people of Telangana were not aware of trains till recent years and it was only after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister that new trains were introduced. “There were railway stations in Telangana even before Narendra Modi was born. Kishan Reddy should verify facts before speaking,” Revanth said.

BENGALURU: On the run for nearly three decades, fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari fled the country in 1994, and is suspected to have lived in at least five countries under at least four names, Karnataka police said.“Pujari was first involved in many heinous cases in Mumbai. Police had identified him as a staunch associate of gangster Chhota Rajan. In 1994, he flew to Nepal and then to Bangkok,” said additional director general of police (ADGP) Amar Kumar Pandey.Investigations revealed between 1994 and 1998, Pujari operated from Nepal. “By the end of 1999 or early 2000, he was forced to leave the country after learning that police had tracked him down. He flew to Bangkok, where he lived till 2003. Pujari had invested huge money in the casino business and financed dance bars. In no time, local mafia gangsters developed differences with him. Knowing Bangkok was no more safe for him, Pujari flew to Sudan by mid-2003,” police officer said.In Sudan, Pujari invested in the garment business. Initially, he earned small profits but later started losing money and shifted to Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, Pujari continued his alleged underworld activities like extortion and murder.“Film personalities, Bollywood actors in particular, well-known builders in metro cities, popular industrialists and businessmen were his main targets. He laid his hands on politicians too. He would make threat calls to them,” police said, adding: “In Burkina Faso, he purchased a garment factory and invested in hotels. In mid 2015, he moved to Senegal.”In Senegal, Pujari opened Maharaja Indian restaurant. He hired Indian cooks and soon the restaurant became popular for its Indian food.Pujari is suspected to have operated under four names, police said. “Ravi Prakash Pujari was his name at birth. His underworld guru, Chhota Rajan christened him Antony Fernandes. Pujari later called himself Tony Fernandes and lived under the name in Nepal, Bangkok and Sudan.“After entering Burkina Faso, he called himself Rocky Fernandes and obtained another passport under the name in that nation,” police said.However, Pujari’s luck ran out when Senegal police, based on inputs provided by their Karnataka counterparts, arrested him on January 19, 2019. He was lodged in Senegal jail and was handed over to Karnataka police on February 20. “Pujari filed a petition claiming there was a security threat to him in India and his health condition was poor.

246,['25/02/2020'],This Bengaluru boy can recall every detail about elevators at 5k sites,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Aaryan Sachin Kashyap

BENGALURU: Aaryan Sachin Kashyap, 12, is not just any other sixth grader. With an exceptional photographic memory , he can not only remember specifics about elevators — if they are service or passenger — from over 5,000 sites that he’s visited, but can also recall all the details within five seconds.

Aaryan’s love for elevators began when he was two and a half years’ old. His father, Sachin Ramesh Shimoga, a lead information architect in a city-based firm, told TOI the boy would stand near elevators for hours and still not get bored. “Initially, we thought like any other child, he likes going up and down elevators, but only when he started recalling specifications of lifts he’d seen long ago in some other building did I realise it’s something special,” Shimoga said.

He said they found out about Aaryan’s photographic memory through Chhota Bheem books, for which he holds a Limca World Record. “We got him 95 volumes of the books with 35 pages each. At the age of two and a half, he wouldn’t read but glance through the pages full of excitement,” Shimoga said.

One incident left the elders awestruck. “I showed Aaryan a picture from one of those books and asked him which volume it was from. He recalled the volume correctly in a second. I wanted to be sure so I picked random pages. Even then, he was correct,” said the father.

After getting a certificate and clearance from his then school, Indus International School, Aaryan’s family was able to get him a place in the Limca Book of World Records.

Four years after that, Shimoga and his wife Smitha Sachin started supporting Aaryan in his love for elevators. They documented all the lifts he had identified and recalled. They are from across the globe — Bengaluru (654) Chennai

(67), Coimbatore (37), Germany (1), Mysuru (66) and Singapore (260), among others.

In August 2019, the family shifted to Mysuru, where Aaryan is now studying at Pramati Hillview Academy School. To test Aaryan’s memory, all one needs to do is ask him about elevators. For instance, if asked about lifts at Forum Mall, Koramangala, Bengaluru, he will respond in jiffy: “Otis, 3 passenger elevators, goes from -1 to 4; Otis, 3 service elevators, goes from -1 to 4.”

It’s not just details of elevators Aaryan can remember. “He can recall the vehicle registration codes of all Indian cities within seconds and has lately started showing interest in cookery videos,” Shimoga said, adding that his son looks up all the information he needs online to get the details.

“From building plans to RTO websites and even YouTube videos, Aaryan always knows where to find what,” Shimoga said. The boy chipped in: “In two years, I will start cooking.” He, however, wants to be an elevator engineer. “I also love sports, especially swimming,” said Aaryan.

Gangster Ravi Pujari (in white cap) at Bengaluru airport

BENGALURU: The long chase for a phantom-like figure has finally ended, additional director general of police Amar Kumar Pandey said on Monday with a sense of pride as well as relief, hours after bringing fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari back to Karnataka.

After all, Karnataka police have in their custody a man who’s an accused in 97 cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion across the state, including 46 in Bengaluru alone, over the past 26 years. But for long, police had no clue where Pujari was. All they had was an old photograph that they photoshopped to know what he would look like in future.

In 2017 and early 2018, there was a spike in the number of cases where threat calls were made in Pujari’s name to extort money from businessmen and others. Some of these calls achieved their objective too.

Among those who received the calls was MP DK Suresh (August 2017). Incidentally, Interpol had issued a red corner notice against Pujari on March 8, 2017 in the Shabnam Developers double murder case of 2007. However, in the Interpol notice, it was suspected that Pujari was in Canada, Australia or New Zealand, where the threat calls had originated.

In 2018, then chief minister HD Kumaraswamy issued an ultimatum to state police — arrest him and get him here, never mind which corner of the world he is holed up in. The responsibility was assigned to Amar Kumar Pandey, who was intelligence ADGP at the time. While cases before Central Crime Branch (CCB) had already piled up, cops collected details about Pujari’s movements. Within days, they got to know he was living as a successful businessman and philanthropist in Senegal.

Between June and December 2018, the team worked hard to collect details and was able to get one crucial video of Pujari dancing during Navaratri festivities at Maharaja Hotel in Senegal’s capital Dakar. The video proved a breakthrough. Inquiries revealed Pujari was living by the name of Rocky Fernandes alias Antony Fernandez.

A police informer based out of Mangaluru and living in Dubai sent cops a set of photos showing Pujari watching a cricket match with a few others. In one of the pictures, a man was seen wearing a white shirt bearing the words ‘Indian Senegal Cricket Club’ and it was confirmed that Pujari was in Senegal. Police officers sought help from locals and found the photo was of Antony Fernandez.

In the third week of December, Karnataka police through diplomatic channels alerted the Senegal government about Pujari and after checking the veracity of the information, Senegal police arrested him on January 19, 2019 when he had gone to get his hair coloured at a salon. Since then, he tried everything under the law to get released but to no avail.

Pune: The third suspect in the kidnapping and murder of Laxmi Road shoe shop owner Chandan Krupadas Shewani was arrested early on Monday morning from a spot near Swargate.

The city crime branch identified him as Ajinkya Hanumant Dhumal (21), a resident of Saswad. Acting on a tip-off about his movement at Swargate, a team headed by assistant commissioner of police (crime) Shivaji Pawar and inspector Mahendra Jagtap rushed to the spot and took Dhumal into custody.

The investigators have not been able to establish the motive behind the murder of Shewani even after Dhumal’s arrest. “The main suspects who plotted the crime are still at large and the arrested trio were fringe players, hired for assistance at nominal payout,” Jagtap told TOI.

Shewani (48) was on way back to home from his shop in his car on the night of January 4 when a group of men intercepted his vehicle near Maldhakka Chowk and kidnapped him. His body with a couple of bullet wounds was found near Lonand in Satara district the next day. The Satara police found a note, purportedly written by the assailants, near Shewani’s body stating that he did not give them Rs2 crore and hence, they had to eliminate him.

The city police arrested Afridi Rauf Khan (23) of Nana Peth on January 7 and Sunil Gaikwad (25) of Katraj on January 10 for their alleged role in the kidnapping and murder of Shewani. Both, Khan and Gaikwad, are since lodged in the Yerawada central jail under magisterial custody.

Inspector Jagtap said, “Prima facie, the investigators are continuing to work on the extortion angle although they have not come across any evidence of extortion calls made to the victim’s family members. The suspects may have demanded a large sum of money from Shewani while he was being taken to Padegaon from the kidnap spot. The victim may have refused to fulfil their demand, which prompted the assailants to kill him.”

Jagtap said, “Shewani had no rivalry with anyone.”

Regarding Dhumal’s role, Jagtap cited the investigation and said, “Dhumal kept an eye on Shewani’s movement on the day of the crime and was in touch with the prime suspects, who plotted the kidnapping and murder. Dhumal followed Shewani on his two-wheeler and kept updating the suspects using his cellphone.”

As soon as Shewani reached Maldhakka Chowk, Dhumal and the other suspects, travelling in a car, intercepted Shewani’s vehicle and forced him into their car before speeding away, police said.

AHMEDABAD: US President Donald Trump’s bonhomie with Gujarat-origin Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was palpable on Monday. In his speech, Trump said that the 4 million strong Indian diaspora has contributed immensely to the development of the US. He also acknowledged the Gujarati diaspora by saying that one in four NRIs has roots in Gujarat.

NRGs in particular and NRIs in general are known to lean towards Democrats. But Trump’s stance on India and his support for the country in the global arena might swing the votes in his favour, believe a few diaspora members.

However, NRGs who were part of ‘Namaste Trump’ on Monday, saw the event as a reciprocation of the love which was on display during the ‘Howdy Modi’ programme last year in Texas. “I am sure the ‘Namaste Trump’ event will leave a deep impression on the US president who has called himself a friend of India and Indians,” said Haribhai Patel, a resident of Chicago and the vice-president of Republican Hindu Coalition.

Patel said that 50-odd NRGs had come on their own to the event as there was no official contingent of NRIs with Trump on his two-day India visit.

On some days, the entire lane gets wet because of excessive seepage. A wet road is always risky and may cause hardships to motorists. It will damage the road surface,” Paidgude added.

Since the flow of traffic in the grade separator is unidirectional, vehicles travel at high speed. Sunil Hegde, who often uses the the underpass to go towards Pune station, said two-wheeler riders often face difficulties while controlling the speed of their bikes and balance when they suddenly get into the wet patch of the carriageway.

“When one is travelling at speed, changing the lane becomes difficult. If not repaired, the problem may lead to serious accidents. The civic body should repair and maintain the facility at regular intervals to avoid such leaks,” Hegde said.

Regular travellers have complained about the loosened lid of the drainage lane which moves when a vehicle passes over it.

The authorities in PMC said they will inspect the entire patch and chalk out a plan to plug the seepage. “We will check the origin of the seepage and why water is on the road though there is a stormwater channel,” civic officials said.

Even when the underpass was being constructed, it ran into several delays-from removal of water lines to uprooting of trees and even the court’s permission.

Permissions from the water supply department to shift the old water lines and place the new ones took time and felling of trees needed the court’s permission.

Four arterial roads --University Road and Wellesley Road going towards the district court and Jangli Maharaj Road and Sancheti Bridge Road that join Boat Club Road and the Pune Regional Transport Office near Sangam bridge—converge here.

252,['25/02/2020'],Airport director says cargo export short of expectation,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Pune: International cargo exports from the city airport had not been impressive and far short of expectation, said airport director Kuldeep Singh on Monday, citing non-availability of land for shifting the current cargo complex as one of the major hindrances.

“We have 10 international flights per week. If we take optimum load of 2 tonnes per flight, our monthly international cargo handling should be in the range of 70 to 100 tonnes. We are far short of that figure. The constraints are the weather during summer, and the runway length,” he said.

Currently, the airport handles around 20-30 tonnes of international cargo per month, said officials. As the international cargo mostly comprises perishable goods, it poses a problem during summer as the airport does not have a cold storage facility. Though there has been some improvement in figures as per the data of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), constraints related to land availability and runway length are major roadblocks, he said.

Close to 260 tonnes of international cargo were handled by Pune airport in 2019 compared to 68 tonnes in 2018. “The present cargo complex will have to be demolished to pave way for the new terminal building. I am sure our operations will record a huge surge once we get a new cargo complex,” he said.

SpiceJet operates a daily flight from Pune to Dubai and Air India Express operates a flight on the same route three days a week.

“The present cargo complex is not up to the mark and has major space and storage issues. There were talks of it being shifted to an Indian Air Force (IAF) plot, but nothing happened. Moreover, the complex will have to shift from its current location as the new building will come up,” a source at the airport told TOI.

Anant Sardeshmukh, former director general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture, told TOI that exporters would come to Pune if the facilities were good. “A trader who has a setup in Mumbai will not consider switching to Pune unless he or she is convinced that the city has got proper infrastructure,” he said.

253,['25/02/2020'],Pune: Parking fine without sign on FC Road stuns citizens,"This story is from February 25, 2020

PUNE: Road users and regular visitors to Hotel Vaishali on Fergusson College Road are crying foul after being penalized by the traffic branch of the Pune police for parking their vehicles in a bay right outside the restaurant.

The traffic police had banned parking of any vehicle outside popular restaurants in the city, including Hotel Vaishali, following the German Bakery blast in 2010.

The stretch of the road initially had a wide footpath with two no-parking signs and a no-stopping sign.

However, as part of smart footpaths, the Pune Municipal Corporation has constructed a bay, which resembles parking bays on the rest of the road, creating confusion among citizens.

According to Gaurav Shah, an urban designer and a regular visitor, the traffic police have been taking action against vehicles found halting or parked in the bay.

“There is no board outside the hotel which says that the bay is a no-parking zone. There is one board with a cross on it which only says no stopping. All similar bays along FC Road are being used for parking and it is obvious that people will park outside Hotel Vaishali as well. If the parking restrictions have not been lifted, what is the need for such a bay?” he said.

Sayali Jadhav, another regular visitor to the area, said, “My friend’s vehicle was parked outside Hotel Vaishali and she was fined. Even when the old footpath had not been broken and there were no parking boards, many four-wheelers could be seen parked outside the restaurant. Now, a bay has been created and the traffic police are taking action. There is no board or sign saying that the area is a no-parking zone. Instead of taking action, the department should inform people that it is a no-parking zone. This should be done till proper sign boards are installed. Once these are installed, they can take action against anyone flouting the rules.”

On the construction of the bay, executive engineer from PMC’s road department, Dinkar Gojare, said, “After the German Bakery blast, the Pune police had notified the areas outside some restaurants in Koregaon Park and Hotel Vaishali and Hotel Roopali on FC Road as no-parking zones. I had coordinated with the traffic police to know whether they want to have parking space as once the construction for the new footpath is done, it cannot be rolled back. I had initially designed a kerb outside Hotel Vaishali. However, together we decided to provide a bay which could be used as a drop-off location thus keeping the carriageway free.”

Police sub-inspector of Deccan traffic division Ramesh Bhote said the bay has been constructed to ensure that the carriageway does not get blocked by vehicles dropping off passengers.

“We have been taking action against vehicles parked here but we only request drivers of vehicles that have halted to move away. Action against vehicles that have halted is taken only if the driver engages in arguments or fights instead of moving away. We have requested the PMC to install no-parking sign boards at the spot to prevent confusion. The sign boards should be installed in two days,” Bhote added.

The four youths used duplicate keys to steal the vehicles

PUNE: Four youths, including a criminal on record and a professional dancer, had stolen 25 two-wheelers and kept them at secluded places to look for prospective customers but they ran out of luck when a patrol team from the Hadapsar police zeroed in on them on Sunday evening.

The arrested persons are Sanjay Bhosale alias Sonya (20) from Osmanabad, Hrishikesh Babasaheb Dongre alias Bittu (19) and professional dancer Abhishek Anil Bhadange alias Monu (19) from Latur, and Ajit Kailash Kamble alias Vitthal (21) from Hadapsar. Bhosale is a criminal on police records.

The foursome was checking expensive vehicles in a parking lot at Magarpatta Chowk suspiciously on Sunday evening when the police team led by assistant inspector Sanjay Chavan, under assistant commissioner of police Kalyanrao Vidhate (Hadapsar division) and senior inspector Ramesh Sathe, also the Hadapsar police station in-charge, arrested them.

Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Suhas Bawache said, “We have seized 25 bikes and scooters from the youths. They used duplicate keys for stealing the two-wheelers parked for a long time at parking lots. Investigations revealed that the youths also broke some vehicles’ locks and pulled the ignition wire for starting them.”

He said, “The suspects are close friends. They are not well educated. They came together and stole vehicles for making fast bucks.”

Assistant inspector Sanjay Chavan said, “Of the 25 two-wheelers seized from the youths concealed at Manjri and Hadapsar areas, we have identified the owners of 22. The process of tracing the three other bike owners is in progress. Investigations have revealed that the vehicles were stolen from Pune city and Pune rural areas in 2019-20. The youths will remain in police custody till February 26 because we suspect their involvement in a few more cases.”

The policemen responsible for the action include Pratap Gaikwad, Nitin Munde, Vinod Shivle, Akbar Shaikh and Shahid Shaikh.

PUNE: A 20-year-old youth was arrested on Sunday on the charge of setting five two-wheelers parked in front of a mechanic’s shop on fire in Pimple Nilakh.

The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday. A 36-year-old man Raju Telangi, a mechanic, has lodged an FIR with the Sangvi police. The vehicles that were damaged in the fire were owned by Telangi’s customers.

Sub-inspector Yashwant Salunkhe of the Sangvi police told TOI that the incident was a fallout of old dispute between the youth and Telangi.

“Telangi and the youngster had entered into a brawl over some petty issue a few days ago. In a fit of rage, the suspect poured petrol on the five two-wheelers that were parked in front of Telangi’s shop before setting them on fire,” the officer said.

Salunkhe said while lodging the complaint, Telangi had suspected the involvement of the youngster. “When we brought the youth in for questioning, he admitted to his involvement in the incident. Though further investigation is still under way,” he said.

The youth was produced before the court and released on bail, Salunkhe said.

Parab said that despite repeated requests, Goa Dairy is not ready to roll back the raise in fodder cost. He also said that after a protest by farmers, chief minister Pramod Sawant had promised to reduce the price of fodder cost, but no action has been initiated.

“Once again, we are requesting the chief minister to personally look into the matter on a priority basis and solve the grievances of dairy farmers,” said Vaibhav Parab, a dairy farmer from Amthane in Bicholim.

Pune: The city will play host to the three-day Asia Economic Dialogue beginning February 28, which will see decision-makers and influencers contemplate on the global trade rules and Asia’s role in the same.

The Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) is one of the three main national dialogues organised/supported by the ministry of external affairs. It focuses on India and Asia’s rise as an economic powerhouse and also the region’s aspirations to get a proportionate share in leading world forums.

“The global economic landscape has changed dramatically. Over 60% of the world’s GDP is coming from Asia, but the global trading system dates back to the 19th or 20th century, and is dominated by OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) thinking,” said Raghunath Mashelkar, the president of Pune International Centre (PIC), which is organising the event.

The AED hopes to use the dialogue to also tell the India narrative, which is reflective of its position as the world’s fifth largest economy.

On hosting the AED in Pune, Mashelkar said, “Davos-like dialogues have been generally focused in Delhi. So we thought, why not Pune? Because this city is an educational and cultural hub, the ministry of external affairs and the PIC have come together to create the AED.”

The sessions will focus on World Trade Organisation reforms, global value chain, agriculture trade and tariffs, greater participation of developing countries, financial innovations from Asia and Africa, among other important topics.

“Some of these discussions will bring many key stakeholders together in shaping deliberations that will eventually lead to a futuristic governance architecture on international trade,” Prashant Girbane, director, PIC, said.

The organisers are looking to position the AED as one of the main conferences in Asia to look out for.

“This is a geo-economics conference and the theme this year is “Asia and the Emerging International Trading System“. Ministers from the Maldives and Sri Lanka, besides businesspersons from all over Asia and the world will attend it. This will become an annual event, which we hope to develop as an Asian Davos,” Gautam Bambawale, AED convenor and former Indian Ambassador to Bhutan, Pakistan & China, said.

Trichy: Gated communities in the city are gradually adapting independent solid waste recycling within their compounds as a section of gated communities here are producing manure from the waste to use in gardens and for trees.

The most recent to join the list of zero-waste apartments is Rohini Nakshatra apartment in Sangliyandapuram. With 62 housing units, the apartment generates around 12-15 kg of biodegradable waste, mostly food and kitchen waste per day, coming under Ariyamangalam zone.

Based on suggestion from the civic body, the builder installed a couple of green bins at a cost of Rs 1.5 lakh with a capacity of 850kg, that can decompose biodegradable waste into manure. “Maids will collect the waste from houses and shred the degradable waste before dumping them into the green bin. Microbe powder will be sprayed to quicken the decomposition process,” said L M Raj, in-charge of Rohini Nakshatra apartment.

The gated community is processing 12 kg of biodegradable waste each day, while the corporation collects the recyclable non-biodegradable waste such as plastic from the residents.

The bins can decompose the waste without emitting a foul odour. After one of the green bin is filled, support staff will fill the waste in another green bin. In the meantime, the bin completely dumped with waste will produce manure within 45 days.

“The gated community is using the manure for growing garden. If required, we will also help them find buyers for the surplus manure generated. More such apartments will be encouraged to follow suit,” said S Karthikeyan, sanitary officer of Ariyamangalam zone. Similarly, the number of apartments recycling their own waste has increased in Srirangam zone. Officials said that apartments treated as bulk waste generator will have to achieve self-sufficiency in managing their waste.

SELF SUFFICIENCY IN WASTE MANAGEMENT:

Options available:

1) Green bin: Rs4,000 to Rs2 lakh

2) Automatic composter: Rs2 lakh to Rs20 lakh

3) Biogas plant: Rs10,000 to Rs2 lakh

Total apartment buildings/gated communities: 400-450

Nashik: Two friends, both girls aged 16, left their homes in the Indiranagar area on Sunday evening over domestic reasons, but were traced within the next couple of hours. They were counselled and handed back to their parents.

Senior inspector Nilesh Mainkar of the Indiranagar police station said, “The parents came to the police station at around 5.30 pm stating that their daughters had left their homes over domestic reasons. The girls had also left a note behind to their parents saying they were leaving.”

Taking serious cognizance of the matter, the police prepared a team to trace the teenage girls.

They also alerted the Nashik Road police station, the railway police at Igatpuri and Kasara stations to keep a vigil on trains arriving at these key junctions.

Mainkar said they got a tip-off from one of their informers regarding spotting girls matching the description at Kalika temple area of Nashik. “At around 7.30pm, we had found the girls. They were then counselled and handed over to their parents,” said Mainkar.

The entire operation of tracing the girls and handing them back safely to their parents was conducted under the guidance of police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil, deputy police commissioner Vijay Kharat and other senior officials of the city.

TIRUPUR: Burglars broke into the State Bank of India’s branch on the Palladam – Tirupur Road to decamp with cash and jewellery worth several lakhs, just three months after a failed attempt.

The heist came to light on Monday morning when the staff of the branch, at Kallipalayam, returned after the holiday weekend. They informed senior bank officials, who informed police .

The news was kept under wraps till afternoon to prevent a public scare. But rumours began spreading by afternoon and depositors gathered at the branch in the evening. Police officers pacified them and ensured that the burglars would be arrested soon, and the stolen items would be recovered.

Bank authorities have not ascertained the quantum of money and jewellery stolen, a police officer said. “The burglars had drilled holes and forced open some safety lockers. In that process, locks of other lockers got jammed. So, a technical team from the bank’s Coimbatore office will arrive to open those lockers. Only then the exact value of cash and gold can be calculated,” a police officer said.

A special team has been formed to nab the gang, said superintendent of police Disha Mittal, who inspected the spot.

Police believe the incident could have happened on Sunday night. The miscreants had smashed the glass windows and bent the window grill to enter the building.

The incident has brought to light the lack of safety features at the bank branch. It lacks security guards for night duty and burglar alarms, despite the earlier bid to loot it last October. “The burglars also took away a CCTV camera installed in front of the branch,” the officer added.

Nagpur: The Scientific Society Hall in Laxmi Nagar turned musical on Sunday as ‘ Sur Aur Noor 2’ paid tuneful tributes to Bollywood’s 57 divas through 55 songs that touched the souls and captured the hearts of the audience .

Though Kanak Sur Mandir set the stage for the grand show, the spotlight was however on Kanaka Gadkari who regaled the gathering with her mesmerizing voice on all the 55 counts.

The audience was taken on a Bollywood journey which began with songs picturised on the majestic Madhubala and ended with the amazing Alia Bhatt.

With a display of various genres like semi-classical, devotional, patriotic and much more, Kanaka was a picture of versatility at its very best.

Anchor Shweta Shelgaonkar made the entertainment wholesome by adding a heady dash which included a brief introduction coupled with anecdotes of every star before every song.

‘Aaiye meherbaan’, in remembrance of Madhubala, left the audience spellbound. Mumtaz, the epitome of beauty, was brought alive with the song ‘Bindiya chamkegi’.

Ravishing Rekha’s ‘Piya baawri’ gave a classy account of the timeless beauty. ‘Pyar karne wale pyar karte hain’, picturised on another diva, Parveen Babi, was another tribute by Kanaka.

The other popular songs which left the audience glued to their seats included ‘Panchhi banoo udti phiru’, ‘Barsat mein’, ‘Jaa jaa bewafa’, ‘Gore gore baanke chore’, ‘Tadbeer se bigdi hui taqdeer bana le’, ‘Tora mann darpan kehlaye’, ‘Yeh zindagi usi ki’ and ‘Ghadi ghadi mora’.

‘Yeh ishq haaye baithe bithaye’, filmed on the scintillating Kareena Kapoor Khan and ‘Pinga’, picturised on damsels Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra, amazed the audience.

Kanaka sounded melodious with ‘Saawar lun’, picturised on the starry Sonakshi Sinha.

While ‘Ae qatan’ saw the flow of patriotism, ‘Hungama ho gaya’, ‘Ainvayi ainvayi , ‘Piyu bole’ and ‘Beedi jalaile’ entertained the audience to the hilt.

The event would have been incomplete had it not been for musicians Govind Gadhikar, Moreshwar Dahasahastra, Vishvajeet Paserkar, Gaurav Tanksale and Sourabh Killedar.

Chandigarh: In the absence of chief minister Amarinder Singh in the Punjab assembly, Congress MLAs struggled to launch a counter-offensive at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs who cornered the treasury benches during the budget session. The incumbent party legislators went into a huddle to strategise how to blunt the opposition’s frontal attack on the sensitive issue of DGP’s references to Kartarpur corridor.

However, lack of proper coordination was visible as the Congress MLAs tried to go on the offensive after some SAD legislators referred to the Congress leadership while raising slogans against the government. Led by cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, the Congress MLAs too raised slogans against the Akali leadership when the House resumed after the first adjournment of half hour.

The senior Congress MLAs, including Randhawa, were apparently upset at their party colleagues not taking on the opposition parties even as it tried to drag the party leaders into the local issues raised in the House.

Most Congress MLAs gathered around parliamentary affairs minister Brahm Mohindra and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal as Warring took the lead in planning the party’s strategy in consultation with others. Later, the Congress MLAs too flashed pictures and raised slogans against the Akali leaders.

The opposition parties had already announced that they would raise the issue of the DGP on the floor of the House even though the police chief had clarified his statement on the Kartarpur corridor. Later, when some of the Congress MLAs left their seats to take on the opposition, cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi had to signal them to go back

Dehradun/Pithoragarh: Women members of the state Congress on Monday staged a protest against the Trivendra Singh Rawat government’s decision to cut liquor prices in the state. The protesters burnt an effigy of the state government in the city’s Astley hall area. Similar protests took place in Haldwani and Pithoragarh as well.

The protesters claimed that the hill state’s women will be the worst hit by the decision to make liquor cheaper. Kamlesh Raman, head of Congress’s women wing, told TOI that the party will ""mobilise women from each house -- be it in hills or plains, urban or rural areas, to raise their voices against the anti-people policies of the BJP government in the state.""

“Women will be the worst victims of the policy to make liquor cheaper, even as items of daily use continue to be steep. Easy access to liquor will only give rise to increased domestic violence. All of this is being done for revenue,” said Raman.

Meanwhile in Pithoragarh, Congress staged a demonstration at the district magistrate’s office. The protesters also submitted a memorandum to roll back the new excise policy.

Congress state spokesperson MD Joshi said, “The BJP government has an anti-people attitude, which is why it keeps increasing rates of transport, electricity, house tax and other basic facilities but cuts the rates of alcohol. This decision shows that the government has surrendered to the liquor mafia and is promoting alcohol consumption in the state.”

To recall, the state cabinet, in a meeting on Saturday, gave its approval to the excise policy for the fiscal year of 2020-21. This policy sets the overall revenue target at Rs 3,500 crore, about 15% more than the last fiscal. Liquor prices are likely to decrease by almost 20% after the new excise policy comes into effect. This dip will make liquor in Uttarakhand cheaper than what it costs in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. The new policy alsi gives power to issue bar licenses to district magistrates.

TRICHY: As the corporation has indirectly hinted at stopping waste collection from buildings in a month or two, residents have urged the civic body to stop levying solid waste management (SWM) user charge for collecting waste. Residents said that the corporation should not charge residents who recycle their own waste.

“Encouraging apartments to recycle waste is fine, but will Trichy Corporation stop collecting the SWM user fee alongside property tax for properties that recycle their own waste?” said H Ghouse Baig, a resident of Khajamalai. At present, the corporation collects Rs150 to Rs1,000 from buildings as user fee.

“Residents have been asking us to stop collecting SWM user fee. The decision has to be taken by the state-level authorities,” an official source said. The civic body, however, justified the collection of SWM charge by stating that residents will depend on the civic body during disasters and major events.

Lack of space is other reason cited by apartment buildings for opposing the ‘recycle your own waste’ move. While new apartment buildings have space to process and recycle waste, old ones in the city without open space are in a fix.

Majithia and Cheema, during the meeting with the functionaries here, said they were rejecting the resignations.

In a statement issued on Monday, Thapar said both the leaders gave a patient hearing to them and assured them of taking all steps to redress the issues raised by them. While Rakhra claimed that the party drifted away from the ideology based on which it was formed in 1920 and this had provoked widespread unrest among workers, Thapar said Dhindsas were dismissed in an ‘undemocratic manner’ and everyone should have the right to raise their voice on issues concerning the party. Majitha and Cheema said they had an elaborate meeting with the disgruntled functionaries. He said leadership had promised the office-bearers that they would be given more say in the functioning of the party and their concerns would be addressed soon.

P Kandasamy, one of the protesters, said, “We have been demanding the district administration to remove encroachments along the waterbodies for a long time.

Some of the revenue villages, including Sundakkamuthur in the corporation limit, falls under the Hill Area Conservation Authority (HACA) category. It has become difficult to sell land in villages that come under HACA as it involves getting approval from the authority, he said.

“It has been one of our long-pending demands to limit the area that falls under HACA and remove the villages off the list. But, it was not considered while making amendments in the Town and Country Planning Act,” he added.

He also demanded the state government to take steps to find a solution to curtail human-animal conflict in the district. About seven months ago, the district collector had assured to take steps to find a solution to reduce the conflict and nothing has changed on the ground so far, he added.

Police said sub-inspector N Udhayasuriyan was investigating a case against the accused, V Prabhu, of Valparai, following a complaint filed by J Vellaisamy , 42. Both of them work in meat stalls in the municipality market. “Vellaisamy submitted a written complaint that Prabhu and his friend Senthil Kumar were abusing him in foul language and threatening to murder him following a quarrel over a business dispute,” a police officer said.

The sub-inspector filed an FIR under Section 294 (b) (using obscene words) and Section 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and subsequently went to the municipality market for the preliminary investigation.

“When the sub-inspector came back to the station, Prabhu and Senthil Kumar were waiting for him. The officer started questioning them and it gradually led to an argument. Prabhu lost his cool and started verbally abusing the officer. HE grabbed the officer by his uniform and started hitting him,” the officer said.

Other police personnel at the spot separated the duo. “However, Prabhu threatened to kill the sub-inspector and fled from the spot with his friend, ignoring the warnings,” the officer said.

The traders alleged that corporation was not taking action against the makeshift daily retail vegetable markets in Srirangam which play a spoilsport to their revenue.

The protesting retail vegetable traders from the Srirangam Town Vegetable Seller Association said around 150 traders were paying rent and occupying the shops allotted to them by the corporation in Chithirai Street.

However, some other traders were conducting daily makeshift vegetable markets at Geethapuram and Teppakulam Street in the past few weeks.

The association said these traders were jeopardising the business of the association members by selling the vegetables at a lower price.

“We are paying rent to the civic body to occupy their space. But a section of traders from other parts of the district are hosting daily vegetable market in the vacant space without paying any rent. Though we petitioned the civic body to stop the daily markets, it didn’t act. The local body should support us,” R Govindaraj, president of Srirangam town vegetable seller association, said.

Following the protest, the district administration instructed the revenue department and the local body to hold a peace talk with traders.

Submitting a petition to the district collector in the grievance meeting, they said that reduction of green cover due to urbanization and vast landscape under eucalyptus plantation has robbed the wild animals of their habitat.

S Niyaz Ahmed, district secretary of the party, said that death of monkeys, peacock and spotted deer in road accidents have become usual in Pudukottai.

This is primarily because they lost their home as Pudukottai has lost significant green cover in the recent years.

Roughly 40,000 hectares of land in Pudukottai district is under eucalyptus cultivation. Majority of the cultivation is carried out by forest department for their commercial gain, this has been affecting wildlife, he said.

Panaji: With the footfall of charter tourists decreasing, tourism stakeholders are now looking into probable reasons for the fall in numbers. The ‘Export Strategy of Goa’ document prepared by the department of industries stated the lack of provision of night parking at Goa International Airport results in fewer charter flights arriving in the state.

Goa witnessed a decline in tourist footfalls from the UK in the last two months of 2019. The November-December period in 2018 saw 69 charters from UK bringing in 19,956 tourists, while the same period last year saw just 9,723 tourists arriving on 36 charters.

As a result of infrastructural constraints, though charter flights land at Dabolim , they have to return to their point of origin and come back to pick up passengers on a scheduled date.

Only after the night parking facility is created, will charter flights be able to land late at night. The document suggests that Goa has to expand its connectivity to European and Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia.

It is also suggested that the tourism department introduce floating bays by putting to use unutilised barges for weddings and other events. Further, tourist zones may be earmarked by relaxing noise pollution norms.

Pointing out that there is no online mechanism, the document suggested that the tourism ministry should have a single-window clearance to grant approvals and permissions. “Making it online and specifying time delivery norms will increase the number of events,” stated the document.

The state should consider promoting Goa tourism as cruise tourism, the document suggested. For this, outbound immigration processing facility must be created. “Introduce e-visas and landing cards,” the document stated. Currently, identity cards are not accepted at ports.

Stating that tourists do not like the idea of having to stand in queue, it suggested that international ports have special processes for cruise tourists which exempt them from the exasperating exercise.

“The tourism department will also have to put its infrastructure in place before it aggressively promotes cruise tourism,” the document said, adding, “More berths have to be added so that ships are not made to wait till a berth gets empty.”

There is also a suggestion that an ombudsman be appointed for quick dispute settlement and ease e-visa processes. The immigration officer can go to the ship, complete all the formalities and the get e-visa done, a system that is followed in Gulf countries.

LONDON: A Punjabi man charged by detectives investigating the death of three Punjabi men in east London on January 19 refused to leave his prison cell and attend his plea and trial preparation hearing on Monday morning.

Sandeep Singh, 29, who lives in Romford, east London, on January 27 was charged with conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and remanded in custody at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court the next day.

Judge Martyn Zeidman QC, said, “I received a note from prison that the defendant does not agree he needs to attend court and the prison marks he is fit to attend court but doesn’t agree he needs to come. If that is correct that would be a real cheek by this defendant because he does need to be here.”

Zeidman said: “This is obviously a very serious matter. This is very sensitive case for a number of reasons not least a number of people are dead.”

The judge has set July 27 as the provisional start date for a 10-day trial for Sandeep, if a trial is needed, and March 9 for him to appear to enter his plea. “It is absolutely clear, he must be here on the next occasion as this is not suitable for a prison hearing,” he said.

Narinder Singh Lubhaya, 29, from Hoshiarpur , Malkit Singh Dhillon alias Baljinder Singh, 37, from Sultanpur Lodhi, and Harinder Kumar alias Honey, 30, from Patiala, were found dead on the road in Seven Kings. Harinder’s funeral was held on Monday in Hainault, Redbridge. His family, who flew to London for it, will carry his ashes back to India. Bodies of Narinder and Baljinder are expected to be flown to Punjab this week. The Seven Kings Gurdwara has been raising money for the three families to cover funeral costs and help them.

Ludhiana: Ishroop Kaur Brar is pursuing Class XI (humanities) in Sacred Heart Convent School, Sarabha Nagar. She scored 97.4% in her Class X. She said, “On the whole, I had an enriching experience while giving my CBSE board exams for the first time. After all, it is self confidence and hard work that pay off. And leave the rest to god.” Here, she shares the routine followed by her while preparing for the board exams.

How did manage to get high scores?

Simple, by paying 100% attention during class lectures. It helped me grasp concepts easily. Secondly, i worked consistently and, to be honest, smartly too. I never hesitated in seeking help or clarification from my school teachers.

What tips and tricks do you have for current batch of students?

Work hard with dedication and sincerity and be attentive in the class. Have a balanced study schedule. Do not take any stress or pressure whatsoever. Have faith in yourself, and in God.

What kind of routine did you follow before and during exams?

I was consistent. I studied for 5-6 hours every day. I also made sure to get adequate sleep — for atleast seven hours, I didn’t skimp on that. To keep my attention from sagging, I took short naps of 15 to 20 minutes. I also studied NCERT books throughly. My success mantra was to study with devotion, focus and determination. The rest, I left it to the God.

How was your experience in exams?

I was both apprehensive and excited. The constant support of my parents, teachers and the regular prayers to the Almighty encouraged me and made me realise my inner strength. Also, exams are stimulating and provide an opportunity for intellectual expression. Needless to say, there is always that tingly anxiety.

Who was your inspiration?

My elder sister

What did you do to relax?

I meditated, went for evening walks, listening to music and painted in my free time.

Trichy: DMK has demanded the government to include Trichy , Karur and Ariyalur districts in the protected special agriculture zone (PSAZ) in the recently introduced bill in Tami Nadu assembly. A resolution to this effect was passed in the DMK cadre meeting in the district on Monday.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palanisami had introduced the bill in the assembly on February 20 announcing Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, five blocks each of Cuddalore and Pudukottai districts as protected special agriculture zone. The bill came in the wake of relentless opposition from people and political parties against hydrocarbon projects in the delta region.

The bill also termed industries like copper smelter, zinc smelter, aluminium smelter; iron ore process plants, tannery and few others to be adversely affecting the agriculture sector.

The issue was also reflected in the weekly grievance day meeting at the Trichy collectorate on Monday. Tamilaga Eri Matrum Aatrupaasana Vivasayigal Sangam members staged a protest by wearing ‘naamam’ on their forehead and rolling on the ground before handing a petition to the officials. State president of the association P Viswanathan raised his apprehension that Trichy, Karur, Ariyalur may have been excluded with deliberate intention. “We fear that the government may start research in the area for (mineral) reserves. So, we strongly demand inclusion of the three districts under the protected special agriculture zone,” he said.

PUNE: The civic body is finding it tough to take action against illegally parked private buses because of non-availability of big jammers , an official said.

The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) had planned to take action against such buses with the help of the traffic police from the first week of February. But, the big jammers required for the same were not available with the civic body, which put a brake on the drive against illegal parking. The operators of these buses are now fined on the spot.

“The action is jointly being taken by the PMC and the traffic department. A few drives have already been carried out. The buses are parked on the road during the day as well as night. It not only causes traffic problems, but also leads to accident threats,” a senior PMC official said, adding that the drive had been suspended temporarily, and would begin again soon.

“The civic administration will procure jammers for this drive and hand it over to the traffic department. Around 100 jammers will be bought,” Madhav Jagtap, head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department, said.

Designated parking bays have been set up for private bus operators. But, many of them do not park their vehicles there, an official said. The areas where the buses are mostly found parked include JM Road, Deccan, Shivajinagar , Satara Road, Nagar Road and Sinhagad Road. The PMC in association with the police department and private land owners has given operators space at Sangamwadi . Inter-state and intra-state private travel companies use this space for parking.

The civic body had given notices to those violating parking norms. Those who were not adhering to the notices were facing action. No new notices are being issued now and the civic administration has been directly taking action against them, an official said.

The private tour operators in the city take around 5,000 trips a day. Over 1,000 operators have their buses visit Pune for the tours. Different buses are used for these services ranging from mini buses to sleeper coaches.

The city corporation had recently evicted a group that had encroached on the 2.25-acre plot, said Prakash , a resident. “We have been staying at Kamarajapuram from 1961, when the layout was launched. The corporation did not do anything to develop the common space, which was earlier a part of ward 45 but is now ward 32. Gradually, some people began encroaching the space and stayed there. But a few months ago, the corporation evicted them after giving them houses at Keeranatham,” he said.

After the encroachers were shifted, the residents expected the civic body to develop the land by setting up a park, playground, anganwadi or a primary health centre. “But a new set of encroachers seem to be moving in,” said Pattiammal. “Most of us belong to the SC community and other economically-backward sections. We would benefit from a community hall, a primary health centre offering free medical care and playground for our children.”

A new slum may come up in the residential area, the petition said. “There are rumours that some people want to construct a church or a temple on the land,” said another resident.

“The corporation should develop the land. Only then it will be useful to us,” said Jothimani , another resident.

Scindia was in an open jeep, surrounded by a large gathering of supporters. Garlands were being thrown at him to welcome him to Guna district headquarters. From the opposite direction came Digvijaya Singh and his son, minister for urban administration Jaivardhan Singh, who were headed for Indore.

On seeing each other, both leaders got out of their vehicles and rushed to greet each other. They laughed, hugged and garlanded one another as followers of both leaders cheered and raised slogans. The meeting lasted a few minutes but the reverberations were felt across the state.

Later, speaking to reporters in Ashokenagar, Digvijaya said, “There was no meeting scheduled between us. But since I was in Guna and came to know that he (Scindia) is also there, I thought I should meet him, or you (media) will say there is tension between the two.”

Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan took a dig at the Scindia-Digvijaya meet, saying: “In Congress party, Raja (Digvijaya Singh) and Maharaja (Jyotiraditya Scindia) hold their courts. We are poor, come from poor families and are always with the people. But Congress has become a circus with every leader pulling in a different direction.” Chouhan argued that while one Congress leader holds meetings in his office, another threatens to ‘hit-the-streets’, and yet another leader says, “Let him hit the streets.”

“In their attempt to finish each other, the state is getting a severe blow. Implementation of policies and schemes is suffering and funds for construction of 2 lakh homes for the poor has gone back,” Chouhan alleged.

Minister for law P C Sharma rejected Chouhan’s allegations, and said: “Look at the body language of both leaders. Everything is fine in Congress. There are no differences. And in this circus, our leaders are the heroes while the person making the allegation is the clown.”

In the race for the chief ministerial post in December 2018, Digvijaya had apparently supported Kamal Nath. Now, both Singh and Scindia are in the race for nominations to Rajya Sabha. Digvijaya completes his first tenure in the Upper House this April and could be sent for a second term. There are two more seats that fall vacant, one of which will be for a Congress nominee. Speculation is rife that Scindia, former Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha, could be sent to Upper House along with Digvijaya, though a section of the state Congress rooted for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to be nominated from MP. Scindia is also in the race for state PCC president’s post, so is Digvijaya.

297,['25/02/2020'],Forest dept struggles to curtail poaching in Trichy,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Trichy: The Trichy forest department is unable to curtail poaching as many cases go unnoticed. And, even the few cases that are reported and where the guilty are arrested, all of them walk free by paying a petty penalty.

Experts say that increasing activity of poaching reflect on the poor awareness among people and meagre effort from forest department to curtail such incidents.

Few days ago, about 50 villagers in Manapparai picketed the taluk office seeking permission to hunt wild animals inside the reserve forest.

However, the forest department denied them permission and warned of strict action under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 if anyone is found indulging in poaching activities.

In another incident, more than 40 people were detained by the forest personnel on Saturday for trespassing into the reserve forest in Thatchankurichi. Sources said a state minister intervened to release the detained people. Subsequently, they were released by the officials after collecting fine.

While in such attempted poaching incidents, offenders are usually sent to jail.

However, bowing to pressure from local leaders, the guilty often get away with a meagre fine.

R Chandrasekar MLA of Manapparai, who had contacted the forest personnel on behalf of the Manapparai villagers for permission, said that those seeking permission aren’t poachers.

“It has been a traditional practice to hunt rabbits during Mahashivrathri and people strongly believe that their prayers are incomplete without hunting,” he said.

A forest department official said that they cannot allow such activities as there is a possibility that protected wildlife species could be harmed along with other small animals. There was no significant step towards preventing poaching incidents by the forest department which has largely contributed to such incidents, says A Kumaraguru, conservation scientist from biodiversity conservation foundation (BCF).

Ludhiana: Protesters at the Ludhiana’s “Shaheen Bagh” on Monday burnt the effigy of Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adiyanath to protest against the alleged police atrocities in Aligarh on Sunday.

Addressing the protesters, president of Majlis-e-Ahrar Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi, who is Shahi Imam Punjab, said police’s atrocities in Aligarh will only be considered as murder of democracy. He added that the UP administration on directions of their political masters is walking on the road once tread by General Dyer.

Shahi Imam said those men in uniform should understand that there is rule of law in the country and a time will come when those committing atrocities will have to go to jail. He added that the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) agitation is to save the constitution of the country and it cannot be muzzled.

Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman said those threatening to turn Shaheen Bagh into Jallianwala Bagh should listen with open ears that such threats will not be heard in independent India and no one will be allowed to resort to ‘goondaism’.

Personal secretary to Shahi Imam said the protests at the Ludhiana’s Shaheen Bagh have entered 12th day and people of various faiths are coming there to voice their anger against CAA and National Register of Citizenship. He added that to promote national unity and against CAA and NRC, a kavi sammelan (poetry evening) was organised at the protest site.

During the session, poet Ghulam Hassan Qaisar recited his poem ‘Na Tan Ki Baat Karo, Na Dhan Ki Baat Karo, Jahaan Khaloos Mile Uss Watan Ki Baat Karo’. Also poets Rajinder Rajan, Manohar Vijay, Dalip Aodhi, Sukhwinder Andoh, Aalima Khaton, Niyam Jigar, Mustkeem Karimi, Johar Wastawi, and Salman Rehbar recited their poems.

299,['25/02/2020'],"Meet Komal, the first woman doc from Madia tribe","This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: Neither the rattling guns of Maoists and police nor the acute backwardness of her native village, nestling deep in forest on border of Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, could sway the determined steps of Komal Madavi.

Daughter of a farmer father and mother, who is a nurse at a primary health centre (PHC) in Maoist-affected Gadchiroli district, 22-year-old Komal became the first woman doctor from Madia tribe, one of the three tribal groups classified as particularly vulnerable in the state.

Komal, a student of Shri Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College and Hospital, Yavatmal, attained that distinction when her final year’s results were declared earlier this month. Her younger sister, Payal, studying at GMCH Nagpur, is likely to follow her feat in another two years.

Komal’s dream now is to open a hospital in her village which suffers from backwardness due to Maoist-related issues. “I have seen how my own people suffer to get even basic medical facilities which always pushed me to become a doctor. My mother’s being a nurse was another motivation. I used to always write an essay or prepare speech in my early days in schools on my aim of becoming a doctor. Soon, it had started to run in my blood,” said an elated Komal aims to be a surgeon.

The siblings come from a village where people are still struggling for basic amenities and poor infrastructure. There is a solitary bus service and the nearest railway station is more than 100-km away in Telangana state. It has a small PHC to cater to the medical needs of the local population. The closest town Sironcha is more than 45 km and district headquarters 230km away. During 2019 national and state elections, the place had to be transformed into a fortress so polling could take place.

Komal, who studied till Standard IV at her village’s ZP school, would speak only Madia language when she took admission at Dharmarao High School at Sironcha in the Standard V as her mother got transferred out of Zinganur to the new place. Learning Marathi was first of the many challenges she faced. Despite the odds, she scored 84% in her board examination.

Komal’s father Kasa, a school dropout after Standard VII, may not have an academic background but he nurtured a dream for his elder daughter. His decision to send Komal to Nagpur for her higher secondary education meant another struggle for her. The girl had to adapt to city life and also fight home-sickness. It took a toll on result of her board examination.

It also reflected in her performance in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) which she could not clear in 2013. “I wanted to quit but father egged me on. In 2014, I managed to crack it comfortably,” recalled Komal.

Komal’s take on Maoist movement of her district is positive. “They may have been present around me but they never came in my way even once nor bothered my family. One must come here to see and feel the serene nature, the beautiful villages and forests unlike anywhere else. There is more to Gadchiroli than just Maoists,” she said.

Trichy: On the third day of the international conference of National Research centre for Banana (NRCB), a farmer drew the attention of everyone by visiting all the stalls put up in the exhibition and insisted on keeping the names of the stalls in Tamil besides having names in English.

The farmer was of the view that the farmers knowing only Tamil could not make use of the exhibition organised by the government by spending huge money.

When farmers are visiting the stalls and listening to the staff telling about their product, a 68-year old man visiting all the stalls starting from one and appealed to the representatives of each stall to write their company or agency’s name in Tamil with folded hands.

He has been identified as S Natarajan, a resident of Raja Colony in the city. He identified himself as a farmer visited each and every stall established at around 75 and questioned them how farmers who have arrived from rural areas could understand what was going on that particular stall.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police will be on very high alert in the next 24 hours as intelligence agencies have received inputs that the riots in the city could intensify in order to put the international spotlight on Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) with President Donald Trump in the capital.The intelligence branch and Special Cell are keeping a close tab on the developments and coordinating with the intelligence bureau with regular updates which are being further shared with secret service officials who are in charge of Trump’s security. The security on routes leading to Rajghat was reviewed on Monday evening and additional forces will be deployed to keep it out of bounds for people.The agencies are also learnt to be probing the role of at least three organisations, including Popular Front of India (PFI), in fanning Monday’s violence which spiralled out of control. The outfit is already under probe on allegations of funding anti-CAA protests in UP and Delhi.After the death of one of its cops and injuries to four dozen others, the police brass is reworking its strategy to tackle the riots. A meeting was called late on Monday to review the situation and decide the plan of action for Tuesday.The plan to whip up frenzy in north-east Delhi seems to have been set in motion days in advance and only intensified on Sunday night. Stones and Molotov cocktails were piled up at strategic locations like houses, rooftops, balconies and corners of lanes inside colonies. It is disturbing that the police did not anticipate this or failed to crack down.Perhaps because of the impending visit of the US President or lack of leadership and clear orders from the police brass, the force was evidently ill-prepared and hesitant in nipping the trouble in the bud. They were inadequately deployed in such a volatile area and reinforcements had to be rushed in and later additional forces deployed when much of the damage was done.Many cops agreed that there seemed to have been a lack of preventive measures too compared with the past scenarios where Delhi Police even moved to restrict internet services in several areas of Delhi during the anti-CAA protests in mid-December.TOI spoke to several policemen who have watched over law and order in the capital for over two decades and many of them agreed that the police did not seem to be on the front foot this time. “Alarm bells should have rang after Sunday evening’s stone-pelting in Maujpur and incidents of arson at Karawal Nagar late at night but the police brass, it appears, chose to remain in wait-and-watch mode and started reacting in haste when things spun out of control on Monday noon,” he said. In fact, TOI was witness to multiple instances where rioters beat up people after asking for their names and set a shop and a house on fire in the presence of the police.Delhi Police, however, denied being lax and said they took appropriate measures. In a statement issued around 4.30pm on Monday, the department casually said that “some incidents of violence and arson had been reported in the areas of north-east district, particularly Maujpur, Kardampuri, Chand Bagh and Dayalpur...strict action will be taken against miscreants and anti social elements”.Delhi Police has also compiled a detailed report on Monday’s violence and it will be submitted to the ministry of home affairs late on Monday night or Tuesday, said an officer.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74292450,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-265750,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/alarmed-cops-on-alert-after-intel-report/articleshow/74291633.cms

Coimbatore: The Thudiyalur police on Sunday arrested a 21-year-old man, who injured a college girl using a blade at Vellakinar on the city outskirts.

Police identified him as M Muthukaruppan of Gandhipuram. “He was a senior student in the private college attended by the 19-year-old victim and was besotted with her. But the girl had rejected his unwelcome advances several times. Even after completing his study, he used to follow her when she was on the way to the college. But the girl never reciprocated his feelings,” a police officer said.

A frustrated Muthukaruppan met the girl at her house in Vellakinar on Thursday when she was alone. “When the girl rejected his proposal again, he grew angry and verbally abused her. He slashed her throat, hands and legs using a blade he had carried with him. As the girl started to scream in pain, he ran away from the house,” the officer added.

Alerted by her screams, the girl’s neighbours rushed to her help and took her to a private hospital. She has sustained injuries in neck, legs and hands, and is undergoing treatment.

Based on a complaint from the girl’s mother, police have filed an FIR under Section 294 (b) (for using obscene words), 448 (punishment for trespassing into a house), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) and arrested Muthukaruppan. He was remanded in judicial custody.

303,['25/02/2020'],Disabled tea vendor attempts suicide over anti-encroachment drive,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: A day after Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) anti-encroachment squad removed his tea stall near Dawa Bazaar in Gandhibagh area, differently-abled vendor Chandrashekhar Kumbhare allegedly attempted to commit suicide by setting himself ablaze at NMC headquarters on Monday afternoon. Alert security guards and Sadar police station personnel foiled his attempt.

NMC’s anti-encroachment drive intensified against vendors encroaching on roads and footpaths after Tukaram Mundhe took over as municipal commissioner on January 28. NMC’s anti-encroachment squad has started conducting the drive even on Sundays.

On February 23, the NMC anti-encroachment squad carried out a drive against vendors who had encroached on roads and footpaths in Gandhibagh zone area. During the drive, NMC enforcement team seized Kumbhare’s tea stall in front of Dawa Bazaar. Despite requests, the team did not return his belongings.

“Kumbhare’s tea stall was situated next to a public toilet constructed on a portion of footpath in the commercial area. It never disrupted the movement of vehicles or pedestrians,” claimed Giridhar Bhajbujhe, another differently-abled vendor, during a meeting with additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and deputy municipal commissioner Mahesh Morone. They demanded that NMC should not act against differently-abled vendors.

The delegation said there are around 100 differently-abled people earning a livelihood through hawking. They also showed some government resolution issued a decade ago regarding rehabilitation of differently-abled by setting up shops. “But nothing has happened so far,” said another differently-abled vendor Sukhdeo Dudhalkar.

To justify their demand, they also pointed out that when Mother’s Dairy and cobblers’ kiosks were constructed on footpaths, why were their shops facing anti-encroachment drive?

Joshi rejected their demand and clarified that the civic body is already facing contempt petition for inaction against encroachments on roads and footpaths. “So no leniency will be show while taking action against vendors on roads and footpaths,” he said.

He also informed them that NMC has already formed a town vending committee. “The committee will soon start functioning by identifying hawking zones,” he explained.

The delegation also sought directives to enforcement department to return Kumbhare’s seized material, which too was refused by Joshi. “Inquiry will be conducted in his case and if we find his encroachment was not disrupting vehicles and pedestrian movement, only then we will think about your demand,” Joshi said. Kumbhare told TOI he has been selling tea there for the last 25 years and it is the only source of income for his family of four members.

They also pointed out that they could neither run nor save their material during the anti-encroachment drive. So, they demanded NMC should give a warning before taking any action against differently-abled vendors, and the additional municipal commissioner assured to look into it.

“The Sadar police booked the differently-abled vendors for unlawful assembly but has not registered any case against the vendor who attempted to commit suicide by pouring kerosene on himself,” said senior police inspector Mahesh Bansode.

TRICHY: A 26-year-old man from Mannanchanallur in Trichy, who has undertaken a cycle rally from Kanyakumari to Chennai to highlight the sorry state of agriculture due to conversion of farmlands into housing plots reached Trichy on Monday.

T Balamurugan of Vadakkipatti near Mannachanallur, hails from a family whose occupation has been primarily agriculture. Mannachanallur being a rain-fed area, the agriculture work of his family gradually came to a standstill after water scarcity loomed large and the wells turned dry a decade ago. “After completing my Class XII, my family was unable to provide me higher studies as they could not earn from the farming following which I chose construction work. In the past two decades, most farmlands were converted into housing plots which disturbed me a lot and forced me to take up a rally to create awareness,” Balamurugan told TOI on the way to Perambalur.

The objective of the cycle rally that commenced from Kanyakumari on February 18 is to sensitise the public about the ill-effects of converting farmlands into real estate. “If the situation continues at this pace, our future generation will have to bear the brunt of shortage of food. It is high time we raise the pitch against the alarming trend. So, i am on a mission to disseminate the message and insist the state government on passing a law to prevent the conversion of farmlands,” he said.

His journey covered Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, Madurai and Trichy. He plans to reach Chennai after covering Perambalur, Villupuram, Tindivanam, and Chengalpattu to petition the chief minister Edappadi K Palanisami.

Pedalling for 80km a day, Balamurugan was upset over the reaction of the public in urban areas to his rally. “Urban people are not bothered about the issue but those in rural areas show interest to take home the message from my rally,” he said.

TRICHY: The recruitment of teachers to vacant posts have been hit greatly after a few government-aided refused to absorb the surplus teachers from other schools

As many as 350 government aided schools, including 108 high and higher secondary schools, are functioning in the Trichy district. Salary of regular teachers in these private management-run government aided schools are borne by the state government.

Number of regular teachers in these schools have become excess over the recent years because of fall in the student strength. The state has prevented these schools from filling vacant posts so that the posts could be filled with excess teachers found in many schools.

But many schools seem to be reluctant to fill posts by absorbing excess teachers from other schools. This has delayed filling up of teachers posts in many schools.

Speaking to ToI, S Santhi, Trichy district chief education officer said that there has not been any delay in giving permission to make appointments in government aided schools in Trichy.

She said that five postgraduate teachers in as many government aided schools are found surplus in the city. One teacher each in subjects like Tamil, English, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics have been found surplus.

“Though we called for a meeting of aided schools management to absorb these teachers when there is a vacancy in their schools. But not many are showing interest in absorbing excess teachers,” she said.

“For instance, if seven schools have vacant teacher post in one of the five subjects, any one of the school should absorb the teachers. If one of the school could come forward to take this one teacher, we can give permission to rest of the six schools to go ahead with the appointment . But none of the school is agreeing to take these five teachers which is resulting in the delay,” she said.

SALEM: Detailing about the achievements of his government, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami challenged DMK party chief MK Stalin to list out the faults and drawbacks of his government, if any, as his party had fulfilled all the promises made in its manifesto before the 2016 assembly .

Citing 2006 assembly election manifesto of DMK, the chief minister asked why former chief minister and DMK leader M Karunanidhi failed to give two acres to landless farmers as promised in the manifesto.

“At the same time, DMK functionaries had grabbed lands from many people across the state,” he said. “The AIADMK government took action and returned the land to original owners,” he added.

The AIADMK government has given 11 medical colleges in the state besides created five new districts.

Slamming the DMK for winning in the Lok Sabha election by giving false promises, the chief minister appealed to the public to vote for AIADMK in the municipal election to give good governance.

He said Rs 3 lakh crore worth of projects have been brought to the state in the investors meet held last year. Nearly 304 MoUs were signed in the meeting, he added.

“We have saved the delta districts by announcing it as agricultural zone,” he said.

On releasing convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Palaniswami said his government had sent a letter to the governor to release six people including Nalini and Murugan . “At the same time, DMK did not take any step to release them,” he said.

308,['25/02/2020'],"Transgender identity is for my soul, not sympathy: Narthaki Nataraj","This story is from February 25, 2020

Narthaki Nataraj performs at Khajuraho festival

BHOPAL: Day five of ongoing Khajuraho Festival radiated with extra sparkle, as the first Padma awardee transwoman, Narthaki Natraj, presented some of the oldest compositions of her guru - Kittappa Pillai- direct descendant of the Thanjavore auartet, known as father of Bharatanatyam.

Admitting that performing at Khajuraho is a momentous occasion, she said, ""I read the history of Khajuraho temples and decided to stick to my traditional repertoire. Performing on Vishwanathashtakam bhajans was an ode to my guru.""

Originally from Madurai, today she travels across the globe for her solo concerts, but not many know that she was thrown out of her home at 11. That didn't stop Narthaki from dedicating her life to classical dance, with her childhood 'soul mate' Sakthi Bhaskar standing by her, throughout. ""My struggle egged me on to focus all my energy in the pursuit of dance. My siblings and extended family have accepted me now and I love them too, holding no grudges,"" said she.

For her, dance is the only way to drive the demons away. Admitting that her art is indeed cathartic, she said, ""When I'm dancing, I feel like a queen. On stage, it seems as if I'm flying like a honey bee. I can't express my happiness in words ; dance has definitely helped me forget all the fears and anguish of my past.""

These days a lot of LGBTQA youngsters are participating and excelling in dance reality shows and competitions, but most of them still prefer Bollywood or western genres to classical formats. When asked if it saddens her, the danseuse said, ""Classical forms, whether Hindustani music, Carnatic music or dances, require a lot of hard work. You can't pursue this genre as a hobby. You can reach your goals only if you surrender yourself to the art. Not only the community youngsters, but most of the youngsters today want to strike it rich, overnight.""

It's been over five years that transgender community got the third sex status, but even now those thin lines that marginalise the community, remain. A vocal leader, Narthaki suggested a way forward. "" I tell the community youngsters, come out of the closet and serve the society selflessly. Seeking sympathy is not advisable. Whatever I got in life, is purely on merit. Transgender identity is for my soul; it is not for sympathy. To get love, we have to give love. We are known as god's people, so if we work for people without expectations, it will eventually be recognised. My friend Shakthi and I practise this mantra and both of us are the happiest people in the world. We indulge in thanksgiving every day,"" said she.

Earlier, Aswathy and N Srikanth presented the finer nuances of Bharatanatyam on stage, Nair sisters' Mohiniattam presentation was also appreciated a lot.

309,['25/02/2020'],"Stringent new norms for Tadoba guides, drivers","This story is from February 25, 2020

Guides and drivers are yet to respond to the directive

Nagpur: No involvement in any forest or wildlife offences, good communication skills in Marathi, Hindi and English, and termination of service after three complaints are some of the conditions part of fresh rules framed by Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) for new guides and Gypsy drivers.

Stung by sharp criticism from all quarters — including the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) — over a viral video of a tourist vehicle blocking the way of a tiger on February 9, the TATR management issued stringent guidelines on February 18 for guides and drivers.

The existing guides and safari vehicle drivers/owners have also been asked to submit a notarized affidavit on a Rs200 stamp paper by February 25, stating that they are not involved in any kind of forest offences, and that they are ready to clear encroachments on forest land, if any. Sources said guides and drivers are yet to respond to the directive.

Anil Tiwade, the president of Maharashtra Guides Union said, “Guides are opposed to giving an affidavit. A meeting has been called on Monday to take a final decision.”

TATR conservator of forest (CF) and field director NR Praveen said, “For the first time, rules have been formulated for guides and drivers. We need 25% more guides than the existing carrying capacity of the entry gates, and there is demand to recruit guides from gates like Kolara.”

Currently, there are 225 guides for TATR’s core and buffer zone. Around 125 vehicles (including canters) enter Tadoba in two shifts, and another 100 vehicles enter the buffer ranges of the park.

“The rules have been framed with the consent of the guides and registered vehicle owners. The new rules for recruitment of drivers will be applicable from the next tourism season,” Praveen added.

The rules make it compulsory for new guides and drivers to have proficiency in Marathi, Hindi as well as English. A guide or driver will be terminated if three complaints of any violations are received against them.

“The educational qualification for new guides will be at least SSC, while for drivers it will be Std V. We have also fixed 58 as the age of retirement for drivers, while for guides it will be 65. The minimum age for recruitment will be 22,” said Praveen.

To curb dual employment from tourism sources, the guides and drivers will be asked to submit an affidavit.

Guides and drivers had recently blocked the entry of tourists from Kolara gate, after park management asked them to clear encroachments on forest land in Kolara.

Young naturalist Himanshu Bagde welcomed TATR’s move. “Till now, there were no curbs on guides, drivers or vehicle owners because of the park’s requirement. Only the tourists were taxed for any set of rules. I hope the new set of rules bring discipline. If good candidates are identified at the recruitment stage, the park management will face fewer problems.”

Radical Rules

Guides’ retirement age to be 65, drivers 58

Guides should have cleared SSC, drivers Std V

Character certificate from police must

No record of forest or wildlife offences

No dual employment from tourism sources

Proficiency in Marathi, Hindi & English mandatory

Termination after 3 complaints

The fake job advertisement highlights vacancies for nearly 20,000 constables in the Railway Protection Force

PUNE: The railway authority has warned people against a widely-circulated advertisement on social media and several websites, which highlights vacancies for nearly 20,000 constables in the Railway Protection Force (RPF).

The Ministry of Railways wrote a letter to all the railway zones on February 20, instructing them to alert job seekers about the false advertisement through different mediums, senior officials at the Central Railway said.

Sources said the advertisement appeared on a website www.placementstore.com, which was further circulated on different social media platforms, via WhatsApp groups and messages.

The website claims that “RPF has issued a latest notification for the recruitment of constable vacancy at 19,952 posts. Interested candidates can apply by April 30, 2020.”

“There are some unofficial websites spreading advertisements for the recruitment of 19,952 constables by the RPF. The railway board has not issued any advertisement regarding vacancies in the RPF,” a senior official with the railways said.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the RPF in the railway board, said in a letter, “Fake advertisements regarding the recruitment of the constables of RPF is being spread by some unofficial websites and social media platforms. Any advertisement related to RPF jobs will be published on the official website of the Ministry of Railway, indianrailways.gov.in.”

A senior RPF official told TOI that they were investigating the issue. “The advertisement is fake and action will be taken. The cyber cell of the RPF is investigating the matter and a complaint has also been lodged with the Delhi cyber cell,” the official said.

Job aspirants should know that any job vacancy related to the railways comes out in the official website only and not anywhere else, the official added.

“The RPF and railway board will not be responsible if anyone is trapped into the net. We always publish advertisements on our official website. These websites are to dupe people. People are requested not to give any details related to bank accounts, date of birth, insurance policy or Aadhaar numbers to such websites,” the officer pointed out.

Colva: Even as development of Colva beach has come to a standstill due to paucity of funds, six gazebos have been installed at the beach. One gazebo meanwhile has come up on the adjoining Sernabatim beach.

Gazebos are free-standing roofed shades which are open on all sides. Apart from adding ornamental features to the beach, they also provide a shady respite to beach visitors.

The Union tourism ministry had announced Rs 100 crore to the state in July 2017, under the Swadesh Darshan scheme, to augment tourism infrastructure. In the first phase, inaugurated last September, projects under this scheme were unveiled at Anjuna, Candolim and Morjim.

In the second phase, GTDC has taken up Colva, Sernabatim, Benaulim and Palolem, Miramar and Dona Paula beaches .

Goa Tourism Development Corporation, managing director, Nikhil Desai, said that while the gazebos are placed for providing shade to visitors, they could also be used by lifeguards, night patrol staff, tourist wardens and tourist police while on duty.

He also said that the gazebos, made of steel and fibre reinforced plastic (FRP), are approved under the Swadesh Darshan scheme.

Thrissur: Thrissur Malayora Samrakshana Samithi , a farmer’s movement began an indefinite hunger strike in front of the Thrissur collectorate from Monday onwards demanding to distribute title deeds to all eligible farmers under the Ollur assembly constituency. The farmers movement leaders allege that the district administration failed to distribute the titles to the farmers on time.

Malayora Samrakshana Samithyi convenor K K George Kakkasery said, “Thousands of farmers from Pananchery, Nadathara, Puthoor and Madakkathara areas have been waiting to get title deeds for the last 40 to 50 years. But the district administration officials failed to distribute the it.”

“It was in last November that the district collector said they will distribute title deeds to the farmers before December. But they changed the dates and the title deed distribution was left in limbo. But as per the recent statement by the collector said that they would distribute only 1,300 forest land title deeds,” said George.

“Our demand is that the government should appoint a special officer for the title deed distribution process. A special officer can easily complete the verification process of the forest and title deed applications and distribute the title deeds on time,” he said. “Whenever the farmers movement announces a protest the district administration will announce the date of a title deed distribution fest. But after we withdraw the protest the district administration cancels the title deed distribution related works,” alleged George.

“We will continue the indefinite hunger protest till we get a favourable reply from the government,” he said.

Two days ago, district collector S Shanavas announced that the district administration will distribute 1,300 forest land title deeds to the farmers.

Uttarkashi: A ‘ Mountaineering Summit ’ workshop organised by district administration commenced at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) on Monday, on the occasion of 60th foundation day of Uttarkashi district. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat inaugurated the two-day workshop, which focuses on various aspects of mountaineering and trekking-based tourism in the Himalayan region.

During the event, Gopal Singh Rawat, MLA Gangotri constituency, put forth the demand to open trekking routes situated in inner line region of India-China border for foreign tourists too. Besides, he also demanded to give relaxation in the number of mountaineers visiting Gangotri National Park, as only 150 tourists per day are allowed to enter the park.

President of Adventure Tour Operators Association of India, Swadesh Kumar, said that Gangotri National Park should be open throughout the year for mountaineers and trekkers. He also pressed for opening of Nanda Devi National Park for tourists, to open adventure sports rescue centres all over the hill state, to provide marketing grants to tour operators and not to take any extra charges from foreign mountaineers.

CM Rawat assured to take positive action over the demands. He said, “We are soon going to conduct a meeting with the ministry of home affairs over inner line issue and will try to remove the restrictions from foreign tourists. We will also try to pass the budget for marketing grants to tour operators in upcoming assembly session. Besides, we will also conduct a meeting with forest department for opening of new trek routes in hill districts.”

“Government is taking all possible steps to boost tourism in the state.

Training for officers of the rank of tahsildars and above — designated as ‘charge officers’ — was conducted at... Read More

NASHIK: The Nashik district administration on Monday started the process of imparting training to officials who would oversee the National Population Register (NPR) exercise across the district.

“The process of NPR is to start across the country from May 1. The process will, in no way, affect the valid citizenship rights. Any miscreant trying to create trouble will be dealt with the proper procedure of law,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said sounding a warning to those opposing the exercise.

Ever since the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was passed by Parliament, there have been protests in pockets across the country. Some organisations have also appealed to the people to oppose the CAA and not cooperate with the NPR enumerators.

Earlier, in Malegoan, some people opposed the electors’ verification programme (EVP) started by the Election Commission of India. Local elected leaders, including MLAs and corporators, had to intervene to ensure that the process went on smoothly.

The administration has pointed out that the NPR and the census had nothing to do with the CAA. The officials said that the issues coming up at the time of enumeration will be dealt with appropriately.

Training for officers of the rank of tahsildars and above — designated as ‘charge officers’ — was conducted at the Niyojan Bhawan. The training was chaired by resident deputy district collector Bhagwat Doifode.

The enumerators will be going house to house between May 1 and June 15 to complete the NPR exercise. The enumerators will have to complete the process on the special application, which they have to download on their cellphones and complete the formalities. Only authorised personnel have access to the software. The application works online as well as offline, thereby ensuring that every house, even in the remotest location, is covered. The enumerators will be derived from the rank of teachers, clerks and others.

TRICHY: Exporters in Trichy airport exuded confidence that the introduction of two more flight services to Abu Dhabi and Doha will help them handle more volume of cargo. The old terminal at the airport was converted into an international cargo complex and was commissioned for operations on November 21, 2011.

The Central Board of Excise and Customs approved and notified the airport as an air cargo complex. Ever since the airport started to handle cargo, the terminal has been witnessing increase in handling cargo consignment when compared the previous year.

Export of perishables commodities like vegetables, fruits, flowers constitute 90% of the total volume of consignments handled here. Singapore, Dubai, Sharjah, Kuala Lumpur and Colombo are the main destinations. The remaining 10% of export included are non-perishables like garments, leather etc.

Air India Express, Air Asia, Scoot Air, Malindo Air, Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo Air have been providing 91 services per week to Dubai, Sharjah, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Colombo. The total volume of cargo handled in 2009-10 was 1,349 and it started going upward year by year. In 2018-19, the total volume of cargo handled registered as 6,932 tonnes. It was 6,787 tonne till January 2020. As two months are remaining to complete the financial year 2019-20, the terminal is likely to touch a volume of 8000 tonne, airport authorities said. It will be a reality when the newly launched flights - Abu Dhabi and Doha - accommodate significant volume of cargo, they said.

“So far, exporters sending their consignments via Colombo to Abu Dhabi and Doha by Sri Lankan Airlines, taking circuitous route are wasting money and time. This means that there is no more ordeal for the exporters. Volume of cargo would go up. Each flight can accommodate cargo to their belly ranging from 1 tonne to 2.5 tonne, based on various factors. On an average, these two new flights would fetch 75 tonne a month,” managing director of MB Cargo R Muralidharan said.

As Doha is a transship destination to various Europe countries, the new service would attract more number of exporters, airport sources said. It is noted that Air India Express will commence new services from March 29.

Nagpur: Two persons were injured after they stabbed each other in broad daylight at Bajaj Nagar Square on Sunday. Bajaj Nagar police have registered two separate offences of serious assaults and attempt to murder against three persons including the injured.

It’s learnt that Shrikant Raut and Prashant Koparde were purchasing liquor from an outlet at Bajaj Nagar when one Sachin Mandalwar attacked them from behind with a knife. Mandalwar and Raut, who are neighbours, had a verbal duel around couple of days ago. Following the spat, they had vowed to teach each other lesson.

After Mandalwar stabbed Raut twice on his lower back, the victim and his friend Koparde fought back. In the scuffle, Mandalwar lost possession of the knife which was picked up by Raut. Subsequently, Raut and his aide took turns to stab Mandalwar in his stomach, chest and other parts of the body.

As the cops arrived at the spot, the injured were rushed to the Mayo hospital for treatment and offences were registered.

Representative Image

BHUBANESWAR: The effort to drive away the wild tusker that killed four persons in Puri’s Pipili on Sunday seems to have had unintended consequences.

Students of the area who are appearing for the matric examination alleged that the presence of the uninvited guest had affected their studies. The reason? All power distribution companies in the area had been instructed to shut off electricity supply to prevent the animal from accidentally getting electrocuted.

The elephant strayed into Pipili on Saturday, prompting the state government to ask all power distribution companies to shut off supply in villages like Matighara, Rajatei, Mangalpur, Jamalpur, Gopinathpur, Balanga and Sankari Sahi. Power was restored only on Monday morning, while the matric Sanskrit exam began at 10 am on the same day.

“We had no electricity for almost two days and two nights. My exams are on. I could not study at all for Monday’s paper. We don’t have inverters. How long can we study using candles? This is really unfair,” said Subas Nayak, a student.

The Central Electricity Supply Unit (Cesu) pleaded helplessness and said it had standing instructions from the government to ensure the safety of the tusker. “The government asked us to disconnect power supply in areas the elephant passed through. Elephants often fall victim to low-tension wires in villages,” said Subrat Mishra, spokesperson of Cesu.

This failed to calm down angry parents, who demanded that the school and mass education department ensure that the students received grace marks in Sanskrit. “We are not asking for any favour. The government must make sure that our children pass in Sanskrit,” said Anadi Charan Sahu, a parent and resident of Gopinathpur village.

Officers in the school and mass education department, however, said there was no precedent for granting grace marks to students because of elephant intrusion.

Meanwhile, the tusker at the centre of it all safely entered Chandaka sanctuary, after spending some time at Ghatikia on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar.

New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal condoled the death of the Delhi Police head constable who died in the line of duty in the clashes at Gokulpuri on Monday. Along with him, different AAP functionaries also made appeals for peace.

In a series of tweets, Kejriwal said, “The death of the head constable is very sad. He was also among one of us. Please abstain from violence. It will benefit none. All problems will be solved with peace.”

The CM also urged Union home minister Amit Shah and LG Anil Baijal to maintain law and order. “Very distressing news regarding disturbance of peace and harmony in parts of Delhi coming in. I sincerely urge LG and home minister to restore law and order and ensure that peace and harmony is maintained. Nobody should be allowed to orchestrate flagrations (sic),” he tweeted.

Baijal instructed Delhi Police to maintain law and order in northeast Delhi and asked people to remain calm.

Meanwhile, Gopal Rai, AAP MLA from Babarpur, one of the points where the clashes erupted, appealed through a video posted on social media to maintain peace. “I request everyone with folded hands to maintain peace. Some people are intentionally trying to aggravate the situation by creating an atmosphere of fear,” he said.

“The LG has assured me that additional security forces are being deployed to maintain peace in the affected areas,” he added.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also condemned the violence. “The flames of violence cause irreparable damage to everyone,” he said. Later, he tweeted, “I am living in Delhi for three decades. Never felt so terrified in my own city. What has happened? Who are the people burning Delhi? I am very sad and ashamed today.”

AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh alleged on Twitter that Shah was not taking any steps to stop the violence. Singh and Rai added that police were not taking their calls.

Rai and Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha arrived at the LG House around 11.45pm to demand police action against the rioters. “We are getting distress calls from different areas. We want police presence to be increased,” Jha told TOI. Till the filing of the news they were camping outside LG House.

319,['25/02/2020'],Forest dept to take public opinion on Kanhargaon reserve,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: Over a year after the state board for wildlife (SBWL) gave in-principle approval to declare Kanhargaon in Gondpipri tehsil a wildlife sanctuary, the first process has been initiated by taking locals’ views on the proposal.

“The in-principle approval to the proposed sanctuary was subject to the condition to seek ‘janmat’ (public opinion) and accordingly, the process has been initiated,” said Nitin H Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Maharashtra.

SV Ramarao, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Chandrapur, said, “FDCM and regular forest officials have been asked to hold joint meetings with locals to seek their views on the issue.”

This may be the first occasion when public hearings will be held to notify any forest area a sanctuary. On December 5, 2018, the decision to notify Kanhargaon as a sanctuary was taken at the 14th SBWL meeting led by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar was also present.

The Kanhargaon sanctuary proposal was first mooted in 2014. Since then, it is hanging by the fire owing to political differences and basically, opposition from Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), which has large-scale logging operations.

“The corporation generates a revenue of at least Rs20-22 crore annually from commercial extraction of timber from Kanhargaon. It is in possession of 28,000 (280sqkm) hectare area,” officials said.

The Kanhargaon proposal includes 24,862-hectare (248.62sqkm) area of FDCM and 1,638 (16.38sqkm) hectare area of territorial forest under the Central Chanda division. Both combined makes it a 265sqkm sanctuary with no villages inside.

Even as the FDCM was opposed to it earlier, things have changed in the last six years. Sources said that now, the FDCM is willing to part with the Kanhargaon area provided it is compensated with an equal amount of forest in the Allapalii division in Gadchiroli Circle.

A proposal in this regard is already pending. Earlier, FDCM was compensated with forest land in Allapalli for handing over its area for the Koka wildlife sanctuary in Bhandara.

“Another reason why Kanhargaon needs to be declared a sanctuary is the flared up man-animal conflict with tigers crying for space. The tiger numbers in Maharashtra has grown from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018,” says Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel.

As per the survey conducted in 2015 by the Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), there were 10 tigers and 23 leopards in Kanhargaon.

“The lush green forest of Kanhargaon forms the key southern corridor for the spill over tiger population moving to the Kawal tiger reserve in Telangana and Indravati reserve in Chhattisgarh through Chaprala and Pranhita sanctuaries in Gadchiroli,” says wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.

Chandrapur honorary wildlife warden Bandu Dhotre said, “Notifying the sanctuary is in the interest of locals as they will reap benefits of ecotourism besides the Dr Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Jan-Van Yojana.”

“I have visited villages around Kanhargaon and found that people were being misguided on the issue by being told that they will be relocated if the sanctuary is notified. This is completely false,” said Dhotre.

“Kanhargaon encompasses pristine forest patches which were once shooting blocks during the British era. With TATR emerging as the top tiger tourism destination in the country, tourists flow can be diverted to the proposed sanctuary bringing local employment,” Dhotre adds.

WHY KANHARGAON?

* Tigers need space as number in Maharashtra up from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018.

* Kanhargaon is a strategic link between Tadoba-Kawal in Telangana and needs to be made inviolate.

* The new PA can accommodate surplus spill over population of tigers reducing man-animal conflict and ensure safe future of tigers.

* The new sanctuary can boost employment generation for locals.

Pole erected on the middle of a road in Thanjavur

THANJAVUR: Despite there being a ban on erecting arches and flex boards on roads obstructing public movement and vehicular traffic, AIADMK workers have damaged arterial roads in Thanjavur to erect arches and banners to welcome the chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam , who are scheduled to attend Rajya Sabha MP and deputy coordinator of AIADMK R Vaithilingam’s son’s wedding on February 26.

Some workers were seen digging holes and erecting bamboo poles almost in the middle of the state highway roads in and around Thanjavur on Monday morning. This has raised questions about effectiveness of the ban.

“Workers said they were doing it for a wedding that was scheduled for Wednesday. The arches would be a huge threat and hinderance for motorists,” said a roadside vendor near New Bus Stand, where the wedding is to take place in a hall.

When contacted, superintendent of police, Thanjavur, S S Mageshwaran told TOI that while court orders said no one must erect flex banners in public places affecting people, there were no such restrictions in case of arches, if they are erected in a way that public movement and vehicular traffic are not affected.

ROORKEE: Four persons, including three contract killers, were arrested by Jhabreda police in Haridwar district on Monday for trying to allegedly eliminate a 19-year-old man of a village near Jhabreda.

Police said that he victim's father Subhash worked as a labourer in the house of a farmer Suresh Pal of Miragpur village. He had allegedly taken some money on interest from Pal which amounted to Rs 4 lakh.

When 55-year-old Pal, a bachelor, realised that Subhash was unable to repay the debt, he proposed his marriage with Subhash’s 17-year-old daughter. But, Subhash's son Satendra was opposed to his sister’s marriage with Pal.

Police claimed that Pal hired three criminals for Rs 35,000 from Rajjupur village near Deoband to eliminate Satendra.

Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai K Raj said, “Since the victim is from the Dalit community, we have now slapped a section of SC/ST Act along with other sections of IPC 307(death causing act), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 452 (house-trespass for assault) on the accused.”

ERODE: A 20-year-old tusker suffering from intestinal worms died near Bhavanisagar in Erode district on Monday.

After being informed that an elephant was lying on a village road that connects Dengumarahada and Bhavanisagar, forest officials went there and found the tusker battling for its life.

Using an earthmover, officials moved the jumbo off the road. Veterinary doctors tried to save the elephant, but in vain. “Due to intestinal worms, it did not eat for at least a week,” a forest officer said.

The veterinarians performed an autopsy on the spot and buried the carcass in a nearby forest.

The tusks of the elephant were cut and kept in the Bhavanisagar forest office, the officer added.

Traffic in the stretch was halted for a few hours due to the incident.

323,['25/02/2020'],PWD replacing defective concrete panels on Inner Ring Road,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: With the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court taking cognisance of criminal PIL filed by activist Suraj Lolage, the state’s public works department (PWD), through controversial contractor RPS Infraproject Private Ltd, has started removing defective cement concrete panels and laying new ones on Inner Ring Road (IRR).

The PWD has also started the process to appoint a private agency for checking quality of work done under IRR Widening and Cement Concrete Project.

HC on November 6, 2019, had asked the petitioner to carry out survey of the already executed work and file affidavit supported by authenticated material.

The PWD, through RPS, then removed defective panels between Trimurti Nagar Square and Pratap Nagar Square. Instead of concretizing the patch again, the contractor laid paver blocks in place of the panels. TOI on November 25, 2019, highlighted the irregularity.

The PWD through RPS has now started removing two defective panels at Kharbi from the last few days. Each panel of 40 metric tonne is around 4.5 metre wide and 3.5 metre long. The cement concrete panel was dumped on the road divider and the contractor laid a new panel.

Lolage told TOI that PWD and RPS did not replace defective panels between Hingna T-point and Chhatrapati Square. “Even, those between Chhatrapati Square and Kharbi were not replaced. The work directly started at Kharbi. PWD should ensure all defective panels on IRR are removed like at Kharbi. Also, PWD engineers should monitor work at the site,” he said.

The activist said that huge quantum of cement, concrete, sand, iron rods, time, manpower and funds have gone waste due to nexus between PWD officials and contractor. “Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had blacklisted RPS for inferior quality of road works. PWD should have verified it and avoided tender,” he said.

PWD has also floated a tender for appointment of private agency that will conduct falling weight deflectometer test at 50 locations on IRR to evaluate effectiveness of dowel bar at joints and assess effectiveness of cement concrete panels.

Lolage said PWD is wasting public money. “PWD had appointed a third party agency to check quality and paid it in crores. Inspection was also done through Central Road Research Institute (CRRI),” he said.

TOI from the last three years has been reporting about cracks on IRR and deterioration of surface layer. Lolage had lodged a series of complaints with PWD. When PWD did not take any action against contractor and its engineers, Lolage filed a criminal writ petition.

A PWD engineer told TOI that all defective panels will be replaced. “We will repair surface layer by removing entire panels as per suggestions of CRRI. Lot of initiatives have been taken to ensure proper quality and completion of project,” he said.

RPS was given the work on September 24, 2015. It was supposed to complete the project within two years. Till date, it is 89.3% completed, as per PWD.

After HC took cognisance of criminal PIL, PWD started levying a fine of Rs5,000 per day on RPS.

Madurai: The Madras high court has dismissed a plea which sought to declare the birth anniversary of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa as a government function.

M Manimaran, an AIADMK functionary, and resident of Sivaganga district, in his petition stated that Jayalalithaa served as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for more than 14 years. Because of schemes implemented for the welfare of the people, she became a renowned political leader. Following her demise, the state government had announced that February 24, her birth anniversary would be declared as a government function, however, nothing has been done so far. He said that he had submitted a representation in this regard to the government, but no steps were taken.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench. When the petition was taken up for hearing on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran observed that since the petitioner had stated that he had filed this petition only on the ground that her birth anniversary is celebrated on Monday, the court is not inclined to entertain this petition.

The new library at the university will have a digitalised system to reduce manpower

JAIPUR: A constitutional park and a new library in the name of Bhimrao Amedkar will soon be additional features of Rajasthan University .

While library construction has been completed, furnishings will begin soon and the university will invite tenders in two days.

Vice-chancellor R.K.Kothari said, “We will finalise the tender within a few days after furnishing work will start. We are expecting the work to be completed in three months. It will be named after Bhimrao Ambedkar. Right in front of the library, a constitutional park will be created as per the orders of the governor. Preamble of the Constitution, fundamental rights, directive principles of state policy and other provisions of the Constitution will be inscribed on a stone in the park. This will spread positive message amongst students.”

The new library will have a digitalised system to reduce dependency on manpower. Professor S.L.Sharma, in-charge of library, said it will be digitalised and there will be special chip in the books to keep a track. “Students will have to punch their smart library cards to get a book issued. Library cards will have information of all books issued in the past as well. At the entry gates, sensors will be installed that will start beeping if any book is taken out without being issued. This will help in preventing book theft as well,” said Sharma.

A Rs 4.85-crore new humanities hall is under construction in the university. A human resource and development centre is also almost ready near Government Poddar College which is currently running at the university.

326,['25/02/2020'],"Raut’s free power plan will cost 8,000cr per year, is unfeasible, say discom officials","This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: Energy minister Nitin Raut may have made big headlines by proposing to provide free power to domestic consumers using less than 100 units per month, but MSEDCL top officials say the plan is unfeasible.

Raut in fact wants to provide free power to consumers of all four discoms in the state – Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), Brihanmumbai Suburban Electric Supply (BSES) and Tata Power.

“I have asked energy ministry officials to submit a report in this regard in three months,” he told TOI.

A senior discom official told TOI on the condition of anonymity that there were 14 lakh consumers in Delhi whose consumption was less than 100 units. “However, in the state the figure is over 1.25 crore. A rough calculation done by us shows that state government will have to pay Rs8,000 crore to the MSEDCL every year to provide free power to the targeted group,” he said.

The official further said Delhi and Maharashtra could not be compared as far as power tariff was compared. “Delhi has no agricultural consumers whereas there are 42 lakh such users in the state. Other consumers have to pay a cross-subsidy of Rs9,000 crore to keep their tariff at less than Rs2 per unit. In addition, the state government has to pay a subsidy of Rs5,500 crore to us. Delhi government doesn’t have to pay any such subsidy,” he added.

“The state government is reeling under a debt burden of over Rs4 lakh crore. Recent crop loan waiver will cost it another Rs30,000 crore to Rs40,000 crore. How will the state pay Rs8,000 crore subsidy every year,” said the official adding that the government has already stopped funding to many development works citing cash crunch.

Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister who handles finance portfolio, had publicly opposed Raut’s plan. He told the media that ministers should not make people habituated to such freebies. Unfazed, Raut told the media that he would talk to Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to implement his scheme.

Balasaheb Thorat, revenue minister who hails from Congress, recently found it difficult to defend Raut. When asked about the contradictory statements of Pawar and Raut, he said the energy minister had merely asked MSEDCL to study the plan and a concrete announcement had not been made.

Power expert Ashok Pendse feels that such populist decisions can’t be sustained in the long run. “Delhi government has created regulatory assets worth hundreds of crore to keep power tariff in the state artificially low. The power companies have approached Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (ATE) and Supreme Court for recovering these assets. If the decisions go against the government, it will have to shell out hundreds of crores or allow the power companies to sharply increase the power tariff,” he told TOI.

Panaji: The directorate of mines and geology (DMG) has written to mining companies asking for details of the locations where their non-royalty iron ore is being stored and the quantities.

This is to avoid mining companies from lifting government iron ore lying at jetties and plots. There is nearly 5 million tonne of government-owned ore lying at jetties and plots .

“Once we receive the details of the quantity and locations, we will send a file to the government for approval for collection of royalty,” a senior officer said.

Once the royalty is collected, the department will issue the mining companies transport permits for the same.

Details of the transportation route will also be submitted to the Goa State Pollution Control Board to enable it to monitor air pollution, the officer said. The senior officer also said that when mining in the state first came to a halt in 2012, the apex court had declared the ore lying at plots and jetties as illegal.

It had directed the state government to confiscate the ore and conduct e-auctions. The mines department had identified 15 million tonne of such ore, from which 10 million tonne was e-auctioned.

Between September 2014 and January 2015, the state conducted a second renewal of 88 mining leases.

Mining activities in Goa once again commenced in August 2015, but then came to a halt on March 15, 2018, after the Supreme Court quashed a second renewal of 88 mining leases. Recently, the apex court permitted the export of ore extracted before March 15, 2018.

Senior officers said from August 2015 to March 2018, mining companies extracted ore, but did not pay the royalty.

Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday ordered senior officers to permanently stop the pension of six retired employees after charges of corruption were proved against them by vigilance. Naveen also ordered compulsory retirement for two other employees of doubtful integrity.

According to an official statement issued by the chief minister’s office ( CMO ), the action has been taken because of the chief minister’s policy of zero tolerance for corruption.

The retired officials whose pension has been stopped are former managing director of Odisha Bridge and Construction Corporation Ltd (OBCC) Sudhir Kumar Brajendra Narayan, former senior project manager of OBCC Arun Charan Parida, retired assistant engineer Pramod Kumar Behera , retired executive engineers Brajasundar Patnaik and Khageswar Swain and retired superintending engineer Bibekananda Mohanty, said the CMO statement.

Two revenue inspectors — Eswari Prasad Purohit from Kalahandi district and Arun Kumar Purohit from Sonepur district — have been given compulsory retirement according to the state government’s premature retirement policy.

In a crackdown against corrupt officials, the state government has sacked 74 government officials since August last year.

Similarly, 15 officials of doubtful integrity have been given forced retirement since September 26, 2019.

Panaji: After repeated delays, Goa tourism expects to start helicopter rides from Ela, Old Goa, before the monsoon starts. A new helipad is under construction at Ela.

“Construction of the helipad should be completed in March. We should be able to start the helicopter rides before monsoon,” J Ashok Kumar, tourism secretary, told TOI on Tuesday.

Pawan Hans Ltd, a Delhi-based helicopter service company, was originally appointed when Goa introduced helicopter rides in early 2016 with Aguada helipad as the take-off point.

The chopper rides will also continue during the monsoon period since they shall be only covering a short distance, said the tourism secretary. Some tourism-related services are closed during the monsoon months keeping safety in mind, and also because tourist footfalls usually decrease during the rainy months— though, in the last few years, the state has seen an icreasing trend of visitors during extended weekends despite the rain.

In 2016, GTDC was compelled to discontinue the ten-minute joyrides from Aguada, within a few days of the launch, following objection from some villagers, who were supported by local politicians. The service was then shifted to South Goa, and the helipad owned by a starred hotel was used, but the service was discontinued at the end of the season that year due to logistical problems.

New Delhi: Referring to the anti-CAA protests in the city, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Monday said that people were still “confused” about the amendment made to the law and were creating an “atmosphere of unrest”.

While urging protesters to practice restraint and maintain peace, Tiwari, who is a Member of Parliament from North East Delhi where violent clashes erupted on Sunday between those favouring and opposing CAA , said lakhs of people were being “harassed” due to the agitations.

“Under the guise of peaceful demonstration, miscreants are harassing millions of Delhiites by protesting on roads and committing violent activities. It is now important that they be controlled as soon as possible,” Tiwari said.

Former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken , however, urged chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to not appear “helpless” and take the “lead” in bringing the situation firmly in control.

In a series of tweets, Maken suggested setting up of a helpline to take complaints of violence or police inaction, calling an all-party meet to take suggestions from functionaries across party lines and formation of peace committees in troubled areas.

Maken, who was junior home minister in the UPA-II government between 2009-11, said he was making the suggestions to deal with Delhi riots on the basis of his experience in dealing with numerous administrative responsibilities.

In his tweets, Maken suggested: “Establish a helpline directly under your office to receive complaints of violence or police inaction. This should be monitored and further passed on to police and the local SDM. Immediately call an all-party meeting, take suggestions and work across political parties to restore normalcy in troubled areas. Form peace committees with social influencers, including MLAs, councillors, district magistrate, local SHO and SDM. Make each minister of your cabinet in chargeof such committees and ask them to hit the ground.”

The senior Congress functionary also asked the chief minister to establish a hotline with the lieutenant governor and talk to him every hour to take stock of the situation. “Take a lead and don’t sit back blaming others. As a CM, please do not appear to be helpless. This would badly erode a much-needed credibility of our democratic institutions to protect atrocity/violence against innocent citizens,” he added.

Senior BJP functionary and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel said he will start a campaign against Shaheen Bagh protests on March 1 from Delhi University’s Bonta Park. He added he will visit parks across the city every morning to talk about Shaheen Bagh.

“Women at Shaheen Bagh are being exploited as shields by Opposition parties. This is a very well-thought conspiracy to instigate riots,” the MP claimed.

Madurai: The Madras high court has dismissed the bail plea filed by a woman maoist stating that trial in her case is prolonging, and directed the trial court in Dindigul to complete the trial within March 31. The court further said that it would not hesitate to grant relief to the petitioner, if this timeline is not strictly adhered to.

Sivasakthi alias Shenbagavalli alias Rama alias Kanimozhi, a resident of Krishnagiri district in her petition stated that police officials received information on April 19, 2008 that maoists were conducting arms training camp inside the forest areas of Kodaikanal. When the police officials went to the spot, the maoists opened fire. When the police officials retaliated a maoist was shot dead. There were total seven accused in the case registered by the Kodaikanal police and it was alleged that she was also one of the participants in the camp.

When she filed a bail petition before the high court Madurai bench in 2019, the court on November 25, 2019, dismissed her bail plea taking into consideration the state government’s submission that examination of witnesses was not concluded. She stated that the court had also directed the Dindigul principal district and sessions court to complete the trial by January 31.

However, as police officials are not cooperating with the trial, it is still prolonging before the trial court. Since she has been in judicial custody for the past two years, she moved the high court Madurai bench seeking bail.

When the case was heard on Monday, the state government submitted that the process of examination of witnesses was under way and sought time for complete the same.

Taking note of the submissions, justice G R Swaminathan dismissed the bail petition and directed the trial court to complete the trial within March 31. The judge observed that the petitioner had filed this bail petition as the earlier timeline fixed by the court was not adhered to.

Madurai: The state government has been directed to file a counter on a plea moved by an advocate seeking to constitute a committee to remove stray cattle from the roads in Madurai district.

K Gandhiyammal, an advocate from Madurai, in her petition before the Madras high court stated that people who own cattle let them loose on the roads as they do not bother about taking care of them. Due to this, the cattle are roaming on the roads causing difficulty to vehicular movement.

She said that stray cattle roaming on the roads are also a reason for causing accidents. Recently, when she was travelling from her house to the high court, she sustained injuries as two cattle which were running amok pushed her down from her two-wheeler.

Even though she submitted a representation to the authorities concerned in this regard, no steps were taken.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction to constitute a coordination committee comprising district administration officials and police officials with adequate vehicles to remove the stray cattle from the roads and impose heavy penalty on the owners who allow their cattle to roam on the roads.

When the petition was heard on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran gave the direction.

It is expected that the project would benefit other destinations including Urupunyakvu beach at Moodadi and Koyilandy Mangrove Park also. “The tourism circuit project was initiated with an aim to develop all tourism destinations and bring them under a single project in the backdrop of the fact that there are many destinations in the district which could be developed into major destinations,” said K Dasan. The tourism circuit project would enable us to popularize our destinations, he said.TNN

Madhaya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Monday continued his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to provide employment to the youth.

Nath said PM Modi never talked about youth and tribal welfare, but MP government will chalk out a scheme to check migration of tribals and provide them employment and justified price of their produce.

“PM Modi never talks about youth and farmers. He only talks about Pakistan and nationalism to distract people from real issues. The Congress government will restart all welfare schemes closed by the BJP government so that tribals get work and do not migrate,” said Nath, while addressing a tribal convention in Dindori to mark Shabari Jayanti.

The chief minister also assured that after Chhindwara, tribal dominated districts of Dindori and Mandla would be on the priority list for development. The government is committed to overall development of the tribals.

“We will mobilise the economic activity. The state government will chalk out a scheme to provide jobs and justified price of farmers’ produce. The government will also review all the old schemes dumped by the previous government,” said Nath, hinting at the revival of Rs 10,000 crore Narmada water supply scheme for Dindori.

Nath's tribal convention holds significance amid efforts by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that has recently launched its most important campaign on social equality and harmony among tribals and other backward classes.

The chief minister said during last 15 years of BJP rule in MP all the promises made to the tribals remained incomplete. The Congress government will fulfill these tasks without much propaganda.

He said, “Mata Shabari is a symbol of humanity and simplicity which is why tribals have great reverence and faith towards her. They should resolve to preserve their culture and history. Tribals have always supported the truth, the Congress government will not disappoint them. The previous government had left empty coffer for the new government. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan made 21,000 announcements but, none of them was fulfilled,” he said.

These include Baripada, Rairangpur, Keonjhar, Sundargarh, Gajapati, Malkangiri, Rayagada, Koraput, Nabarangpur and Kandhamal.

“There are many hidden sporting talents in our tribal areas who do not get a proper platform to showcase their talents. The SDC Cup is a unique platform to explore the hidden talents and nurture them through better training and other facilities,”Sujeet Kumar, advisor of SDC, said.

The league matches of the SDC Cup were played at Baripada and Phulbani on Monday. These will continue till February 28, while the semi-final matches will be played on March 2 at Keonjhar and Sundargarh.

341,['25/02/2020'],Goa: Governor worried fewer boys win honours in higher education,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Over 55% of students awarded degrees on Monday were women

PANAJI: Of the 10,670 students who were awarded various degrees at the 32nd annual convocation of the Goa University (GU) on Monday, over 55% were female students, said GU’s vice-chancellor Varun Sahni at the event on Monday. Of the 15 medals awarded for outstanding academic performances, only one awardee was a male. Following this, governor and chancellor of the university Satya Pal Malik said that it is worrisome that boys have been left so far behind in higher education.

“I congratulate all the students who were awarded medals, especially the female students. There was only one male student. It brings us happiness that so many girls have won medals. But it is sad to think where have the boys gone. I want to request them that now girls are winning medals even in wrestling, weightlifting and in every other sport. Now they can enter the Army too,” Malik pointed out.

“Now you need to tighten the belt and try to do some good work. Otherwise you cannot even cook like them. Take inspiration from girls and try to change this situation the next time around,” Malik said.

Sahni said that of the 10,670 students who received their degrees at the 32nd GU convocation, 8,569 are graduates, 1,894 are postgraduates, 130 PG diplomas and 78 PhDs.

“Most pleasing of all, over 55% of the students receiving their degrees today are women. As the only university in our lovely state, we are extremely proud of this statistic in particular,” Sahni said.

Vice-President of India M Venkaiah Naidu, who was the chief guest at the convocation, said that the trend is the same in universities across India. Where ever he is called to attend convocations, 65% to 70% of the gold medalists and honour awardees are women, he said.

“We should feel happy that more girls are getting awards because it is a trend that needs to be encouraged. Women constitute 50% of the population of the country and they are not being given adequate encouragement because of the feeling that what will the girl child do, they have to get married and have children. They feel that is our tradition. But that is not our tradition,” Naidu said. “In the Indian tradition, women always used to be in the forefront,” he added.

Sahni said that the university is now working towards making the varsity campus a green one.

“Goa University is very fortunate to possess a beautiful campus of 403 acres with enough land for development of the university over future generations. We are determined to create a green campus, which is second to none. Our campus is plastic-free,” said Sahni.

343,['25/02/2020'],ICAR sees potential in local cow breed Shweta kapila,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Panaji: An indigenous dairy cow of Goa has shown prominent presence of A2 milk, beleived to have better health benefits when compared to A1 milk. Called Shweta kapila, this local breed has been registered by Old Goa-based ICAR-CCARI.

“The A2 milk is beneficial to health over A1 milk,” said ICAR-CCARI director E B Chakurkar. He said that the institute has collected blood samples and extracted DNA of the cow breed. “It was found that the DNA samples from these cows showed prominent presence of A2 milk protein genes of size 172bp,” he said, adding that further study is required of the breed.

Of the various stray cattle found on the streets of Goa, many are local breeds left by owners due to their low productivity. Their genetic make-up, however, is largely unknown. ICAR-CCARI, during its survey on indigenous cattle breeds of Goa, discovered few local breeds with characteristic features of true breed, one of which was the Shweta kapila.

“This breed has been around in Goa for many years, which is unlike the coloured breed of cows. It is spotless, white in colour, and of medium size. Moreover, it can sustain adverse climatic conditions owing to its genetic make-up,” said Sanjay Udharwar, animal scientist at ICAR-CCARI, Old Goa.

Shweta kapila cows are prevalent in Valpoi and Saakeri regions of the Satari taluka in North Goa as well as in some parts of South Goa. Based on the institute’s findings through farmer interviews, approximately 5,000 animals of this breed are estimated to be in Goa.

“Many farmers believe that the milk from Shweta kapila cows has medicinal properties and is being used to treat gastrointestinal disorders and other health problems. The milk yield of these cows may vary from two to six litres under grazing with minimum feeding inputs,” animal scientist Shivasharanappa N has stated in his report on the breed.

Looking at the tremendous potential of this distinct cow breed in Goa, the institute’s team of scientists has begun work on documentation of this breed based on its phenotypic characteristics. They have also started working on characterisation of A1/A2 milk protein gene from indigenous dairy cattle in this region by molecular biotechnological tests.

“There is an urgent need for proper documentation and registration of the Shweta kapila. The conservation of elite germplasm of the cattle will help farmers shift from cross breed cows to local cows as they produce A2 milk with medicinal properties and which further significantly enhances the milk production of Goa,” the scientists stated.

344,['25/02/2020'],Recover Rs74.87 lakh from RFO for wrongdoings: Probe panel,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Nagpur: In an unprecedented decision, a range forest officer (RFO) from Yavatmal has been asked to deposit Rs74.87 lakh for irregularities committed by him in plantation and nursery development works under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

Sources said based on information received under RTI, a complaint was lodged by one Sachin Kukkulwar from Jodmoha in Kalamb tehsil with Yavatmal collector alleging financial irregularities by RFO SG Hatkar.

Hatkar was RFO, Hiwri, under Yavatmal forest division in 2017-2018. After the complaint, a committee was set up in March 2019 under Yavatmal collector to probe the matter. The committee found glaring irregularities committed by Hatkar in purchases for raising 6.95 lakh saplings in eight nurseries under Hiwri range. The report was submitted to Yavatmal conservator of forests (CF) Ravindra Wankhede in November 2019.

The committee charged Hatkar with financial bunglings in purchases of material from various parties by violating prescribed procedure. These purchases relate to green nets, teak root stumps, bamboo sticks, sand, soil, manure, polybags, watering of plants among other things.

Some of the works were carried out despite lack of provision in the budget. These irregularities in purchases and other works amounted to over Rs74.87 lakh.

Based on its findings, the committee not only directed to recover entire amount from Hatkar but also recommended action against him under Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1979, and MGNREG Act, 2005.

“On the recommendation of the collector-led committee, we have issued a challan to Hatkar on January 2, 2020, and asked him to deposit the money in government treasury in 30 days. However, Hatkar has moved Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT) against the decision,” said Yavatmal deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Dr BN Pingle.

Hatkar, who has been posted in social forestry department (SFD) in Yavatmal now, has contended that the committee’s recommendation is one-sided as he was not allowed to submit his say.

“The forest department and collector have been asked to file reply in three weeks,” Pingle added.

Tuesday is the deadline to fix cameras

BHUBANESWAR: The Council of Higher Secondary Education (CHSE) has issued an ultimatum (February 25) to all examination centres to install CCTV cameras for higher secondary examination. The higher secondary schools or junior colleges , which will fail to install CVTVs by the deadline, will not be allowed to conduct the annual plus two exam, an official source said. The exam will begin from March 7.

“All 1,142 exam centres have been asked to install CCTV cameras to ensure free and fair exam. But it came to our notice that many college authorities have not yet installed the cameras. We will tag the centres without CCTVs with nearby colleges having such surveillance system. By February 25, the colleges have to inform whether they have completed the process or not,” said CHSE controller of examinations Bijay Kumar Sahu.

Despite several reminders, some junior colleges in the state did install CCTVs. The CHSE decided to put all examination centres under CCTV surveillance to ensure free and fair Plus Two exam in 2019.

Meanwhile, the CHSE has appointed centre superintendents for exam centres. The headmasters of higher secondary schools, which have become exam centres, will be the centre superintendents. If relatives of the principals are engaged in the exam duty, the latter would hand over the charge to senior teaching staff. Besides, a deputy superintendent will also be engaged in examination duty, Sahu said.

To ensure security of question papers, the CHSE has set up examination management hubs (EMHs) across the state. Question papers will be kept in strong rooms in these EMHs with 24x7 security arrangement. Question papers will be sent to the EMHs this week for first-phase exam.

“The district administrations will declare these strong rooms as temporary treasury and ensure security. These strong rooms will operate till the answer sheets of the region reach CHSE office,” he added.

The process of handing over of question papers to hub supervisers must be recorded on the CCTV. Besides, a police van will pilot when question papers will be transferred from the EMHs to the examination centres, an official said.

Raising a special mention during the Zero Hour in the assembly, Sangod constituency MLA Bharat Singh cited a 2019 Transparency International report to say that Rajasthan ranks first in the country in terms of corruption and those caught taking bribe rejoin their duty ""with pride after serving a jail term"".

Singh urged the House Chair to allow a day-long discussion to know the views of other assembly members. In the present arrangement, the state government's resolution to eliminate corruption seems impossible, he said.

It is necessary an arrangement is made to dismiss those from service who are caught taking bribe by the ACB.

The MLA said 2,067 government employees and public representatives were caught taking bribe by the ACB in last five years. However, challans were issued only in 986 cases and the rest were still under consideration, he said, adding some of the accused are absconding.

He claimed that those caught taking bribe include officers at the level of the chief secretary, IAS, IPS and village sarpanchs. PTI

Dehradun: Officials of the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) on Monday inspected its old trenching ground at Sahastradhara road and announced a plan to remove the trash that still lies at the site. The DMC stopped using the dumping ground in 2017, but the garbage was never removed.

“We inspected the site today and tried to analyse its condition. Soon, the tonnes of waste lying there will be removed. Our aim is to remove all the waste there and level the ground. However, we have not decided what to convert the site into once it is cleaned up,” said DMC commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey.

A source indicated that the site might be converted into a martyrs’ memorial public park once the waste is shifted.

Interestingly, the Supreme Court had directed the local administration to treat the waste in Sahastradhara and convert the site into a public park back in May, 2014. If the apex court orders had been followed, the facility would have been ready by now.

The municipal corporation is currently dumping waste at the Shishambara Waste Management Plant. Local residents there have been protesting for months to shift the dumping ground to the city’s outskirts as it is causing health complications among those living in the vicinity.

Nashik: The process of authenticating the accounts of the beneficiaries of loan waiver schemes with their Aadhaar number has started in the district.

“The process of authenticating the accounts has started in Chandori village in Niphad taluka and Sonambe village in Sinnar taluka,” said deputy district registrar, Nashik, Gautam Balsane.

Balsane was in the two villages to see if the authentication process was being conducted as per proces and if farmers were facing any issues. Over 778 farmers were identified from the two villages as beneficiaries for the loan waiver scheme.

“Once we verify the accounts of the beneficiaries with their Aadhaar cards, the loan amount will be waived from their bank accounts,” said Balsane. According to the state government’s loan waiver scheme, farmers having total outstanding loan worth Rs 2 lakh are to benefit from the scheme. Around 1.47 lakh farmers from the district are expected to benefit from the loan waiver scheme.

Various nationalized, private and cooperative banks, which had provided loans to the farmers, were asked to upload the Aadhaar number associated with every account. Thereafter, the process of clubbing all the loans linked to one Aadhaar number was carried out.

“The banks have come up with the list of farmers who fit the criteria for loan waiver. Farmers will have to look for their names in the list and then go either to the Aaple Sarkar Seva Kendra, consumer facilitation centre, private and nationalized banks or the Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank to authenticate their Aadhaar number with the unique number allotted to them,” said Balsane.

All the banks across the district are expected to publish the list of beneficiaries by February 28. The district administration is taking efforts to complete the authentication process in a week, so that the loan disbursement process begins soon.

Once the verification is complete, the beneficiaries receive a government letter stating that their account will be credited with the amount they had taken as loan. Farmers will then be able to obtain loan for crops to be cultivated in the kharif season starting from June or with the onset of rainfall.

“After the farmer’s account is credited with the aid from the government, he can proceed to obtain a new loan that will be given to him in April / May or as and when required,” said Madhukar Tarle, a farmer.

Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) has finalised a vendor to develop the Santa Monica jetty in Panaji. An area of 1,000sqm will be leased out to a private player while the government will earn Rs 1.2 crore annually.

Tourism, secretary J Ashok Kumar confirmed to TOI that the vendor has been finalised through a tender. GTDC will proceed with the formal appointment of the vendor after approval is received from the government.

The vendor will build facilities like restrooms for tourists visiting the jetty and also construct a restaurant and host other commercially-viable activities.

The jetty was reconstructed over three years ago, but hardly offers any facilities for tourists though footfalls even during non-peak tourist season are impressive.

During season time, the crowd at the jetty is maddening and leads to traffic chaos in the evenings— and there are no traffic policemen posted there to ensure the safety of pedestrians, complain tourism stakeholders.

In 2016, GTDC’s plans for development of the jetty were halted, when the government did not approve its plan to lease the entire area – jetty plus multi-level car park— to a single party.

While it wanted to float a fresh tender, it could not, owing to construction of the Atal Sethu as some building material was stored there.

NEW DELHI: On February 27 last year, head constable Ratan Lal was the talking point among his colleagues and seniors because his moustache was similar to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who had shot down a Pak F-16 fighter jet that day.Exactly a year later, the 42-year-old policeman died a heroic death while bravely fighting rioters in northeast Delhi. He had joined Delhi Police in 1998 as a constable.Lal was currently posted in Gokulpuri. The ACP he reported to was also injured in the riots. Known to be a confident and brave cop, Lal led many raids conducted by Gokulpuri police in the last few years because of his strong built.“An outstanding policeman with indefatigable attitude and tremendous positive energy,” recalled additional DCP Brijender Yadav to whom Lal reported to a few years ago. Yadav, in his profile as ACP (Gokulpuri), had given many citations to Lal for his excellent performance.Born in a middle-class family in Sikar, Rajasthan, Lal was the eldest among three brothers and a sister. He lived with his wife and three children — two girls aged 11 and 12 and a boy aged 8 — in north Delhi’s Burari. He had promised his children that they would celebrate Holi at their village in Tihawali. He had lost his father a decade ago. His mother has not been informed of his death as yet.“My brother-in law informed us about his death and we immediately switched off the TV so that our mother does not see anything. She knows we are hiding something from her as people are coming to meet us more than usual. She doesn’t know how to use social media, so she cannot get to know of his death online,” said a family member.Speaking to TOI, Lal’s younger brother Dinesh said, “He was a patriot. He wanted to don the uniform from the very beginning. He had immense patience. We never saw him scream or shout at people. He last came over a month ago when a relative had passed away.”Dinesh appealed to people not to be violent. “I lost my brother today, but tomorrow it could be anyone else,” he added.Lal’s colleagues said he would always volunteer for difficult and dangerous assignments. “He was instrumental in nabbing the accused in a gruesome rape of two tribal women in 2013 and in an act of vandalism committed by a group of wrestlers at a restaurant in Seemapuri,” said an officer.His villagers have demanded a “martyr” status for him and that he be consigned to flames with full state honours.

Nashik: The Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU) has decided to recognise the skill-based projects done by jail inmates so that the convicts can get employment in industries or begin their own work after their release from prisons.

The inmates usually prefer to learn mobile repairing, plumbing, making Paithani sarees, bedsheets, Ganesh idols, soaps, bakery products etc. Some of them also cook in the central kitchen.

“The projects undertaken by the convicts in our jails are efficient and skill-based. They will help the inmates build on their confidence and reform their lives once they are out of the prison,” said E Vayunandan, the YCMOU vice-chancellor. The varsity was approached by an Aurangabad-based NGO called Samta Foundation that has been working on reformation of convicts over the past three years.

Deepak Loya, the head of prisoner reform project, told TOI: “There are several convicts who work hard and take part in skill-based projects. They hope to get back on their feet once out of jail. Our objective is to ensure that they do not commit another crime after serving their sentence.”

There are 45 prisons in Maharashtra, but they do not provide any certificate to the convicts, added Loya. The certificates that will be provided to the convicts will be from the YCMOU and Samta Foundation.

Thiruvananthapuram: The social justice department has brought out some amendments in the guidelines for adoption . The major change that has been brought is that annual income of the prospective parents has been brought down to Rs 2.5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh.

The governing body of the state adoption resource agency has decided to bring down the annual income stipulation since people who had come forward for adoption had alleged that their applications were rejected since they could not prove the annual income.

Health minister K K Shailaja said after the meeting that “if the parents cannot produce the income certificate then they should produce certificates to prove that they have assets worth Rs 50 lakh without any liabilities”. The income limit had adversely affected adoptions in the state and hence it was decided to bring down the annual income limit, she added.

The district adoption committees have been asked to scrutinize the applications once again as per the new amendment.

US President Donald Trump. (AFP)

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Monday reaffirmed cooperation with India in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism , underlining a key area unaffected by ups and downs over trade and tariffs as security agencies collaborate closely on counter-terrorism.

“The United States and India are also firmly united in our ironclad resolve to defend our citizens from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism,” Trump said at Motera Stadium with US agencies often playing a crucial role in assisting terrorism investigations in India as after major terror strikes like 26/11.

“Both of our countries have been hurt by the pain and turmoil of terrorism and that terrorism brings. Under my administration, we unleashed the full power of the American military on bloodthirsty killers of Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria. Today, the IS territorial caliphate has been 100% destroyed. And the monster known as Al Baghdadi , the founder and leader of IS, is dead,” Trump said.

In addition, he defended the US’s measures to secure its borders. “In the United States, we have also made clear that while our country will always welcome newcomers who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorists and terrorism and to any form of extremism,” he said.

PM Narendra Modi repeated the sentiment. “We are together in our fight against terror. We are inspired by a long-term vision. Our cooperation will grow and we will fulfil the dreams of our nations,” he said. The cooperation has also found voice in military joint exercises and sharing of logistics.

Madurai: Two more Indian crew on board quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess at Yokohama in Japan tested positive for Covid-19 positive on Monday, taking the number of Indians infected by the virus in the ship, to 14.

After disembarking passengers, the mandatory test for all crew members on board was conducted on February 20 and results of the PCR test is being released in a phased manner. Four Indians tested positive two days ago and two more names were added on Monday.

Indian crew members on board complained that proper quarantine measures were not carried out inside the ship. A couple of those who were later quarantined after they tested positive were having food with the other crew members in the common mess area.

There is fear of the numbers climbing as the official Twitter handle of the Indian Embassy in Japan has stated that the results of all crew members will be out by February 25 or 26. In a series of tweets and messages on Twitter and Facebook, the Indian embassy confirmed that all 14 Indians who tested positive for Covid-19 are responding well to treatment.

“Indian Embassy is awaiting test results and is coordinating with Japanese authorities and ship management company for safe return of all Indian nationals who do not test positive for Covid-19,” they stated on their Facebook page.

It received strong replies from the crew on board Diamond Princess.

“Many of us have already completed quarantine and tested negative. Are you waiting for all of us to test positive?” asked a crew. “Why is the embassy not replying to our mails. You are saying that you are in touch with us but when we mail you with our concerns, we are not getting any response from anybody,” said another.

Responding to the messages, the embassy thanked the crew for their patience and reassured that they are working on their early and safe return.

Stating that there has been no official announcement on crew members affected by Covid-19, the crew said that 64 have tested positive till Monday.

Princess Cruises, the parent company of the ship that provided daily updates on the status of the quarantine on their official website has not given any update after February 20, raising concern among crew members.

“On Monday the (ship) captain announced that Philippines will evacuate its crew members on Tuesday and asked Philippines crew to be ready with their baggage. We await a similar message for the Indian crew members. It’s a week since we filled up the forms sent by the Indian Embassy in Japan asking interest to prematurely leave the ship if the government arranged a chartered flight,” Anbalagan, 41, a chef from Madurai said.

Nashik: Two woman corporators — Priyanka Ghate of the BJP and the Shiv Sena’s Poonam Mogre — lashed out their respective party leaderships in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for ignoring their names for the new member positions on the standing committee.

Both corporators questioned their senior party functionaries outside the House before the general body meeting started. Ghate also tendered her resignation to the municipal commissioner, party MLAs and city president of the party.

She also staged sit-in agitations along with her supporters at the mayor Satish Kulkarni’s official residence, but the mayor was not home. After half-an-hour Ghate called off her agitation.

Speaking to reporters, Ghate said the new corporators are being sidelined within the party. “We never worked against the party, but we have not been given any opportunity or any posts in the NMC in the past three years. Therefore, I have given my resignation to the municipal commissioner, the party MLAs as well as the BJP city president,” she said.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena corporator Poonam Mogre said that though she was not disappointed in her party, she felt that the new corporators were being ignored while opportunities for various NMC posts were given. The party leadership should give an opportunity to the new members and consider their names while appointing members to various committees and posts, Mogre said.

The mayor had called a special meeting of the NMC general body on Monday to appoint new members on the standing committee. Sensing trouble, he hurriedly announced the names of the eight new standing committee members and concluded the House proceedings.

The mayor announced the names of eight of 16 members, which included four members from BJP, two from Sena and one each from Congress and NCP.

The eight new members are Hemant Shetti, Supriya Khode, Rakesh Donde, Varsha Bhalerao, Satyabhama Gadekar, Sudhakar Badgujar, Rahul Dive and Samina Meman.

BJP corporator Dinkar Patil said BJP is a disciplined party and no injustice is done on anyone. Hence, there is no chance that the party is ignoring new members.

She was sitting in the passenger’s seat. She has been charged with the offence of abetment of crime as she allowed Venkitaraman to drive the car though he was allegedly drunk.

Police had failed to take Venkitaraman for blood alcohol test immediately after the accident and delayed it by more than 10 hours. The state government had placed Venkitaraman under suspension after the opposition raised questions on his act.

Congress also filed complaints with SEC and the chief secretary over the alleged violation by the chief minister who flagged off the carnival parade and delivered a speech along with tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and town and country planning (TCP) minister Chandrakant Kavalekar.

Congress referred to SEC’s letter to the director of tourism which states that “no political functionary should inaugurate or close the function or deliver speech throughout the event”. “The chief minister of Goa has not only flagged off the parade, but has also given a speech which was political and targeting a certain section of society,” general secretary of Goa Congress Pradesh Committee (GPCC), Amarnath Panjikar, stated in a letter to the SEC.

In the letter addressed to the chief secretary, Panjikar complained that the director of tourism, under alleged political pressure, did not follow instructions of the SEC and allowed political functionaries to directly participate and use the carnival at Panaji and Margao for political propaganda. “Strict action needs to be initiated against the tourism department,” stated the Congress’ letter to the chief secretary.

Indore: A local complaints committee (LCC) under Vishaka Guidelines on Monday recorded statements of witnesses including the complainant in a case filed against suspended deputy commissioner of cooperative department.

Accused Rajesh Kumar Kshatri, who is absconding since an FIR lodged against him at MG Road police station, failed to appear before the committee prompting it to complete ex-parte proceedings.

A government employee had last month filed molestation complaint against Kshatri and taking cognizance of it, the state government suspended him. On January 28, MG Road police lodged an FIR against him and also raided his house to arrest him but he was not there.

According to LCC members, Kshatri was not receiving notices and summon was pasted at his house giving him last chance to appear before the committee to file his reply on allegations made against him. On Monday, the committee had asked the complainant and other witnesses to record their statements and furnish proof including mobile recordings and messages while Kshatri was issued a notice to challenge the same.

The complainant has alleged that Kshatri had been harassing her for the past one year, used to send text messages to her late in night. He also tried to molest her in his cabin on pretext of meeting for an official work.

“Kshatri failed to appear before the committee as he was given chance first to challenge the allegations made against him and second to present his side against the statements and other proof furnished by the witnesses. The committee then carried out the proceedings one-sided,” an LCC member said.

Sources said the committee has completed entire proceedings related to the case and is likely to deliver its verdict within a week.

Madurai: Stating that Citizenship (Amendment) Act would not have been passed if the AIADMK and PMK had opposed it, CPI(M) politburo member G Ramakrishnan questioned “If welfare of the people or their alliance dharma with the BJP is important for AIADMK and PMK?” Ramakrishnan was addressing reporters after releasing a booklet titled ‘Kudiurimai Thirutha Sattama allathu Kudi Kedukkum Thittama’ (CAA or scheme for citizenship destruction) that was prepared by the CPI(M) state council.

The 16-page Tamil booklet released was received by representatives from Tamilnadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi and Madurai mavatta Aikkiya Jamath Peravai. “The booklet is to support the ongoing strong protests across the State and India against CAA,” the former CPI(M) state secretary said. He stated that the CAA, NRC and NPR are tactics of the BJP to implement the RSS ideology of ‘Hindu Rashtra’.

Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah are determined to implement CAA, NRC and NPR despite a losing streak in the assembly elections in Bihar Odisha, Andhra, Telangana and Delhi, he added that the CPI(M) and those opposing it will continue protesting till the three initiatives are defeated. “It is not too late,” he said and added that the meeting to be conducted by the party in Chennai on Wednesday will serve as such a platform.

Ramakrishnan said that many poor villagers from rural Tamil Nadu migrated to cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai many years ago for their livelihood. “What certificate would they be carrying? Their children and grandchildren may know the place of birth of their ancestors who migrated but not the date. In that case they will be marked as doubtful citizens and detained in detention camps like the ones in Assam,” he said.

Saying so, he claimed that 25 persons lodged in detention camps in Assam have died and it includes Hindus. “These acts are not against Muslims alone. They are against the poor,” he added. He said that CAA, NRC and NPR will destroy the vision of a secular, democratic and economically independent India that our forefathers had when the country got independence. The government of Tamil Nadu should pass resolutions against CAA and NPR, he reiterated.

He accused the AIADMK government of contradictory stands on NPR. Stating that revenue minister R B Udhayakumar had replied the DMK that they have written to the Centre seeking clarification on three questions (10, 13 and 14) out of 21 questions in the NPR, he pointed out that without getting the clarifications AIADMK has announced that NPR will be conducted in June. He asked the government not to cheat people with their drama.

Mhow: A total of 28 illegal structures encroaching upon defence land were brought down in an anti-encroachment drive at Mhow on Monday. Defence estate officer (DEO) Neha Gupta led her team assisted by the team of Mhow Cantonment Board, police and administration in demolishing the 28 shops constructed in the premises of Bungalow no. 86 (also called Barwani Bungalow) situated near government high school at Mhow.

A large police force reached Mhow on two buses from Indore in early morning hours and all policemen were positioned between Hariphatak square and the school.

As soon as the magistrate naib tehsildar Ritesh Joshi arrived at the spot, DEO Neha Gupta ordered her team to start the action on the illegal construction. The residents and shop owners reached there on getting information that their shops were being razed. They tried to hamper the action but were restricted by the troops.

Mhow MLA Usha Thakur reached there as half of the shops had been flattened. Thakur asked Gupta to give some time to the residents to evict and remove the structures but Gupta told her that they had already been given time of more than a year. On this, they both had a heated exchange of words for over 15 minutes.

Gupta agreed to give two hours to the shop owners for removing their own constructions but by then all structures had been razed.

Usha Thakur raised the issue of Khan Colony where a large number of multistorey houses have been constructed on defence land and asked Gupta that why doesn’t the department take action in that area.

Mhow: Kishanganj police have arrested six minors in connection to the vandalism incident which had rocked Kishanganj on Sunday. Seven have been booked in the case so far who were identified on the basis of CCTV footage.

Accused Appa alias Rahul Lodhi, 20, is on the run. A scooter and a bike have been recovered from the accused that were used in the crime.

Kishanganj police station in charge Shashikant Chorasiya told TOI that the accused revealed all of them had consumed bhang and under its influence, they drove through colonies hurling stones on cars and houses.

Chorasiya said that the CCTV cameras installed in about half a dozen houses in all three colonies led to the arrests.

Residents of three colonies at Mhowgaon had their worst nightmare when bike-borne youths damaged their cars and window panes by pelting it with stones on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. The miscreants riding on five to six two-wheelers broke the windshields of over 80 cars in Jawaharnagar, Shantinagar and Supercity. Some of them had their faces covered.

Residents were worried as some of them were of the view that if the miscreants are not arrested, they could attempt even more harmful acts in the colonies.

Nashik: The fate of the smart city development corporation’s rent-a-cycle project hangs in the balance as besides the significant drop in the number of people opting for the rides, the cycles are either missing from the stands or are damaged beyond repair.

CEO of Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) Prakash Thavil said, “When the project was initiated, there were around 900 takers for the cycles. Now, hardly 100 people opt for the cycle rides. We are creating awareness among the residents about the project. We have also joined hands with Nashik Cyclists Foundation to create awareness.”

Thavil said they would conduct a survey to find out how many cycles have been damaged. A senior official from HYPL said, “It is really unfortunate that over 100 cycles have been damaged. After all, it is public property. The government should have taken some steps to keep a check on miscreants damaging cycles.”

“There is no question of winding up the project. We need to brand and market the rent-a-cycle project properly to evoke interest among citizens,” said the official. tnn

Thrissur: A new team led by Thrissur deputy transport commissioner M Suresh, on Monday, visited the accident site at Avinashi in Tamil Nadu , where a container truck collided with a KSRTC bus. The team was appointed on the directive of transport minister A K Saseendran.

The team inspected the site in detail. An inspection report will be submitted to the transport commissioner, officials said. Allegations rose that the report by the Palakkad enforcement RTO had no scientific facts. The transport minister then appointed a new team led by Suresh and enforcement RTOs Shaji Madhavan and P Sivakumar. Motor vehicle inspectors Appu P M, Padmalal P T, N Vinod Kumar, Tamil Nadu RTO and police officers also joined the inspection. The RTO enforcement report found that the truck driver may have fallen asleep or while negotiating a curve at high speed, he may have lost control of the vehicle.

The container truck had collided into the KSRTC bus on the Salem-Kochi national highway near Avinashi on February 20 at 3.30am. The accident killed 19 people and many were injured.

370,['25/02/2020'],Junk food continues to be sold on school campuses,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Madurai: While most of the schools in the city have stopped sale of junk food items and restricted its consumption by students inside their campuses, few schools continue to sell junk food items on their campuses.

Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) recently has made draft regulations titled Food Safety and Standards (Safe food and healthy diets for school children) Regulations, 2019, which bans sales of food items containing salt, sugar and fats in high levels, in school campuses. Junk food cannot even be displayed or sold within 50 metres of the school campuses, according to the draft regulations.

Some of the private schools continue to sell junk food in campuses despite recent circulars sent to schools by food safety officials from Madurai district restricting them to do so. Recently, junk food items were sold in large quantities in a popular private school near Koodalpudur during an event, which saw a participation of students and parents from various other schools. Students purchased high caloric drinks, fried food and packed food consisting high salt level.

M Senthil Nathan, president of matriculation schools in Madurai district, said that most of the schools have stopped selling junk food in campuses. However, they could not check sales of junk food in shops outside their schools. “Consumption of junk food has come down due to the increased awareness among parents and students in higher standards like IXth and Xth. However, children in lower classes continue to consume junk food items outside the campus as they are not aware of the risk,” he said.

A food safety official said that apart from sending circulars, they also conducted awareness meeting involving private and government school teachers in Madurai district. They will soon conduct inspections in school premises and areas around the schools to ensure that junk food items are not sold.

“Teachers can inform them if they come across traders near schools selling junk food items. We will take appropriate action against the trader,” he said.

371,['25/02/2020'],Licences of over 55k drivers suspended,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Madurai: More than 55,000 licences have been suspended/cancelled by the transport department based on recommendations made by police units across nine southern districts in 2019. The action was taken for not following traffic rules and causing accidents due to negligence.

Transport department officials said that 76,554 recommendations were made by nine police units, of which action was taken on 72% of the recommendations.

Madurai district police unit has made the highest number of recommendations for suspension/cancellation in 2019, while the lowest number was recorded in Kanyakumari district.

More than 15,000 licences were cancelled/suspended in Madurai district, while it was around 1,000 in Kanyakumari.

An official from Madurai district said that they are recommending cancellation/suspension only in cases of extreme negligence, causing deaths and repeated violations. While all drivers faced such action, bike riders faced the maximum recommendations. “No one is deterred by penalty as most of the common offences attract only Rs 100. But, when they realise that licences will be suspended for a few months and they cannot ride/drive their vehicles, it creates a strong deterrence,” he said.

The official added that details of suspended licences is updated online by transport authorities.

Every single recommendation made by Kanyakumari and Sivaganga districts was accepted by the concerned road transport officials, whereas 99.95% recommendations made by the Ramanathapuram police was accepted. But, in Dindigul and Tuticorin districts, only around 50% of the recommendations were accepted.

Police officials say that action on licence helps deter erring motorists as the recent rule by the road transport department increasing penalty for traffic violation has not been implemented in Tamil Nadu so far. The enhanced penalty is only followed in cases of drunk and drive, since the cases are directly dealt by courts, they say.

Nashik: The Cantonment Board, Deolali (CBD), has kicked off the process to repair 3,000 defunct streetlights in the entire cantonment area.

The CBD officials said that apart from repairing the defunct lights they would also erect more than 250 new LED streetlights with poles at various places.

“We have started identifying the obsolete streetlights and repairing them in the cantonment area. This will ease commuting at night,” said Ajay Kumar, the board’s chief executive officer.

According to the officials, the Cantonment Board, Deolali has decided to use more than Rs 40 lakh for the repair of the old and installation of the new streetlights.

“There are 3,314 existing streetlight poles that we are examining during the night and repairing during the day in case they are faulty,” the officials added.

The repair and new installations will take about a month.

“We are making provisions for over 250 new fixtures that will be spread across the cantonment area. The whole project should get over by March 31,” the officials said.

Sushil Chavan, a resident of the Deolali cantonment area, appreciated the board’s actions.

“I finish my work only after dark every day and my residence is in the interiors. If the streetlights are repaired, it will be very helpful for me. The LED lights will be more efficient. Also, there is still the lurking danger of leopards,” he said.

Another resident of the cantonment area applauded the installation of new streetlights.

“I work as a night watchman in one of the housing societies. I have to commute late at night to work. There are many areas along the way that do not have any streetlights. Since the board is putting up more poles, my problem will be resolved,” said Viraj.

A man pushes his scooter after violence errupts in Trilokpuri

NEW DELHI: Minor flare-ups involving two communities are not that uncommon in the capital but full-fledged communal riots are not frequent. It was in 2014 that the city witnessed large-scale violence in the Trilokpuri riots. Seven years later, communal violence has come back to haunt the capital as the anti-CAA protests taken a violent turn.

There had been no casualties in the Trilokpuri riots though over three dozen people were injured in the clashes and subsequent police action. At that time, a mata ki chowki was organised near a mosque in the area on the night of Diwali. What started off as arguments between two groups over playing of loudspeaker turned into a scuffle and led to stone-pelting. The cops managed to control the situation but violence erupted yet again and this time it was fierce and led to instances of firing.

TOI spoke to seasoned policemen who said that apart from the 1984 riots, there was one instance of large-scale violence during a riot which took place a decade prior to that in west Delhi. “Around a dozen people were killed after two communities clashed,” an officer recalled.

In recent times, the police have been often able to control the situation before it spun out of control. After the Trilokpuri riots, Delhi Police had formed Aman committees, comprising elderly members and religious preachers from different communities. They have often been police’s troubleshooters and helped defuse tension after the police contained the violence.

Members of two communities had clashed in north-west Delhi’s Sangam Park area in June 2018. Around six people were injured in the stone-pelting leading to tension in the area. The locality was a volatile one with a history of communal tension.

In 2016, two communities had clashed after a minor girl from the Valmiki community was molested by a man from another religion. The cops were vigilant and moved swiftly to control the situation when they clashed again in 2018.

Another cop narrated a recent incident in which a temple was vandalised in central Delhi last year but cops managed to defuse the situation. In both incidents, elderly members of both communities played a pivotal role in restoring peace.

Indore: Madhya Pradesh, eyeing spot in top five tourist destinations in the country, has less than 500 hotels having 25 rooms capacity while top 34 tourist destinations lack any form of recreational activities, showed a survey.

Khajuraho is the only tourist destination with presence of branded hotels with last one to come up in 2008 since then there has been no influx of branded chains at any tourist destinations in the state, the survey showed.

First-of-its-kind hospitality survey by Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board has revealed a wide infrastructure gap in tourism sector and stressed on urgent need to bring in more branded hotels at tourist destinations and promote recreational activities to attract footfall.

“The survey was done to look into all aspects where we are doing good and where we have failed to perform. This will give us a line to work and improve to achieve the desired target in promoting tourism,” said a senior official from tourism department.

A total of 1,480 hotels were surveyed, of which just 33 per cent were found to have minimum 25 rooms. Indore followed by Ujjain has the highest number of standard hotels, the survey showed.

State tourism board in association with the government of India conducted a hospitality survey to ascertain tourism infrastructure and measures to bridge the gap, a move seen promoting tourism and aiming to scale up to top five tourist destinations in the country.

Aiming to attract investors, the state tourism department has picked up land parcels and notified water bodies to bring in new players and branded hotels with slew of subsidies and promotional sops.

The department claimed that in past 4-5 years, an average of 80-100 hotels are coming up in the state every year looking at untapped potential.

The official said, “We are also working to promote scenic and outskirt places as wedding destinations owing to encouraging enquires and feedback from hoteliers. Space constraints in cities have led people move to outskirts and rural areas for hosting functions.”

The survey also included detailed study of 34 tourist destinations and found them having negligible recreational activities such as ropeway, amusement park, museum and theme parks among others to attract footfall.

The state has tweaked the tourism policy to incorporate water and adventure activities at notified water bodies with attractive sops.

Kochi: The high court on Monday disposed of a petition challenging an order issued by state police chief for allegedly granting access to ‘ crime data ’ to a labour cooperative society for handling police clearance for passport verification.

Justice Anu Sivaraman disposed the petition by KPCC secretary Jyothikumar Chamakkala through senior advocate George Poonthottam after state police chief informed the court that the order granting access to Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCC) was a typo and that ‘crime data’ is not being shared. A revised order was subsequently issued, the court was told.

It was contended by the petitioner that the state police chief’s order allows sharing of confidential details of citizens to a private entity, which is impermissible as per law. It affects the right to privacy of citizens and amounts to failure of constitutional functions of the State, he had alleged.

As per the petition, the state police chief’s order directed for granting ULCC access to ‘crime data’, which consists particulars of every crime registered in the state, by permitting access to Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) production API, CCTNS master data, firewall access to CCTN production, API, etc.

378,['25/02/2020'],Book sugar mill for not paying FRP: HC,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Aurangabad: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad has directed the police to register a case against the management of a sugar factory from Majalgaon in Beed for alleged non-payment of fair and remunerative price ( FRP ) to growers within the stipulated 14 days of supply.

The court has directed that the case be registered under sections 3 and 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 on the basis of Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, in respect to the FRP.

The bench, comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar, observed on on February 17 that it was “unfortunate, but a fact that most sugar factories from Maharashtra are not paying FRP to farmers, who are at their mercy as they have no alternative than to supply sugarcane to the nearest sugar factory. This problem of the sugarcane growers is used by the persons in the management of the sugar factory and the farmers are virtually exploited.”

Pawan Ramkisan Chandak (31), an agriculturist from Talkhed in Majalgaon taluka of Beed district, had approached the court seeking directions to register offences against the chairman, vice-chairman of the sugar mill. He had earlier approached different police authorities in Beed district about the non-payment of FRP for the crushing season 2018-19 within 14 days of delivering the sugarcane and even till April 23, 2019, when he filed the complaint.

The court noted that Chandak was paid FRP after he filed the petition. “Admittedly, the price of sugarcane was not paid within 14 days of the date of supply and interest is not paid till today,” the court observed.

The bench noted that the farmers face all kinds of problems due to “such late payment of FRP and non-payment of interest. They cannot repay the loan taken from banks and societies for cultivation purpose. Due to their inability to make payment of the previous loan, the banks and societies are not sanctioning new loans for subsequent crop seasons to the farmers. Due to these circumstances, the incidents of farmers suicides have increased to an alarming extent.”

The high court also observed “though, these circumstances are within the knowledge of sugar commissioner and all the concerned, including the police, actions are not taken against the concerned. This is mainly due to circumstance that the factory owners or the persons managing factory are influential persons and most of them are in politics.”

“In the present matter also, it can be said that the police station has tried to shirk the responsibility by submitting a report that money of the farmers is now paid and the sugar factory has supplied an information that FRP is paid. On the basis of such police report or the payment of FRP, after so many months, the things cannot be closed. They (sugar factories) need to learn a lesson, otherwise these things will be repeated,” it noted.

Gujarat National Law University

AHMEDABAD: At least six students of Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) were bitten by a suspected rabid dog on Sunday evening and night at the campus. The students were taken to a nearby private hospital for vaccination.

GNLU authorities said that none of the students were in any danger.

According to sources at GNLU, the stray dog was a pet of a few students living on the campus. The dog went on a biting spree near the residential areas as the students brought the incident to notice of the university authorities. “All the students were provided necessary vaccines and all are back on the campus,” said a senior GNLU official.

Sources said the dog was later removed from the campus and the students, who keep stray dogs as pets, have been reprimanded. “Keeping a pet on the campus is not allowed. However, a few students had raised objection to the policy and removal of stray dogs on humanitarian grounds. After the incident, it’s likely that the no pet policy could be implemented more stringently,” said the official.

Madurai: Newly-appointed additional director general of police (ADGP) and Madurai city police commissioner, S Davidson Devasirvatham has petitioned the higher authorities to divide Madurai city police jurisdiction into two and to bring each under a deputy commissioner of police in order to effectively maintain law and order and crime prevention.Devasirvatham told this to reporters after assuming charge as ADGP on Monday. The posting, which is at the level of an inspector general was upgraded to ADGP paving way for Devasirvatham to continue as commissioner. Devasirvatham said the proposal was sent a few weeks ago for consideration of higher officials. Once it is implemented policing can be done more effectively as officials will be concentrating their area in a much better way.

At present, crime and law and order is being handled separately by two deputy commissioners respectively by K Palanikumar and E Karthick. There are some grey areas. For instance, four newly-added stations like Thirupparankundram, Thirunagar, Avaniyapuram and Koodalpudur do not have a separate crime station, while the remaining police stations have law and order and crime. DC law and order takes care of crime incidents in such stations. tnn

Experts also said that the rise in prices will adversely impact demand of gold

AHMEDABAD: Continuing its upward rally riding on global factors, gold price breached the Rs 45,000-mark in the Ahmedabad market on Monday, touching a new record-high price. Pure gold price settled at Rs 45,050 per 10 gram in Ahmedabad on Monday, including 3% goods and services tax (GST), increasing by Rs 900 against Thursday’s price.

Analysts said that the increase in price can be attributed to the rise in international price of gold, owing to spike in cases of coronavirus infections in China and other countries and consequent concerns over its impact on the global market.

“Gold prices rose to $1,689 per ounce in the international market amid rising concerns over impact of the spread of coronavirus not just in China but other countries as well. Concerned over adverse fallouts of this situation on the global markets, investors have begun moving towards safe-haven investments in gold as a result of which prices have gone up. Consequently, gold prices touched a new record high in the Ahmedabad market as well,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

“The restrictions imposed by Singapore on movement of passengers has also fuelled rise in prices,” Acharya added.

Experts said that prices are expected to rise further in the days to come. “Throughout the year, gold prices will continue to rise and this is because of rapidly changing global scenario. Big investors across the world have turned to safe-haven investments in gold,” said Sudhish Nambiath, head, India Gold Policy Centre (IGPC), Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Experts also said that the rise in prices will adversely impact demand of gold. “Gold imports in Gujarat for January already plunged to 0.92 metric tonne in anticipation of customs duty cut in the Union Budget announcement. Currently, the demand has sustained only due to the ongoing wedding season and after mid-March, if prices continue to remain high, this will further come down,” said a gold analyst.

The HC has also instructed the district judiciary heads to take initiatives for paper saving as much as possible.

PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump wave the crowd at ‘Namaste Trump’ event (ANI Photo)

AHMEDABAD: A group of 25 traders had the challenging task of performing ‘Gair-Naach’, a Rajasthani folk dance performed mainly by the Bhil community, for six long hours on Monday morning. But the troupe comprising all men were not complaining as they danced away enthusiastically showcasing their native state Rajasthan at the roadshow of US President Donald Trump and Indian PM Narendra Modi.

""Our troupe played the dhol non-stop and danced to its beats with gunghroos tied to our feet almost non-stop,"" said a businessman Bhimji Chaudhary, one of the troupe members.

All along the 22km roadshow, tableaux, folk dancers and musicians rolling out the cultural tapestry from 28 states of India lined the roadsides, making it a sight to behold. At least 50 stages were set up with some bearing unique names like Lilliput and Michael Jackson.

Young, old and children alike thronged the roads to watch Trump. ""I have come to watch Trump with my eight months old baby,"" said a housewife Meena Bharwad.

There was unprecedented curiosity over Trump’s bulletproof limousine ‘The Beast’ as large crowds bent over the railings to click picture of the vehicle. Unlike Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and wife Akie Abe, who participated in the 8km roadshow from airport to Gandhi Ashram in an open vehicle, the fact that Trump was in a closed vehicle was a bit of a dampener.

""It would have been great if we have caught a glimpse of Trump and Modi together. But we understand the security concerns,"" said Madhav Patel, a professional.

At many places, cops were seen having a tough time to restrain the enthusiastic crowds behind the makeshift barricades as they clamoured to get pictures in their mobile phones. Policemen were also seen enjoying the roadshow on TV sets in shops in Motera. The Trump euphoria at Motera had attracted salesmen from cities as far as Kolkata to sell their wares.

Subrato Paul and Riddhan Sarkar who travelled from Kolkata hoping to sell Team India t-shirts and tricolours failed to make brisk sales but were happy to witness history of a different kind at the world’s biggest cricket stadium.

Incredible, unbelievable, tweet the guests

Donald Trump, from his personal Twitter account, shared pictures of the event and also tweeted in Hindi. In one of the tweets featuring him and PM Modi, he wrote, 'Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words: ‘We the people’. That means that in America and India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve!' The tweet also had flags of both the nations. Robert C O’Brien, US national security advisor, who was part of the Trump convoy, tweeted video of the roadshow. In his tweet, he mentioned, ‘Incredible crowd for @realDonaldTrump & @narendramodi in India. Bigger attendance than a SEC football game! USA-India relations are at an all time high point! #NamasteTrump. Another tweet by him, capturing the roadshow, was retweeted by Ivanka Trump .

In a tweet, Don Scavino Jr., director of social media for Trump, mentioned, ‘In motorcade en route to the stadium. I've never seen anything like this. Unbelievable!!! #NamasteTrump.

Panaji: The united opposition , comprising Congress , Goa Forward Party ( GFP ), MGP and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte, has accused the state government of lying to the people on the Mhadei issue.

They gave the government a month to submit a white paper on the issue, inclusive of all details, affidavits and prayers in various courts and the tribunal. Further, they have threatened a joint agitation if it fails to do so.

“We need to know what the government’s stand was at various stages. Did they oppose the notification of award or did they keep quiet at that time? Everybody is discussing the issue but we don’t know what the prayers of the Goa government were. Let the entire state know,” opposition leader and former chief minister Digambar Kamat said.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai said the white paper is necessary because “the ministers, CM and water resources minister are telling lies”. “We cannot trust what the government and the ministers say,” Sardesai said.

“They keep uttering nonsense. We want it on paper,” he said, adding that on the ground, water is already being diverted.

Sardesai said the state is “succumbing to pressure from the big brother from Delhi” and that former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s 2017 letter to Karnataka BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa was just an election gimmick. Kamat added that the letter was used to show that Goa was sympathetic to Karnataka.

Former Congress chief minister Pratapsingh Rane meanwhile warned that the state could face an ecological disaster.

Accusing the central government of being biased towards Karnataka, MGP’s Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said the diversion of water for Karnataka would dry up the state’s dams much before May. The first to be hit will be the water treatment plant in Sattari, which will affect supply to Bardez, Tiswadi and Ponda talukas, he said.

Khaunte said the Goa government should have been more proactive considering that the Karnataka government has made a huge provision for the water project in its budget.

MADURAI: The Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) sources, on Monday in Madurai , said that to prevent the entry of unauthorized people, only an access card can now open the grill gates leading to the section of corridor outside the two labour theatres at the comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEmONC) building in the hospital. The access card system has been implemented on a trial basis, said hospital sources.

The system has come into place after over two months since the incident when a woman PG doctor was assaulted by a patient’s kin in the same area on December 14. After the attack, GRH doctors and staff had protested demanding for better protection and safety. “The access card system is on trial for a week first. The mechanism for it has been set up. Depending on the feedback, any flaws may be rectified and then it may be implemented full time,” said a hospital source.

According to hospital sources, the GRH dean Dr Sangumani J has distributed access cards to select doctors, medical professionals, staff nurse and PG doctors. The card can be swiped on the machines installed just outside the grill gates leading to the labour theatres to open them. “Without the card, the gates cannot even be opened. Only the security can now allow attenders. They have been instructed to allow attenders inside only in case of emergency. Even the needs of patients like food, water, towels or napkins will be taken in only by the security staff from the attenders to the patients,” said a security staff.

While GRH staff has welcomed the move, there is also concern regarding the practical difficulties of implementation. “Many times previously as well, there has been much resistance and difficulties when we try to restrict the number of attenders and their access. A lot depends on the security staff, who need to be vigilant,” said sources.

Surat: Even as the inquiry by a three-member women committee is probing the alleged stripping of probationary women clerks, the state-government run New Civil Hospital (NCH) waded itself into the row with its superintendent addressing media persons on the issue on Tuesday, much to the chagrin of junior health minister Kishore Kanani.

While the incident of stripping had happened in the Surat Municipal Corporation-run SMIMER hospital, the NCH superintendent Preeti Kapadia addressed media persons in her office and justified undressing of women for fitness and medical test.

Even as she denied having approval from her department to address media when the inquiry committee is already doing its work, Kapadia claimed she had been asked by municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani to explain how the tests are done. Pani, however, categorically denied having asked anyone to hold a press conference.

When contacted, Kanani told TOI: “Why is she holding press conference in NCH on this issue? It is a matter related to SMC and SMIMER. She has not been authorised to speak on this issue by the health department. She cannot do this even if it was done in the capacity of NCH superintendent.

Kanani said he will inquire and take action if necessary.

""I have been asked by the municipal commissioner to call the mediapersons and explain how these fitness tests are conducted. He was to remain present but due to some reason he could not come,"" Kapadia said while replying a question.

However, Pani said he had not asked anyone to hold a press conference. “NCH officials could have requested SMIMER superintendent. I have no role to play in this. I am also not aware that SMC's PRO department made calls to media persons to attend the press conference,” he clarified.

Kamlesh Naik, assistant commissioner, SMC, said, ""The PR department was instructed by the NCH superintendent to ask media persons to come to NCH for briefing. I am not aware about the purpose of press conference.”

Undressing necessary for examination

Surat: Preeti Kapadia was joined in the briefing by Dr Vandana Desai, superintendent of SMIMER and Dr Ashwin Vachhani, head of gynaecology department, SMIMER.

""To examine some parts of a woman, their clothes have to be removed. Cancers of different types require physical examination for which removing clothes is necessary,"" said Kapadia.

""I should not speak this but if I am 25 years of age, unmarried and if I say that my last menstrual was three months ago then obviously I could be pregnant. In that case we will have to check the patient and bring this on record. It can become an issue in job of the woman,"" Kapadia added.

Kapadia, however, could not explain why doctors consider pregnancy as the only cause of disturbed menstrual date. She contradicted the stand of Kamal Dayani, principal secretary, general administration department (GAD) who had stated that there are no rules to check pregnancy or other conduct any such gynaecology tests.

This proposal, however, did not make much headway.But the fresh development has the registration department worried about the impact on its revenues. “Due to economic slowdown, there is no revenue growth in the department, especially in the municipalities and surrounding areas of Hyderabad. The new clause will adversely affect our revenues from registrations,” said a senior official of the stamps and registration department.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74292725,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-175801,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-gets-tough-on-illegal-layouts-stops-registration-sans-papers/articleshow/74291788.cms

Kochi: Two high court benches have recused from considering the appeal filed by the state government against a single bench’s order to take over Kothamangalam church and hand it over to the Orthodox faction.

The appeal came up for hearing before a bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly during the forenoon session on Monday but the bench said it is recusing from the matter.

In the afternoon session, the appeal was scheduled to be heard by another division bench comprising Justice CK Abdul Rehim and Justice TV Anil Kumar but that bench also recused.

The single bench had ordered Ernakulam collector S Suhas to appear before it on Tuesday along with the plan to take over the church and associated properties. In the appeal filed by the collector and other officials on behalf of the government, a stay on the single bench’s directive was also sought.

It was on December 3 that the single bench ordered the collector to take over the church and hand it over to the Orthodox faction. When the order was not implemented, the Orthodox faction had filed a contempt of court case.

399,['25/02/2020'],HC seeks a week’s response from state after PIL wants ban on animals’ entry for slaughter,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Monday gave the state government a weeks’ time to respond to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that has sought a complete ban on the entry of living animals into the hill state.

The division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe heard the matter and listed the case for further hearing next Monday.

The petitioner has argued that since there is a blanket ban on the illegal slaughterhouses in the state and there are no legal ones, the entry of live animals means that they are being brought in for slaughter which is a crime within the territory of the state.

“We said that the honorable high court has banned the illegal slaughterhouses in the state and the government has not set up any slaughterhouse yet. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the animals brought in are being slaughtered in illegal slaughterhouses. That’s why we have said that the court should ban the entry of such animals in Uttarakhand,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, the lawyer appearing for the petitioner.

As reported by TOI earlier, the HC has also been hearing a bunch of petitions which have said that there are no slaughterhouses in the state. The HC has directed the administration as well as municipal councils and corporations across the state to set up slaughterhouses in places like Nainital, Haldwani and Haridwar.

While different district administrations have said that many of the slaughterhouses are at various stages of completion, none of them have become functional yet.

400,['25/02/2020'],Ahmedabad: Chorus of 1.2 lakh responds to US president Donald Trump’s ‘Namaste’,"This story is from February 25, 2020

CM Rupani, Union home minister Amit Shah and other dignitaries at the Motera stadium on Monday

AHMEDABAD: What does it sound like when 1.2 lakh voices cry out an exuberant ‘Namaste’? The warm salutation easily flies across the world’s largest cricket arena — the Motera stadium — from the galleries to the ground, and envelops the VVIP zone on the stage.

""When US President Donald Trump began his speech with ‘Namaste,’ more than 1 lakh people returned the greeting together,"" said Pravin Chauhan, one of the attendees of Monday’s ‘Namaste Trump’ event at the stadium. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call, ‘Long Live Indian-American Friendship’, received a similar response. Besides, the sheer size of the stadium inspired awe.""

The stadium was packed before Modi and Trump arrived at noon. They received a spectacular ovation when they strode onto the stage. Groups from several districts of Gujarat were spread across the stadium. The loudest roar of approval came when Modi and Trump addressed each other as ‘friends’.

The US president’s allusion to Bollywood blockbusters, his ‘chaiwala’ reference about Modi, and his appreciation of the contribution of NRIs in the US drew spirited cheers from the crowd. Moreover, the spectacle seemed to mitigate the effects of the scorching heat for the crowd.

Senior city police officials said that the bandobust at the stadium rivalled that for the annual Rath Yatra in Ahmedabad. ""We had an extensive plan to handle the arrival of participants from outside the city to prevent jams on arterial roads and highways,"" said a senior city police official. ""We also scheduled the entry of people to prevent crowding outside the stadium.""

People were frisked by two cops simultaneously — one focused on the upper part of the body and the other on the lower part. ""This allowed us to frisk each person in just five seconds,"" the official said. ""Still, it took about three-and-a-half hours for the stadium to fill up.""

To provide uniformity to the crowd, various groups had provided specially designed white T-shirts and caps to the participants. A few groups entered the stadium with saffron jackets with ‘Namaste Trump’ logo emblazoned on them. Legions of people wore Modi and Trump masks.

A participant from Khokhra in Ahmedabad, who did not wish to be named, said that the area corporators took him and others in the neighourhood to the venue in buses.

""In the morning, we were provided breakfast before the start of the journey at 8.30am,"" said the participant. ""On the ground, boondi-ganthiya and buttermilk were served."" He said that corporators were asked to take pictures of groups they had brought to the ground.

The stadium began to fill up from 7.30am and a host of performers kept the people entertained before the two world leaders arrived. Among those who performed were Kailash Kher, Veena Saxena, Kinjal Dave, Kirtidan Gadhvi, and Sairam Dave. The energy of the people was reflected in their enthusiasm to dance whenever a folk song was presented.

403,['25/02/2020'],Villagers lock school where teachers forced students to perform in TikTok videos,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Aurangabad: A zilla parishad school at Dharkhed village of Gangakhed, in Parbhani district, was locked down by the locals on Saturday after they came to know that two teachers (a couple), were forcing students to perform in TikTok videos.

Demanding action against the teachers, the villagers sent a letter to the education department alleging that instead of imparting education, the couple was making the students perform in videos for a social networking platform.

On Monday, the villagers were informed by the education department that the two teachers have been shunted out and two new teachers have been appointed in their place. The ZP school in Dharkhed has seven teachers and 163 students of Classes I to VIII.

ZP CEO Pruthviraj BP said, “Today (on Monday), the school functioned normally and all the students attended their classes. I have sought a detailed report from the block education officer based on which, appropriate action would be initiated against the teachers.”

He added that allegations against the teacher-couple resorting to frequent leaves and not focussing on education by the villagers are also being checked.

Meanwhile, the residents said that locking down the school was the last resort as several of their earlier pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Parents Teachers’ Association (PTA) president Ankush Bobde said: “This has been going on for the past three months. Initially, we raised the issue with the school authorities, but nothing happened. So, we finally decided to lock the school.”

After the villagers locked the school gate, the headmaster tried to intervene. Later, the block education officer was forced to go to the village and accept the written complaint.

It was also alleged that teachers used to punish the students who refused to perform in the videos. Panchayat samiti member Jankiram Pawar said nobody at the school was ready to take cognizance of their complaints and that is why the villagers were compelled to take things into their own hands.

“Several videos of the school students have been uploaded on the video-sharing platform by the teachers from their account,” a villager said, adding that teachers should be banned from using mobile phones during the school hours.

404,['25/02/2020'],Conspiracy to defame India: MHA,"This story is from February 25, 2020

New Delhi: The heavy stone-pelting, violence and arson witnessed in parts of Delhi on Monday was a conspiracy to defame India at a time when US President Donald Trump is visiting, minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy has said.

Hitting out at opposition parties for backing the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act, Reddy stated: “This is a conspiracy to defame India. Why are these protests taking place at a time when the US President Donald Trump is visiting the country… Will the opposition parties take responsibility for the death of the Delhi Police constable? Will Congress take responsibility?”

Delhi Police head constable Rattan Lal was killed in the violent protests on Monday. A native of Sikar, Rajasthan, the 42-year old was posted in the office of assistant commissioner of police, Gokulpuri. Many police personnel, including Shahdara DCP Amit Sharma, were injured in the violence. Sharma is now okay, said a source.

Holding out the assurance that the law and order situation of the city had been brought under control, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said: “Senior officers of Delhi Police are in the field with adequate central para-military force personnel, managing the situation.”

According to sources in the government, the violent anti-CAA protests appear to be orchestrated to coincide with Trump’s India visit in a bid to garner headlines in the international media. Stone-pelting and crowds of protesters started building up on the eve of US President’s arrival and intensified as his special flight was about to touch down in India. This, many point out, cannot be a coincidence.

“This is a matter of investigation,” an officer said when asked what had triggered the crowd build-up and violent protests on Monday. He stated that while things got a little tense in the afternoon, with attempt to set fire to a petrol pump and riders moving around with country-made weapons, “the situation was subsequently brought under control”. Sources said Delhi Police will be registering cases in connection with the violence and arson and the suspected perpetrators arrested.

Discounting the possibility of Delhi Police having failed to act in time to control the violence, a senior government official said the police casualties are testimony to the fact that the police was in the thick of action against the protesters.

Kochi: Case against a youth who followed a woman walking alone through a public road on his bike and asked whether she wants to accompany him cannot be quashed, the high court has held.

Justice R Narayana Pisharadi declined to quash the case registered by Petta police against 23-year-old Abhijeet J K of Anayara Pump House near Kadakampilly in Thiruvananthapuram for insulting modesty of the woman (Section 509, IPC).

The 39-year-old woman was going home around 9.30pm on July 12, 2018 when the accused allegedly followed her. Along with inviting her to accompany him on the motorcycle, he is also accused of making a sexual gesture to her with his hand. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint by the woman.

Declining to quash the police case, the court said that the accused and the victim were total strangers and therefore, the intention was not to give a lift on account of friendship or relationship.

NAINITAL: After the Uttarakhand high court (HC) issued a bailable warrant against him, Sudip Dutta, the under-secretary in the Union ministry of roadways and transport, told HC on Monday that he will hold a meeting between the officials of UP government and Uttarakhand within a week to resolve the issue of payment of dues to the sum of Rs 800 crore by the UP to Uttarakhand.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe had issued a bailable warrant against the secretary after he failed to appear before the court last week. “The officer was present in the court on Monday and he said that after holding the meeting he will file a progress report before the court in a month as well. After hearing him, the court gave him a month’s time,” said MC Pant, the lawyer appearing for petitioner.

The Uttarakhand HC has been hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which has alleged that the government has not paid the salaries of over a thousand of its workers since October.

“Uttar Pradesh owes around Rs 800 crore to Uttarakhand after the bifurcation. However, even after 20 years since the division, the money has not been paid yet. The state of Uttarakhand cites this as one of the reasons for its account books running into negative and that they need that money to pay the dues,” Pant said. The case will now be heard after Dutta files his response.

The court, meanwhile, also refused to vacate the stay it had put on the transfer of roadways to the urban development department after the petitioners said that the rate paid for the transfer of land was way below the market price. “We had said that the land was sold at a much cheaper price than the market rate. While the roadways could have got over Rs 250 crore for it, it was paid only around Rs 50 crore. Therefore, the court had stayed the transfer of land and on Monday it refused to vacate it as well,” Pant said.

HYDERABAD: Despite attempts to clamp down on tuberculosis, the disease is spreading in Hyderabad. The number of TB cases in the city have gone up by nearly 40 per cent — from 10,836 in 2018 to 16,481 in 2019, as per the data available on Nikshay portal, a website launched by the Union government under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP).The fact that 15-20 TB patients (from Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana ) seek admission every day at TB and Chest Hospital in the city, apart from another 20-40 who are diagnosed with TB every day, hint at the gravity of the situation.The upward trend has been attributed to urban congestion with majority of the cases coming from slums and the fact that at least 40 per cent of the patients discontinue medication, leads to further spread of the disease.“Earlier, patients were kept in the hospital for two to three months, now with the domiciliary treatment (at home), patients tend to discontinue medication within 3-4 weeks as soon as the symptoms disappear. The complete course of medication for six months is mandatory as patients remain carriers. As per known statistics, each patient infects another 10-12 people,” said Dr Mahaboob Khan, superintendent, TB and Chest Hospital.While majority of the patients coming from poor socio-economic background tend to discontinue treatment due to lack of awareness, side effects like severe pain, rashes and jaundice push many to discontinue the treatment as well.As there is no system in place to trace the patients after their initial stay at hospitals, the Chest Hospital has been appointed as the nodal centre to put a plan in place.The health authorities are now holding emergency meetings to come up with a plan to trace patients by involving district hospitals, community health centres, public health centres, private hospitals and healthcare workers, said sources.“The idea is to provide treatment to as many as patients as possible and as early as possible. As the deadline to eradicate TB (by 2025) has been set by the Centre, there is an urgent need to contain its spread. It is a challenge to contain TB in slum areas in the peripheral areas of the city,” said a highly placed source in the state health department.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74292793,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-267168,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-sees-40-increase-in-tb-cases-just-in-a-yr/articleshow/74291095.cms

“There has been a crackdown on these bikers at Tanakpur and Banbasa by police. The drive against such illegal bikers will continue in the future,” said Lokeswar Singh, Champawat SP. “There are several complaints of motorbikes carrying passengers illegally in Tanakpur and Banbasa and they are taking Rs 200 to Rs 300 from Banbasa (in India) to Gadda Choki (in Nepal),” Singh said, adding that at Tanakpur, the bikers carry passengers from Tanakpur barrage to Baramdev market.

“Bikers from Nepal usually come to Banbasa for their personal work and on their return they carry people on illegal carriers and take money from them. Some bikers make it their profession and routinely come into India looking for passengers. They sometimes come twice a day,” he further said.

“This practice is totally illegal and the border is very sensitive. A few foreign nationals, who were trying to sneak into India, were caught at Banbasa immigration office recently. So, order has been given to police to seize vehicles, illegally carrying passengers,” the Champawat SP added.

The CEO is also empowered to undertake Devasthanam area development and activities such as boarding, lodging, medical services, hygiene sanitation facilities and general supervision.

Swamy’s decision has cheered the priests of Char Dham who had been agitating against the state government’s decision.

Raghunath Sharma, a resident of Mansarovar area, has been stacking the garbage in his house for many days as the waste pick-up vehicles arrived on Monday after six days. “A month back, things were perfect. Garbage collection vehicles were on time. However, now hoopers are coming on alternate days. On Monday, hoopers arrive after six days of gap. We have to complaint many times on the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) helpline number,” said Raghunath.

Similarly situation has occurred at most places Kalwar Road, a few areas in Vaishali Nagar, in the Walled City. Areas like Gangauri Bazaar, Chandpol Bazaar, Ramganj Mandi and other heritage parts of the city, piles of garbage can be seen on every corners. Kamal Meena, a resident of Gangauri Bazaar, said that trash depots have again started mushrooming in the city.

“For the last two months, sanitation was perfect but now garbage is not picked up from the depots till afternoon. Sanitation workers have stopped cleaning the inside lanes. Complaining to the officials is of no use,” said Kamal.

When the Swachhta Survekshan 2020 was going on till January 30 and all over the city sanitation situation in the entire city was up to the mark. Almost all the municipal employees were involved in it. Sanitation inspectors and in-charge were appointed in all the wards to closely monitor the situation. Every day, officials used to conduct morning inspection of the city. The situation improved in the city and garbage was picked up on time from the garbage depots.

This all has changed as the Swachhta Survekshan ended. A JMC official on condition of anonymity said that slowly officials have returned to their routine work.

“Survekshan is over so officials have returned to their work. Tussle with the BVG Company is going on regarding payment issues. Jaipur is in need of 800 hoopers, while only 530 are currently functioning. So, situation will degrade,” one JMC official said.

Kailash Kher and other Indian artists like Geeta Rabari and Kinjal Dave performed at the cricket stadium in Motera, Ahmedabad. The venue was decked up with huge hoardings and large screen displays of US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi .

As Trump, accompanied by PM Modi , appeared on stage, he was greeted by approximately 1.25 lakh people, many donning white Trump hats. The playlist switched to ‘Macho Man’ song by Village People ringing over the loudspeakers as the crowd burst into a loud, rapturous applause.

The English songs played after Trump’s entry were selected by his team, said sources in Gujarat Cricket Association, which owns the cricket stadium.

Trump is believed to be an ardent fan of British singer Elton John and the songs played at the stadium are from his campaign rally playlist. Some of Elton John’s songs played at Motera included ‘Tiny Dancer’, ‘Rotten Peaches’ and ‘Indian Sunset’.

The bond between the two leaders was on full display. Trump delivered a speech in which he showered praises on Modi, calling him an ""exceptional leader, a great champion of India ... and a man I am proud to call my true friend"".

Addressing the ‘ Namaste Trump ’ event, he recounted decades of friendship between India and the US.

""The US will always be faithful and loyal friend of India. Thank you for the spectacular welcome,"" he said.

Trump said that India is a country that produces about 2,000 movies a year, from the hub of genius and creativity known as Bollywood. He recalled two of his all-time favourite movies - ‘Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (DDLJ) and Sholay.

The event ended with ‘You Can’t Always Get What You Want’ by the Rolling Stones.

Nagpur: The Metro has come as a boon for several students who are opting for the mode of transport to reach their exam centres. It has also ensured that they reach on time without the support of parents who would have otherwise brought them on private transport.

“Taking the bus is the only other public transport option. But all buses heading towards Sitabuldi get filled up very quickly. Even standing is uncomfortable, “ said Piyush Pramanik, a STD XII student.

Another student Saket Rahate said, “If my parents had to drop me, it would have taken at least 35 minutes to commute. With Metro, I can reach my centre in 20 minutes.”

Another student Mukesh Yadav said he “revises comfortably in an air-conditioned train”. “It helps me to stay relaxed even if the weather outside is hot,” he said.

The three are demanding better frequency. “Just for board exams, they should make it 15 minutes. If we miss a train, we have to wait for half an hour for the next,” said Yadav.

MahaMetro spokesperson Akhilesh Halve said, “Commuters are like owners of MahaMetro and we will try our best to comply with the request.”

Houses in BHEL Colony, Rasoolpura

SECUNDERABAD: The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) on Monday took up triennial revision of property tax for 2018-2021 for both commercial and domestic properties in its jurisdiction.

This time, however, commercial property owners are likely to see a hike in property tax rates for properties located on main roads.

According to SCB records, there are 36,000 properties, including commercial and residential, in cantonment areas. Of these, 8,000 to 10,000 are shops and businesses that have been operating for more than three decades.

The tax for each commercial property has been fixed at Rs 4 per sqft and Rs 12 per sqft. “The area of the property, its location, plinth area and number of floors will be assessed,” SCB deputy chief executive officer Vijay Kumar Balan Nair told TOI. “We are calculating the percentage of the property tax in the same way as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC),” he added.

Regarding residential properties, the deputy CEO said that the tax for each property has been fixed between Rs 1.20 and Rs 1.80 per sqft, adding that a separate price will be charged for structures with asbestos sheets as roof. “The revision will be carried out as per the self-assessment proforma that was submitted by the respective property owners,” he said.

The property tax will be levied separately for partly-commercial, commercial and highly-commercial properties. “Property owners can raise objections over the increase in property tax rates, but we will reduce the tax rate only after analysing each property owner’s request,” said a tax department official.

However, the official admitted that the process of calculating the property tax in the cantonment area was higher compared to that of the GHMC.

The last triennial revision was carried out between 2015-18, which fetched the board a revenue of nearly Rs 60 crore. This time around, the fund-starved SCB is hoping to get revenue of Rs 100 crore.

Dehradun: The state government’s recent announcement to provide six-month maternity leave to anganwadi workers has apparently failed to appease them. The members of Anganwadi Karamchari Union of Uttarakhand (AKUU) allege that the Uttarakhand high court (HC) had directed the state to provide six-month maternity leave to them two years ago and the state has simply announced that they will comply with the order.

“So far, we were being given just two months of maternity leave. This was against the HC order. The state government has now only announced that they will now follow the HC guidelines. They aren’t giving us anything new. This is just their way to fool us,” said Rekha Negi, AKUU president.

Negi added that anganwadi workers need a hike in wages and such perks cannot address their issues. “Most of the anganwadi workers are above 45 years of age. Also, many of us are either separated, divorced, or widowed. So, extending maternity leave won’t help us much. We need more money for our work. State government must understand and respect our needs,” Negi told TOI.

Earlier, anganwadi workers had agreed to return to work after Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama met them on behalf of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on February 4. The mayor had assured them that a committee will be set up by March 10 to look into their demands and their honorarium, in all likeliness, will be increased from April, the start of the next financial year.

Notably, the anganwadi workers have been protesting for months to push for a honorarium of Rs 600 per day. “They are not talking about core issues with us. We want to know the actual status of the committee proposed for us. We want to know if our demands would be considered or not during the cabinet meeting in March,” Negi added.

Kollam: Coming down heavily on a former high court judge for his alleged pro-Jamaat-e-Islami stand, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said the ex-judge has become the voice of the Muslim outfit. Without mentioning any name, the chief minister asked why the former judge was getting disturbed when he referred to SDPI and Jamaat-e-Islami.

The chief minister was apparently referring to a former HC judge who is known for making controversial statements. The former judge had criticised the government alleging that large-scale human rights violations were taking place in the state in the name of Maoist hunt. He also had warned the government of having to face severe repercussion if it was not correcting its approach.

Inaugurating the farmers’ rally held as part of the culmination of the 26th state conference of Kerala Karashaka Sangham here on Monday, VIjayan said the former judge’s behaviour was unbecoming of the position he had held.

“The judge’s behaviour was unbecoming of the position he had held. He tried to mislead the public about the government's policy on National Population Register (NPR). He also tried to misquote me by putting words which I never said,” he said.

SECUNDERABAD: Illegal structures in the cantonment areas will also be taken into account during the triennial revision of property tax .

According to the SCB , over 60% of the structures in the cantonment areas are illegal, however, the board does not have accurate data on the number of illegal properties in the cantonment areas as no survey has been conducted so far regarding these structures. Officials said that unauthorised structures are razed when they receive a tip-off or when a court rules in their favour.

“The engineering wing has to decide whether a structure is legal or illegal, but the tax department’s duty is to calculate the property tax for every structure as per the rates fixed by the SCB,” said an SCB official, adding that special teams deployed to assess the properties will go door-to-door and calculate the property tax.

The triennial revision will be completed in a year and notices would be served to owners of unauthorised constructions.

HYDERABAD: Vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad ( JNTUH ) got a reprieve from the Telangana high court on Monday after it stayed the summons of the National Commission for BCs directing the VC to appear before it on Tuesday.

The commission had summoned the vice-chancellor in connection with a complaint filed by a candidate who argued that the university was not following the rule of reservation in relation to Backward Classes (BCs) while recruiting lecturers and other faculty members. Senior IAS officer Jayesh Ranjan is officiating as in-charge vice-chancellor of JNTU.

Agreeing with the arguments of advocate general BS Prasad, Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of the high court directed the registrar of the varsity to appear before the commission since he represents the university.

The judge gave this direction while hearing an urgent petition moved by Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad through its counsel V Ramchander Goud urging the HC to stay the National Commission for BCs summons to the vice-chancellor.

According to the state counsel, all aspirants have to pass post-graduation in the first division. All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) provides relaxation of 5 per cent to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates. States are given the liberty to add Backward Classes reservation to this. JNTU, in its petition, said Telangana had not yet taken any policy decision in this regard so far.

The state counsel also argued that whenever a grievance is placed before it, the national commission should first try to know the version of the university. “It did not do so. Instead, it summoned the vice-chancellor straightaway,” Prasad said.

The advocate general also found fault with the language used in the summons threatening the vice-chancellor that the commission would invoke the powers of a civil court to ensure his presence in case the latter fails to appear before it. “The post of a vice-chancellor is an academically superior post and hence the commission should not summon him,” the advocate general contended.

The judge said it was sufficient if registrar appears before the commission with details of the case. “Vice-chancellor need not go,” he said.

Indore: Corona has infiltrated the footwear industry. Squeeze in Chinese supply of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) — raw material used for making soles — has escalated cost of manufacturing and consumers may soon end up paying more to buy a pair of shoes or slippers from local bazaars.

Cost of PVC has surged by around 40 per cent in a fortnight while fresh supply has almost stopped raising fears among manufacturers sitting on exhausted inventory.

China dominates the footwear sector supplying over 70 per cent PVC and footwear accessories in local market. But shipments have squeezed since outbreak of Coronavirus for which the sector is contemplating a price hike.

Ranjan Bagga, a footwear manufacturer having facility on Sanwer Road said, “We are running out of stock. Traders importing PVC have raised prices by around 40 per cent. This sudden jump in prices has killed profit margins.”

Indore has around a dozen footwear manufacturers that purchase PVC and other accessories from Delhi and Mumbai traders.

Manufacturers said that cost of rexine, another footwear raw material, has jumped by around 5 per cent.

Ranipura Footware Vyapari Association secretary Jaipal Ahuja said, “China is a leading supplier of PVC and we all are dependent on traders of Delhi and Mumbai to source the raw material. But since past fortnight, supplies have been almost negligible.”

According to the association, small manufacturers are the most hit as they work in tiny margins and cater to lower income class while branded chains can afford to take the hit for a short duration.

Manufacturers said that outbreak of Coronavirus has hit supplies of many small items used in the sector such as buckles.

Bagga said, “Indian market do not have competitive and economical alternative for many things and due to this China has a lot of interference. With shortage in supplies of accessories, we are forced to purchase expensive items from local market.”

Manufacturers said supply line is expected to remain empty for a while as China has completely stopped selling raw materials.

MARGAO: With Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) enjoying a brute majority of 27 in the 40-member House, the March 22 zilla panchayat (ZP) elections is being viewed by observers as a referendum on the popularity of the BJP-led government which will face the assembly elections in nearly two years.

Also, as this will be for the first time that the ZP polls are being held under the stewardship of chief minister Pramod Sawant and BJP president Sadanand Tanavade, the leadership acumen of the duo will come under close scrutiny, political observers feel.

BJP therefore is pulling out all stops to ensure that the party has a smooth sailing in the ZP polls.

Salcete, which has nine zilla panchayat constituencies is crucial for BJP, as losing the Catholic-dominated taluka is likely to jeopardise the political fortunes of the neo-saffronite MLAs who had crossed over to BJP from Congress last year.

Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias, Velim MLA and minister for water resources Filipe Neri Rodrigues and Nuvem MLA Wilfred D’Sa are already in a dilemma over whether to field candidates on BJP ticket or extend support to independent candidates.

“For these three MLAs of Salcete , it is surely a trial by fire. For them it’s like damned if you do, damned if you don’t,” a political analyst said.

If they do field candidates on BJP tickets, the party risks losing the seats; and if they back independent candidates instead, the MLAs will be a tight spot in the 2022 assembly elections. Though BJP is divided over the issue, sources said the three Salcete MLAs have been offered a leeway by letting them support ‘independent’ candidates backed by the party.

The reservation of ZP constituencies that has seen much criticism from Congress is being viewed by political analysts as a means to further BJP’s political agenda.

In the March 2015 ZP polls, BJP had posted a victory in only Davorlim constituency of Salcete, the others being won by non-BJP players. Congress had then refrained from contesting the elections on party lines. This time, however, with three of its MLAs representing Catholic-dominated constituencies – following the altered political dynamics post defection of the 10 MLAs from Congress to BJP – BJP is intent on holding its sway over the second-tier panchayat bodies.

Political observers feel that the contentious CAA protest could influence the outcome of the polls in several constituencies in Salcete. “It will very much be an issue if the tempo of the protests is maintained until the polls. But it’s difficult to say which way it could sway the results – it could well be a double-edged sword,” a political observer said.

Congress, left with just five legislators, finds itself in a pitiable situation in South Goa. The party is likely to feel the heat in Quepem and Canacona constituencies where it was largely dependent on the performance of its formidable legislators, Chandrakant Kavalekar and Isidore Fernandes, both of whom are now key figures in the BJP camp.

In Canacona, BJP with three power centres – each headed by Fernandes, former minister Ramesh Tawadkar and former MLA Vijay Pai Khot - faces a further challenge to put up a united front in the zilla panchayat polls.

Losing the Catholicdominated Salcete taluka is likely to jeopardise the political fortunes of the neo-saffronite MLAs who had crossed over to BJP from Congress last year

430,['25/02/2020'],Supreme Court slams Delhi govt on payment of ad hoc school teachers,"This story is from February 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday slammed Delhi government for paying a meagre Rs 4,000 per month to ad hoc teachers in schools when the minimum wage for unskilled labourer was fixed at nearly Rs 15,000 and asked it to come out with a policy to regularise their jobs.

A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Vineet Saran expressed surprise when it was informed that a nursery teacher who had been working on an ad hoc basis for the last 23 years in a government school was paid only Rs 4,000 per month. “How can you pay only Rs 4,000 to a teacher when the minimum wage for labour is around Rs 15-20,000. You use them only for statistics purpose to project that you have so many schools and teachers in your Shiksha Abhiyan,” the bench told additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee who was appearing for Delhi government.

Expressing concern over low salary, the bench told the state government, “You are profiteering out of them by paying such a low salary.”

Last year, the Delhi government had fixed monthly minimum wage for unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled worker at Rs 14,842, Rs 16,341 and Rs 17,991, respectively.

The bench was hearing an appeal filed by the government challenging a Delhi high court order directing the department of education to treat the teacher as a regular employee with effect from 2001 and pay him back wages.

In this case, Milan Rana was appointed against a vacant post of nursery teacher in June 1998 at the Central Academy Senior Secondary School in R K Puram. As per the order of appointment, he was employed on an ad hoc basis till a regular appointment was made, and on a consolidated monthly salary of Rs 1,500. His job was extended in 1999 and 2001 on ad hoc basis. He made various representations to the authorities for regularisation of his job but it was not done and he continued to work on an ad hoc basis.

The court, while hearing the plea of another ad hoc teacher, had in 2010 directed the government to regularise her job effective from 2001. Rana, thereafter, moved the HC seeking regularisation of his service and the court said in September 2018 that he be also regularised from 2001. The NCT government moved the SC against the verdict.

The apex court said there was no merit in the appeal and asked the government to come out with a policy to regularise the jobs of all ad hoc teachers who could be regularised on the basis of their qualification and experience.

431,['25/02/2020'],Reach Dehradun from Delhi in just 2.5 hours via elevated road: CM Trivendra Singh Rawat,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Trivendra Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Monday said that the Union government has given an in-principle approval to the construction of an elevated expressway between Dehradun and Delhi.

Once completed, the ambitious mega project will reduce the total distance between the two cities to 180km, a communique from the CM's office said. At present, the total distance between Dehradun and Delhi is around 250 km. ""With the completion of the elevated road , the distance between Dehradun and Delhi can be covered in as little as 2.5 hours,"" the CM said.

The announcement of the approval of the elevated expressway project was made on Monday after National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) chairman SS Sandhu met the CM at the latter's residence in Dehradun.

While the present route between Delhi and Dehradun passes through Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Roorkee, the new proposed elevated road will run via Baghpat and Saharanpur and touch Dehradun from the Mohand side.

NHAI officials also gave a presentation to chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh about the elevated expressway project, which will be executed in three phases.

The first phase, as per information made available by the chief secretary's office, will be 31.2 km long, connecting Akshardham in Delhi and eastern peripheral expressway, which will include a 18 km stretch of elevated road. The total estimated cost of the first phase has been pegged at Rs 3,250 crore.

The second phase, which is the biggest among all the phases, will connect eastern peripheral expressway and Saharanpur. The 118-km-stretch will be constructed at a cost of Rs 4,830 crore.

The last phase of 20.7 km will connect Ganeshpur to Dehradun. This phase will include construction of a 1.8-km-long tunnel, an additional tunnel of 400 meters near Dehradun's Daat Kali temple and an elevated road of 6.8km.

As part of the mega project, a new tunnel at Mohand has also been proposed, the NHAI chairman informed the Uttarakhand CM.

Terming the project as a major initiative for boosting connectivity to the Himalayan state, CM Rawat said, “In times to come, the elevated road will give a major fillip to tourism in the state and prove to be a big factor in Uttarakhand's economic development.”

Sandhu said that some part of the proposed elevated expressway passes through neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and he has requested the UP government to expedite the forest and wildlife clearances so that the construction work of the expressway can start soon.

Indore: National Testing Agency (NTA) is awaiting approval of ministry of human resource development (MHRD) to conduct Common Entrance Test ( CET ) of Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV).

The varsity is rooting for NTA to conduct the online entrance test. But before getting aboard, the agency has decided to take MHRD approval as entrance test of DAVV is conducted on a smaller scale as compared to entrance tests that the agency regularly conducts.

It has already been over a fortnight that the varsity had written to the agency for conducting the entrance test. However, the agency will revert only after getting approval from the ministry, media spokesperson of DAVV, Dr Chandan Gupta told TOI.

“We are constantly in touch with the agency. We expect a reply in one week,” he added.

The varsity is expecting that NTA will get a heads-up from ministry and as the agency also prepares the question paper. DAVV will only have to provide the course, number of questions and format to conduct the computer-based test.

Recently when the varsity had conducted doctoral entrance test (DET), there were complaints that Ordinance 14 was not followed while framing some questions. Such issues won’t crop up if the agency makes the question paper, said vice chancellor Dr Renu Jain.

“We have decided that we will not go for any private agency for CET,” she said.

In case agency doesn’t get approval, MP Online is the second option for the varsity.

The ‘Innovation-Venturing and Entrepreneurship in India Network’ ( iVEIN ) has as founding members faculty of the Madras and Bombay IITs , and Bangalore , Calcutta and Kozhikode IIMs .

The consortium will leverage strengths of the partnership and work with other stakeholders, such as incubators, investors and the government, to generate and disseminate knowledge, IIM-K authorities said in a statement on Monday.

iVEIN was launched on February 15, 2020 on the sidelines of the ‘Dialogue with Stakeholders’ event organized by SINE (Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) at IIT Bombay

Prof Debashis Chatterjee, director of IIM-K, said forging a close link between academic and R&D institutions, on one hand, and industry, on the other, will not only enable and empower future entrepreneurs but open up previously unexplored avenues for resource-sharing.

Highlighting the features of the initiative, Prof A Thillai Rajan, department of management studies at IIT-M, who is coordinating the initiative, said innovation, venturing and entrepreneurship are expected to play a key role in the economic growth of the country, in addition to strengthening India’s position as an innovation hub.

Chennai: AIADMK joint coordinator and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday asserted that AIADMK cadres were the true heirs of former chief ministers C N Annadurai , M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa .

Speaking at a public rally in his native town of Salem on the occasion of Jayalalithaa’s 72nd birth anniversary, Palaniswami said the cadres were successors of the leaders, who had no direct heirs. “The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is a historic movement. The leaders had delivered a number of welfare schemes for the people. If MGR realized the dreams of Anna, Amma fulfilled the dreams of both. Can anyone refute that?” Palaniswami said. He said his government continued her welfare schemes and enhanced the benefits and cost as well.

Flaunting the recently passed legislation to protect the Cauvery delta region, the CM said, “DMK chief M K Stalin did not expect we would announce the Cauvery delta as protected agricultural zone.”

The AIADMK celebrated Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary with great frenzy across the state by garlanding the statue of the leader, cutting cakes and distributing sweets. Palaniswami launched a drive to plant 72 lakh saplings across the state and distributed welfare measures benefitting girl children to commemorate the Girl Children Safety Day, announced by him last week. In a three-minute video, the CM exhorted cadres to vow to destroy fake propaganda of opponents.

At R K Nagar, deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam said Jayalalithaa had established the rights of the state in inter-state water disputes. “On her advice and along the path laid down by her, the party is moving without getting derailed. She steered the party for 28 years and took the cadre force to 1.5 crore from 18 lakhs when MGR passed away,” the AIADMK coordinator said.

Palaniswami distributed welfare measures to 47,072 beneficiaries in Salem, and Panneerselvam to 18,000 beneficiaries in R K Nagar and others in other districts.

Many shops on the main road towards Bhajanpura and Karawal Nagar were vandalised as the violence spread

NEW DELHI: Till Monday afternoon, an uneasy calm prevailed in northeast Delhi’s Karawal Nagar and nearby localities of Khajuri Khas and Bhajanpura — the epicentre of Sunday’s violence where cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers were set ablaze by rioters.

Things took a turn for the worse after 1pm. It started with pro- and anti-CAA protesters pelting stones at each other at Khajuri Khas Chowk. It all went downhill pretty quickly as the violence spread to the main road in Wazirabad. Eyewitnesses said a mazaar (shrine) on the main road was set ablaze and, a little later, a petrol pump went up in flames, barely 100 metres away.

By 1.30pm, stones were flying like rockets. Police and Rapid Action Force personnel, who were on the spot, were unable to subdue the crowd. TOI was witness to some people even using molotovs, which eventually led to the fire spreading. Police fired several rounds of teargas shells to contain the crowd, but things had spiralled way out of control by then.

Those approaching east Delhi from Signature Bridge and Wazirabad flyover were met with thick, black plumes of smoke. Around 2pm, policemen barricaded the road to prevent any incoming traffic from getting caught in the violence. Several motorists were turned back.

Many shops on the main road towards Bhajanpura and Karawal Nagar were vandalised in the process. Locals alleged that police did little to control the damage. “If the cops had taken timely action, the crowd could have dispersed. People from nearby areas joined in, but the policemen simply waited and watched,” claimed Saurav Jain, whose brother runs a garment store on Wazirabad main road towards Bhajanpura.

Jain said they had no inkling of what was to follow, as till 12:30pm, everything was peaceful. “I even had lunch at a stall on the main road. Around 1pm, some people started throwing stones,” he said. Many shopkeepers downed their shutters and women were quickly transported to safety, Jain said.

Vishal Jha, another local, claimed tension worsened after the mazaar was set ablaze. “All of a sudden, a group emerged on the road and started chanting inflammatory slogans. After the mazaar was burned down, stones, sticks and lathis rained,” Jha said.

TOI saw several people being injured in the melee, with one individual brutally attacked by a group of at least 10 people. Towards Karawal Nagar, another man was severely wounded. People could be seen taking the injured away in e-rickshaws.

Further ahead towards Chand Bagh in New Mustafabad, vehicles and buildings had caught fire. Thick plumes of smoke billowed, but fire trucks were unable to go in for over an hour. Locals said over a hundred people were injured in the clashes.

Delhi University’s Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College in Wazirabad said it had cancelled its cultural festival scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. “The college cultural festival is being postponed till further notice because of circumstances beyond the college’s control (sic),” it stated.

NAINITAL: Two persons died after their speeding car fell into the Bhimtal lake on Monday.

The incident, according to police, occurred around 6:30 am in Bhimtal area of Nainital district when the speeding car hit the parapet, skidded off the road and plunged into the lake.

Speaking to TOI, Arvind Kumar, an eyewitness, said the car was speeding when it lost control and fell into the lake. “We were going there for a walk when we saw the car coming towards us. It, however, went out of control and hit the parapet after which it fell in the lake. We soon informed the police but by the time they could reach the spot, the car had already submerged,” Kumar said.

Police officials, meanwhile, informed that the SDRF as well as the police team recovered the bodies and the car from the lake. However, both the men had already died by then. “We used a crane to recover the bodies and the car from the water. Both the men were found dead,” said Anushka Badola, circle officer, Bhimtal.

The police said that the deceased have been identified as 20-year-old Lalit and 22-year-old Kuldeep Sah. “We have sent their bodies for postmortem and their families have also been informed. The bodies will be handed over to their family members for last rites once the postmortem is complete,” Badola added.

The locals claimed that there was a long delay in the rescue work as neither the police nor the SDRF could reach on time. “The police were informed soon after the incident. But, it took them over an hour to reach the spot. In fact, the rescue work started late when the SDRF came and the crane was then deployed to retrieve the car,” said another local.

442,['25/02/2020'],VACB: 56 docus seized from Sivakumar’s house,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The vigilance and anti-corruption bureau ( VACB ) officials have submitted a report at a vigilance special court here regarding the search conducted in the house of former minister and Congress MLA V S Sivakumar .

It is reliably learned that the vigilance sleuths have seized as many as 56 documents from his house that can throw light into the financial transactions and receipts of luxury tax and fee paid for his daughter.

The vigilance also reported before the court that it seized as many as 72 documents, including 13 documents relating to properties, and six bank passbooks from the residence of Rajendran, who is suspected to be the benami of Sivakumar. The vigilance also said that it received proof that Rajendran had financial dealings abroad as well. The vigilance also seized 25 and 15 documents from the residences of Harikumar and Shyjuharan, respectively. The sleuths also seized two bank locker keys from the residence of Harikumar.

The vigilance team probing the case has also directed the bank where Sivakumar holds account not to open the locker of Sivakumar in the absence of vigilance officials.

However, sources said that the sleuths are yet to find any documents to prove the benami link between Sivakumar and the three others. “Though there is credible information that money has been collected mostly in the names of transfers for doctors and from medical companies, there are no documents to prove them. The agency is waiting to find some person who can vouch that he or she had paid the money for getting a favour.

The vigilance probe could not reveal disproportionate assets to the known source of income of Sivakumar during the period from May 18, 2011 to May 20, 2016 when he was the health and devaswom minister in the former UDF ministry.

Indore: To work things out for Indore Smart City’s largest venture — the ambitious MOG Lines redevelopment project — officials have decided to change terms and conditions of tender worth Rs 800 crore to find an agency to assign the work. “We have issued tenders twice for assigning redevelopment works worth Rs 800 crore for MOG Lines, which is spread in around 40 acre. But no agency showed interest. Therefore, some changes in terms and conditions of the tender have been proposed,” said Indore Smart City Development Limited (ISCDL) CEO Sandeep Soni. He discussed the same with Smart City Mission director Rahul Kapoor during a conference here on Monday.

In the conference, CEOs of 23 Smart City Projects of six states were invited to share their knowledge and discuss challenges in implementation of different development works to share possible solutions. “We are making required changes in tender of MOG Line redevelopment project including construction of residential and commercial complexes and arranging modern amenities to attract agencies to assign work,” Soni said.

During the workshop, senior officials learnt about ‘Indore-model’ for road widening in congested old city areas, waste management and resettlement. The CEOs of different cities will visit CP Shekhar Nagar on Tuesday, which has been converted into a public garden by shifting slum dwellers to highrise apartments near Gandhi Nagar under resettlement policy. Kapoor said that are the challenges are different for each Smart City. These works have been selected on parameters of quality of life, economic potential and sustainability. “The main challenges are population, limited budget and resources and failing to find contractors in implementation of Smart City projects,” he said.

He added that to ensure sustainability of Smart City works, departments using the facilities including civic body, police and traffic should pay service fee to the agency.

“In conference, difficulties and hurdles in implementation of different works in 23 Smart Cities were discussed by their CEOs. They tried to find best possible solutions. The participants also shared their knowledge for better handling of challenges in similar projects in respective cities,” divisional commissioner Akash Tripathi said.

AURANGABAD: Major irrigation projects in Marathwada currently hold twice the amount than the average from the past five years, but many parts in the region, including Latur, Osmanabad and certain areas of Parbhani, are faced with a scarcity this summer.

Summer hasn't officially started but reservoirs, one each from Latur and Osmanabad, have already hit dead storage levels. One project in Parbhani is already showing single-digit storage.

Irrigation projects in Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli and Nanded districts, however, hold sufficient stock. The Jayakwadi irrigation project - a lifeline for Aurangabad and parts of Marathwada - was at 81%.

The Manjra irrigation project in Latur and Sina Kolegaon project from Osmanabad currently show no live storage, whereas Lower Dudhna in the district of Parbhani, district is showing only 6% live storage.

As per official data of the State Water Resources Department (WRD), a total of 11 major irrigation projects in Marathwada were holding a combined 69% live storage as of Monday. The region has 75 medium irrigation projects that were showing 40% live storage; 749 small irrigation projects have been showing 32% live stock. Another 13 barrages built over Godavari currently have 71% live storage, whereas such structures built on the Terna, Manjra and Rena rivers were having 18% live storage.

A senior WRD official said Latur and Osmanabad will have to rely on medium or small irrigation projects besides barrages for their water needs this summer.

“A judicious use of water will have to be norm right from the start of summer. District administrations have already taken note of depleting water reservoirs in both the districts. The available water will be reserved for drinking on a priority basis,” an official from the WRD said.

Latur district disaster management officer Saqueb Osmani said residents were receiving tap water after a gap of 10 days since the monsoon and added that there was no immediate plan to reduce the frequency. “The Manjra dam has around 1.4 TMC of water. Other reservoirs also hold some amount of water that can be put to judicious use this summer,” he said.

Residents of Beed, a district in Marathwada known for water scarcity in the summers, have some relief as the Majalgaon major irrigation project currently has a stock of 79%.

The Jayakwadi dam had received heavy inflow from upstream areas, especially Nashik, during Monsoon 2019. It witnessed heavy periodic discharge, which in turn filled the Majalgaon dam despite its catchment areas receiving weak rainfall.

Marathwada overall had a deficient monsoon last year, with below average levels during the first three months of rain.

The region reported the lowest - 65% average rainfall - in June, followed by 72% in August and 75% in July. In September, Marathwada reported 124.5% rainfall, followed by considerable showers in October.

LUCKNOW: The high court has expressed serious displeasure on railways for stopping plying of trains on the Mailani-Nanpara route passing through Dudhwa National Park. The court clarified that it did not pass any order to stop the operation of trains on the said route. It has sought clarifications from DRM and GM railways in this regard.

A bench of Justice MN Bhandari and Justice VK Srivastava passed the order on two PILs filed by Rajiv Gupta and Terai Development Institute. The petitioners alleged that due to stoppage of the trains, lakhs of passengers from nearby villagers would face serious difficulty.

The court then asked the petitioners to show the order which directed stoppage of the trains but the parties could not produce the order. This irked the bench which summoned clarification from railways.

The court also directed the railways to change the alignment of the track instead of stopping the operation so that passengers would not suffer.

The leopard, which was rescued from Rundal village, at Jaipur zoo

JAIPUR: A leopard attacked three persons in Rundal village of Amber tehsil in Jaipur district on Monday after some people threw a stone at it in an attempt to shoo it away from the village.

The victims have been identified as Deepak, Raju and Mohan. Two of them were rushed to Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital.

Around 9am three women were working in a field when they spotted a leopard hiding in between wheat crops in Rundal village. They rushed back to their homes and within a few minutes people from the entire village reached the spot. Some climbed to the trees and others pulled out sticks to take on the leopard. It was the first time the villagers spotted the animal.

Few days ago, Rundal villagers had come to know that a leopard was seen at Manpura Macheri village, close to Rundal, had killed some goats.

Miscalculating that the leopard will run away if it was stoned, some youths stepped in the agriculture field where the leopard was hiding and started pelting stones. Immediately, the leopard jumped at them and injured at least three youths.

The villages then called police and forest department officials. “Some forest department officials were already in the village as I had called them to rescue a Nilgai from a water tank. But, they did not have cape and the tranquilising dart gun. A team of forest department reached at the spot around 3pm with all their equipment and tranquilised the leopard,” said Dilip Singh Shekhawat, a resident of Rundal village.

Chandwaji SHO Vikrant Sharma said, “The leopard might have come in search of food or he might have gone astray. It injured three persons, who are fine now.”

After the leopard was caged by the forest department officials, villagers celebrated it and chased the vehicle carrying the feline to take videos.

Bareilly: A communication on your Facebook messenger from your friend offering you help in shedding weight and asking for the photos of your specific body parts or full body so that s/he can chalk out a weight-loss plan for you may lead you to unforeseen trouble if you fall in its trap, warns police while cautioning Facebook users, especially women, not to fall prey if they encountered with such messages.

Sambhal police has, in a similar case, booked an unidentified person under IPC section 384 (extortion) and sections 66C (punishment of identity theft) and 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of the Information Technology Act at Chandausi police station. The case has been transferred to the cyber cell and the investigation is on.

The complainant told police, “Many women have fallen prey to the hackers inadvertently. Many victims shared their experience with me on Facebook when I shared a post educating users on how to protect their accounts from being hacked. Hackers attempted to hack my account, too, but I acted sensibly. Since most of the victims are married and don’t want their life to be affected by this, I lodged an FIR.”

Explaining the modus operandi of the blackmailers, additional superintendent of police (ASP) Alok Kumar Jaiswal said, “They hack Facebook accounts of women after they click on a link sent to them. Thereafter, the hackers send messages from the hacked Facebook accounts to the account holders’ women friends, offering help in reducing their body weight and asking pictures of fatty portions of their bodies or full body. The women who share their pictures are later blackmailed by the hackers, who threatened them to post their semi-nude photos.”

The ASP added, “This is a serious issue and our cybercrime team is working to track down the hacker. As the hackers have targeted many women and young girls here, the cybercrime team has sent a message to Facebook users, asking them to block their account — if hacked — so that it can’t be misused.”

Meanwhile, a complaint was lodged at Powayan police station in Shahjahanpur district, where the Facebook account of a lawyer’s wife was hacked and the hacker was sending messages to her friends, demanding money.

Shahjahanpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shivasimpi Channapa said he forwarded the complaint to the cyber cell and an FIR would be registered after verification of the complaint.

NEW DELHI: The arterial Jafrabad-Maujpur Road in northeast Delhi yet again witnessed a clash between pro and anti-CAA protesters on Monday. The opposite camps set up base at two metro stations — Jafrabad for anti-CAA protesters and Maujpur-Babarpur station for supporters of the Act.Tension remained high in Jafrabad after stone-pelting incidents with the violence spreading to inner lanes of the colonies along the main road. Schoolchildren complained of facing trouble in trying to reach their homes. The railings of the road median were broken by the agitators and several walls were also damaged. The bricks from these walls were used by the mob to pelt at policemen trying to control the situation.The situation flared up after sloganeering between the two groups with one shouting “Hum kya chaahe, NRC” and the other replying “Hum kya chaahe, Azadi”. Soon, anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters residing in Kabir Nagar came on the road only to face a rain of bricks and stones.The cemented railings of the central median of 66-Foota Road near Maujpur-Babarpur metro station were broken by the protesters and the debris pelted at police. The security personnel fired tear gas shells, but it didn’t serve the purpose for long as clashes broke out in the interior lanes.In lane number 4 at Vijay Park, both opposing camps started pelting stones at each other. Worried residents waiting for their children to return after the Board exams peeped through their doors to check on them. Gayatri Devi, who lives in one of the lanes, said, “Since morning, they have been throwing stones and hurling abuses. I was scared, so I didn’t send my daughter to school. We are a family of six. How can we live here with people randomly pelting stones at each other?”Around 5pm, Jafrabad-Maujpur Road was found covered with half-broken pieces of glass, bricks and stones. Most of the shops had been vandalised. Windowpanes had been shattered and CCTV cameras damaged. The owner of a furniture house said the entire façade of his shop had been broken. “We were caught in the crossfire when the two groups started pelting stones. We are now being protected by police,” he added.Bricks stacked at a construction site in Vijay Park V-2 Block became ammunition for the mob. Barricades had been put up at Seelampur Chowk even as police and central forces battled to push the stone-pelters away from the arterial road.Till dusk, central forces could be seen tackling protesters near Kadampuri. Stones and bricks were thrown at them from the rooftops across Shahadra drain that divides the region. Broken bottles, Molotov cocktails and pouches filled with liquid were tossed on the mob.A senior police officer leading the charge said that situation was comparatively under control as the two groups had been separated by the nullah. “We are more concerned about people throwing stones from the roofs,” he added. In the evening, ambulances were rushed to the inner lanes of Kadampuri to ferry the injured to hospitals.Loudspeakers could be heard blaring religious songs at Maujpur-Babarpur Metro Station. A youth donning a vermillion tilak said they will not vacate the place until the anti-CAA protesters leave Jafrabad. “How can blocking our roads be called a peaceful protest?” he countered.Several youngsters carrying rods and sticks were seen mixing with the crowd where a langar was being prepared. The agitators objected to being photographed and made appeals to boycott the media.With darkness setting in, plumes of smoke could still be seen rising from the inner lanes with police stationed on the main Maujpur road. As the forces changed shifts, some locals could be seen serving the tired security personnel refreshments. Harish Thakur, a rickshaw driver whose daughters were serving tea, said, “They are protecting our homes. The least we can do is show solidarity.” Late in the night, violence was reported from Noor-e-Ilahi near Ghonda Chowk where protesters set several shops on fire.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74292557,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192084,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cast-in-stone-growing-feeling-of-distrust/articleshow/74291838.cms

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) is working hard to meet its target of collecting Rs 359 crore as property tax, including tax on vacant land, this fiscal. As of Sunday, the civic body has realised Rs 221 crore with hardly a month left before the end of the financial year.

In the 2018-19 fiscal, the GVMC had collected more than Rs 300 crore in taxes. Following that, the civic body proposed a collectible demand of Rs 350 crore this fiscal by bringing new tax assessments into the tax net of the corporation. Now, the GVMC is yet to collect Rs 138 crore, within the next month, to meet the target it had set for itself.

Speaking to TOI, MVD Phani Ram, deputy commissioner ( revenue ) of GVMC said that the civic body could add around 24,000 tax assessments, both through revision of existing assessment and by getting new assessments. “We are making all efforts to achieve 100% of our tax collection target. The civic body has started issuing notices, warrants and property sealing notices to tax defaulters,” Ram added.

He further said the civic body could collect Rs 20 crore water tax out of the collectible demand of nearly Rs 69 crore. “We have launched a special tax drive to reach our target,” Phani Ram informed.

In the last fiscal, the civic body had managed to collect Rs 50 crore more on property tax than the previous fiscal by conducting aggressive tax collection drives. The 2018-19 financial year was the first time that the civic body earned more than Rs 300 crore, making it a record of sorts.

Now, the GVMC wants to continue the momentum and reach its Rs 359crore target. The civic body has been trying to bolster its tax system to ensure the smooth functioning of the civic body for the last few years. Additionally, with the city expanding from all sides, GVMC is faced with the challenge of creating additional infrastructure. The GVMC mostly relies on its own funds for creation of infrastructure.

VISAKHAPATNAM: A four-day workshop on ‘Research Opportunities in Petroleum, Energy and Natural Gas’— ReOPEN 2020 was inaugurated at the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy ( IIPE ) on Monday.

MK Surana, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) was the chief guest.

The focus of the workshop will be on technologies that can improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and bring renewable energy closer to implementation.

Speaking on the occasion, Surana said that India is one of the few countries in the world to adopt BS-VI norms from BS-IV at par with, or even ahead of several developed countries and that India has taken a giant leap in emission norms by directly migrating from BS-IV to BS-VI. “India has made a name for itself in the refining sector. While consumption of India’s crude oil stands at about 225 million tonnes per annum, the refining capacity of the country is much higher at 249 million tonnes.”

Surana further said that under BS-IV norms, the fuel sulphur content will come down to 10ppm, which was 5,000ppm nearly 25 years ago.

Explaining research opportunities in petroleum, energy and natural gas, Surana said that researchers can explore opportunities in converting agricultural waste to fuel. “This can reduce import bills, take care of energy requirements and solve the pollution problem. India is currently importing about 83% of its total energy requirements from. This can be a key research area,” Surana said.

457,['25/02/2020'],Navigation training for Andhra Pradesh fishermen,"This story is from February 25, 2020

VISAKHAPATNAM: Fishermen’s associations in the state have decided to impart navigation and safety training to fishermen across the state following last year’s incident, when eight local fishermen drifted into Bangladesh waters and spent more than three months in the neighbouring country’s jail before being released last month.

“It has happened twice now when fishermen from the state entered the waters of neighbouring countries and got caught. We have therefore decided to hold a workshop on vessel safety and navigation for fishermen of the state,” Arjilli Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation, told TOI. The foundation is a community organisation which works for the interests of fishermen in AP.

The workshop is scheduled to be held on March 28 in Visakhapatnam. Fishermen would be given a basic training on navigation and taught how to use vehicle monitoring system (VMS). “We want all boats involved in deep sea fishing to be fitted with VMS. The cost of installation for such system is around Rs 1 lakh. We have requested the state government to give a 30% subsidy to fishermen to install the system,” added Dasu.

The Union government is already giving a subsidy of 50% to install VMS through the Marine Products Exports Development Authority (MPEDA).

If the state government agrees to the 30% subsidy proposal put forward by the associations, fishermen will have to spend only 20% of the installation cost.

“With fish population reducing along the Andhra coastline, we have to travel to as far as Bengal for a good catch. Such a system would definitely shield us from entering the water of neighbouring countries,” said N Buallaya, a fisherman.

Visakhapatnam: The state government issued an order on Monday authorising the Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation ( AMRC ) to call for quotations for the detailed project report (DPR) for modern tram corridors for a length of 60.2km.

The 60km tram corridor will be developed in the second phase of the 140 km Visakhapatnam light metro rail project. The AMRC has also been authorised to avail transaction advisory from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, RITES Limited and Urban Mass Transit Company Limited.

The state government has already given its nod to AMRC to invite bids for preparation of the DPR of the first phase 80 km project around two weeks ago.

Nagpur: Despite the state government making the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) sole planning authority of the city six months ago, the Nagpur Improvement Trust ( NIT ) is yet to hand over over 1 lakh files to the civic body.

Citing this and other reasons, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has stressed the need for total abolition of NIT and handing over of open spaces, public utility (PU) lands, funds, staff etc to the NMC.

In a letter to the state urban development department (UDD) on February 18, Mundhe, also one of the trustees in NIT, blamed the agency for non-implementation of city’s development plan (DP) in a planned manner.

On August 27, 2019, the BJP government had made the NMC sole planning authority of the city. But the government did not complete the process of abolishing the NIT totally and handing over its properties and liabilities to the NMC.

Immediately after becoming minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, guardian minister Nitin Raut requested CM Uddhav Thackeray to give back planning authority status of seven schemes and Gunthewari areas to the NIT. Accordingly, the UDD had sought opinion of NMC and NIT.

Mundhe said it will not be appropriate to again give back planning authority status to the NIT. “The question of reconsideration of NIT does not arise at all. Also, there is no need to change the government’s decision,” he said.

The municipal commissioner said, “The NMC has started regularizing unauthorized plots and disposing off applications received by it as well as NIT after the government’s decision. There is delay from NMC’s side in disposing off applications as NIT is yet to hand over all files. Also, wrong message about NMC is spreading in public about the NMC only due to NIT. In fact, the NMC has taken up cases in a speedy manner. The NIT is yet to transfer its staff despite repeated reminders from the NMC,” he said.

An NIT official said, “The NMC has not taken away all files. We have time and again asked NMC to take possession of all files at a time. But the NMC is taking whichever file it requires. The decision on NIT’s staff is pending at government level,” he said.

In his letter, Mundhe also state, “The NIT did not hand over all regularized layouts to the NMC despite being mandatory. The NIT regularized 2,084 of total 3,822 unuathorized layouts. As many as 1.11 lakh plots have been regularized whereas demand notes were issued to 1.27 lakh. Only 126 layouts have been handed over to the NMC. Hence, the NMC is unable to execute works. People are upset with NMC over recovering property tax and NIT not executing developmental works,” he said.

Mundhe said, “The city’s DP could not be implemented in a planned manner. The NIT made itself planning authority for maximum reservations while preparing DP. It was supposed to acquire reserved lands, but did nothing leaving people without any facilities. The NIT even deleted various types of reservations and regularized unauthorized layouts and plots on it. It was also made the planning authority under the Gunthewari Act. Land owners were supposed to submit applications within six months. It did not regularize all plots despite passing of 18 years. Also, it did not take possession of all PU lands,” he said.

Mundhe also talked about the NMC’s general body passing a resolution unanimously to maintain NMC as the sole planning authority. “The mayor requested the government to direct NIT to transfer properties, liabilities and staff to the NMC,” he added.

AHMEDABAD: The Trump-Modi bonhomie at Motera had an interesting soundtrack. As the US President, accompanied by PM Modi, appeared on stage at the newly constructed stadium, ‘ Macho Man’ by the American disco group Village People rang out on the loudspeakers as the crowd burst into loud applause.

Maria Abi-Habib, a reporter for The New York Times, tweeted: “I never thought I’d be listening to ‘Macho Macho man’ in Gujarat, let alone with a crowd of 120,000 people anywhere in this world.

The gala ended with the strains of The Rolling Stones’ number, ‘Ýou Can’t Always Get What You Want’, a song that often plays at his campaign rallies in the US. The band has repeatedly asked Trump to stop playing their music, but clearly haven’t had much success.

Another of Trump’s rally favourites is Elton John though the British singer-songwriter politely declined to play at his inauguration. At Motera, the Elton songs that played were Rotten Peaches and Tiny Dancer and Indian Sunset.

The English songs played after Trump’s entry were selected by his team, said sources in Gujarat Cricket Association, which owns the cricket stadium.

The audience was also regaled with Gujarati folksongs like ‘Kasumbi no rang' and Bollywood medleys including ‘It happens only in India’ and ‘Desh mera rangrez hai babu’. Kailash Kher and other Indian artists performed. Composer AR Rahman shared his new track Ahimsa on Twitter. “Here’s a track to welcome President Donald Trump ,” he tweeted.

462,['25/02/2020'],Middlemen out: Farmers in mini-vans are reaching out to consumers directly,"This story is from February 25, 2020

A farmer-turned-fruit vendor with his mini-van in Visakhapatnam on Monday

Visakhapatnam: Mini-vans have played a major role in transforming farmers into fruit vendors. Many small and medium farmers, instead of selling their orchard produce to wholesalers, are now directly selling their produce to customers within the city.

This phenomena is not a new one. About three decades ago, women carrying vegetable baskets on their heads would roam the streets of residential areas in the city, selling their vegetable produce directly to households. However, there was a sharp decline in such direct selling, mainly due to rapid urbanisation, which had engulfed much of the agriculture and horticulture area around the city. Farmers used to produce vegetables in fields, on which we have the massive townships of Madhurawada, Yendada and Rushikonda.

Today thanks to the introduction of mini-vans and large autos, farmers are back with a bang. Many of them come from as far as Yelamanchili-Narsipatnam belt, which are 70 to 80 kms away. “Selling in the city has a major advantage, the difference is the price factor. If I sell my vegetables in the local shandies or to wholesalers, the rewards are little. Take for example, drumsticks, in the city, depending on the size and quality of the sticks, I can make up to Rs 4 per stick. However, in rural shandies and the wholesale market, I cannot make more than one and half rupees, which is not more than Rs 15 per bundle often as against Rs 40,” observed, Y V Chalapathi, a farmer from Chodavaram.

Chalapathi is just one of the many farmers selling their produce directly, instead of going through the cumbersome process of selling them in rythu bazaars or wholesale markets.

P Latcha Reddy a wholesale merchant from Tuni mango market stated, “Small farmers who have mixed mango orchards, prefer to sell directly in the city. High-end mango varieties such as Banganapalli and Suvarnarekha sell for Rs 100 a kilo (roughly four to five units), the small farmers, whose orchards have mixed plantations sell mangoes for Rs 70 a kilo. They usually park at the main residential area junctions in the city and from 0700 am to 1100 am, they sell their produce, which in case of a mini-van or auto does not exceed a tonne.”

According to estimates made by sources in the rythu bazaars, the volumes of some vegetables and most fruits sold this way, equals the volumes sold through the rythu bazaars. In case of mangoes alone, the estimate is 500 tonnes, which would roughly translate into 30 large truck loads.”

AHMEDABAD: US President Donald Trump ’s bonhomie with Gujarati-origin Indian PM Narendra Modi was unmissable on Monday. Trump in his speech said that the four million strong Indian diaspora has contributed immensely to the development of US. He also acknowledged the strong Gujarati diaspora by mentioning that one in four NRIs has roots in Gujarat.

NRGs in particular and NRIs at large are known to have affinity towards Democrats. But Trump’s stance on India and support for the country on global arena might swing votes in his favour, believe some diaspora members.

However, the NRGs who were part of the event on Monday, saw it as a reciprocation of love which was on display during Howdy Modi event last year. “I am sure the Namaste Trump event will leave a deep impression on the US President who termed himself as a friend of India and Indians,” said Haribhai Patel, a resident of Chicago and vice-president of Republican Hindu Coalition. Patel said that 50-odd NRGs had come on their own to the event as there was no official contingent of NRIs with Trump on his two-day India visit.

Madhu Patel, another NRG who was at the event, said that he did not see it as a political event. “It was homecoming of a friend — it’s personal relationship between Indian PM and US President which was on show. I don’t know how it would pan out politically for the duo, but it would build a stronger image for India globally and would also help NRIs in the US,” said Patel, adding that with Trump’s stance on India, many NRGs are supporting the Republicans in the US.

AHMEDABAD: When 1.2 lakh people said 'namaste', all at the same time, the sound travelled across the world's largest cricket arena here - the Motera stadium - from the galleries to the ground, and the VVIP zone on the stage.

On Monday, when US President Donald Trump began his speech with 'namaste,' the entire stadium returned the greeting together.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's call, 'Long Live Indian-American Friendship', received a similar response. And, the sheer size of the stadium inspired awe.

The stadium was packed much before Modi and Trump arrived at noon as people waited for hours despite the scorching heat.

They received a spectacular ovation as they strode onto the stage. Groups from several districts of Gujarat were spread across the stadium. The loudest roar of approval came when Modi and Trump addressed each other as 'friends'. The US President's allusion to Bollywood blockbusters, his 'chaiwala' reference about Modi, and his appreciation of the contribution of NRIs in the US drew spirited cheers from the crowd.

For the police, it was a big task. People were frisked by two policemen simultaneously. ""This allowed us to frisk each person in just five seconds. Still, it took about three-and-a-half hours for the stadium to fill up,"" said a city police official.

Those at the stadium were provided specially-designed white T-shirts and caps to ensure uniformity. A few groups entered the stadium with saffron jackets with 'Namaste Trump' logo them. Many put on Modi and Trump masks.

A participant from Khokhra in Ahmedabad, who did not wish to be named, said that the corporators took him and others in the neighourhood to the venue in buses. ""We were provided breakfast before we started for Motera at 8.30am. At the stadium, we were served boondi-ganthiya and buttermilk,"" said the participant . Corporators were asked to click photographs of groups of people they had brought to the ground.

The stadium began to fill up from 7.30am and a host of performers kept the people entertained before Trump and Modi arrived. As Kailash Kher , Veena Saxena , Kinjal Dave, Kirtidan Gadhvi and Sairam Dave performed, people broke into a dance.

""Our troupe played the dhol and danced to its beats with gunghroos tied to our feet without a break,"" said Bhimji Chaudhary, one of the troupe members. Chaudhary was happy they could showcase Rajasthani culture at the roadshow of US President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi .

All along the 22-km stretch from the airport to Motera stadium, tableaux, folk dancers and musicians from 28 states of India lined the roadsides, rolling out the country's cultural tapestry. At least 50 stages were set up with some bearing unique names like Lilliput and Michael Jackson.

Young, old and children alike thronged the roads to watch Trump. Home-maker Meena Bharwad was there with her eight-month-old son . There was unprecedented curiosity over Trump's bulletproof limousine 'The Beast' as large crowds bent over the railings to click photographs of the vehicle. Unlike Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and wife Akie Abe, who participated in an 8-km roadshow from airport to Gandhi Ashram in an open vehicle, the fact that Trump was in a closed vehicle was a bit of a dampener .

""We wanted to catch a glimpse of Trump and Modi together. But we understand the security concerns,"" said Madhav Patel, a professional. Subrato Paul and Riddhan Sarkar, who travelled from Kolkata hoping to sell Team India t-shirts and tricolours failed to make brisk sale but were happy to be there at the world's largest cricket stadium.

""It is faith in free society, confidence in your own people, your trust in your own citizens and respect for dignity of every person that makes the US and India such a natural, beautiful and enduring friendship,"" Trump said in his speech at Motera .

In fulsome praise, Trump said, ""The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress and a miracle of democracy, extraordinary diversity and above all a strong and noble people. India gives hope to all of humanity. It has become an economic giant, largest democracy and one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world.""

Referring to PM Modi's humble beginnings, he cited him as living proof of what Indians could achieve through hard work. Trump said Modi was a leader who worked for India night and day and who he was proud to call his ""true friend"".

""We will always remember this remarkable hospitality. From this day on, India will hold a special place in our hearts,"" Trump said. Referring to the PM, he said, ""Everybody loves him but I will tell you this, he is very tough"" and chuckled at his observation, adding Modi won a landslide in the largest democratic election to be held anywhere in the world.

The speech came against the backdrop of criticism of India over alleged rise of intolerance and erosion of inter-faith amity. But Trump showed no sign that the charges had resonated with him yet as he launched into fulsome praise for ""one great Indian nation"" despite diversity of faiths and beliefs. ""Your unity is an inspiration to the world,"" he said.

""All Indians - Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Jews, rich and poor - must take pride in glories of the past, and a bright future,"" the American president said. Emphasising India's democratic traditions, he said there was a difference between a nation that rose by coercion and one that rose by setting people free, and added that India would soon be home to the biggest middle class anywhere.

Trump struck an emotional connect when he expressed warm approval for people of Indian origin in the US who he said were contributing to American life in every field. ""They are titans of business, the biggest, the best, pioneers of science, masters of arts,"" he said.

The president took on opposition at home and spelt out why he thought there was great potential in India-US ties, and said US unemployment was low and the economy was booming. ""A booming America is a great thing for the world,"" he said, adding that he had shown how reduced taxes and regulatory burdens had worked and that Modi was also carrying out reforms at a record pace.

MUMBAI: Shahapur police arrested a 21-year-old man for posing as an HSC student and appearing for his English exam at a centre in Khardi, Thane district. The student was arrested as well. This case was among the five malpractices reported on Monday in the Maharashtra State Board's Mumbai division, which consists of Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar.

Teacher Hirve Butha, supervisor at Primary and Secondary High School, Khardi found an examinee's behaviour suspicious and checked his hall ticket during the first HSC exam on February 18. The photo on the hall ticket was not the same as the one in their records, and Butha informed Dattatray Mahajan, the chief exam conductor at the centre.

On questioning the accused, Mahajan found that he was a dummy student identified as Nitesh Dhapte, who was giving the exam on behalf of student Rahul Ghavat (19). Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""After getting confirmation that he was a dummy, we informed the local Shahapur police to file an FIR."" Police sources said Ghavat had failed twice in two subjects, and had hired Dhapte to give all his exams on his behalf.

School authorities informed the board about the incident only on Monday. ""We will seek a clarification from the centre about the case,"" said Sandeep Sangave, Mumbai division secretary.

Another incident reported on Monday was at Nutan Vidyalaya in Goregaon, where a student tore his own answersheet. According to the state board's daily report of malpractices, a student was using a mobile phone and a Bluetooth device to copy at a centre in Bhiwandi. ""The centres will send a detailed report soon. The student is expected to only write his paper. If he tears the answersheet, he destroyed the board's property and hence it is considered to be a malpractice,"" said Sangave.

Other malpractices included students copying from each other at Borivli and Bandra centres. In such cases, students are allowed to appear for the rest of the papers and the board decides on action to be taken after students explain themselves before a committee. Students may be barred from appearing for the examination for one to five attempts.

Across the division, 94,973 students took the physics exam on Monday. Another 1.42 lakh students appeared for the secretarial practice paper and 29,231 students took the political science paper. No malpractices were reported in these papers. In the state, 119 cases of malpractices were recorded on Monday. The highest number of cases-30, was in Aurangabad, during the political science paper.

NEW DELHI: Congress is set to give a complete miss to President Kovind’s banquet for US President Donald Trump , with all three party principals deciding to skip the dinner at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday — alleging that the government had kept party chief Sonia Gandhi out of Trump’s visit.

Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and former PM Manmohan Singh decided to follow the lead of Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who said on Saturday that he would not attend the dinner.

Chowdhury said he was offended that the Congress chief had been completely ignored for the US president’s visit and no meeting had been arranged with the opposition leader. He claimed it was contrary to the practice followed by past governments when interactions were arranged with principal opposition functionaries. Azad is learnt to have conveyed his “thank you” to President’s House but expressed inability to attend. He regretted that Sonia, who is chairperson of the Congress parliamentary party, was not invited. Azad and Singh are learnt to have accepted the invite before turning it down on Monday. It is believed that Chowdhury’s public announcement forced the hands of his colleagues. The decision of complete boycott came after nearly 36 hours of silence.

These agencies said last week he must not be granted bail as he has connections to influential people. Opposing any relief, the agencies have contended he was extradited to India with great difficulty and there was every likelihood he would flee from justice if allowed to come out on bail as he had no roots in India.

Michel, who was arrested in 2018 and has been in judicial custody since January 5, 2019, had been denied bail in both the CBI and ED cases by the trial court. He has now approached the HC against the lower court’s decision.

They added that he had successfully evaded the entire investigation and trial in Italy , which despite being a European Union member could not successfully bring him to face the judicial process. The agencies argued that Michel cannot claim parity with other co-accused.

Urging the central government to issue the notification at the earliest, Patil said, “The state government must start the groundwork for the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project. The state government must exert pressure on the Centre to ensure that no time is lost in the issuance of the notification and work can start at the earliest.”

Patil called on Yediyurappa to lead an all-party delegation from the state to New Delhi to meet the Union minister for water resources.

Meanwhile, the former minister expressed displeasure over the number of files pending for clearance across departments. He said that more than one lakh government files had not been cleared. “This proves that the government is not active, and attests to corruption having spread to all levels of the administration. The common people are struggling to get justice,” Patil alleged.

Pointing out that Karnataka had a reputation for transparency and accountability, Patil said, “Various departments have been feted for transparency. In fact, people could track the movement of files on their fingertips. But they have not been able to do this for the past few months.”

Tourism minister’s suggestion draws flak

The senior Congress member did not pull any punches in criticising tourism minister CT Ravi, who mooted giving permission to operate casinos in Karnataka as a means of generating revenue and employment. “The BJP leaders are very fond of talking about culture in public. But in their implementation of projects they think very differently. Ravi’s statements highlight the gap between their real objectives and what they preach in public,” Patil added.

Making it clear that the Congress was opposed to starting casinos in the state, the former minister said, “Is the minister trying to turn Karnataka into Thailand? The government must drop this idea right here, and the CM must announce that no casino will be opened in the state. The Congress will fight against the implementation of such a proposal.”

MLC Srinivas Mane and AM Hindasgeri were among those in Patil’s company at the media interaction.

471,['25/02/2020'],"60 years on, this co-op society keeps party politics at bay","This story is from February 25, 2020

Haveri: Notwithstanding their size, squabbles and disagreements between numerous factions within cooperative societies often turn out to be their collective Achilles’s Heel. Often, most members are caught up in the pursuit of their personal goals or furthering of their party agenda to be bothered by the needs of the public. Administrative positions in these societies are the subject of hotly contested elections. The purpose of such societies, which is to act as a conduit between the grassroots and the higher echelons of the government, is often defeated as a result.

However, the agriculture produce marketing cooperative society of Hirekerur taluk appears to have been, and continues to remain, immune to the problems that political squabbles inevitably bring in their tow. Since its inception 60 years ago, the functioning of the society has not been interrupted by elections and all the organisational problems that they entail. All members of the society adhere to a set of principles, and all of them have reaped the dividends of efficient administration as a result.

The cooperative society has six branches and a head office, and has been supplying fertilisers and seeds to farmers across Hirekerur taluk since it was founded in 1959. The four fuel stations that the society owns offer petrol and diesel to farmers on credit. In addition to these services, the society owns a rice mill in Chikkerur and a ginning factory in Hirekerur. In all, the society has as many as 60 people in its employ.

President of the society SS Patil said that the organisation had been founded on June 3, 1959 by BG Banakar with just 117 members. The present strength of the society – it currently boasts 4,800 members on its rolls – attests to its growth over the years, he said. “We have an investment budget of Rs 15 crore, and last year we purchased a total of 1,000 tonnes of cotton from our farmers. This year, that figure rose to 1,060 tonnes. Our society has consistently been working for the welfare of the farmers. As a result, there is no scope for party politics here,” Patil said.

Former MLA UB Banakar and chairman of the Karnataka State Agriculture Produce Processing and Exporting Corporation Ltd UB Banakar was lavish in his praise of the society’s accomplishments and its insulation from politics. “The record of the society in Hirekerur is noteworthy particularly because of the pathetic condition of other such bodies. With the support of its members, it has managed to work for the welfare of farmers, the economic condition of whom has improved as a result,” said the former MLA.

Golden jubilee celebrations today

The Hirekerur taluk agriculture produce marketing cooperative society will celebrate its golden jubilee on Tuesday, along with the Taluk Vidyavardaka Souharda Cooperative Society. Panditaradya Shivacharya Swamiji, Karnataka minister Basavaraj Bommai, agriculture minister BC Patil are expected to participate in the event. The Dr Abdul Kalam Science Hall, built at a cost of Rs 5 crore, will be inaugurated on the occasion.

A 53-year-old man in Bastar has been lynched by a mob in his village — some of them neighbours — on the rumour that he was casting “murderous black magic spells”.

Victim Mancheet Kashyap of Charagaon village was beaten until he died on Saturday night. His terrified family, who spent all night cradling his body, could reach out to police only on Sunday after which 10 suspects have been arrested for murder and rioting under IPC and sections 4 and 5 of Chhattisgarh Witchcraft Atrocities (Prevention) Act, 2005.

The lynching was allegedly triggered by a ‘witchdoctor’, with whom villagers discussed their troubles. Cops found that a family in the village was distraught after two deaths for unknown reasons.

NHAI may be held responsible for accidents due to bad roads and signage, the Madras high court has said

CHENNAI: If any accident happens due to bad condition of roads or signages, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) may be held responsible and made to pay compensation, Madras high court has warned.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha, making the remarks during PIL proceedings taken up on Monday, said: ""It is made clear that at some point of time this court also may take the call that if any accident takes place on account of the bad condition of the road, signage, NHAI may also be held liable and responsible for compensating the victims of the road accident.

The judges issued the caution as an advocate-commissioner appointed by the court to monitor the progress made by NHAI on the Maduravoyal- Walajahpet stretch of NH4, submitted in his report that it appeared that the patch works done recently and lighting on the entire stretch were extremely poor and that they were a matter of 'grave concern'.

The report also pointed out the absence of proper traffic signals and restrooms along the stretch and the poor frequency of highway patrols. Noting down the submissions, the bench made it clear that the stretch of road should be relaid be strictly in conformity with the Indian Road Standard Congress.

The judges also suggested that it is high time a single window agency is created by the state government to enable the NHAI to get clearances from various stakeholders expeditiously. They also suo motu impleaded the chief secretary to government of Tamil Nadu as a party to the case.

Earlier, the NHAI authorities submitted that high mast lighting will be provided at toll plaza locations and at 17 major junctions along the Sriperumbudur-Walajahpet stretch.

Already, the assistant solicitor-general had informed the court that the six-laning of the 34km stretch between Sriperumbudur and Karaipettai section was to be completed by May 2019. However, the contractor has achieved a progress of 2.4 % against the target of 15.47 % as of January 31, 2020. It was further submitted that the appointed date for six laning of Karaipettai to Wallajapet section of NH4 was fixed as February 11 last year and the contractor achieved a physical progress of 5.80% against the target of 31.95% as on January 31, 2020.

To a query by the bench as to why there is delayed by the contractors, the ASG submitted that NHAI has to approach several agencies in the state government to get clearances and sought a single window agency so that NHAI projects in the state could be completed on time.

Riskaverse investors turned to gold, which hit a lifetime high of Rs 44, 472 per 10 gram in Delhi and Rs 43,250 in Mumbai.The 30-share index fell 807 points, or nearly 2%, to close at 40,363. The fall in equities was led by stocks of automobiles, pharmaceuticals and consumer durables over fears of disruption of supplies from China, which accounts for 14% of India’s imports.In the foreign currency markets, the rupee fell 34 paise to close at a more than threemonth low of 72 against the dollar, as there was flight to safety.In Europe, early trades saw Britain’s FTSE 100 fall nearly 3.5%, while the CAC 40 in Paris as well as Germany’s DAX lost almost 4%.

Titans' tete-a-tete: RIL CMD Mukesh Ambani (left) with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in Mumbai on Monday.

MUMBAI: With every sector from hospitals to hotels embedding technology in their systems more than ever before, building tech capabilities will be the defining factor of the coming decade, said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Speaking at a Microsoft organised ‘Future Decoded’ summit in Mumbai on Monday, Nadella urged organisations to build their own tech intensity.

Some 150 India Inc leaders, including Kotak Mahindra Bank VC & MD Uday Kotak , Tata Steel CEO T V Narendran, Hindustan Unilever CMD Sanjiv Mehta, Pidilite Industries MD Bharat Puri, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar and McCann Worldgroup India CEO Prasoon Joshi, attended the event.

“Our mission is to empower organisations to achieve more — on how we can help you build your own independence,” Nadella said, while adding that 72% of job openings for software engineers come from outside the tech sector. Microsoft hires the second-largest number of engineers from India.

In a fireside chat with Nadella, Reliance Industries CMD Mukesh Ambani said, “The opportunity that we have for India really is the opportunity to become the premier digital society in the world.”

“I have no doubt that we will become among the top three economies in the world. We can argue about whether it will happen in five years or 10 years, but it’s going to happen. When that happens, our opportunity will be to see if we can be the most tech-enabled society,” said Ambani, who has entered into a long-term alliance with Microsoft to accelerate digital transformation.

Nadella’s visit coincides with Donald Trump’s maiden India visit as US President. “As we are speaking, President Trump has arrived in Ahmedabad, and the India that he will see in 2020 is very different from what President (Jimmy) Carter or (Bill) Clinton or even (Barack) Obama saw. I can easily say that the mobile networks in India now are better or on a par with anybody else in the world. And that’s the big change,” said Ambani.

Commenting on Nadella’s career trajectory, Ambani said, “You joined Microsoft in 1992, when India was a $300-billion economy. Today, India is $3-trillion.”

The action has shocked industries

MUMBAI/KALYAN: Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on Monday issued notices to 45 chemical companies in Dombivli MIDC for violating pollution norms, and told each to pay a fine of Rs 25 lakh.

The action came few days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited Dombivli MIDC, after the colour of a river had changed due to pollution. Thackeray had warned companies polluting rivers to take safety measures or else they would be shut. Thackeray had also told officials to come up with a plan to deal with pollution in Dombivli MIDC.

The action has shocked industries in Dombivli MIDC, and they have decided to move court against MPCB's order. A KAMA (Kalyan-Dombivli, Ambernath Manufacturing Association) member said, ""The order is shocking, as MPCB, instead of taking action against those polluting rivers, is harassing everyone. We will move court against the order as we are not ready to pay the fine.""

MPCB and MIDC officials on Monday met over the Dombivli fire and Waldhuni river pollution issues, and submitted an action plan to the state government.

In the river case, MPCB served closure notices to seven companies releasing effluents without treatment. A senior MPCB official said the companies that were found to have released effluents in Waldhuni have been told to stop the discharge till further orders, which implies that they have been told to shut operations. ""We have told them to stop discharge till MPCB certifies its quality, and the process of effluent treatment,"" he said, pointing out that the penalty had been imposed on each of them for damaging the environment.

Meanwhile, sources said the main MIDC pipeline that carries effluents of these factories to the treatment plant, was also damaged, which was one of the reasons for the pollution. The river had turned orange and later dark blue.

MPCB officers said a notice had been issued to the unit in Dombivili that went up in flames recently, to not resume operations till it is certified safe.

NEW DELHI: The Tata Group has told the government that its share in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues is Rs 2,197 crore only, which it has already paid, and not the Rs 13,823 crore that has been demanded by the telecom department (DoT).Sources said that top Tata executives have made their position “very clear”, and have categorically stated that they “do not have to pay anything more” towards past AGR dues, based on their self-assessed calculations.The matter appears to be escalating, with the telecom department now considering to issue a notice to the Tata Group, that ran operations under Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices ( Maharashtra ) brands, justifying its side of the calculations. “Our assessment is complete and will be seeking an explanation from the Tata companies over the next one-two days,” an official source told TOI.While the ministry appears to be clear on its demand, the source said, Tata executives had said that their calculations have been confirmed after a thorough internal assessment, which was thereafter verified by an independent consultant.When contacted, a company spokesperson said, “Pursuant to the October 24, 2019 judgment of the Supreme Court and in accordance with further communications from the telecom department, Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) have made a payment of Rs 2,197 crore to the DoT towards licence fees and spectrum usage charges. The companies have also submitted to the telecom department the details of calculations in support of the payment.”Sources also said that if the trouble escalates, it could also have an “indirect impact” on Airtel, which has acquired Tata’s telecom business. “We will demand the amount from the new owner, and that’s it. This is what the rules state,” another source said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74293974,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73731,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-agr-dues-2197cr-not-13823cr/articleshow/74292553.cms

It has 2,900 undergraduate medical seats.

Jalpaiguri: Tired of waiting for test reports from Belgachhia forensic science lab , the forest department has decided to come up with a similar laboratory in the Dooars.

The decision was taken in the wake of the rhino deaths at Jaldapara.

The forest minister held a meeting with senior forest officials at Kolkata on Monday and there it was decided that to put an end to their dependence on the Belgachhia lab a new forensic science lab would be set in the Dooars. Madarihat in Alipurduar has been primarily identified as the site.

Amit Shah

KOLKATA: BJP on Monday received “verbal permission” for Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally at the Shahid Minar ground on March 1. The rally, termed “CAA Abhinandan Sabha”, will be the first public meeting of central BJP leaders in Bengal after the CAA bill was passed in Parliament.

“We have got verbal permission from police. There is no reason why they should not give the permission,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. Kolkata police sources on Monday indicated that the rally will not hamper the examination process as the area near Shahid Minar ground does not have many residential units. Bengal BJP leaders will hold a review meeting for the preparations on Thursday.

“Shahid Minar ground is smaller in size and we are expecting a turnout between 25,000 and 40,000 people. We have, however, asked district leaders to restrict the number of supporters,” said a Bengal BJP leader.

While Shah is likely to spend a night in Kolkata, his office is yet to finalise the itinerary. BJP national president J P Nadda and national general secretary B L Santhosh may be present at the rally. It will be Nadda’s first visit to Kolkata after he was elected BJP president.

Shah, who is visiting Kolkata little more than a month before the

municipal poll in the state, is likely to touch upon local civic

issues during his visit. While party leaders are micro managing the

campaign for the poll, Shah and Nadda are likely to prepare a broader

roadmap for the municipal polls. BJP workers have also been demanding

projection of Mayoral candidate in a few key municipal corporations

like Kolkata and Howrah. Shah and Nadda are likely to take a decision

on that. “Normally, we do not project face in the election and we have

not taken any decision on that so far,” Ghosh said.

488,['25/02/2020'],West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar seeks municipal poll preparedness report from SEC,"This story is from February 25, 2020

Jagdeep Dhankhar

KOLKATA: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has sought an update from the state election commissioner over the upcoming polls in around 110 municipalities across the state, including Kolkata Municipal Corporation . The governor wants the report on February 27 from SEC Sourav Das on the commission’s preparedness in regard to holding free and fair polls.

This is the first time a governor has taken a “proactive role” even before the election notification. The governor, who appoints the state election commissioner, has mentioned why he did so in a tweet on Monday. “The commission is a constitutional body for superintendence, direction and control of municipal elections under Article 243K of the Constitution of India,” Dhankhar tweeted.

The purpose, according to a Raj Bhavan official, is to ensure free and fair civic polls, putting behind the 2018 panchayat polls that had sparked a controversy on the plea that candidates didn’t get a level-playing field. The matter went up to Supreme Court after opposition parties moved HC crying lack of democracy. Raj Bhavan sources said that Dhankhar doesn’t want a repeat of the 2018 experience.

Sources hinted that the government wants to hold the civic polls in mid-April and complete the process by mid-May. BJP leaders, on the other hand, called on the SEC urging the body to “advise” the state government that parties should get at least some time for campaign. However, a section within the ruling party wants the civic polls to be over by May 23 before the Ramadan month. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had hinted that polls for most municipalities should be held in a day.

The opposition had moved Raj Bhavan against the government’s appointing administrators in a host of municipalities without holding polls in due time. The tenure of Kolkata Municipal Corporation is ending in May 2020.

“Board examinations are slated up to March 30. We can’t use microphones during this time. Holding civic polls in mid-April will leave less than 10 days’ time for campaign,” BJP leader Mukul Roy said.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had hinted that polls for most municipalities should be held in a day. The state government doesn’t want a prolonged phase-wise election schedule because that will throw a spanner on the ongoing development projects. But the decision has to come from the SEC, and not the government.

People in Bengal are aware of the legal battle between state election commissioner Meera Pande and the state government during the panchayat polls over deployment of forces and also determining the phases of polls.
