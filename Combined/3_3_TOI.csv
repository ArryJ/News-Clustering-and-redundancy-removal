While zoos across the country do as much as they can for the upkeep of the animals in there, a lot of our celebrities are known to pitch in with financially as well. Cricketing aces MS Dhoni and Zaheer Khan have adopted tigers at the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, Mysuru, and actors Sivakarthikeyan, Vijay Sethupati, Karthi Sivakumar have adopted white tigers at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai. Closer home, actor Darshan has adopted an elephant and a tiger at the Bannerghatta Zoological Park, while cricketer Anil Kumble had adopted a giraffe and Asiatic lion at the Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens.Interestingly, the upkeep of tigers and elephants cost the highest in most zoos, while birds and reptiles often cost the least. Regardless of the size of donation, every little donation counts, share zoo officials who urge each citizen to donate whatever possible.This World Wildlife Day, we take a look at the sort of animals up for adoption at some of the bigger zoos across the country, while zoo officials tell us how much it would take for you to adopt a wild animal, just like the celebs do.This park located in Bengaluru is home to a range of animals. The adoption rates at the park starts from Rs. 2,000 per year — this category mostly includes different types of birds and reptiles — and the highest cost is reportedly Rs. 1,75,000 per year for the Asiatic Elephant and the African Elephant. You can also adopt animals like Hippopotamus, Common Ostrich, Hybrid Lion, Indian Leopard, Sloth Bear, etc. Last year, over 15 cobras were adopted by citizens, while quite a few paid for the care of tigers and love birds too.One of Mysuru’s biggest tourist attractions, this zoological park is home to a range of species. The starting rates at this zoo is Rs.1,000 for different types of birds and reptiles. Here too, the highest cost is Rs.1,75,0000 for the Asiatic Elephant and the African Elephant. You can also choose to adopt other creatures like Southern white rhinoceros, flamingo, cheetah, etc.The animals put up for adoption at the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, range from macaws to fishing cats, peacocks, jaguars, giraffes, antelope, etc. The Bengal Tiger and the Asian Elephant cost the most, at approximately Rs.2,00,000. Birds like emu, spotted dove, or reptiles like the python, cost about Rs.25,000. Chimpanzees, rhinoceros and kangaroos are some the other animals up for adoption.This sprawling park in Hyderabad is home to many species and many citizens have come forward and adopted animals like jungle fowl, rhinos, tigers, etc. The adoption of a big cat like the tiger, reportedly costs about Rs.1,00,000 (upkeep for rhinos and hippos cost the same too). While caring for crocodiles or water monitor lizards, for instance, costs about Rs.20,000, yearly. Giraffes and elephants, however, reportedly cost the most at Rs.5,00,000 per year.You can also adopt the landscape garden areas in the zoo, like Central Fountain, the Bear Moat, the reptile area, etc., for Rs.2,00,000 per year.This park is popularly known as the Chhatbir Zoo. In 2018, there were reportedly 56 adoptions of different types of deer and about 50 adoptions of snakes. Adopting an Indian lion or a royal Bengal tiger here, will cost about Rs.17,200 for a month, while caring for a partridge or parrot comes up to Rs. 100 a month. The monthly upkeep of an elephant, however, as in the case of other zoos, proves costliest at Rs.23,900 per month.Over the years, celebrities from the entertainment industry and the sporting community have stepped forward to adopt animals, across different zoos in thecountry. And tigers, incidentally are the most popular animals on their list of favourite animals to adopt.*Details regarding the animals up for adoption, and the cost of their adoption have been compiled from posts shared on official websites, news articles, and features on print and pages online, over the last few years",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74439464,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-412640/74439464.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/worldwildlifeday-adopt-a-wild-animal-just-like-the-celebs-do/articleshow/74439464.cms

Premiered in 2013, Nayani has been staged across the country and the USA and is now making a comeback to namma ooru.This time around, though, Rukmini has changed parts of the choreography and the storyline. “My mother’s short story is based on how one can find divinity within themselves and everyone around them. I have adapted the story as the script for my dance production. It is also a celebration of the devotion we have towards the natural elements of the earth,” she says.Rukmini says, “I have retained the essence of the original production, but have made major changes to the choreography and the storyline to give it a fresh feel, keeping in mind that we will have audiences who have seen earlier performances. This time, the choreography is more concise and cohesive. Over the years, not only have I grown as a choreographer, but the recital has also been staged several times, so, I have tried to be more creative and this is the result of revisiting it with a different perspective.”“Most Indian classical dance recitals have a very strong narrative; in fact, they always have a story. Whether that’s mythological or any other genre-based, the dancer uses the medium of dance to narrate it. In a way, classical dancers are visually pleasing, immersive and even interactive storytellers. Everything, from our expressions to our costumes, narrates a certain part of the recital,” she says.Rukmini adds that she is looking forward to bringing Nayani back to Bengaluru, given that audiences here have always been a joy to perform for. “People here come to watch and enjoy the performance and not judge it.

4,['3/03/2020'],"Aparna Rajeev: This year, I’m excited to present my own song too at the Soorya Fest","Young Aparna Rajeev used to sing the prayer song every year, for the memorial function of director Santosh Sivan’s mother in Thiruvananthapuram. Once, Santosh’s father, whom she lovingly calls Sivan uncle, asked her, “Why restrict yourself to the prayer song of the function? You should perform too.” And being a fan of ghazals, Sivan suggested that she tries the genre for the function. That was about five years ago.

From there, Aparna went on to become a regular ghazal performer at events like Soorya Festival and Swaralaya and most recently, she released her first independent ghazal music video Barey Dino Baad . The song, composed by her father Rajeev ONV (son of late poet ONV Kurup ) has lyrics by Piyali Das .

The musician, who has also sung in movies, tells us getting the diction and pronunciation right was a challenge she faced while making Barey Dino Baad. “The song’s lyricist helped quite a bit to perfect the recording on that front, and yet another challenge was giving the right expressions for the song in the video, though I am no actor.”

The song has been widely shared on social media too. Aparna says, “I feel blessed to receive the kind of feedback that’s coming her way. It feels great that people liked the music and its visuals.” Its orchestration is done by veteran musician Arjunan master’s grandson Midhun Ashok, and sitar and tabla were played by composer Sharreth’s brother Ranjith.

She tells us how her first performance, just five years ago, paved way for her to bigger platforms. “Many art doyens also turn up at the memorial function at the Sivans’. The year in which I was to give my debut ghazal performance, Soorya Krishnamoorthy sir was also invited, but he couldn’t attend. Instead, he asked me to send him a CD recording of my performance, and I did.”

Interestingly, watching her show, Soorya Krishnamoorthy asked her to perform at the Soorya Fest that year. “I couldn’t believe that he would offer me such a platform. I have learnt Hindustani music for a few years, but my core area has always been Carnatic and the opportunity was quite overwhelming. Then again, I had to grab it,” says Aparna, who has been performing at the fest every year since then.

Aparna would be performing ghazals at Soorya festival again this year. “Generally, I try to pick ghazals that are familiar to the audience as that’s what helps them connect the best with a singer in such shows. However, this year, I would be presenting a bit of my own song too, and I’m excited about it,” she says, signing off.

5,['3/03/2020'],Supritha Sathyanarayan set to make Telugu small screen debut,"Actress Supritha Sathyanarayan is making her debut on the Telugu small screen with the daily soap opera Savithramma Gari Abbayi . Interestingly enough, Supritha will co-star Kannada actor Chandan Kumar who plays the lead on the show. In the family drama, the actress will play Nandini , a character earlier essayed by Ayesha . Supritha says, “I was getting plenty of offers from both Telugu and Tamil serials, but I did not accept any because I was busy with my Kannada serial. The makers of Savithramma Gari Abbayi, though, insisted and I finally agreed. The story was about Nandini an arrogant, stubborn girl, who does not respect elders, and only loves her father whom she loses in a road accident. She believes that her husband had a hand in her father’s death. But when she realises the truth, she mends her relationship with her husband. The twist, then, is that Nandini gets grievously injured in an accident, following she has to undergo plastic surgery. I play Nandini at this juncture. The role is very similar to Maithili that I played in the Kannada show Seetha Vallabha. Honestly, I don’t find any difference between the two, but I would love to explore different characters in my upcoming projects.”Supritha, who is not well-versed with Telugu, is relying on her co-star Chandan to help her with the language. “Chandan helps me get the diction right. It is also great to work with Haritha, who is a veteran actress on Telugu TV. Right now, I have been shuttling between Bengaluru and Hyderabad for my shows and the constant travel is already taking a toll on me.

8,['3/03/2020'],Being on Bigg Boss Kannada helped mend my ties with my family: Bhoomi Shetty,"When Bhoomi Shetty decided to make a name for herself in showbiz, her family was far from thrilled. A career in entertainment was not something her ‘conservative’ parents had envisioned for her. So much so that since she moved lock stock and barrel to Bengaluru, their relationship was rather strained. But things are now on the mend, thanks to the actress’ stint on the recently-concluded season of Bigg Boss Kannada. “Before entering the Bigg Boss house, I went home to Kundapura to seek their blessings. Even though they were warm towards me, all was not well. But it has changed completely for the better after my return from the house and I’m so grateful for that,” says an upbeat Bhoomi, who spent the past week in her hometown. “Everywhere I go now, there’s so much recognition and love. But most of all, it has reunited me with the most precious aspect of my life — my family. I thought my mother wouldn’t have watched the show considering that she was so upset that I had taken up a career in television. But my sister and grandmother told me that my mother was hooked to the show from start to finish. On my recent visit, my entire family and extended relatives came home to meet me; they fed and pampered me. It’s what I missed most during my stint on the show,” Bhoomi tells us. That apart, the Kinnari actor also got to see a Bhootha Kola performance, went for a drive to Maravanthe beach and paid obeisance at her family temple. “My mother came to drop me at the bus stand the night I was to head back to Bengaluru and it was just like the old times.

11,['3/03/2020'],Vidyut Jammwal: My constant ambition is to lead a happy life: Vidyut Jammwal,"Owing to his talent, hard work and dedication, Commando actor, Vidyut Jammwal has earned himself popularity and the image of one of the top action heroes in the Indian film fraternity. The man has been practising martial arts since the age of three and takes great care of his physical and mental well-being. Vidyut, who was recently in Lucknow to shoot for his next film Khuda Hafiz , spoke about how life has changed and why he is happy being single. Having visited the city earlier too, Vidyut said the weather in Lucknow was amazing and hopes that he can one day see more of the city. “I was talking to my mom yesterday and I was like mum I’m in Lucknow and she was delighted that I was here. Lucknow is a beautiful city with beautiful people. There’s so much warmth in the people that one feels so welcomed here. That’s why it’s no wonder that Lucknow is known for its mehmaan nawaazi. I love this city.”The Junglee actor although regrets not being able to see more of the city. “I would love to go out sightseeing in Lucknow. When I was last here several years ago, then also our schedule was so tight that I couldn’t see the place properly. Even now we are short of time,” he says.Vidyut Jammwal shooting with actress Shivaleeka Oberoi for the film Khuda Hafiz in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Vidyut revealed that his father served in the army and he lost his father when he was 19. He added, “I’ve grown up in an army background and I don’t think it's left me till now, but I’ve become a civilian now, as they say in the forces. Chivalry, respect, understanding of human beings to an extent and being grounded are some of the attributes which never leave a person who has been raised in an army background. Besides, I have great respect for soldiers, because I’ve seen them up close, it’s a different life altogether. Whenever I go to an army place I feel very proud of the way they treat me.”When asked about why he didn’t join the army himself, Vidyut jokingly said, “I am in the army. I’m representing the Indian army as a commando. I create an opinion about how an Indian army officer is to the civilians.” “On a serious note, I did apply to the NDA, but I was too young and not well prepared. Along with this, I also feel that destiny plays a huge role in terms of where you’re going to land up doing in life,” claimed the new age action hero of Bollywood.The Junglee actor professed his love for animals and especially how his love for elephants grew after shooting with them for the film. He said, “Being an army chap you have grown up with dogs. But then you meet the real majestic creature the elephants, it changes everything. I spent a lot of days with elephants, about 50 of them. I was telling my director also that, although we had 50 elephants on set, I never heard ki haathi ne kisi insan ko gira diya or banged into a human being. But 50 people in a room will 100% bump into each other. There’s no idea of the human body. Animals are amazing. I think human race needs to evolve the most.”He went on to add, “In fact, there was this very interesting thing that happened while we were shooting the film. There’s a scene in the film where I am running through the elephants. I can easily say it was one of the most difficult things I have done in my life. Like I’ve done a lot of other great stunts which not many people in the world have attempted, but that stunt has byfar been the toughest, I’d say. So, my director, Chuck Russell asks me to run between 50 elephants weighing about 4000 kilograms each, and at that time I was like koi nahi, it’s all cool, main kar loonga. So I ran, but the moment I came in between them I actually realised how heavy they are and I could hear them breathe and I was so scared. My brain had shut, my body wasn’t in harmony. But the moment I crossed them, I was like, ‘Thank God I got saved!’ But those animals, they were completely in control of themselves. Not one went haywire.”Further, speaking about getting scared while doing dangerous stunts and other physically challenging tasks, the action hero averred, “I get scared doing everything I do. But just the thought of overcoming it is a great feeling.” He went on to add, “Coming back to your question, I do get scared but I also believe that jis bhi cheez mein darr lagta hai, woh zaroor karo, phir log kehte hain arey waah, kamaal kar diya. If you can’t speak a language, go and speak to a person who is excellent at it. You’ll realise that you’ve just picked it up. The fear is the hindrance to everything you do. Anything that scares you, please confront it,” said the actor whose writing a book on mental exercises.Touted as an action hero, Vidyut says he is happy with the image he has as an actor. “I want to be like the Bruce Lee of India . I always wanted to be an action hero. But with this film that we are shooting, there is a slight shift from action. He gets to do that later on in the film. So as far as being typecast as an action hero, I have no problems. In fact, everything now is a bonus for me. I didn’t expect life to be this amazing. I get these great small highs like my mum goes to a military hospital sometimes, and the doctor says there’s a hero also by that surname Jammwal and she’s like he’s my son. So this is a high I can’t really explain to people, but it puts me on cloud nine. I have more than what I had dreamt of. Now my constant ambition is to lead a happy life. I look back at my life, I planned nothing. It’s all a bonus. At the end of the day, it's all about happiness. No one really tells you how to get it. So find something that inspires you to wake up, the moment you find that something, you’ll be happy. And it can’t mostly be a job, it has to be something around it. There has to be a light within you which is so lit that everybody notices.”Happily single now, Vidyut says that he has never really felt the need for a partner. He feels that one doesn’t necessarily need a partner to complete them. “You don’t need a partner. You need a companion who you can share your stuff with.

14,['3/03/2020'],From e-invites to BYOC (bring your own cutlery): Make your parties sustainable,"Isn’t dealing with post-party trash and leftovers a bigger stressor than hosting the actual party? Well, there’s a way to reduce that post-party dread. Additionally, with all that post-party waste and clean-up, you are not only putting stress on yourself, but the environment as well. So, by hosting a zero-waste party, you are not only doing yourself a favour, but also doing your part in saving the environment. “Not using single-use plastics at your party can help to reduce a lot of waste. Since it’s convenient, a lot of people usually go for disposable plastic cutlery and decor, but that is easily avoidable,” says Nandita Khosla Sud, a Gurgaon resident, who hosted an eco-friendly birthday party for her daughter, adding, “One thing that we kept in mind was to have a party with no plastics and we succeeded. Just that one step helped us in reducing a lot of post-party waste.” Hosting a party definitely needs a lot of planning and if you aim at hosting a party with minimum wastage, here are some tips to get you going.E-invites on WhatsApp or e-mail are the way to go. You can give it a personal touch by adding a message. You can also add a footnote informing the guests about your efforts to go eco-friendly. “Physical invites are an absolute waste of money and effort,” says Bangalore-based eco-friendly event planner Pragati Badrinath, adding, “You can have a potluck dinner and even ask guests to not bring any gifts wrapped in plastic.”It is a no-brainer to have plants as a return gift for your guests. While that’s always a good idea, one can also get creative with gifts. Using old newspapers for wrapping gifts or gifting handmade potlis or just small posters (made with waste fabric) with hand-written messages for each guest make for creative gift ideas. “That just adds to the experience of the guests. For kids’ birthday parties, one should look at gifts like wooden toys, instead of plastic ones, or hand-made cloth bags with their favourite superheroes embroidered on them,” says Anjali Sharma, a Gurgaon-based event planner, who promotes sustainable parties.Event planners often encounter customers who think that decor (especially for birthday parties) must have balloons. “We suggest that people go for reusable props when it comes to decor. There can be hand written notes (on paper) or photos that can be used as hangings with small lights, glass jars with candles can be used for table decorations, paper bunting and hangings can be used as wall decor. We also use reusable props made out of waste fabric,” shares Anjali Sharma.Pragati adds, “I have created a standard poster made of felt fabric with happy birthday written on it. It can easily be washed and used at different parties. Kids are not interested in balloons. They are simply interested in colours, so one can have that through paper and fabric decor as well. For other parties, especially house parties, one can completely do away with additional decor.”Borrow props and lights for decorUse cloth napkinsOffer finger food and minimise the use of cutleryKeep enough trash bins at the venueUse waste fabrics for making bunting for decorDistribute leftover food immediately after the partyUse newspaper and jute strings for wrapping gifts",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74439604,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-375449/74439604.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/from-e-invites-to-byoc-bring-your-own-cutlery-make-your-parties-sustainable/articleshow/74439591.cms

Akshay Oberoi knows it only too well. The actor went through a lull phase right at the beginning of his career and says that those tough days have ended up shaping his worldview. He shares, “I am not afraid of death, that is inevitable. Success, money, fame, stardom — all of that’s also secondary. They are just by-products. The only thing I care about is being in front of the camera. It keeps me happy and sane. I don’t even fear failure. I just fear another lull.”Prod him further about this ‘lull’ and he says, “I was out of work for three-and-a-half years. That lull, after I had just done my first film (' Isi Life Mein ', 2010), was crushing. It was a tough phase to survive and I went back to theatre. I had just gotten married to my childhood sweetheart Jyothi Vynatheya, and I had no money. It’s difficult when you are married and not earning. You start wondering what your wife will think of you. Insecurities crop up and your confidence takes a major hit. She was earning and she took care of the house for a couple of years. But I knew that my only way was to keep at it. I kept pushing myself, and she believed in me. The break finally came when Bijoy Nambiar gave me a show called ' Rush ' (2012). After that, he told me that he wanted to make a film with me. I was 25 then. Six months later, he offered me ' Pizza ' (2014). And that’s how I was back in business.”Akshay says that the struggle toughened him. “I have lost fear completely. Today, I do not worry about the length of my scenes or the screen time of my character. I see so many people getting trapped in this web, but it can kill you and your creativity. Now, even big directors and producers are inclined towards casting actors rather than stars. I don’t mind being called a character artiste. In fact, I would love it.

20,['3/03/2020'],"Radhika Madan: My directors made me believe I should focus on my craft, not looks","In her brief career so far, Radhika Madan has chosen roles that can’t be stereotyped, like the girl with stained teeth, excess weight and dyed hair in 'Pataakha' or the quirky character who is a misfit in her circles, in 'Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota'. Ahead of the release of her third film, director Homi Adajania ’s 'Angrezi Medium' where she plays Irrfan ’s daughter, she talks to BT about why this will be an unforgettable film for her and how actors need to break away from the mindset of looking conventionally good in every frame and every role. Excerpts:I still can’t believe that it has happened. After seeing the trailer of the film, I had tears in my eyes. When Homi (Adjania) showed it to me at a party, nothing registered as much as the last 10 seconds, which shows my name appearing along with that of Irrfan sir, Kareena Kapoor Khan Pankaj Tripathi and Deepak Dobriyal . Those 10 seconds made me realise that I am indeed living my dream. When I was working on the film, I would hang out on the sets even when I was not needed, because I didn’t want to miss a chance to observe so many good actors in one frame and learn from them.Well, I became an actor by chance, after I was spotted on social media. When I got past the auditions, it was my father who helped me achieve what I set out to do. While my mother worried about me being a part of the industry, my father stood by me like Irrfan sir does in this film for his daughter. My dad booked us flight tickets to Mumbai. While I would attend narrations, he would wait outside. Till that point in my life, I had never thought that I would become an actor. And when I got the chance to be one, my father never questioned my decision. When I started shooting, he went house hunting to ensure that I have a roof over my head here. It’s surreal how life gave me a chance to experience those emotions again with Irrfan sir.On the contrary, it has been my toughest role so far because Tarika is totally unlike me. I’m sure when people see the film, they won’t know the effort it took for me to be that person. When we started the pre-production work, I just couldn’t crack the voice of my character. I wasn’t sounding like her. I went to Udaipur with Homi and there, I hung out with girls who were 16-17 years old. In fact, I told them to spread the word that I was seeking admission in one of their schools, just to know how the boys would react. I’ve studied at Delhi Public School and the students there have a different mindset from those in English medium schools in Udaipur. I wanted to understand what these kids think about studying abroad or about having relationships. I wanted to crack their demeanour and the way they speak to their elders and among themselves.It’s got to do with the fact that we, as an audience, wouldn’t watch the same thing again and again. We no longer want to see an actor play the same role repeatedly. It doesn’t work. For example, when you talk about the girl next door, there are so many kinds of girls next door. I understand that filmmakers want young energy and a peppy vibe, but that’s not the only kind of young girl that exists. As an actor, I don’t want to be put in a box. We become actors because we want to live many lives, we’re not happy living just one. It doesn’t matter how tough it is. We have to let go of this mindset that we’re pretty, aur abhi toh mere paas age hai. So, let me do things that make me look nice and ek fan base banati hoon. Acting baad mein kar loongi, pehle national crush ban jaaoon. I want to become an actor first, star to desh bana hi dega. If I become a star eventually, I will know that it didn’t happen by fluke or by chance, and that I deserve it. I don’t want overnight success, because then, it will make me doubt if I deserve it. I have not given the audience enough yet.In my case, the credit for that goes to Vishal Bhardwaj and Vasan Bala (the directors of 'Pataakha' and 'Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota', respectively). They laid the foundation for this thought process. As a girl born into a regular Delhi household, I grew up watching the usual commercial Hindi fare, where heroines shoot their debut scenes on hill tops and make an entry with their hair flying in the air. So, you have this fixation about playing a leading lady. Vishal sir and Vasan sir broke that image for me and shattered my inhibitions to pieces. The concern about looks stems from insecurity at some level. Art gives you the confidence to hold your own. That confidence and talent are not temporary, your looks are. I felt sexy and stunning even with stained teeth, excess weight and dyed hair in 'Pataakha', which is very close to my heart. Who looks like that in their debut film? People may wonder, but they don’t know what I learnt in the process. Vasan sir told me that I will learn action and do it without a body double in 'Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota'. He also said, ‘Tumhare baal udenge, lekin tab jab tum action kar rahi hongi, you won’t be the hero’s fantasy’. The directors that I worked with made me believe that I should focus on my art and craft, and not my looks.It’s the era of social media and influencers. We need to be kind to ourselves and others around us. We need to tell youngsters that they don’t need to look a certain way and that it’s cool to be yourself because no one else can be you. We get influenced so much by personalities, especially actors’ personalities. If someone says that I want to be like you, I tell them to be themselves instead. You can be inspired by people’s ethics, their sense of dress or how they conduct themselves and adapt it to the environment. But you don’t have to become their clone. There’s no point in chasing a certain shape, size, hair colour or lip contour. This obsession with looking a certain way comes from what’s being fed to youngsters through different media. We need to tell our youngsters that it’s one thing to be inspired and another to be influenced. You don’t need superficial appendages to look beautiful. If you love yourself, you will stop feeling the need for approval from others around you.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74443457,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-62495/74443457.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/radhika-madan-my-directors-made-me-believe-i-should-focus-on-my-craft-not-looks/articleshow/74443457.cms

Owing to his talent, hard work and dedication, Commando actor, Vidyut Jammwal has earned himself popularity and the image of one of the top action heroes in the Indian film fraternity. The man has been practising martial arts since the age of three and takes great care of his physical and mental well-being. Vidyut, who was recently in Lucknow to shoot for his next film Khuda Hafiz , spoke about how life has changed and why he is happy being single.Having visited the city earlier too, Vidyut said the weather in Lucknow was amazing and hopes that he can one day see more of the city. “I was talking to my mom yesterday and I was like mum I’m in Lucknow and she was delighted that I was here. Lucknow is a beautiful city with beautiful people. There’s so much warmth in the people that one feels so welcomed here. That’s why it’s no wonder that Lucknow is known for its mehmaan nawaazi. I love this city.”The Junglee actor although regrets not being able to see more of the city. “I would love to go out sightseeing in Lucknow. When I was last here several years ago, then also our schedule was so tight that I couldn’t see the place properly. Even now we are short of time,” he says.Vidyut Jammwal shooting with actress Shivaleeka Oberoi for the film Khuda Hafiz in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Vidyut revealed that his father served in the army and he lost his father when he was 19. He added, “I’ve grown up in an army background and I don’t think it's left me till now, but I’ve become a civilian now, as they say in the forces. Chivalry, respect, understanding of human beings to an extent and being grounded are some of the attributes which never leave a person who has been raised in an army background. Besides, I have great respect for soldiers, because I’ve seen them up close, it’s a different life altogether. Whenever I go to an army place I feel very proud of the way they treat me.”When asked about why he didn’t join the army himself, Vidyut jokingly said, “I am in the army. I’m representing the Indian army as a commando. I create an opinion about how an Indian army officer is to the civilians.”“On a serious note, I did apply to the NDA, but I was too young and not well prepared. Along with this, I also feel that destiny plays a huge role in terms of where you’re going to land up doing in life,” claimed the new age action hero of Bollywood.The Junglee actor professed his love for animals and especially how his love for elephants grew after shooting with them for the film. He said, “Being an army chap you have grown up with dogs. But then you meet the real majestic creature the elephants, it changes everything. I spent a lot of days with elephants, about 50 of them. I was telling my director also that, although we had 50 elephants on set, I never heard ki haathi ne kisi insan ko gira diya or banged into a human being. But 50 people in a room will 100% bump into each other. There’s no idea of the human body. Animals are amazing. I think human race needs to evolve the most.”He went on to add, “In fact, there was this very interesting thing that happened while we were shooting the film. There’s a scene in the film where I am running through the elephants. I can easily say it was one of the most difficult things I have done in my life. Like I’ve done a lot of other great stunts which not many people in the world have attempted, but that stunt has byfar been the toughest, I’d say. So, my director, Chuck Russell asks me to run between 50 elephants weighing about 4000 kilograms each, and at that time I was like koi nahi, it’s all cool, main kar loonga. So I ran, but the moment I came in between them I actually realised how heavy they are and I could hear them breathe and I was so scared. My brain had shut, my body wasn’t in harmony. But the moment I crossed them, I was like, ‘Thank God I got saved!’ But those animals, they were completely in control of themselves. Not one went haywire.”Further, speaking about getting scared while doing dangerous stunts and other physically challenging tasks, the action hero averred, “I get scared doing everything I do. But just the thought of overcoming it is a great feeling.” He went on to add, “Coming back to your question, I do get scared but I also believe that jis bhi cheez mein darr lagta hai, woh zaroor karo, phir log kehte hain arey waah, kamaal kar diya. If you can’t speak a language, go and speak to a person who is excellent at it. You’ll realise that you’ve just picked it up. The fear is the hindrance to everything you do. Anything that scares you, please confront it,” said the actor whose writing a book on mental exercises.Touted as an action hero, Vidyut says he is happy with the image he has as an actor. “I want to be like the Bruce Lee of India . I always wanted to be an action hero. But with this film that we are shooting, there is a slight shift from action. He gets to do that later on in the film. So as far as being typecast as an action hero, I have no problems. In fact, everything now is a bonus for me. I didn’t expect life to be this amazing. I get these great small highs like my mum goes to a military hospital sometimes, and the doctor says there’s a hero also by that surname Jammwal and she’s like he’s my son. So this is a high I can’t really explain to people, but it puts me on cloud nine. I have more than what I had dreamt of. Now my constant ambition is to lead a happy life. I look back at my life, I planned nothing. It’s all a bonus. At the end of the day, it's all about happiness. No one really tells you how to get it. So find something that inspires you to wake up, the moment you find that something, you’ll be happy. And it can’t mostly be a job, it has to be something around it. There has to be a light within you which is so lit that everybody notices.”Happily single now, Vidyut says that he has never really felt the need for a partner. He feels that one doesn’t necessarily need a partner to complete them. “You don’t need a partner. You need a companion who you can share your stuff with. It could be your mother, brother, best friend, sister, anyone, not necessarily a person of the opposite sex. But if you find somebody, it's great,” expressed Vidyut.— With inputs from Yashi Agarwal",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74441964,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275266,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/my-constant-ambition-is-to-lead-a-happy-life-vidyut-jammwal/articleshow/74441979.cms
22,['3/03/2020'],Madhur Bhushan: I won’t give up on my dream of making a biopic on Madhubala,"Paeans have been written about her ethereal beauty and stardom, and odes dedicated to her spirit and passion for life. And yet, destiny was such that her beautiful life was laced with tragedy. At 36, after a nine-year battle with illness, she succumbed to death. Days after her 52nd death anniversary (February 23), Madhur Bhushan (originally Zahida), reminisces moments from her sister’s far too short life, and talks about why Madhubala’s story needs to be told.She says, “Though she is remembered for her classic beauty, there was so much more to her than her beauty. I want to do something for her before I die. She continues to rule millions of hearts and her story needs to be told.”However, Madhur’s dream of making this biopic hit a roadblock after her other siblings raised an objection over it. Reportedly, filmmaker Imtiaz Ali who had procured the rights from her for the biopic earlier, recently terminated the contract because of the same reason. But Madhur is not ready to give up on it, yet. “As of now, the biopic has come to a halt because my sisters have objected to it. I find it strange that they don’t want this to materialise…humne uska (Madhubala) namak khaaya hai. Usne apne behnon ko paala hain,” she says, adding, “With the help of my spiritual guru, Arvind Kumar Malviya, who’s idea this was, I want to make this biopic.”Madhur also plans to write a biography on her sister and title it ‘Nine Years of Madhubala’.‘It was written in her fate...becoming an actress,’ says Madhur, recounting the turn of events that made a nine-year-old Mumtaz Jehan Begum Dehlavi land in Bollywood. From Baby Mumtaz to Madhubala, her journey could only be described as that of a dance of destiny. She made her acting debut as a child artiste at the age of nine with 'Basant' (1942) and her first appearance as a lead actress was at 13, when she starred opposite Raj Kapoor in 'Neel Kamal' (1947). It wasn’t long before, she became a star and a sensation. Madhur continues, “Madhu aapa was a cute little girl. She would sing, and dance in front of the mirror. She always told our dad (Ataullah Khan), ‘Abba, mujhe filmon mein jaana hai’. However, our father was averse to it because of his conservative background and the belief that girls should not join the industry. But life had plans of its own. Our father lost his job, and eventually, we had to move to Mumbai to survive. At one point, he relented to her wishes and started doing the rounds of studios with her. However, he never dreamt that she would become such a big star.”With 'Mahal' (1949), she caught the imagination of Bollywood. She became a star, overnight. She was around 16 then. So, did things change at home with this newfound stardom? “Never,” Madhur is quick to point out, adding, “We often felt, ‘Oh my God, she is so beautiful. How can we sit next to her?’ She would put us at ease by saying things like, ‘Main toh actress hoon na, isliye log mujhe mudd mudd kar dekhte hain. Tum actress bann jaoge toh tumhe bhi log mudkar mudkar dekhenge’. She never made us feel any less. She was such a loving daughter and an equally good sister. Unfortunate are those people who ill-treated her or left her to be by herself.”To the outside world she was an enigma, a mystery. People even said that she was a recluse, but what was the eternal beauty like in real life? Madhur gets nostalgic while taking us on a trip down memory lane. “Hum logon ke saath toh bohot hi masti karti thi — kabhi baal kaat diya, kabhi kuchh kar diya. She loved to have ice-cream and enjoyed listening to music. She would even go to theatres to watch movies wearing a burkha. If you would have met her, aapko aisa lagta hi nahi ki yeh actress hain. She never felt that she was a star and she didn’t behave like one. She wouldn’t wear any make-up; she didn’t need to because she was so pretty. She would only dress in whites and tie her hair up in a simple bun when not shooting. Madhu aapa didn’t need to get dolled up, as my father didn’t allow her to attend parties. He had told her, ‘Maine izzat bohot mushkil se kamaayi hai, Madhu. Court cases jeeta hoon tum bachhiyon ki izzat ke liye. Mere baad koi tum par unlgi nahi utha sakta saying that they were dhandhewali chokris and their father exploited them.’ My sister always abided by him. She was a gharelu ladki,” says Madhur.With beauty and fame came rumours of her linkups, controversies and heartbreaks. Following a courtship of nine years with Dilip Kumar, the couple endured an ugly break-up and Madhubala finally married Kishore Kumar in 1960. Madhur says, “People have written about her affair with Kamal Amrohi. Baahar jaane ko milta nahin toh affair kaise hoga? Woh toh Dilip Kumar sahab ke saath itni films mein kaam kiya, waise mulaqaat hui aur pyaar ho gaya. She worked with Kishore Kumar sahab in 'Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi' (1958) and 'Half Ticket' (1962), toh pyaar hua. It was very easy to link her with men because she was so beautiful. Prem Nath wanted to marry her, but she told him that our father wouldn’t allow it, because we were Pathans. She was not the kind to have frivolous relationships.”However, the highlight of her love life remains her relationship with Dilip Kumar, which made headlines then and continues to pique eveyone’s interest to date. Most believed that the two of them would tie the knot, but sadly, it was not to be. Was it a misunderstanding, a clash of egos or love gone sour? In the Bollywood thespian, Dilip Kumar’s autobiography, which was published in 2014, it has been stated that things soured between them during the making of ' Mughal-E-Azam '. He stated, “I sensed, Asif (filmmaker) was seriously trying to mend the situation for her when matters began to sour between us, thanks to her father’s attempt to make the proposed marriage a business venture.” Talking about their bitter-sweet love saga, Madhur recalls, “Dilip sahab and Madhu aapa were shooting for ' Naya Daur ' (1957, Vyjayanthimala was cast in her place ultimately). The makers had scheduled an outdoor shoot (the location was where a previous shoot was attacked by dacoits), and our father was not willing to allow her to shoot at that location. He feared for my sister’s safety. He asked them to zero in on an alternate location, but BR Chopra (producer) sahab didn’t budge. That’s when Dilip sahab got involved. His only mistake was that he stood by the producer. Finally, BR Chopra filed a case against my father, which went on for four months, jiske dauraan we heard people say ulti-seedhi cheezein about my father. They called him a dictator and that he wanted to dominate my sister. Finally, the case was resolved, and later, Dilip sahab came home and told Madhu aapa to complete the film, and post that, they could get married. But my sister wanted him to apologise to our father. He flatly refused. We have nothing against him. Had he apologised to my father, aapa would have been Mrs Dilip Kumar. She had immense gratitude for our father, and she couldn’t just let it go.”It was in 1960, while shooting for a film in South, that Madhubala spat blood. She flew to London the next day, along with her husband, Kishore Kumar. “We were not aware that she had a hole in her heart. When the doctor said that she had a hole in her heat and the operation won’t be successful, we were all in shock! Imagine a young girl of 27 being told that she had just two years to live. She consulted several doctors in India and they confirmed her worst fears. She was advised to take a break, but she had films lined up. She completed a song and a few scenes in 'Mughal-E-Azam' (1960) in that condition. It took about nine years to complete the film and that was the phase when she was suffering. In all those years, she rarely met anybody from the industry, barring Geeta Dutt and Waheeda Rehman. She didn’t want anyone to see her in that state. I was with her through the last few years of her life. I would sleep in the same bed with her.”It was a life too beautiful, cut too short. Madhur reveals, “You know…She loved the song Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera ('Jewel Thief', 1967). She felt that it encapsulated her life. She would wait every day for the doctors to tell her that they had discovered a cure for her. She wanted to live. I believe that love heals. Yes, we can’t change destiny, but if she had received more love from the people who she loved so much, then I think she would have had more strength to fight her battle for life, longer.” Did Madhubala get a chance to interact with Dilip Kumar during the last days of her life? Madhur says, “He once went to see her at the hospital. She sent him a message through someone that she wanted to see him, and he came over to see her. This was before his marriage. Later, he came for the funeral. He immediately flew down from Madras (where he was shooting) when learnt that Madhubala was very critical. But he was late by two hours...she was buried by then.”Though she is remembered for her classic beauty, Madhur says that there was so much more to Madhubala than her beauty. She believes that the story of her undying zest for life, fierce loyalty towards her family and quiet courage in matters of the heart, needs to be told to a nation that hailed her the Venus of Bollywood. However, Madhur’s dream has not taken off because her other siblings are not willing to give their consent. But she is not ready to give up on it, yet. She says, “With the help of my spiritual guru, Arvind Kumar Malviya, I am keen to make the biopic, as it was his idea.” Along with her guru, she also plans to set up an old-age home and a school for young girls in Jodhpur. “Madhu aapa would always tell my father, ‘Abba, jab hamare paas bahut paisa aayega na, toh hum log school banaayenge chhoti ladkiyon ke liye.’ She didn’t get formal education herself and this was her dream.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74441694,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-55300/74441694.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/madhur-bhushan-i-wont-give-up-on-my-dream-of-making-a-biopic-on-madhubala/articleshow/74441663.cms

25,['3/03/2020'],Nirbhaya case: Nirbhaya convicts to live a little longer,"The four convicts of the Nirbhaya rape case (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Any condemned convict shouldn’t meet his creator with a grievance in his bosom that the courts of this country had not acted fairly in granting him an opportunity to exhaust all his legal remedies, a Delhi court said on Monday while deferring, till further orders and for the third time, the hanging of all four convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

On February 17, the court had said the hanging would take place at 6 am on March 3.

After Monday’s hearing started, additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana initially rejected a plea to defer the execution. But subsequently, he was informed that one of the convicts had moved a mercy plea with the President following the rejection of his curative petition in the Supreme Court.

‘Where there’s a right, there’s remedy’

The conundrum of executing the death sentence against the condemned convicts does not seem to be over. Within half an hour of dismissal of the application of Pawan and Akshay seeking postponement of hanging, their counsel (A P Singh) informed court that Pawan’s mercy plea had been moved with the President of India,” the court observed.

When the court turned towards special prosecutor Irfan Ahmed , he said under a provision of the Delhi Prison Rules, it is for the government to decide whether to stay or not. “This game of hide and seek on behalf of defense should be handled with hard hands,” he said.

The court earlier asked Singh to show it the rule which explicitly stated that mercy plea could only be filed after dismissal of curative. It also asked him about the provision at the current stage for the court to interfere. “Under what provision shall court come to your rescue?” it asked but could not find an answer from the counsel. Singh urged the court that he had the only option to come to court as it had only issued death warrants.

In its order, the court noted that it would be ""axiomatic to state that the extreme penalty of capital punishment is irreversible in nature"". For the court the remedy of mercy plea is an important legal remedy available to the convict and guided by the cherished legal principle Ubi jus ubi remedium – where there is a right, there is a remedy. ""I am of the opinion that the application is very much maintainable,"" the court said.

Even going by a prison rule, a trial court is required to fix the date of a prisoner's hanging post rejection of a mercy petition. ""Therefore, it is not correct to contend that the execution of punishment is a matter in the hands of the executive alone and the court has no control over the same,"" it pointed out. Despite ""stiff resistance"" from the victim's side, the court opined that it was only correct to defer the scheduled hanging ""till further orders"". The court said, ""I am of the opinion that the death sentence cannot be executed pending the disposal of the mercy petition of the convict.”

27,['3/03/2020'],SC refuses to refer petitions on Article 370 to a 7-judge bench,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to refer to a seven-judge Constitution bench a bunch of pleas challenging the constitutional validity of changes in Article 370 for scrapping of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and said the issue would continue to be heard by the five-judge bench.

A five-judge bench of Justices N V Ramana, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, R Subhash Reddy , B R Gavai and Surya Kant, which was set up to decide the issue, said there was no reason to refer the case to a larger bench. It did not find merit in the plea of some of the petitioners, who alleged there was contradiction in the verdicts of two five-judge SC benches on the scope of Article 370 as they sought reference of the case to larger bench. The petitioners argued that two SC judgments — Prem Nath Kaul versus J&K in 1959 and Sampat Prakash versus J&K in 1970 — on the issue were in conflict and thus a larger bench should hear the case. But the court agreed with the contention of the Centre and J&K administration that there was no inconsistency between the decisions.

Article 370: No inconsistency in two earlier rulings, says SC

The SC agreed with the contention of the Centre and J&K administration that there was no inconsistency between the decisions of the apex court in Prem Nath Kaul and Sampat Prakash cases.

The petitioners contended that as decision in the Kaul case was not considered in the subsequent judgement, the latter verdict was wrongly decided. After examining the two verdicts, the bench said facts and context were different in those judgments and observations made in a judgment cannot be selectively picked in order to give them a particular meaning. The bench said the SC in the “Prem Nath Kaul case indicated that the Constituent Assembly’s decision under Article 370(2) was final. This finality has to be read as being limited to those decisions taken by the state government under Article 370 prior to the convening of the Constituent Assembly of the state, in line with the language of Article 370(2)”.

“The Constitution bench in the Prem Nath Kaul case did not discuss the continuation or cessation of the operation of Article 370 of the Constitution after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of the state. This was not an issue in question before the court, unlike in the Sampat Prakash case where the contention was specifically made before, and refuted by, the court. This court sees no reason to read into the Prem Nath Kaul case an interpretation, which results in it being in conflict with subsequent judgments of this court, particularly when an ordinary reading of the judgment does not result in such an interpretation,” the bench said.

NEW DELHI: The Budget session of Parliament resumed on a stormy note on Monday as the opposition protested against the Delhi riots and demanded the resignation of home minister Amit Shah , with pushing and shoving between BJP and Congress MPs marking proceedings in the Lok Sabha .The Lok Sabha saw Congress MP Ramya Haridas alleging that she was hit by BJP member Jaskaur Meena, with the latter responding with similar claims against Haridas. The House, adjourned till afternoon following an obituary reference for JD(U) MP Baidyanath Prasad Mahato , saw Congress MPs troop into the well, raising slogans and demanding Amit Shah’s resignation.Adjournment notices were moved by Congress seeking discussion and a House probe into Delhi communal clashes.The Rajya Sabha, too, failed to transact much business amid protests by the opposition. Proceedings were adjourned till 2pm after the entire opposition protested, with Leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad accusing the Centre of “sleeping” for three days when violence was rocking Delhi.When the Lok Sabha tried to execute work, initiating a discussion on ‘vivaad se vishwas bill’, it saw raucous scenes with Congress and allies camping in the well holding placards and raising slogans. Big black banners saying ‘Amit Shah must quit’ were displayed by MPs.An angry parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi slammed Congress’s “unruly behaviour”. “They murdered 3,000 people in 1984 (riots) and did no probe. The priority is to restore peace (in Delhi) but they want to create tension,” he said. BJP MPs later said that the Congress tactic of pushing towards BJP benches was provocative and could lead to showdowns as this was becoming a trend.As Speaker Om Birla continued to run the House and BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal was speaking on the bill, Congress MPs Gaurav Gogoi and Gurjit Singh Aujla went to the treasury side. BJP members demanded that they go back, resulting in scuffles and virtual bedlam.Haridas took her complaint to Birla. Sources said she broke down in the chamber and asked if it was repeatedly happening to her because she was “a Dalit and a woman”, visibly unsettling Birla. Haridas had made a complaint in the winter session also, following a clash.It was such a polarised confrontation on Monday that treasury and opposition members stayed in the House even after adjournments, raising slogans and pointing fingers.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74449409,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-499159,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliament-stalled-as-mps-clash-over-delhi-riots/articleshow/74449407.cms

30,['3/03/2020'],"Sara Pilot, Iltija Mufti pleas to be heard on March 5","Sara Pilot (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Jammu and Kashmir administration told the Supreme Court on Monday that Sara Pilot must move the high court to challenge her brother and former CM Omar Abdullah ’s detention under the Public Safety Act. The SC should not entertain habeas corpus petitions when the HC was adjudicating challenges to various preventive detention orders, it said.

The bench, however, said it was a matter of liberty and recalled that another petition by Iltija Mufti challenging the detention of her mother, ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti , was also pending. Though it was to be heard on March 18, the bench will now hear both on March 5.

‘HC has nixed 68 Jammu and Kashmir detentions so far, upheld 11’

Attorney general K K Venugopal told a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee that the high court had been adjudicating petitions challenging preventive detention orders since August 2019, when J&K’s special status was scrapped.

“The high court is seized of more than 350 habeas corpus petitions challenging detention orders. The HC has quashed 68 detention orders since August 2019 while confirming 11 detention orders. Petitioner (Sara) has failed to disclose a reason for not moving the HC,” Venugopal said. The J&K government, in its reply affidavit, said the February 5 order detaining Omar Abdullah under PSA was confirmed by the advisory board on February 24. “Omar Abdullah was and continues to be detained in conformity with the mandatory provisions of PSA and is kept in Hari Niwas , which has been temporarily declared a subsidiary jail,” it said.

Sara claimed that since her brother was in detention since August 5, there could not have been any fresh material on his activities to warrant a fresh order for his further detention under PSA. In response, the government said, “This assertion is fallacious and ignores that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the grounds of detention and the dossier clearly indicate that there exists a live and proximate link in the events that occurred in the past, the activities of the detenu and the possibility of such activities being prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.”

It further added, “The acts, which are easily available in public domain, on the detenu’s part squarely fell within the realm of public order, as it was calculated to disturb public peace and tranquillity. It is needless to emphasise that the incitement of the public at large pertains to public order.”

31,['3/03/2020'],"Make in India: Government plans Rs 42,000 crore Make in India boost for mobile phones","Scheme aimed at making India a hub

NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest incentive schemes to boost domestic manufacturing of mobile phones and their components, the government has worked out a production-linked incentive (PLI) package of nearly Rs 42,000 crore for those making in India, planning to offer a benefit of 4-6% on incremental sales (of goods manufactured locally) for a period of five years.Companies making and selling high-end devices, such as iPhone from Apple and the Galaxy S and Note Series by Samsung, would be the biggest beneficiaries, as would some homegrown players like Lava, Karbonn, Micromax, and Intex.The scheme -- which will be rolled out by the IT ministry and has been prepared in consultation with the ministries of finance and commerce as well as the Niti Aayog -- is aimed at making India a hub for manufacturing of electronics and components, standing parallel to other manufacturing powerhouses such as China and Vietnam, highly-placed sources told TOI.“The electronics hardware manufacturing sector faces the lack of a level-playing field vis-à-vis competing nations… (and) suffers from a disability of 8.5% to 11% on account of lack of adequate infrastructure, domestic supply chain and logistics; high cost of finance; inadequate availability of quality power; limited design capabilities and focus on R&D by the industry; and inadequacies in skill development,” a source in the IT ministry said, while making a case for the booster.The government plans to offer incentives under the scheme to large contract manufacturers (as defined in the FDI policy circular of 2017) on sale of phones above the invoice value of $200 (a little over Rs 14,000). Those to benefit will include global contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, Flex and Wistron, all of whom are making products in India. However, some companies such as Oppo, Vivo and even Samsung are not too happy as the incentive is for devices with ex-factory price of above $200, and the majority of phones sold by them are below this cost.The other group to benefit will be “domestic companies”, defined as those “owned by resident Indian citizens”, again as defined in the FDI policy circular of 2017. These include entities such as Karbonn, Lava and Micromax, which are currently struggling but may benefit from the booster. “A company is considered as ‘owned’ by resident Indian citizens if more than 50% of the capital in it is beneficially owned by resident Indian citizens and/or Indian companies, which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens,” an official said.The government wants to cut the ballooning bill of electronics imports. It hopes that incentives through the scheme will help create incremental production of Rs 8.2 lakh crore worth of mobile phones and their parts, generate exports of Rs 5.8 lakh crore, while creating 2 lakh fresh jobs and contributing Rs 4,782 crore to the exchequer through direct tax revenue.“The total cost of the scheme is envisaged at Rs 41,795 crore and it will be initially available for approval of new applications for a period of three months. This will be a centrally-sponsored package and will not have an overlap with any existing schemes in electronics manufacturing,” one of the source said, adding, “India will be well-positioned as a global hub for electronics system design and manufacturing (ESDM) on account of integration with global value chains, becoming a destination for mobile phones exports.”As per the plan, the scheme will extend an incentive of 4% to 6% on incremental sales achieved in 2019-20, that would act as the base year. While the majority of funds would be disbursed towards manufacturing of mobiles phones, it will also cover making of specific electronic components and also ATMP units (assembly, testing, marketing and packaging) which are seen as a precursor for setting up an eco-system for semiconductors. The components covered will include SMT (surface-mounted technology), devices for semiconductor, PCB (printed circuit boards), and sensors and micro/nano-electronic components.The official note said that the package was necessary considering the imminent withdrawal of the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and the limited relief provided under the proposed Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) scheme. “A high-level committee, chaired by CEO Niti Aayog and comprising of secretaries of Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Commerce , Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and IT has recommended for focus on mobile manufacturing.”The total incentive planned to be given in the first year is around Rs 4,030 crore, in second Rs 6,395 crore, in third Rs 8,760 crore, in fourth Rs 11,790 crore and in fifth Rs 10,820 crore. “With the demand for electronics hardware expected to rise rapidly to approximately $400 billion (approximately Rs 26 lakh crore) by 2025, India cannot afford to bear the rapidly increasing foreign exchange outgo on account of electronics imports,” the IT ministry said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74449442,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-315417,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-plans-rs-42000-crore-make-in-india-boost-for-mobile-phones/articleshow/74449439.cms

NEW DELHI: As many as 95 MPs did not attend a single meeting of the eight department-related parliamentary standing committees ( DRSCs ) that reviewed allocations for 18 ministries after the presentation of the Budget on February 1, Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu said on Monday.Reviewing the functioning of the eight DRSCs handled by the RS secretariat, which have 244 members (166 from the Lok Sabha and 78 from the Rajya Sabha), Naidu said they held 20 meetings during the three-week parliamentary recess. The highest attendance was recorded in the meetings of the committee on health and family welfare (65.5%), while the lowest attendance was in the DRSC dealing in commerce (32.3%). The DRSC on home was a close second with an attendance of 54.8%, while the DRSC on industry saw attendance of 43.55%.BJP, with a strength of 110 MPs out of the 244 who constitute members of the department-related parliamentary standing committees (DRSCs), had a total attendance of 58% against Congress’ 62% attendance with just 32 MPs. Smaller regional parties, which account for the remainder members, had a cumulative attendance of 40%.The RS has DRSCs dealing with commerce, health & family welfare, home affairs, HRD, industry, personnel, public grievances and law & justice, S&T and environment, and transport, tourism and culture. RS chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu said, “In all, the work put in by the 24 DRSCs in examining the demands for grants of all ministries equals 30 days of functioning of Parliament, which is quite significant. This alone takes the total sittings of Parliament during a year to over 100 days. I would like to assure people and all stakeholders that Parliament is meeting for sufficient time every year in discharge of its functions.”But Naidu expressed disappointment that 95 (78 from the LS and 23 from the RS) of the 244 members in the eight DRSCs with the Upper House had “zero attendance” this time as compared to only 28 last time.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74449473,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-815377,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/95-mps-didnt-attend-single-panel-meeting/articleshow/74449474.cms

35,['3/03/2020'],"Can’t check politicians' spend, EC against state funding of polls","The Election Commission is not in favour of state funding of elections (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission is not in favour of state funding of elections as it will not be able to prohibit or check candidates’ own expenditure over and above that provided by the state, the government told the Lok Sabha on Monday.

In written reply, minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur said EC ’s view is that for addressing the real issues relating to political funding and need for complete transparency, there must be radical changes in the provisions relating to receipt of funds by political parties and the manner in which such funds are spent. “The Election Commission has informed the Government that it is not in favour of state funding as it will not be able to prohibit or check candidates own expenditure or expenditure by others over and above that which is provided for by the state,” the minister stated.

While the Indrajit Gupta panel had in 1998 justified state funding of elections, it recommended that this benefit be limited to recognised national and state parties. It also recommended that state funding be in kind in the short term. In fact, EC did accept this by allowing airtime to recognised national and state parties for campaigning on state media.

The Law Commission report in 1999 said state funding of elections was “desirable” provided that political parties are prohibited from taking funds from other sources. Thakur on Monday told the Lok Sabha that that the government, to discourage cash transactions and bring in transparency in the source of funding of political parties, had amended the Income Tax Act and limited anonymous cash donations to Rs 2,000.

He also pointed out that the government had introduced the ‘Electoral Bond Scheme 2018’ to establish a transparent political funding system in the country, with well-established audit trail.

36,['3/03/2020'],"NRC India’s internal matter, won’t affect Bangladesh: Harsh Shringla","Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise is “a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there will be no implications for the government and people of Bangladesh. You have our assurance on that count,” foreign secretary Harsh Shringla told a high-powered audience in Dhaka on Monday, addressing the cause of a lot of disquiet in Bangladesh.

Shringla is the senior-most Indian official to visit Bangladesh after the CAA-NRC controversy broke out here, which saw Bangladesh cancelling the visits of foreign minister A K Abdul Momen and home minister Asaduzzaman Khan to India late last year.

In his first visit as foreign secretary, Shringla met PM Sheikh Hasina where they discussed bilateral ties and preparations for PM Modi’s visit to Dhaka later this month. The foreign secretary also met his counterpart Masud Bin Mamun and Obaidul Qadir , minister for transport and Awami League secretary general.

Shringla also offered to sell all military hardware made in India to Bangladesh. “We believe that our ongoing efforts to develop a robust ties between our militaries emphasises trust of a high order. Especially since we are willing to share with you any and all military hardware being manufactured in India for use by our military. We also welcome the opportunity for our officers to train at your top military institutions, just as we are ready to open military training institutes at all levels — from officer cadet training to specialised higher command training — to Bangladesh.” India has already offered a $500 million defence cooperation assistance to Bangladesh.

Asserting that India wanted the “closest possible ties with Bangladesh” Shringla said, “it is entirely in India’s interest to fully support your own efforts to build a strong, prosperous, progressive, peaceful and harmonious Bangladesh; to build a nation that stays true to the extraordinarily inclusive vision of Bangabandhu.”

Gowher Rizvi, Sheikh Hasina’s adviser said at the same conference, that Dhaka does not like to see any situation in India that could affect Bangladesh’s secular social fabric. “Our commitment to secularism is absolutely central and we do not want to see any situation where our secularism will be threatened anyway,” he said. Describing India’s NRC as a “burning issue”, Rizvi said, minorities in Bangladesh were “absolutely equal citizens” with the government attaching the highest priority in protecting and addressing their rights and issues.

PATNA: Patna police would seek assistance from the economic offences unit (EOU) for confiscating all movable and immovable properties amassed by the drug peddlers by selling brown sugar in the state capital.

One Sudama Kumar (24) was arrested from a rented accommodation on road number three of Postal Park under Jakkanpur police station area on Thursday night. two kilograms of brown sugar worth around Rs4 crore in international market was seized from his possession.

Jakkanpur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Verma said Sudama operated at least three bank accounts of which one is in his wife’s name. “Police would get details of the amount deposited in those bank accounts after which further required action would be taken. Police will also consult EOU for getting the properties attached under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA),” he said.

Verma said a team of EOU and Crime Investigation Department (CID) had sought details of the older cases of the drug smugglers when five of them with 300gm of brown sugar were arrested in September last year before the mastermind Bhabhi Ji alias Radha Devi and her husband Guddu were nabbed from their residence in Gardanibagh in October with 200gm of brown sugar, Rs5 lakh and passbooks of several bank accounts.

“More than Rs50 lakh is lying in the bank accounts of Radha and Guddu. The accounts have been freezed,” he said adding she owns a couple of houses too.

SHO Verma said Sudama was a SUV driver and he purchased an SUV four months back. “It has yet not been seized. Source of money used to purchase that SUV would be investigated before taking required legal action,” he said. Verma also said police were awaiting call detail records of two cellphones seized from Sudama to know about the Beur jail inmates he was in contact with and seeking directions from for drug supply.

“He has also named at least three more drug peddlers,” SHO said.

Verma said if necessary, Sudama’s gang member Abhimanyu alias Mannu would be taken on remand for interrogation. Mannu had surrendered last year after police had seized his SUV from Pirbahore with brown sugar last year.

39,['3/03/2020'],Bihar: Cops’ arrest exposes nexus with criminals,"Representative image

PATNA: Crime and policing go hand in hand in the state these days. This seems true if the arrest of three police constables from Vaishali district on Sunday in connection with a kidnapping case is taken into account.

Anil Kumar Manjhi, Anil Kumar Pandey and Himanshu Raj — all constables, who patrolled different lanes and bylanes of the district headquarters town in Hajipur, were arrested for their involvement in the kidnapping of one Shivpujan Singh on January 29.

Besides, the three cops, a home guard jawan, Monu Kumar, and three criminals were also arrested. After Shivpujan’s kidnappers demanded Rs 1 lakh as ransom from his family, his wife, Khushboo Kumari, lodged a case with the Hajipur sadar police station on January 29.

Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla said, “We not only rescued the captive from the clutches of his kidnappers, but also exposed the police-criminal nexus. We recovered the service revolver of constable, Manjhi, from the house of one of the kidnappers, Sujeet Kumar alias Santu, in Katra locality under the Hajipur town police station area.”

The SP added, “The three erring cops were immediately put under suspension and departmental proceedings initiated against them while the contract of service of arrested home guard jawan was terminated.”

The arrested cops’ accomplices were identified as Neeraj Kumar, Amit Kumar and Sujeet Kumar, all residents of Vaishali district. While Manjhi and Pandey belong to Saran district, Raj is a native of Bhojpur district.

If sources are to be believed this is not an isolated case. Police personnel have been accused of kidnapping people and plotting the murder of someone or bank robberies on earlier occasions.

Constable Sanjeev Singh alias Pappu Singh of Saran district, for instance, was arrested on the charges of hatching the conspiracy of at least 12 robberies in banks. He was also involved in the loot of Rs 1.25 crore from a cash van in Saran district in 2013 and dismissed from service. He was earlier deputed as the bodyguard of a DSP-rank officer at Biharsharif in Nalanda district.

Similarly, Amresh Sharma, a constable posted in Begusarai district, was arrested and sent to jail on the charges of plotting the murder of a woman, Sarita Devi, and and her daughter, Monika, at a village in Jehanabad district in 2015.

The discerning trend has, however, embarrassed the top police officials. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, “Every department has some black sheep and ours is no exception. What is important is that they are getting punished for the offence.”

Bihar Police Association (BPA) president Mritunjay Kumar Singh also admitted that some men in uniform were involved in unlawful activities. “But it does not mean that the entire department is to be blamed and castigated,” he added.

The guidelines have been framed by a six-member committee constituted by the chancellor in the light of the Patna high court order dated May 4, 2018. The committee consisted of Magadh University vice-chancellor Rajendra Prasad, Patliputra University VC Gulab Chand Ram Jayaswal, Munger University VC Ranjit Kumar Verma, Raj Bhavan law officer R V S Parmar, education department special secretary Satish Chandra Jha and higher education director Rekha Kumari.

The guidelines state that an institution must have at least one acre of land in rural area and 0.75 acre of land in urban area for getting permission for starting either of these (BCA or BBA) courses. The land area should be commensurate to the built-up area requirements and sufficient to provide common amenities and infrastructure, including toilets, common room, library, play space, either exclusively or inclusively.

The institution is required to submit the sanctioned and approved building plan from the competent authority considering the total built-up area as required to run the programmes. The institution is also required to submit completion certificate stating that the buildings are fully developed and ready in all respects for the intended use.

The guidelines prescribe a minimum of carpet area of about 500 square metres for having nine rooms for academic purposes, including classrooms, tutorial classes, computer lab, seminar hall and library. Besides, a carpet area of about 425 square metres is required for amenities. The minimum faculty required for BCA or BBA course is four (in the rank of assistant professors) and there must be at least three supporting office and technical staff for each course. An institution seeking permission to start the course must have an endowment of Rs20 lakh for BCA and Rs10 lakh for BBA.

Besides, the guidelines also provide for implementation of skill development courses and schemes announced by ministry of human resource development, creation of institute-industry cell, placement cell and safety and security measures on the campus.

Hundreds of teachers working in different universities of the state have been awaiting their promotion under the provisions of the career advancement scheme (CAS) for the past several years.

In a letter written to the universities recently, UGC secretary Rajnish Jain stated that the UGC came to know that many eligible candidates face difficulties in getting promoted and having their past services counted. “Delay in promotion to those who have demonstrated satisfactory performance in service is not a practice consistent with the UGC (minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers and other academic staff in universities and colleges and measures for the maintenance of minimum standards in higher education) Regulations, 2018. The regulations have provisions for recruitment and promotion of faculty members under CAS and the same are mandatory in nature,” the letter said.

Expressing grave concern over the inordinate delay in promotion of teachers, Federation of University Teachers' Associations of Bihar (FUTAB) president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, pointed out that thousands of teachers around the country, including a sizeable number in Bihar, are waiting for their promotions for years under CAS and are eligible under other schemes prior to implementation of 2018 regulations. The number of such teachers denied their promotion is at least 300 in Veer Kunwar Singh University. While a few teachers of Magadh University have been accorded promotion, many others are still waiting for that. Not a single teacher in Munger, Purnea and Patliputra universities have been promoted under CAS, they said.

All India Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisations of Bihar general secretary Arun Kumar observed that the UGC has been compelled to issue such directions to the universities in view of the ongoing teachers’ agitation in different universities. Recently, Punjab University Teachers’ Association staged a protest outside the vice-chancellor’s office as interview dates were not being finalized for clearing the backlog of promotions under CAS.

Delhi University has also got a huge backlog of promotions with some waiting for more than a decade, he added.

There are presently six hostels at NMCH which accommodate 372 boys and 243 girls. However, with the rise in number of students in both undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses in the recent years, the government decided to construct a new 800-bed hostel at NMCH and sanctioned Rs 91 crore for the purpose.

Dr Gupta said the new hostel would have 400 beds each for UG and PG classes with separate rooms for boys and girls. A centralised outdoor for patients in a six-storey building at NMCH is also under state government’s consideration.

Dr Gupta said presently the patients have to visit outdoor units of different departments like medicine, orthopaedics and paediatrics. “After the opening of centralised outdoor service, it will be easier for patients to seek medical advice. It will be attached to the pathological investigation wing so that patients, if advised for some tests, may get it done in the nearby department,” Dr Gupta added.

Replying to the calling attention motion by BJP MLC Rajan Kumar Singh in the legislative council on Monday, state building construction minister Ashok Choudhary said in a department resolution dated June 19, 2008, the government had approved fixed allowance to the elected representatives and that included daily and travel allowances.

Choudhary also said that later in 2015-16, all the allowances were consolidated and elected representatives were then given per month allowance effective from May 2015. Accordingly, a zila parishad head gets monthly Rs12,000, panchayat samiti pramukh Rs10,000, up-pramukh Rs5000, gram panchayat mukhiya Rs2,500, up-mukhiya Rs12,00, gram kachahri sarpanch Rs2,500 and up-sarpanch Rs12,00. On the other hand, zila parishad members are given monthly Rs2,500, panchayat samiti members Rs1000 and panchayat and gram kachahri members Rs500 each.

However, the members said the allowance amount was meagre and demanded increase in it. “Now it is 2020 and we request the government to hike their allowances,” said BJP MLC Rajnish Kumar. JD (U) MLCs Suman Kumar and Reena Devi also pressed for immediate increase in the allowances being given to the elected panchayat representatives. “What can a person do in Rs500. An elected representative meet many people. He will not be able to meet the expenditure of even tea which he serves to his visitors,” said Suman and Reena. “While we are getting in lakhs, their salary is too meagre,” they said.

Even RJD MLC Subodh Kumar demanded increase in the allowances as per the inflation.

44,['3/03/2020'],"Soft raw material prices spell hope, corona may play spoiler for Motown","Chennai: In the middle of the slowdown plaguing the auto industry, falling of raw material prices have been a silver lining.

Prices of steel, aluminium, copper have been soft, allowing auto and ancillary companies to improve their margins by 30 basis points (100 basis points =1%) to an average of 12%.

“All of last year commodities have been very benign. Steel went down by around 15% in the last 12 months, aluminium and copper were down by 10%-15% and lead too is down though not so soft. Every company has benefited from soft commodity prices which has helped in managing the bottomline during the slowdown,” said the chief procurement officer of a parts to passenger vehicle conglomerate.

Overall performance of the sector would have been much worse in Q3 if not for soft commodity prices. In its recent report, brokerage firm Emkay says, overall auto companies saw Q3 revenues declining 5% YoY even though volumes were down 39% lower YoY in domestic medium and heavy commercial vehicles, 15% in two-wheelers, 6% in tractors and 1% in cars and SUVs. “Aggregate EBITDA margins expanded by 30bps YoY to 12% due to softening commodity prices (lower steel, aluminum, copper, rubber and crude prices) and cost-reduction efforts. Margins saw an expansion, after seeing a contraction for five quarters,” said the report.

The raw material elbow room is significant particularly in the case of core inputs like steel.

“Almost 65%-70% of the cost of a vehicle is bought out parts. Steel, copper, aluminium—globally these prices have been soft for a while and auto companies have benefited from that and been able to get better costing for their components even as they spend more on the marketing side during the slowdown,” said automotive consultant Rakesh Batra. A compact car for instance requires anywhere between 500-800 kg of steel so a drop in prices is a major benefit. As for the impact of crude, it is mostly “through the 15%-16% plastic component of the vehicle. But while these input costs are down, electronic costs have been going up, he added.

Of course the benefits from lower inputs costs are restricted to big volume players. For smaller players, the low sales could attract a penalty. “Raw material prices softening benefits those who have large volumes. For raw material sourcing there is a volume commitment and if that is not delivered a penalty clause kicks in,” said the head of a niche MNC car brand. Consultants feel however that this elbow room in raw material prices could disappear due to the value chain disruption on account of coronavirus. Consultants however feel that this elbow room in raw material prices could be at risk due to the value chain disruption on account of coronavirus.

“Till now steel and aluminium prices have been on a declining trend due to a slowdown in steel demand in China, a relatively flat global aluminium production and reduced capital infusion into capacity expansion in key markets. However most Indian auto companies source anywhere between 10%-30% of their components from China. Any “value chain disruption” on account of coronavirus for those companies with a significant exposure to China sourcing will result in an increase in input costs, which will have a negative impact on OEMs even in a relative stable raw material price regime,” said Vinay Raghunath, head-auto sector, E&Y.

Managing director and chief executive officer of Northern Arc Capital Kshama Fernandes said, “This transaction will allow corporates to access the securitisation market which has so far been mostly dominated by NBFCs. As part of the transaction, we have extended our own platform to non-financial entities as well.”

Invoice financing is one of the oldest financial products and has traditionally been dominated by banks and a few NBFCs. Under the transaction, discounted invoices that are raised to large anchors (buyers) by the vendors (suppliers) on the fintech’s platform are later assigned as invoice receivables to the securitisation trust.

Commenting on the benefits of transactions to investors, Kshama said, “The structure allows investors to take indirect short tenor exposure to corporates, which may not have typical borrowing requirements. This helps in diversification of their overall portfolio. Furthermore, since the anchors are non-financial entities, the exposure doesn’t not come under NBFC limits for the investors.”

However, the story does not end here.With CoV scare all over, the tourism industry in Bodh Gaya has been severely hit.“Chief minister Nitish Kumar has been making efforts to promote Bodh Gaya as a key tourist destination. Hence, any drop in the footfall of foreign tourists can adversely affect the local businesses,” Nagar Vikas Manch president Suresh Singh told this newspaper.The tourist season officially ends in Bodh Gaya in March. Hospitality sector expert, Arun Kumar Ojha, claimed that the tourist inflow in February this year registered a nearly 50% decline compared to the same period in 2019.“Several tourist groups, which were set to visit Bodh Gaya, have got their bookings cancelled now. The tourism sector has, anyway, witnessed a slowdown in recent years on account of two terrorist attacks, prohibition and general recession. Hence, the CoV has added to the woes of Bodh Gaya’s businessmen,” said Ojha.Asked about the impact of the advisories issued by several countries to its nationals, deeming India an unsafe travel destination due to the ongoing anti-CAA protests, Ojha pointed out, “Such advisories have not been issued by countries like Thailand, Myanmar, Korea, Japan and Sri Lanka from where most tourists come to Bodh Gaya.”Activist, Motibhai, said, “Quality infrastructure is required for the healthy growth of the tourism industry. Going by the average profile of the visitors, it can be said that most of them fall in the low-budget category.”“On account of factors like poor air connectivity, lack of good hotels, quality roads and recreational facilities, high-end tourists, who would otherwise have visited Bodh Gaya, do not put the place high on their itinerary,” the activist added.According to sources, the four-laning of NH-83 is now in limbo.

Rajkot: In a brutal case of honour killing , a 19-year-old woman in Gandhidham town of Kutch was murdered allegedly by her parents and brother who were bitterly against with her relationship with a Dalit man.

While the crime happened on February 28, the police arrested the woman Bharti’s father Ramesh Rajgor (42), mother Rashmi (40) and her brother Manish (21) late on Sunday night. They had allegedly strangled her to death and try to show it as a suicide by hanging her with the ceiling hook.

“Bharti’s mother Rashmi sat on her chest and smothered her face with a pillow, while Manish grabbed her hands. After she died, her father and brother hanged the body from the ceiling of her room to show that she had committed suicide,” said P A Chawda, sub-inspector with Gandhidham A division police station.

However, the postmortem report revealed that she had been smothered and strangled. “There was no outsider at their home when she was murdered. Moreover, Manish had even clicked her photographs hanging and showed the doctor. This raised suspicion on the family members,” said Chawda.

“When we interrogated family members, they broke down and confessed to their crime. They said they were against Bharti’s relationship with a Dalit youth whom she wanted to marry,” the officer added.

Ramesh has a tea stall in Gandhidham while Manish worked with a private firm there.

Bharti and her lover Manoj Vaghela were colleagues in a unit in Kandla Free Trade Zone a year ago. However, when her family members got to know about their affair, they forced Bharti to discontinue the job. There were frequent quarrels between Bharti and her parents and brother over her affair as she was adamant on marrying Vaghela.

“On the night of February 28, there was a bitter argument and fight over the same issue and all three of them killed her,” added Chawda.

PATNA: Former JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor on Monday criticized Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for not “saying a word on the Delhi violence” in his 100-minute speech during the party’s state-level “Karyakarta Sammelan” at Gandhi Maidan here on Sunday.

“It was bad on his (Nitish) part not to say a word on Delhi violence ,” Kishor said in a tweet.

The election strategist, who was expelled from JD(U) in January after his differences with the leadership over CAA/ NRC/ NPR, was referring to last week’s communal violence in north-east Delhi in which at least 42 people were killed and around 200 sustained injuries.

In the same tweet, Kishor also took a dig at the JD(U) chief for the less-than-claimed turnout at the party convention addressed by Nitish at Gandhi maidan. Many JD(U) leaders, including its state president Bashishtha Narain Singh, had earlier claimed that more than 2 lakh booth-level workers would attend the Sammelan. However, the turnout was not as per the claim.

“While addressing a ‘bhaari bheed’ of JD(U) workers, Nitish Kumar claimed to win more than 200 seats (out of total 243 in Bihar assembly) but did not explain as to why despite 15 years of his ‘sushasan’ (good governance), Bihar continues to be the most poor and backward state in the country,” Kishor said in Hindi in the same tweet.

Nitish had on Sunday told party workers, “The NDA is united in Bihar, let us resolve to ensure NDA’s victory with more than 200 seats in the forthcoming assembly polls.”

Several opposition leaders on Sunday shared photographs of ‘empty’ Gandhi Maidan, on social media platforms, to prove their claim that the total turnout at the JD(U) event was “very unimpressive”. Even some JD(U) leaders admitted in private that the turnout was “much less” than the expectation of senior party leaders.

“The Gandhi Maidan event was a test case for Nitish Kumar and his party. They failed miserably. JD(U) will end up finishing third in terms of seat tally when the assembly polls are held in the next few months,” Leader of Opposition in the council and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi told media persons outside the legislative council building on Monday.

KOCHI: The high court on Monday asked the CBSE to inform whether any student from any unrecognized school was allowed to appear for Class X board exams this year.

A division bench comprising Justice A M Shaffique and Justice V G Arun issued the directive after considering an appeal filed by 28 students of Arooja’s Little Stars School through advocate T Sanjay. The students have challenged a single bench’s decision not to allow them to appear for the ongoing Class X board exams.

During Monday’s hearing, the court said the students could be entitled for compensation if it is found that students from other unrecognized schools have been allowed to appear for the board exams.

At the hearing, the court asked CBSE’s counsel whether the practice of allowing students from unrecognized schools to appear for board exams through recognized schools exists. The counsel submitted that no such practice exists since 2018. The court again asked whether such a practice exists. The counsel replied that it has not happened with the CBSE’s knowledge.

CBSE’s counsel also submitted that Arooja’s school did not have registration since 2012. Stating that exams for Class IX and X are linked, the counsel said only students who register during Class IX through a recognized school are allowed to appear for board exams at Class X.

The appeal filed by the students of Arooja’s school had stated that though they had registered through SDPY school at Kannamali, the school management withdrew at the last minute. The appeal also said Leo Public School was willing to allow the students of Arooja’s school to appear for board exams there.

However, CBSE has informed the court that names of students of Arooja’s school got included in the list submitted by SDPY school wrongly and that it had received a letter from SDPY school stating this. The court will consider the case again on Tuesday.

However, the actual expenditure during the 2019-20 financial year would remain at Rs2.01 lakh crore, as the supplementary budgets contained amounts drawn from state contingency fund and the non-budgeted amount in the past for which the approval of the House for their appropriation had not been taken, Modi said, adding the appropriation for the third supplementary budget amount is in the nature of seeking the approval of the House.

Earlier, the House debate was conducted on the Rs144.47 crore of the rural development department (RDD) contained in the third supplementary budget against which senior RJD member Ramdeo Rai had moved the cut motion. The House passed it by voice vote, even as all the opposition members, excluding Rai, walked out of the House maintaining that they were not convinced by the government’s reply.

In his reply, RDD minister said the department had taken up work under three “exceptional” schemes and projects like CM’s homestead land purchase scheme, CM Gramin Awas Yojana and on the opening of Development Management Institute that is coming up near Bihta with an overall expenditure of Rs250 crore.

Minister Shrawan Kumar said DMI would produce skilled and fully trained professionals having deep and detailed knowledge of development work to make proper area-specific interventions to bring about socio-economic changes by helping in the execution of development activities.

He said Rs4.21 crore had already been distributed at the rate of Rs60,000 per homeless family to purchase land to build house under the CM’s homestead land purchase scheme. As to the 2019-20 fiscal, Rs50 crore had been allotted and 702 beneficiaries had been identified under the scheme. Their houses were being constructed under the PM Awas Yojana.

With respect to the CM Gramin Awas Yojana, the minister said the houses of scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and freed bonded labourers were being renovated, as they had been constructed during the 1985-96 period under Jawahar Rojgar Yojana and had become old and not worth living in. For this, Rs1.20 lakh would be given to each of the identified beneficiaries under the CM Gramin Awas Yojana.

A similar work was also being done in the five blocks of Muzaffarpur district that had reported most affliction and deaths caused by Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES).

AURANGABAD: The civic administration has lodged a police complaint against the waste collection agency that it had appointed for collecting solid waste after it was found transporting construction debris, soil and biomedical waste.

On Saturday, corporators Raosaheb Amle (Mitmita), Asha Nikalje (Bhimnagar) and Subhash Shejwal (Padegaon) caught two trucks of the waste collection agency ‘P Gopinath Reddy’ dumping construction debris and murum at Padegaon waste site. The corporators had also caught a truck containing bio-medical waste, belonging to the same agency, at the same location.

Later, the trucks were brought to the head office of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). They were emptied and the materials were weighed separately. Two trucks contained large quantities of construction debris, stones and soil alongwith mixed waste. The civic body pays the agency per tonne of waste collected and transported.

On Sunday, the AMC filed two separate police complaints against the agency. In the complaint registered at Kranti Chowk police station, head of AMC’s solid waste management cell Nandkishore Bhombe sought registration of a criminal against the agency’s manager, zonal supervisor and the sanitation inspector hired through the contract under section 420 (cheating) of the IPC.

In another complaint submitted to Beghumpura police station, Bhombe stated that the agency was found to be transporting biomedical waste from Government Medical College and Hospital , for which a separate agency has been appointed. AMC has sought that offence be registered against the agency’s manager and a zonal officer under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC.

The civic body also sought that sections 8 and 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, section 18 of the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Trans boundary Movement) Rules, 2016, and section 8 of Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016, be slapped on the agency. The cases were not registered till Monday evening.

Speaking to TOI, chief manager of the waste collection agency Harshwardhan Reddy said that as per the tender, the agency was responsible for lifting waste collected and kept at dedicated points. “Our trucks collected the waste swept and accumulated at the fixed spot and were transporting it to Padegaon,” he said.

Reddy said that biomedical waste was to be stored in red and yellow bags. However, the waste collected by his staff was in black and green bags meant for mixed and biodegradable waste respectively.

KOLKATA: A citizens’ body will organize a rally on March 8 which will be attended by religious heads from all faiths who will walk to protest against the Delhi riots and the “goli maaro” slogan chanted during the BJP rally on Sunday.

A meeting was held on Sunday evening at the Archbishop’s house to decide what United Interfaith Foundation, India — the group that is organizing the rally — should do in the wake of the riots in Delhi. The meeting was chaired by Archbishop Thomas D’Souza and attended by spiritual heads of Islam, Hindu, Sikh, Protestant, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi faiths. They all said they would spread the word within their respective communities, urging members to join the walk and spread the message further.

Starting from Mother House on AJC Bose Road, the rallyists will walk towards Mullickbazar, move on to Park Street and walk towards the Chowringhee and Mayo Road crossing. It will end at the Gandhi statue, where an open-air prayer meet will be held for the victims of the riots and their families.

Those who will be seen walking on that day include Archbishop Thomas D’Souza of Roman Catholic faith, Bishop Paritosh Canning of the Church of North India, Bauddha Dharmankur Sabha's Bhikkhu Bodhipala, Jain monk Munni Mani Kumar Maharaj and Imam-e-Eidain Maulana Qari Fazlur Rahman. While Satnam Ahluwalia will represent the Sikhs at the rally, Sister Asmita will walk for the Brahmakumaris, Jews will be represented by Ian Zachariah and Parsees by Ervard Jimmy Taraporwalla.

“We will start walking at 10.30am. We wanted to keep it on a Sunday so we don’t inconvenience the office-hour traffic on a weekday. With 42 people killed and more than 200 injured in clashes between the pro- and anti-CAA groups, we thought that it is once again time for us to take to the streets,” said Ahluwalia, spokesperson of UIFI.

“During the Delhi riots, we saw how destructive the “Goli maaro” slogan can be. It was shocking to hear that on the streets of Kolkata. We will organize protests against such divisive issues. Intellectuals and religious leaders will walk in the March 8 rally,” said Maulana Abdur Rafiq, president, Jamaat-e-Islami-Hind ( West Bengal ).

KOLKATA: Students of Presidency University staged a demonstration and blocked College Street for 15 minutes on Monday evening to protest against the arrest of former student Souradeep Sengupta for his social media post on the violence in Delhi in Silchar last week. Sengupta, who was teaching in a college, deleted his post and uploaded a “clarification”. But the arrest raised several questions over how the BJP government in Assam was muzzling free speech.

The protesting students demanded immediate release of Sengupta. “He has been booked under non-bailable charges for a mere social media post. This is an indication of the sort of authoritarian regime we are under. Ordinary citizens can’t even express their anguish over the mindless violence unleashed in Delhi,” said a student.

Students protesting at the Eden Hindu Hostel, too, participated in Monday’s protest. “We appeal to the Bengal government to ensure his safety. His career may be adversely affected,” said another student.

61,['3/03/2020'],Recognition of PU’s MEd course restored,"PATNA: The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has restored the recognition of the MEd course run by Patna University (PU) from the current session. A decision to this effect was taken at a two-day meeting of the NCTE’s eastern region committee (ERC) at Bhubaneswar on Saturday and Sunday.

PU education department head Khagendra Kumar told this newspaper on Monday that the decision to withdraw the course’s derecognition was taken following an appeal made by PU for reconsideration of its previous decision in the light of facts and relevant documents. PU’s rejoinder clarified the objection raised by the NCTE with regard to the built-up area.

NCTE, at its meeting held on January 18 this year, had decided to withdraw its recognition on the ground that it did not have the required built-up area as per the council’s regulations. The regulations state that an institution running MEd course should have a built-up area of 2,500 square metres.

The council had pointed out that the built-up area is less than that prescribed as per Appendix-5 of NCTE, Regulations-2014 to run two units of BEd course and one unit of MEd course. PU, however, clarified that the BEd course is run separately in two different institutions — Patna Training College and Women’s Training College and the MEd course is run by the postgraduate department of education located in a separate building at Dariyapur on Bari Path. PU also submitted fresh documents and site plan of the total built-up area of the department.

Kumar assured that PU education department, with an intake of 50 students fulfils all other conditions, including required number of teachers, instructors, laboratory, library and other infrastructural facilities.

“PU education department is one of the oldest postgraduate departments in the country, serving the needs of teachers since 1954,” he said.

Varanasi: Services at the trauma centre of Banaras Hindu University were normalised on Monday morning after resident doctors called off their strike late Sunday night.

The doctors were agitating since February 29 against attack on their colleague at orthopedic ward of the centre.

Professor in charge of trauma centre (BHU) Dr Sanjeev Kumar Gupta said he, along with director of Institute of Medical Science (BHU) and chief proctor, held talks with resident doctors on late Sunday night.

“On the demand of arrest of all the accused, the chief proctor talked to senior police officers. Cops said the two accused still at large have been identified and efforts are on for their arrest,” he said. Resident doctors also demanded increase in the number of security personnel, covering all parts of trauma centre with CCTV network, installation of centralised public address system and inclusion of their representatives in the committee for monitoring security related exercises. “All their demands were accepted after which they agreed to call off their strike and restore healthcare services at the centre,” he said.

On February 28, Badri Vishal of Sonbhadra, student of a private management institute, and his accomplices had attacked resident doctors. An FIR was lodged at Lanka police station after which Vishal was arrested. However, junior doctors went on strike demanding arrest of all the accused and enhancing security at trauma centre.

64,['3/03/2020'],Manufacturers up in arms against govt over renewal of salt pan lease,"Rajkot: The salt manufactures in Gujarat are up in arms against the state government over procedure laid down for the renewal of salt pan leases and have threatened to halt supply of salt if their demands were not satisfied.

A Namak Satyagrah Samiti, comprising on members of the Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA), has been formed to deal with the issue. The decision to stop supply of salt to the domestic market will be taken during March 7 meeting of the samiti in Ahmedabad. There are over 1,200 salt pans in Kutch which are owned by 250 salt manufacturers.

Over 80% of salt manufactured in India comes from Gujarat, which produces 2 crore tonne of salt annually. Industry sources said that if the salt manufactures decide to halt supply, it could lead to severe shortage of the essential commodity in the domestic market.

The manufacturers have been demanding decentralization of salt pan lease renewal process since past one decade. But ISMA said that in its notification of February 28, the state government had failed to fulfil their demands.

According to ISMA, till 2011 the Kutch collector had powers to renew lease of salt pans up to 350 acres. But the state government changed it and reduced collector’s powers for renewal to 10 cares, for renewals and new lease the manufacturer had to approach the revenue department in Gandhinagar.

ISMA members had met with chief minister Vijay Rupani in August last year with their demands and how most of the manufactures had been forced to come to Gandhinagar for renewal. During the meeting, delegation of power of renewal up to 350 acres was discussed and also demand was raised for abolition of non-agriculture tax of 10 paise per sq m. The manufacturers said that they had got the assurance from the government that their demands will be consider.

But the new notification allows the collector renewal rights up to 100 acre, while the power of granting new leases rests with the revenue minister. For renewal above 100 acres it would require approval of the chief minister and for new leases the cabinet has give a nod.

The convener of Namak Satyagrah Samiti, Bachu Aahir said “We had asked government to decentralized the processed but the government has further centralized the entire process. The new notification will not help majority of the manufacturers. We have called an urgent meeting of our members to decide on giving ultimatum to the government and stop the supply.”

Besides this, Aahir said they were being compelled to obtain no objection certificate from the Border Security Force (BSF), fisheries department and others. “It’s not easy for a small manufacturer to obtain these certificate from all the agencies. As such these are not required under the policy.”

65,['3/03/2020'],AAI reserves land for international cargo terminal at Surat airport,"Surat: If all goes well , Diamond City may get international air cargo terminal for export of diamond and gold jewellery, textile fabrics , chemicals etc .

With the world’s largest Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) coming up at Diamond Research and Mercantile (DREAM) city at Khajod, Airports Authority of India (AAI) authorities have reserved space near the domestic cargo terminal for development of international cargo terminal.

Airport director Aman Saini told TOI, “We have made provision for international cargo terminal at the airport and reserved land near the domestic terminal. At present, we are analysing the demand for setting up of international cargo terminal. Proposal regarding this will be sent to higher authorities soon.”

Saini said the infrastructure to handle international cargo movement is ready with presence of customs department at the airport. The AAI is developing 23 parking bays for aircraft, which will be an added advantage.

Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) office-bearers have set up a help desk for promoting cargo business from Surat. In the last one month, inquiries related to international cargo have increased.

SGCCI president Ketan Desai said, “We have been generating inquiries for international cargo from South Gujarat. Majority of the inquiries are coming from diamond sector followed by chemical, horticulture and textiles. We have strongly recommended to the AAI to set up international cargo terminal at the airport.”

Desai added, “The SDB project at Khajod is likely to be completed by the end of 2020 and there will be huge requirement to directly export diamond and jewellery parcels from Surat. The chamber is in talks with a few private airlines for operating international flights to Dubai, Hong Kong and Thailand for tapping the huge potential of cargo movement from Surat.”

Surat Hira Bourse (SHB) chief executive officer KK Sharma told TOI, “It is our long-pending demand for international cargo terminal with adequate flights from the city. At present, we are exporting diamonds and jewellery via Mumbai.”

66,['3/03/2020'],‘Relentless’ I-T dept on spree to freeze bank a/cs for pending dues,"Nagpur: In what is being termed as a desperate move to mop up revenues before the fiscal ends, the income tax department has issued large-scale orders to freeze bank accounts of assesses for non-payment of dues.

Tax practitioners who have pointed out the development say that even if freezing bank accounts is part of the procedure, this year it is being implemented rather aggressively. Even small demands running up to a couple of lakh are not being spared, said chartered accountants contacted by TOI.

The department is liable to take action if the tax is not paid within a period of 30 days after the demand is raised.

Officials in the income tax department also confirmed the development, saying this year exceptionally high number of accounts have been attached. This is due to the pressure for increasing revenue collection before the budget, they said.

Apart from attachments, a number of recovery surveys are also being carried out by the taxmen, said a senior officer from the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) cadre. Internal reviews are being conducted on a daily basis with every officer having to report about the action taken, the source said.

Chartered accountant Kailash Jogani said the department should give the assesse a chance to be heard before the bank account is attached. “Rather attachment should be the last resort. However, this year the department is carrying out attachments in a blanket manner. Even the disputed cases where an application has been filed for securing a stay on the demand, are not being spared,” he said

“The manner in which the action is being taken denies the taxpayer of his basic rights. There is a case in Amravati in which the account of a person has been attached to recover the tax from a partnership firm that he has quit more than 10 years ago,” said Jogani.

Abhijeet Kelkar, former president of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said even cash credit accounts are being attached. These are not regular bank accounts but a loan facility for working capital needs.

Julfesh Shah, another chartered accountant, said the orders are being issued for all the tax dues pending as on 2018-19. “Action is being taken for the smallest of amount. Apart from regular income tax dues, bank accounts are being frozen even for recovering tax deducted at source (TDS) dues. The action has severely hampered the businesses as it has blocked the funds. The accounts are released only after a part payment is done with an undertaking to clear the dues before March end,” he said.

“There are huge dues towards the payment of penalty for late filing of TDS returns. The penalty was challenged in courts but a ruling was delivered in the department’s favour in 2013-14. All such dues pending since then are being recovered now,” he said.

No of companies raising seed capital dropped to 11 from 17 and the money raised also dropped from $13 million to $11 million. “The lag effect on early stage deals is far higher and going forward, there will be more of angels in the space then VCs.

68,['3/03/2020'],Urea cos to benefit from corona impact as gas prices register fall,"Chennai: The coronavirus epidemic could have a silver lining as well. Urea producers could benefit from the impact of coronavirus as gas prices plunge.

According to estimates a $1/mmbtu reduction in the pooled gas price, reduces the cost of urea production by around Rs 1,500-Rs 1600/MT which works out to a lower subsidy outgo for the government and lower working capital borrowings for companies. As per reserach firm ICRA’s analysis, impact of the coronavirus scare is expected to be soft despite the domestic industry importing a major portion of the raw materials for phosphatic fertilizers, mainly phosphoric acid and finished fertilizers (mainly DAP — 47% of total imports in FY2019) from China.

“The Hubei province is a major centre for production of phosphoric acid and phosphatic fertilisers. Even though the production is down in the province, the overall fertiliser market remains well supplied due to the build-up of inventories at the producer’s end in China as international prices remained weak. Thus, the international prices are not expected to be affected by the Chinese industry dynamics, unless the shutdown is extended towards the latter half of February. As for the Indian fertiliser industry, with the markets currently remaining well supplied and the fourth quarter of the financial year being an off-season period for the industry, the impact of the Chinese shutdown is expected to be muted. Also, the global urea markets have remained well supplied in the recent years with new capacities coming online in Africa, the Middle-East and Africa. With the downward trend in Chinese exports continuing for the last couple of years, the impact of the Chinese urea industry on the global market has reduced,” said K Ravichandran, group head & senior VP ICRA.

70,['3/03/2020'],Non-bailable charges against three for ‘Goli maaro’ chant,"Kolkata: The New Market police on Monday slapped stringent non-bailable sections against the three persons arrested for raising “Goli maaro” slogan in Esplanade the day before. Chief metropolitan magistrate Debanjan Sen denied bail to Surendra Kumar Tiwari and Pankaj Prasad, while Dhruba Basu (71) was granted bail due to his age. Late at night, cops detained two others for questioning.

Public prosecutor Abhijit Chattopadhyay argued that Section 153A IPC and Section 505 IPC are non-bailable offences. “These sections are slapped when anyone tries to promote enmity between different groups on grounds like religion, race or place of birth. This can be done through words, spoken or written. The accused persons tried to disturb law and order or create a riot-like situation through their words.”

Defence lawyer Subhajit Bal said, “The complainant is a hawker. The Esplanade area is relatively empty on a holiday when there is a rally in the city and it is quite surprising that there is a single hawker who lodged the complaint and that is being considered as the voice of the common people.” He argued that, so far, there is no proof that the accused had uttered “Goli maaro gaddaron ko”. Another defence lawyer, Sidhartha Roy, argued, “The rally was peaceful and the allegations against the accused are false. The non-bailable sections are attracted only when something has hurt the sentiment of a community.”

Lawyer Brojesh Jha said, “As of now, we have no plans to move higher courts for bail.”

New Market police said the arrests were made after CCTV footage and video evidence were analysed and people were identified. “Some persons allegedly shouted provocative slogans having the potential to disturb public tranquillity while going to attend a political rally on Sunday. A complaint was received at New Market PS and a specific case was registered. The footage of the procession was analysed and the persons shouting the provocative slogans were identified. Raids were held on Sunday night and Monday, and three of the identified persons were arrested. Two of them have been sent to police custody.

71,['3/03/2020'],Diamond City shows vision to eradicate blindness,"Surat: In May last year , 42-year-old businessman Vrajesh Shah suffered brain haemorrhage and he never recovered from it. Despite the tragedy, Vrajesh’s wife Vaishali and family members decided to give a new lease of life to seven people by donating his vital organs including eyes.

Vaishali and hundreds like her have helped Surat district top in collection of donated eyes in the state for the third consecutive year.

According to the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB) data, a total of 1,556 donated eyes were collected from Surat district in 2019, which was three times higher than the target given for the year. Over all, the state had set the target of collecting 6,500 donated eyes against which 4,997 were collected.

“Along with heart, liver, both kidneys, we also donated his two eyes. My husband’s organs helped seven people get new life,’’ Vaishali told TOI.

Surat had topped in Gujarat in 2017 and 2018 too by collecting 1,504 and 1,542 donated eyes respectively.

“Surat is leading from the front in eye donations because of the sustained awareness campaign carried out by doctors, community leaders and voluntary organizations. We have been active in eye donation campaigns since 1996,’’ said Dr. Praful Siroya, president, Lokdrishti Eye Bank, Surat.

Dr Siroya said, on average, their eye bank receives at least 1,300 calls for eye donation collections every year in the Surat city and district.

The eye bank has set up a real-time response system for eye collections from hospitals across the district, besides regular awareness programmes.

“NGOs working on eye donation awareness have done tremendous work and this reflects in the eye donations’ data of the district,’’ said Nilesh Mandlewala, founder of Donate Life, an NGO working to promote organ donations.

72,['3/03/2020'],Coca-Cola chief wants to double India biz in 5 yrs,"Mumbai: Coca-Cola India has become the fifth largest market for global beverage giant The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) after clocking one billion unit cases in sales in 2019. But TCCC chairman & CEO James Quincey has already set a new target for Coca-Cola India — to double the size of the business in five years.

The last time Quincey visited India, he talked about the company’s aspiration of the country becoming the fifth largest business, ahead of Japan. On Monday, at a press meet, Quincey said it took 21 years for Coca-Cola India to reach sales of a billion unit cases. The target of 2 billion unit cases, as and when achieved, should take India among the top four markets for TCCC. The top four markets for TCCC are US, Mexico, China and Brazil. “We see India as a super attractive market and we continue to invest, continue to build our business and jobs locally. And we’d like to see those growth rates continue. So our next objective is on the way to becoming the top four,” he said.

On the spread of coronavirus, Quincey said the epidemic has not affected the organisation’s supply chain in the short term.

“When we plan our supply chain, we build in buffers and contingencies around key ingredients for our products around the world. We are not foreseeing at this stage any significant supply chain challenges. If the virus spreads exponentially, globally, that would be a different issue. The part of the reason of the resilience of the cold system is all the Cokes in India are made in India and all the Cokes in China are made in China. So there’s a great degree of local business in the corporation. So no imminent problems,” he said.

Globally, as well as in India, Quincey said the sparkling beverage business continues to grow despite the slowdown. Commenting on the multinational’s outlook and the impact of the recent unrest in certain pockets and the Delhi riots, Quincey said any disruptions in the functioning of society can have some degree of impact on business. But, he said, “India is a vibrant democracy and all of us hope that things get resolved in an appropriately democratic manner. We see a lot of long-term potential in India.”

Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia president T Krishnakumar said the company is on track with its Rs 11,000-crore investment plan in fruit circular economy. The company, which started its low-sugar level journey with Thums Up and Maaza, is ensuring new products are formulated with lower sugar levels that meet the prescribed WHO guidelines.

73,['3/03/2020'],Best to go home and plead case: Delhi hardens stance,"Kolkata: The Polish post-graduate student at Jadavpur University and the Bangladeshi undergraduate student at Visva-Bharati have this week to learn about the outcome of their appeals against the “Leave India” order issued to them by Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) in Kolkata.

Kamil Siedcynski, the Polish Jadavpur University student, and Afsara Anika Meem, a Bangladeshi girl studying at V-B, have been issued the order for “improper conduct and violating visa norms” for allegedly participating in anti-CAA protests.

Kamil, who has appealed to the FRRO to pardon him and allow him to stay on in India till his final examinations were over, has also contacted the Polish embassy. But sources at Jadavpur University said Kamil was unsure if he would be able to stay on. On advice from his professors to keep a low profile, he even seemed unwilling to speak to the media.

Afsara had posted pictures of anti-CAA movement on social media, which was considered against visa norms. Siedcynski, who is yet to appear for his MA final examinations, has been accused of violating visa norms for taking part at a rally opposing the amended citizenship law on December 19 in central Kolkata. He, however, had said he went to take photographs. An official pointed out that there was prohibition on foreigners to take or distribute photographs, which might bring disrepute to India.

Afsara, who consulted lawyers to file an appeal in the Calcutta High Court, has apparently received hint that her appeal to the FRRO would not offer her any instant relief.

A senior home ministry official from Delhi said the two had very little chance of getting the sanction to stay back in India. Saying the two students should return home and file an appeal from there, he said, “They are liable to face prosecution if they ignore the FRRO deadline.”

Pointing out that foreigners found violating visa norms were immediately given marching orders, he said said the directives were very clear and that there was no point appealing against the FRRO order. “Anyone found violating a visa norm has to return to his/her country and then, file an appeal through the Indian high commission or embassy. A decision to issue fresh visa will be taken based on bilateral relationship, which is a dynamic matter,” he said. Told Afsara was planning to move the HC against the FRRO order, the official said it would not stand legal scrutiny. “As such sensitive matters are sole discretion of the Centre, only the ministry can take a decision,” he said.

A German student at IIT Madras, Jakob Lindenthal, who was doing his MSc in physics in an exchange programme, has recently been sent back home for his alleged involvement in the anti-CAA movement. Similarly, a Norwegian tourist, who had participated in an anti-CAA rally in Kochi, was given a marching order.

NEW DELHI: The New Delhi Municipal Council’s 135 avenue roads , which were last developed or beautified during the 2010 Commonwealth Games, may get a new look if a proposal of the horticulture department is accepted.

The plan includes reshaping focal points such as roundabouts, triangular parks, open point, segments and road dividers. It also proposes to install hanging baskets with seasonal plants on trees and pillars, and get succulent plants of the same size on side berms to give a symmetrical look to Lutyens’ Delhi.

“Focal points immediately grab tourists’ attention. For years they have the same look and almost similar types of seasonal flowers or saplings are planted,” said S Chellaiah, horticulture director of NDMC .

The baskets will be kept at uniform distances and at the eye-line level, at a height of seven-eight feet from the ground, so that people can see them easily while commuting. “These baskets will have seasonal flowers or long-lasting foliage to bring an unmatched elegance to the area,” he said.

NDMC also plans to replace grass with shrubs of at least half-metre height and give them ornamental shapes at places. “Pedestrians walk over the grass or vacant areas between side berms, minimising the scope of growth of plants. It won’t be possible to walk over shrubs,” Chellaiah said. Berms may also be redesigned to create space for greenery on either side of the roads.

Depending on the availability of space, the department has proposed to plant low-maintenance shade plants between footpaths and sidewalls.

To replace close to 100-year-old heritage trees in the next 10-15 years, NDMC is raising a second-generation of these plants on a 10-acre site provided by DDA near the Yamuna floodplain.

PATNA: With a view to curbing the menace of stray dogs on city roads, the Patna Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) is likely to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a Ghaziabad-based firm within a fortnight.

According to sources, the firm will catch stray dogs from all the 75 wards under the PMC and conduct sterilization, birth control and anti-rabies programmes.

“After carrying out sterilization and birth-control measures, the firm will take care of the male dogs for at least five days and the females for almost a week. They will then be left in the same locality from where they were caught,” a civic body official claimed.

PMC’s public relations officer (PRO) Harshita told this newspaper that the firm would spring into action after signing an MoU with the civic body in the next 10 days.

“The firm will keep a record of all the dogs that were trapped, sterilized and released. A 24-hour helpline number for reporting problems related to stray dogs will also be issued,” she said, adding that the firm would update all the information on a mobile app in order to maintain transparency.

The PMC will reportedly make all the necessary arrangements required by the firm for carrying out sterilization and birth-control measures.

Asked about similar attempts, which failed to materialize in the past, the PMC PRO replied, “Last year in March, we had selected a private firm for the purpose, but the bidding process could not be finalized. This time, we are making sure that the work is taken up on a priority basis,” Harshita said.

Meanwhile, residents, who face the menace of stray dogs on a daily basis, have hailed the PMC’s initiative.

“The population of stray dogs has increased considerably. They bark consistently, especially at night, and even attack people,” said Gopal Pandey, a resident of Gola Road.

77,['3/03/2020'],Railways proposes private trains on different routes from Bihar,"Representative image

PATNA: The Railway Board has started working on the blueprint as approved by the Niti Aayog to invite private passenger train operators in view of the proposal in Union Budget. Out of 150 private passenger trains proposed in the first phase, 15 of them have been identified to run on different routes from Bihar under the jurisdiction of East Central Railway (ECR).

According to a Board official, senior railway officials have been assigned the task to work out on the project and finalise the pre-bidding formalities to pave way for running high-speed private passenger trains in different zonal railways, including the ECR. Several private operators from abroad, including the US, Canada and France, have evinced interests in this project, he said, adding a few business tycoons in the country are also keen to compete at the pre-bidding stage with foreign operators.

According to sources, the 15 routes identified in Bihar to run private passenger trains are Darbhanga-Aannd Vihar (biweekly), Bhagalpur-Anand Vihar (weekly), Gaya-Anand Vihar (triweekly), Patna-New Delhi (daily), Darbhanga-Jogeshwari (weekly), Patliputra–Byappanahali, Bengaluru (five days a week), Katihar–Tilak Bridge (weekly), Kisanganj-Tilak Bridge (weekly), Barauni–Anand Vihar (biweekly), Patna–Howrah (daily), Chhapra-Anand Vihar (biweekly), Patna-Hadapsar, Pune (weekly), Patna-Udhna, Surat (weekly), Patna-Panvel, Mumbai (weekly) and Danapur-Indore (weekly), sources said.

Railways has fixed Rs668 per train kilometre as haulage charge, which includes terminal cost, traction, transportation, track maintenance, signalling and overheads cost. Besides, railways is likely to make an indicative investment of Rs22,500 crore for a period of 35 years for running about 150 private passenger trains on different zonal railway routes, a Board official said.

According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the new experiment is likely to boost railways’ economy as well as give much relief to people who are keen to travel fast by trains on the pattern of aeroplanes. Under the proposed terms and conditions, railways has fixed Rs25 lakh as compensation to each victim in an accident with a provision to pay compensation of Rs100 for late running of those trains by an hour and Rs 250 for late arrival of trains at the destination points by two hours, he said, adding private operators will pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh in case of passengers’ luggage lifting from the running coach during journey.

Meanwhile, experts told this newspaper that the haulage charge of Rs668 per kilometre is too low. In the long run, it will not benefit railways keeping in view the fact that the United Kingdom (UK) was forced to take over railways even after 20 years of its privatization, they said.

78,['3/03/2020'],"Gujarat: Lions establish supremacy near Chotila, kill leopard","Body of the leopard found in Chobari near Chotila on Monday

RAJKOT: Asiatic lions , who have ventured near Chotila in Surendranagar, have become fiercely protective about their new-found habitat. In a rare occurrence in Gujarat, a male lion killed a sub-adult leopard in Chobari grassland near Chotila on Monday morning. Two lions had ventured into this area just four months ago and are frequently spotted in the villages.

Pug marks of lion and marks of its nail were found near the leopard’s body,

Forest department officials and experts said the attack was clearly to establish supremacy over the territory. In wildlife, encounters between lions and leopards are common, but this is an extremely rare incident in Gujarat as no such killing of leopard has been reported from Gir sanctuary and the near-by districts in recent memory. Junagadh and Amreli have healthy population of lions and leopards both.

According to experts both carnivores compete for the same predator, but lion is a big predator. In many cases if leopard has hunted an animal and lion appeared it has to leave it for lion. It happens when co- predator are existing at the same place.

Talking to TOI, Sandeep Kumar deputy conservator of forest Morbi said, “In wildlife parlance, this phenomenon is called kleptoparasitism , where leopard leaves its hunted prey for the lion on spotting it.”

“The lion felt that the leopard was dominating on its territory and therefore killed it. This also indicates that lions are determined to make this are their new home and settle down permanently.

It’s possible that a lioness may also venture into this area,” he added. Priyvrat Gadhvi, member of state wildlife board said, “Interspecies relations among the big cat or carnivore is usually one of hostile and intolerance. Lions generally don’t get a chance to kill leopards as the latter avoids confrontation by fleeing quickly or climbing trees.

This one is an accidental encounter and lions don’t leave any opportunity to kill the leopard. The leopard also kills lion cubs if it gets a chance.”

The development authority should ensure that parks and services are properly maintained after renovation by deploying dedicated staff or hiring a private agency.

LUCKNOW: The open air gyms at the two most popular parks of the city — Janeshwar Mishra Park and Lohia Park, both in Gomtinagar — have become an epitome of poor health.The defunct and broken equipment have turned into a huge disappointment for morning and evening walkers who frequent these parks to inhale fresh air besides stretching their muscles.In a reality check at Janeshwar Mishra park, TOI found elliptical cross trainer, recumbent cycle, two-person parallel dip station and full bar exerciser lying broken. Not just the gym equipment, even most of the slides for children had jagged sharp edges, holes and broken ladders. Many of the swings, too, were in a bad state and looked they would fall apart any time.“I used to exercise on the cross trainer, but it has been out of order for the past few months. Now I just come to the park and leave after to doing some running and stretching,” said Vishal Jain.Vaishnavi Gupta, who brings her 7-year-old child to Janeshwar Mishra Park daily, said, “I keep a close watch because the metal swings are broken and slides have holes and sharp edges that could cause injury to children.”TOI found a similar state of open air gym equipment when it visited Lohia Park.

My friends and I used to come here for workout but we have now joined a gym as the equipment are defunct. We now come here only in the evening for running.”When TOI raised the issue with LDA — which is responsible for the maintenance of the two parks — it blamed the private company hired for installing and maintaining the open air gyms. “We had given contract to a private company for maintaining the gyms at both the parks.

80,['3/03/2020'],Oyo-backer Lightspeed eyes 3rd $300 million India fund,"(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Top Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lightspeed is on the road for its third India-focused fund, which is expected to mop up $250-300 million by the next quarter, according to three sources familiar with the development. The new fund comes soon after the firm has been able to complete record exits from unicorns like Oyo and Byju’s in the previous year, delivering cash returns of over $900 million between the two deals.

While Lightspeed had started informing limited partners (LPs), who are investors in PE and VC funds, about the new India fund last year, it kicked off fund-raising a few months ago. Though the fund’s size is yet to be decided, it is likely to be in the range of $250-300 million.

“They are unlikely to raise more than $300 million even though there is likely to be a demand given the portfolio and exits that it has recorded,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier. Lightspeed India’s managing partner Bejul Somaia declined to comment when contacted by TOI.

Lightspeed had been active in India since 2007, investing from its global fund in the country with early bets like TutorVista and Indian Energy Exchange, both of which it has successfully exited. The firm raised its maiden India fund in 2015 of $135 million, which was followed by a $175-million fund in 2018. It has also invested in some Indian portfolio companies through its global growth fund for larger funding rounds.

The plans for a larger India fund come at a time when Lightspeed has emerged as one of the hottest venture firms in India over the last couple of years. It booked one of the biggest paydays from SoftBank-backed hospitality major Oyo, making $800-850 million by selling a 9-10% stake. Lightspeed has invested a total $28 million in Oyo, backing the startup first in early 2014, making over 35 times returns on its investment already. It continues to hold around 4% stake.

The firm also quietly made a partial exit from Byju’s when the education technology startup raised funding from Qatar Investment Authority last year. Lightspeed is said to have made over $70-80 million from the partial exit, making over 8-9 times returns. Lightspeed’s other portfolio companies in India include Udaan , a B2B commerce platform valued at $2.8 billion, and vernacular social network ShareChat, which is backed by Twitter. It has also been an early backer of enterprise software startups like Innovaccer and DarwinBox .

In the US, Lightspeed is known for its early bet on messaging app Snap besides several enterprise software companies like AppDynamics, Guardant Health, Rubrik, Nutanix, and Mulesoft. Lightspeed’s new fund comes at a time when several other large new funds are also in the works, indicating that despite sobering sentiment around valuation, overall capital flow in startups is not expected to dramatically slow down.

TOI reported on January 24 that Sequoia is raising $1.3 billion for two new funds for India. Tiger Global Management, which was one of the most active investors in India in 2019, also closed a new $3.8-billion global fund. A recent report from Bain & Co said that dry powder available for investments in startups in India has reached a record high of $7 billion in 2019, from the previous high of $6.1 billion in 2018. The report added that India remains one of the most attractive emerging markets for venture capital among LPs, after Southeast Asia and China.

82,['3/03/2020'],Include Maithili in school curriculum in Bihar: Congress,"Former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi with her party and Congress Legislators

PATNA: Opposition members of state legislative council on Monday demanded that the government should talk to agitating niyojit (contractual) teachers and resolve the issue pertaining to their strike. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra demanded adjournment of the House to have discussion to incorporate Maithili in school curriculum.

RJD MLC Subodh Kumar also demanded adjournment of the House on the issue of niyojit teachers’ strike. However, the demand for adjournment was rejected.

Mishra said it was unfortunate that Maithili was not being taught in schools for almost 15 years, in spite of being in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. “All the languages listed in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution are being taught in schools of those states where they are spoken. But for years together, Maithili is neither being taught in Bihar nor are the teachers being recruited or its books printed. This is an important issue associated with common people,” said Mishra.

He said during the Congress’s regime, Maithili was taught at all levels and even Maithili Academy was established for its development. Former chief minister Rabri Devi also stood in support of Mishra, demanding the government to start Maithili teaching in schools. Taking a jibe at Rabri’s demand, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said, “It was during RJD’s regime that Maithili was removed from the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) list.”

84,['3/03/2020'],Bihar government should hold talks with agitating teachers: Opposition,"Representative image

PATNA: The opposition members from RJD, Congress and CPI(ML) entered the well of the legislative assembly on Monday in support of contractual teachers’ demand of equal pay for equal work, forcing Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary to adjourn the House abruptly during zero hour. The contractual teachers have been on strike since February 17.

RJD member Shivchandra Ram raised the issue first, followed by other members from Congress and CPI(ML), demanding that the government should hold talks with the agitating teachers.

CPI(ML) members also raised the issue of permission given by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi to the police to prosecute former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and others in an allegedly false sedition case lodged against him.

Outside the House, Bihar Secondary School Teachers’ Association president Kedar Pandey and its general secretary Shatrughan Prasad Singh demanded that CM should consider the demands of the secondary schoolteachers whose indefinite strike entered the seventh day on Monday.

Earlier, the one-hour business related to the short-notice and starred questions was conducted smoothly.

2018-19 Annual Credit Plan (ACP): In reply to the short-notice question from senior RJD member Abdul Bari Siddiqui regarding the part fulfilment of the agriculture loan disbursement target under the ACP during 2018-19 fiscal, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said the target loan was fixed at Rs60,000 crore. Of this sum, only Rs43,621 crore (72.70%) could be disbursed as loan due to the reluctance of the bankers to issue new Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) to the farmers covered under PM Kisan Samman Yojana.

Modi also said the bankers had made it conditional for any farmer who takes loan with KCC to also go for crop insurance scheme. As a result of it, no new KCC could be issued to the farmers.

However, later, the matter was discussed with the Centre, as a result of which the Reserve Bank of India intervened and removed the condition of crop insurance for agriculture loan under the KCC scheme. Further, it was said that the KCCs would also be used to take loans for fishery, poultry and dairy activities.

Accordingly, camps and campaign were conducted from February 12 to 27 this year to issue KCC to the willing farmers for even fishery, poultry and dairy activities, Modi said, adding that the disbursement of loans under the ACP would pick up from the current fiscal.

FIRs against teachers in Sitamarhi, Khagaria: Runnisaidpur block education officer on Monday lodged FIR against 30 secondary schoolteachers for boycotting evaluation of answer sheets of Intermediate exams conducted by Bihar School Examination Board.

PATNA: Four criminals were arrested with arms and ammunition from different locations under Bochaha police station in Muzaffarpur district and recovered nine looted bikes on their confession on Sunday.

The recovered bikes were looted from Bochaha, Gaighat and Kanti police station areas of the district. Two of the arrested criminals were also involved in Rs1.4 lakh loot from a financial firm under Runnisaidpur police station in neighbouring Sitamarhi district almost a week back.

Bochaha police station SHO Puran Kumar Jha, who is a probationer IPS officer, said on Monday that the arrested criminals were identified as Avinash Kumar alias Manjay Kumar, Pawan Kumar, Dharmendra Kumar alias Mintu and Mohammad Riyaz. Jha said Avinash and Pawan with four others were involved in the Runnisaidpur loot case.

“They committed crime in Bochaha, Gaighat and Kanti and used to sell the stolen bikes in West Champaran and East Champaran,” he said. “The gang is new. Police came to know about the gang after a bike was looted on NH-57 on February 29. Avinash and Pawan were nabbed with two looted bikes, two country-made pistols, two magazines and Rs30,000 near Bochaha High School,” he said.

Jha said the duo told the police about Dharmendra and Riyaz. “Riyaz used to ask for bikes with specific colours on customers’ demand. Dharmendra used to ask Avinash and Pawan to loot bikes as per the demands,” the SHO said.

He said the gang leader was still at large and police are also trying to ascertain the owners of recovered vehicles.

KHAGARIA: With more than 2,500 students on its roll, KMD College at Parbatta in Khagaria district is managed by 10 teachers only. A constituent unit of newly created Munger University, the college has the sanctioned posts of 25 teachers.

Dilapidated building, leaking roof, shortage of teachers, lack of basic infrastructure and facilities, boundary wall, common room, recreation and sports facilities and laboratories have made it miserable for students even after the lapse of 64 years of its establishment.

The college was established in 1956. It was named after Kabir Moti Das, the mahant of Sant Kabir muth, who had donated nearly 100 acres of land of the trust to set up the college. The college functioned as an affiliated unit of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) till 1982, when it was upgraded as a constituent unit. Later, it was carved out of TMBU in 2018 and became a constituent unit of newly created Munger University.

None of the departments has the required number of teachers. Vacancies caused by retirement, death or transfer have not been filled. There is not even a single teacher in Statistics, Botany and Zoology departments since 2002, 2010 and 2018 respectively.

“There is no teaching facility for commerce and students have no option except to go to district headquarters town for higher studies,” rued Niranjan Hazari, a native of Kabela village.

Meanwhile, the college is yet to be assessed by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The college may be deprived of UGC grants if it failed to get the NAAC accreditation, college sources said.

Acting principal Shiv Kumar Agrawal, who has taken over the charge recently, said he has already apprised the university authorities of the various problems pertaining to shortage of teachers and proper infrastructure.

The triennial elections would be conducted on April 3 and results would be announced the same day.

All of these 400-450 lawyers had failed to complete formalities even after the poll panel constituted under chairman Bhanudas Kulkarni had twice extended the deadline which ended on Monday.

With this, 1,801 members have become eligible to vote, which is still 300 more compared to 2017 polls. “Over 400 members were added in the last few days after extension of the deadline. All HCBA members were requested several times for clearing their arrears as soon as the polls were announced. Those who cleared the dues till December 31 have been declared eligible to vote,” sources told TOI.

Over 600 new lawyers would not be able to vote as they were enrolled after February 18, 2019 and have not completed one year of mandatory membership when the polls were announced. “All decisions were taken as per the rules mentioned in HCBA’s constitution,” the panel members said, while justifying the move to bar 400-450 lawyers from exercising their right to vote.

90,['3/03/2020'],Kazhakoottam-Mukkola: NHAI to begin toll collection in April,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If things go as planned, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will begin toll collection on the Kazhakoottam-Mukkola stretch by next month. NHAI is gearing up to begin construction of a temporary toll collection centre by next week at the proposed location between Thiruvallam and Vellar.

A notification approving the proposed rates for various vehicles are expected to be issued in a week. Once toll collection begins, Kazhakoottam-Mukkola will be the only stretch in city where toll will be applicable.

The toll collection at Akkulam on the Kazhakoottam-Kovalam stretch was stopped in September 2016 following NHAI’s decision to widen the stretch as part of the new Kazhakoottam-Karode NH stretch.

Sources said the temporary toll collection centre will be constructed as NHAI could not afford the loss of revenue till the time a permanent toll plaza is constructed. The construction of a staggered toll plaza would take around 2-3 months.

As more and more toll plazas are switching to online collection of tolls with the implementation of FASTag, the temporary toll centres of NHAI will have handheld devices for toll payment of vehicles with FASTag stickers.

The total cost of Kazhakoottam-Mukkola NH widening is Rs 845.24 crore with construction alone pegged at Rs 669.06 crore. Though the NHAI initially planned to launch it as a build operate transfer project (BOT), contractors were reluctant to take up the work due to the opposition to tolls in the state. Finally, NHAI had to call for tender after changing it into engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract where the contractor will be given the cost of construction as lumpsum grant. Under EPC, toll collection is the responsibility of the NHAI.

The NHAI had planned to a construct toll plaza at Akkulam, where a toll collection for the Akkulam bridge had existed. The then district collector Biju Prabhakar had asked NHAI to shift the location so as to avoid toll burden on city commuters. Following the intervention of state government, NHAI assigned National Transport Planning and Research Centre (Natpac) to suggest possible locations. The Natpac checked possible spaces in Chackai, Kuzhivila and the location between Thiruvallam and Vellar. Considering the 54-metre-wide space for construction of plaza and traffic, the location between Thiruvallam and Vellar was suggested as the better option. The Natpac had, however, mention about the possibility of motorists taking Thiruvallam-Pachalloor-Vazhamuttam road to skip the toll.

As per the design, NHAI will construct staggered toll plaza in the stretch. It will have overhead rooms as office spaces.

With the opening of Chackai flyover for two-way traffic, major works of the 26.5-km Kazhakoottam-Mukkola national highway widening project has been completed.

92,['3/03/2020'],Another truck of same firm caught transporting biomedical waste,"Aurangabad: Saturday’s episode of a waste collection agency caught transporting construction debris and biomedical waste to Padegaon dumping ground failed to deter the firm from committing malpractices. On Monday, a truck of the same agency was again found allegedly carrying biomedical waste from a private hospital.

AMC’s sanitation inspector caught a truck of P Gopinath Reddy transporting biomedical waste to the secondary transportation point at Rama Nagar near Kranti Chowk. No sooner the biomedical waste was found, Kranti Chowk corporator Shilparani Wadkar rushed to the spot. The truck was emptied for confirmation. “When the material from the truck was segregated, we found large quantities of used syringes, needles, bandages and medicines,” Wadkar said. The staff of AMC’s health department also inspected the waste being transported by the agency.

The Biomedical Waste Management (BMWM) Rules, 2016, mandates that biomedical waste should only be given to an agency responsible for collection, reception, storage, transport, treatment, disposal or any other form of handling bio-medical waste. The rules restrict the generator (hospitals, labs, blood bank or dispensary) from mixing its biomedical waste with the solid waste.

The AMC has appointed Watergrace Products, an agency dedicated for BMWM in the city. The hospitals are required to pay a fee to the agency and give its biomedical waste for transportation and treatment. However, several hospitals, including the Government Medical College and Hospital, are found to be mishandling their biomedical waste.

Meanwhile, the incident led to an argument between sanitation inspector of P Gopinath Reddy and AMC ward officer SM Jarare. They were found to passing the buck of segregating waste on each other.

Head of AMC’s solid waste management cell Nandkishor Bhombe said that the biomedical waste found on Monday was dumped by a private hospital on road. “The agency had collected the dumped waste and transporting it. The health department will submit a report and a case will be registered against the hospital,” said Bhombe.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd is mulling linkage of two projects meant for parking and commute to reduce the congestion on roads owing to two-side parking in the city.

The multi-level car parking (MLCP) facility, which will come up at Palayam under Smart City project, is expected to cater not just to those frequenting the market but also regular office goers to private firms and government offices located along the mobility corridors being planned for share auto scheme.

SCTL notified tenders for electro mechanical multi-level multi grid over ground parking system at Palayam on Monday. This will have the capacity to accommodate a total number of 568 cars and can take the load of 2,000kg per car. The system will accommodate SUVs in the ground floor and cars of lesser dimensions in upper floors. The average retrieval and parking time has been fixed as not more than 300 seconds.

It will have total seven levels to achieve the required 568 slots. In addition, it can accommodate over 250 two-wheelers. The facility will have features like automatic vehicle retrieval, position guiding sensor wherein sensors with red and green lights will guide the vehicle into the pallet. The lifting speed of the facility will be 0.1m/sec and horizontal sliding speed will be 0.133 m/sec as per the tender notification.

SCTL has also planned another parking facility as part of redevelopment of Palayam market. Two share auto mobility corridors are being considered by SCTL ahead of launch of city’s first share auto scheme. Fifteen e-rickshaws will ply to and fro along Thampanoor-Overbridge-Secretariat-Legislative assembly -Museum-public office-Manaveeyam stretch and Thampanoor - Overbridge-Gandhi Park- Pazhavangadi- Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple precincts.

The corridors would offer connectivity between offices and MLCP at Palayam. The women driven e-rickshaws will be functional from morning till evening.

Extension of operational timings will be considered only after the official launch of the share auto scheme. With MLCP and share auto scheme being linked, it will also open up enhanced revenue potential for MLCP as project officials anticipate people to embrace a safe and secure parking facility with fast retrieval and parking timings. The connectivity between office and MLCP through share autos adds to the attraction, project wing said.

As part of AMRUT project, the city corporation has already completed another MLCP on corporation office premises with a capacity to accommodate 102 cars.

The e-rickshaw with four seats will have two passengers sitting face to face and minimum rate has been tentatively fixed at Rs 10. The e-rickshaws will be rolled out with a special colour theme in sync with city’s heritage and history.

The e-rickshaws will be brought to the city from the showroom in Kollam. The share auto scheme is expected to be implemented in wards under (area-based development) to ensure connectivity between minimum distance points within central wards.

94,['3/03/2020'],"6 months on, no action for excavation on govt lands","Nagpur: Despite preliminary survey confirming murrum excavation from state-owned zudpi jungle and hillocks in August last year, Wardha district administration is yet to levy penalty and take action against concerned companies in the last six months.

Though murrum excavation from government land has been banned, it was pilfered without permission for construction of Samruddhi Mahamarg stretch in Wardha district.

BJP MLC Girish Vyas told TOI, “Murrum has been excavated illegally from government-owned lands and hillocks for Samruddhi Mahamarg right from Nagpur to Mumbai. The concerned departments have turned a blind eye towards destruction of government property, environment and huge revenue loss. Therefore, I have submitted a legislative assembly question (LAQ) during the ongoing budget session asking whether such illegal excavation happened and who all are responsible for it.”

“I have also sought information whether the illegal excavation has benefited Samruddhi Mahamarg and the government,” he said.

TOI, on August 27, 2019, had reported that a survey was conducted by Selu tehsildar Mahendra Sonone and his team. Sonone had issued notices to Mumbai-based Afcons Infrastructure Limited on August 31, 2019.

In the notices, Sonone had stated that murrum was excavated from zudpi jungle on khasra no. 7 at mouza Itala, hillock with khasra no. 210 at mouza Kotumba and hillock with khasra no. 65 at mouza Giroli, all owned by the government.

Later, activist Sandip Khedkar from Kotumba had sought information under RTI Act from Wardha mining department and concerned gram panchayats as to whether permission was given for excavation of murrum from these three parcels of land. All the authorities had denied having given permission for the excavation.

Khedkar also pointed out that excavation was also done in khasra no. 206 at mouza Kotumba, owned by forest department. Information obtained under RTI from social forestry department revealed that these three parcels of land were having 37,917 trees, which were over 30-year-old.

Wardha district administration has not taken action against the concerned companies as on date ignoring the fact that government had stopped giving lease of its land for excavating murrum and also it cannot give permission to excavate murrum from zudpi jungle and forest land.

Officials told TOI that while Selu tehsil office and mining department have completed their surveys, land records department has started its own verification on Monday.

Murrum was also excavated from land owned by Hyderabad-based Cozy Properties without permission from the owner as well as the district administration. Following complaints by Cozy Properties, Wardha district administration had completed all formalities and levied a fine of Rs238.99 crore on Afcons in December last year. In this case, the police also had registered offences against officials of Afcons, its petty contractor and arrested them.

Afcons had challenged the punitive action in this case in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court. Cozy Properties had also filed petitions.

Afcons spokesperson said, “We have been repeatedly clarifying our stand in this context that Afcons has never been involved in any illegal excavation. It may also be noted that in a similar issue, HC has granted stay in favour of Afcons.”

Local residents had also lodged complaints about similar excavation in Digras lake and excess excavation in Bor river. No action has been taken in these cases also.

THRISSUR: In a shocking incident, an oracle (komaram) misused his divine power to tarnish the image of a 30-year-old woman in Thrissur district. After the slander, the woman, a mother of two, killed herself. The husband and brother of the woman filed a police complaint seeking action against the oracle (velichappadu) and his friend.

“The incident took place on February 25. As part of the festival in the Karanath family temple, the oracle, Sreekanth declared in public that my wife had committed a mistake and issued a command that she must apologize before the goddess of the Karanath Devi temple. Over 200 family members and relatives had attended the festival. My wife was mentally distressed with the public announcement. The next day, she committed suicide,” the woman’s husband, who is working in the Gulf, said.

“After the incident in the temple, family members informed me over phone that my wife was mentally distressed with the oracle’s public outburst. I, then, asked my kids to provide her support. But on February 26 night, she was found hanging inside the room,” the husband said.

“Sreekanth and Janamithran are our relatives. For the last several months, Janamithran had been trying to tarnish my wife’s image by spreading fake messages against her through WhatsApp. We had warned him several times,” he said.

“We suspect that Janamithran influenced the oracle to publicly insult my wife,” he alleged.

Meanwhile, district Sastra Sahitya Parishad president K S Jaya, secretary T Satyanarayan and gender issues state committee convener P S Juna visited the woman’s house on Sunday. “We suspect that the oracle misused his power. The oracle has no right to tarnish a woman’s image in public. Normally, oracles share public issues during the festival. But Sreekanth targeted the woman and insulted her. A detailed probe is needed to expose exploitation in the name of faith,” Satyanarayan said.

“We have registered a case under Section 174 IPC (unnatural death). The probe is on,” said Anthikkad CI.

AURANGABAD: Three youths were arrested from the Misarwadi area of the city on Sunday night after they were caught smuggling marijuana. Cidco police have seized high-quality marijuana weighing about 19 kg from the youths and also launched a hunt for the fourth suspect who is on the run.

A squad member of the Cidco police’s detection branch said that he received a tip-off that a group of youths were involved in smuggling of marijuana and were going somewhere to peddle the stock. After receiving the tip-off, the standard operating procedure was followed and a couple of panchas were roped in.

A team from the Cidco police laid a trap in the presence of the panchas. When the police team intercepted the youths who were travelling by two different mopeds near the Misarwadi area of the city, they started fleeing. Police managed to nab the three suspects after about a kilometre’s chase.

However, they could not catch the fourth suspect, who taking advantage of the dark, managed to escape.

The suspects have been identified as Virendrasingh Mahendrasingh Pardeshi (22), a resident of lane number 3 of Jai Bhavani Nagar, Shubham alias Bablu Gautam More (19), a resident of lane number 10, New Hanuman Nagar near Vande Mataram school, and Ramlal alias Deepak Sardar Barela (19) from Borajanta in Chopda tehsil of Jalgaon district. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the suspect on the run (26) is Barela’s kin and hails from Jalgaon.

Based on the complaint lodged by head constable Subhash Shewale, the suspects were slapped with sections of the Narcotics , Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, early Monday.

Police said that the suspects stashed the banned stuff in two fertilizer bags and kept them in their mopeds to avoid getting noticed by people and also evade suspicion of the police.

Inspector at Cidco police station Ashok Giri said that as per preliminary probe, it seemed like the the suspects were associated with habitual offenders professionally involved in the illegal sale and supply of marijuana.

“Stashing marijuana in fertilizer bags and carrying them on mopeds is part of their modus operandi to evade police’s interception. We are working on ways to reach the source of the stock, which could have been grown in the neighbouring district, if not in another state,” said Giri.

97,['3/03/2020'],"Community of elders with farms, hotels","The Vangaon-Dahanu-Gholvad-Bordi belt in Palghar district has a sizeable population of both Parsi and Irani families, especially elderly couples . Most of these families have been traditionally into chikoo farming and some have branched out to other businesses such as hotels and bakeries.

Rohinton Taraporewala (73) and wife Homai (70), who were targeted by five dacoits on Saturday, said Vangaon has just around eight to 10 Parsi and Irani families.

The assault on the Parsi couple brought back memories of the 2014 double murder in the same neighbourhood. The killing of Naushir Irani and wife Nargis in December 2014 in Vangaon bungalow had shaken the neighbourhood. Nargis was a relative of the Taraporewala family.

All houses have cameras and many residents even keep licensed revolvers for self-defence. Locals said most crimes are committed by people known to the families. Locals said house help and workers hired at homes and farms need to be registered with the local police station, which is not done in most cases. Due to growing security concerns, some families have moved to towns. A Bordi-based Irani man said several farms are now managed by caretakers. — Sandhya Nair

The residents, under the banner Samajik Nayay Sangharsh Samiti, called off their stir after mayor Nandkumar Ghodele assured them of action. A memorandum was also submitted to the mayor highlighting the poor quality of road constructed by the civic body outside Mukundwadi police station.

“The road had started developing cracks following which AMC ward engineer filled them with a mixture of cement and sand. However, the mixture has started to come off making our commute on the road unpleasant,” Lahuji Shewale, a member of the delegation, said.

The residents demanded that the executive engineer of the AMC should conduct an inspection and based on the report action should be taken against the ward engineer for substandard road work.

Mayor has directed executive engineer Hemant Kolhe to conduct an inspection and submit the report.

The residents also stated that in wake of insufficient water supply by the civic body, the annual water tax of Rs 4,050 is impractical and it should be slashed to Rs 1,800.

The delegation stated that areas like Sanjay Nagar, Sant Rohidas Nagar, Shriram Nagar, Mukundwadi J Sector, Ambikanagar, Sangharsh Nagar, Shraddha Colony Santoshi Mata Nagar and Vitthal Nagar of Cidco N-2 are inhabited by people belonging to the lower income group.

“After these areas where transferred from Cidco to the AMC, the families are being imposed with heavy property taxes. The AMC should therefore exempt properties till 600 sqft area from property tax,” Shewale said.

Kozhikode: Kalpetta MLA C K Saseendran has been appointed as temporary chairman of the National Highway 766 Transport Protection Action Committee, which had been spearheading the campaign to lift the night traffic ban on the interstate highway, amid war of words between LDF and UDF over the issue.

Sulthan Bathery MLA I C Balakrishnan had last month stepped down as chairman of the action committee, raising allegations that the state government was taking a deceptive stand on the issue. He alleged that the government was trying to implement a secret agenda aimed at enhancing road connectivity to Kannur airport even at the cost of road connectivity through NH-766.

The public convention organized by the action committee at Sultan Bathery noted that Balakrishnan’s act of resigning from the post of chairman of action committee was condemnable.

It said the state government had taken a stand that there was no alternative to NH-766 and it was reiterated in the unanimous resolution passed by the state assembly.

The meeting said that Balakrishnan’s proposal of using Sulthan Bathery-Valluvadi-Chikkabaragi bypass road as an alternative route for the forest stretch of NH-766, where night traffic ban is in force, cannot be accepted. It amounted to deceiving the mass public protests in Wayanad over the issue, it said.

Also the meeting decided that the action committee leaders would hold meetings with Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa before the case’s next hearing in the Supreme Court.

Saseendran said the action committee would go ahead with programmes and agitations to revoke the night traffic ban.

The video prepared and uploaded by the suspect — identified as Shubham Bokde (20), a resident of Daulatabad — on Sunday garnered several views before going viral on social the media.

“The video appears to be aimed at peddling communal disharmony among different communities. Taking cognizance of the alleged act, we have booked the suspect under section 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulating its religion or the religious beliefs) and 153 A (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code ,” a police officer said.

Inspector Rajshri Adhe of Daulatabad police station said Daulatabad has a long history of communal harmony with villagers from all communities staying and even celebrating all festivals together.

“Making such video would have disrupted communal harmony. We have not only registered an offence, but have also detained the suspect immediately,” Adhe said.

“After being detained, the suspect has confessed to making the video. Though he has deleted his TikTok account, we have seized his mobile phone for sending it to the forensic laboratory,” she added.

Sources said that soon after the video went viral on Sunday night, some members from the minority community objected to it. However, elders of the village from both sides intervened and diffused the situation amicably.

“Not taking any chance and to send out a strong message to those indulging in to mischief on social media, police decided to put the incident on record and a complaint was lodged,” sources said.

“There are standing orders from commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad to take stringent action against anyone found posing threat to communal harmony in the city, and we have acted accordingly,” an officer privy to probe said.

LUDHIANA: Two men on a motorcycle shot at a garment trader and robbed him of Rs 50,000 on RK Road, near Cheema Chowk, on Sunday night. With two bullet injuries, Mohinder Singh , 52, drove back home in Mohar Singh Nagar, from where he was taken to a hospital.

Mohinder’s wife said in her police complaint, “My husband runs a readymade garment store at Neem Wala Chowk. Around 10.15pm on Sunday, he was on way home when a bike intercepted his two-wheeler near India Summer restaurant close to Cheema Chowk. As its two riders tried to snatch his cash bag, he fought back. The duo then fired two shots at him.”

Moti Nagar police station ASI Rajesh Kumar said, “After firing at Mohinder, the duo sped off with his cash bag. Mohinder called up his wife and apprised her of the incident. The brave man then drove back home. As soon as he reached his house, his family, along with their neighbours, took him to Christian Medical College and Hospital .”

On receiving the information, additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Gurpeet Singh Sikand and assistant commissioner of police (Central) Waryam Singh reached the hospital.

Police suspect it to be the handiwork of an insider.

“Every Sunday, Mohinder collects payment from shopkeepers to whom he supplies garments. On Sunday, too, he was returning from Giaspura after collecting Rs 50,000. The role of an insider, who knew that Mohinder would have cash with him, cannot be ruled out. We are questioning the shopkeepers who cleared his dues,” the ASI added.

On whether the assailants were masked, the ASI said, “Mohinder is not in a state to give a statement. He has received bullet injuries on chest and stomach. We are scanning the footage of CCTVs installed near the spot.”

Moti Nagar police have registered a case under Section 392 (punishment for robbery) of the IPC and under the Arms Act.

Ludhiana: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday sought details of the case of assault on advocate Varun Gupta by Ludhiana STF in-charge Harbans Singh at a dhaba near Doraha. A bench of Justice Lisa Gill has adjourned the case for Tuesday.

Gupta has accused the STF inspector and his team of beating him up on February 25. The bench took on record the claims of the petitioner that no action was taken against the erring police officials even as he was being threatened and pressurised to withdraw his complaint.

Seeking registration of an FIR against the erring cops, the petitioner claimed that Ludhiana civil hospital was not releasing to him his medical report. He said the entire incident was captured in CCTVs installed at Sethi Dhaba and a petrol pump in the vicinity “But the police officials are actively destroying this evidence,” he added.

When the petition came up for hearing, state counsel HS Sitta, while quoting Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Agarwal, said an inquiry was being conducted into the “unbecoming conduct” of the police officials and a special investigating team (SIT) had been constituted by Khanna SSP. However, the state counsel denied allegations of threats or pressurisation. He sought adjournment of the case to give a detailed reply.

Earlier, petitioner’s counsel DPS Randhawa pointed out that no FIR was registered even a week after the incident and since the complaint was against police officials, a sessions judge should monitor the case. The counsel said the petitioner should be given security as he was facing threats to take back the complaint.

In his complaint to the city police commissioner and other authorities on February 25, Gupta had claimed that a day before when he was returning to Ludhiana from Delhi with his father, who was on a catheter, and driver, STF in-charge Harbans Singh beat him up and maltreated his father at an eatery near Doraha.

‘Was threatened will be framed’

In his plea filed on February 28, the petitioner said he had given a representation to the official respondents (Punjab through its secretary, department of law and justice, Punjab DGP, Ludhiana commissioner of police, Ludhiana STF AIG, and chairperson of Punjab State Human Rights Commission), seeking action against Harbans Singh and three unknown police officials, who first beat him up brutally and then threatened him and his family of dire consequences. He said he was even threatened implication in false cases. The petitioner added that the Ludhiana District Bar Association has been on a strike since last week, but no action has been taken in the case.

They also took hostage district cane officer (DCO) Yashpal Singh and held him for hours, demanding payment of cane dues. The farmers said they were struggling to make ends meet and did not have any money for celebrating Holi next week.

Bijnor sub divisional magistrate Brijesh Kumar Singh and DCO Yashpal Singh held talks with the protesters. But their assurance to get their dues cleared cut no ice with farmers. The dharna is still going on.

According to official sources, there are 119 sugar mills in UP which owe Rs 8,000 crore to 40 lakh farmers across the state. Out of these, seven sugar mills have not paid a single penny for the current crushing season that began in October last year. Now, farmer organizations are planning a statewide agitation.

Yashpal Singh, DCO, said, “There are nine sugar mills in Bijnor which owe Rs 725 crore. Out of these, five mills are paying dues. We have served notices on four mills through the district magistrate. If they fail to clear the dues, action will be taken against them. We had held talks with farmers on Monday and assured them to get their dues cleared as soon as possible. In fact, some mills paid Rs 22 crore on Sunday.”

Talking with TOI, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union’s youth wing Digambar Singh said, “Mills in the state are doing well but some are not paying dues to farmers. There is a provision in the Sugarcane Act that farmers should be paid within 14 days of cane delivery to the mills. Government has not increased state advised price of sugarcane despite an increase in production cost. All hope that government will get the dues cleared in time has been dashed.”

He added that farmers have run up debts and are not in a position to prepare for the next cane season.

Indira Singh, director of UP Cooperative Bank, said, “We are trying our best to get the dues cleared. We have talked with the higher authorities of UP Cooperative Bank to release loans to the mills. Once their credit limit is extended, the mills will be able to pay the dues.”

This phase kicked off in Meerut on February 17. As many as 159 teams of doctors and health officers started visiting houses from February 17 to examine lakhs of people and collect sputum of those suspected to be suffering from the disease.

Health officials went door to door in residential areas, examining lakhs of people and collecting sputum of those suspected to be suffering from TB. A total of 4.74 lakh people were covered during the drive, out of which samples of 2,205 suspected cases were taken.

Detailing, Dr MS Fauzdar, Meerut district tuberculosis officer, said, “As many as 159 teams with 11 nodal officers went to 84,500 houses in different parts of the city to check cases of tuberculosis. A total population of 4.74 lakh was covered out of which 2,205 samples were taken. As many as 212 people tested positive.”

The active case finding is part of a nation-wide effort to stamp out the disease, which has re-emerged as a potent killer, claiming more than 4.06 lakh lives in the country every year. The central government, aiming to root out the disease by 2025, has instructed all states to start ‘active case finding’. This means that health authorities, instead of waiting for TB patients to approach them, will send workers to knock at households in order to identify and treat such patients. The pilot project kicked off from urban slums of Meerut in August 2017.

For, the desynchronized timings of the traffic lights and the railway crossing barrier add to the vehicular congestion on the stretch.

The department had installed the traffic signal a month ago.

The RPF’s recommendation comes three days after a train ran over two commuters while they were trying to pass through the closed Giaspura crossing around 8.15pm on February 29.

A railway official said, “Due to the traffic lights and the railway track gate’s uncoordinated timings, chaos rules the stretch during peak traffic hours. As a result, impatient commuters try to cross the tracks even when the barrier is closed or take illegal shortcuts.”

A senior official said, “The railway crossing barrier is just 50m from the traffic lights. If the signal turns red, heavy vehicles eat up most part of the lane, leading to traffic mess. Besides, if the signal is green, many commuters pass through the track illegally so that they aren’t stuck for long.”

After receiving the letter, the traffic police have shut down the traffic lights and now plan to remove them.

Ludhiana Railway Protection Force company commander Anil Kumar said, “We have asked the traffic police department to remove traffic lights from near the Giaspura railway crossing. Roughly over a lakh vehicles pass through this crossing every day. Instead of serving any purpose, this traffic signal is adding to vehicular chaos.”

City station chief area manager Parminder Singh said, “Heavy security forces have been deployed at Giaspura crossing. We are trying to find a solution to the peak hour jam problem, so that commuters do not try to cross the tracks illegally.”

Speaking to TOI, the helpless father said, “I had gone into depression after my wife’s death, so my mother had to take the children to the shelter home as she was not able to take care of all of us. Had I been well, I would not have sent them anywhere and would have brought them up myself. They have now snatched my children away from me and sent them so far that we cannot even go and meet them.

“My mother used to visit them around 4 -5 times a year until 2018. Later, she was told that the children get distracted from studies on seeing her, so she should not come to meet them so often. Then when she went to the shelter home on February 22, she was told about the adoption. She told me the whole thing and as I was working out of station, I boarded a train and came back as soon as I could. Never in my dreams would have I thought of giving up my children,” he said.

The father also told CWC that he will file an FIR against all the parties involved in the adoption without his knowledge and consent.

Bhopal collector Tarun Pithode has asked the district programme officer (DPO) Brijesh Tripathi to collect all the documents needed to investigate the case.

“I have come to know that the children were made legally free for adoption three years ago and have asked the DPO for a detailed report of the case. We will investigate the case thoroughly and then take appropriate action accordingly,” said the collector.

CWC member Kripashankar Choubey, who met the father and grandmother of the three children on Monday, said, “As the case was under the former CWC, we are collecting all the documents regarding it. The father has given us an application to get his children back and once we have all the documents of the case, we will write to the WCD department to take action and do what is best for the children.”

Ludhiana: Police on Monday booked a man for brutally thrashing his wife with an iron road after tying her up at their house in Miller Gunj’s Santpura.

Sonia, 29, said in her police complaint, “I had tied the knot with Dharminder, a labourer, 11 years ago. We have three children. My brother, who lives in Ambala, had purchased a motorcycle from Ludhiana a few months ago. Some days ago, he came to visit me and gave me Rs 5,200 to pay the bike’s instalment. When my husband came to know about it, he took the money from me and said he would make the payment.”

But instead of paying the bike’s instalment, Dharminder used the money to meet his expenditures. “On February 27, when I questioned Dharminder about it, he started quarrelling with me. He then tied up my hands and feet with a rope and thrashed me with an iron rod. He hit me till I bled.”

After Dharminder escaped from there, neighbours rushed to their house on hearing Sonia’s screams and took her to a hospital.

Miller Gunj police post assistant sub-inspector Jageer Singh said, “Before battering Sonia, Dharminder asked his children to go out of the house and bolted the door from inside.”

On why the FIR was registered late, the ASI said, “Sonia is admitted to a hospital in Ambala. On learning about it, we went to Ambala and recorded her statement on Sunday. The case was registered against her husband, who is on the run, under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC on Monday.”

116,['3/03/2020'],Deer with white patches on body sighted in Pench,"Wildlife photographer Ajit Kulkarni‘s capture shows unusually big white patches on the deer’s body and face

Nagpur: After an albino sambar was recorded in Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve ( NNTR ) last month, a deer with coat variation having white patches on its body was sighted by a tourist on Sunday morning at Sillari in Pench Tiger Reserve.

The picture clicked by wildlife photographer Ajit Kulkarni shows the deer’s mouth is white and similar big spots on the body.

“It was the lone deer with spots among the flock. We were curious and thought it was an albino deer but it needs to be verified by experts,” said Kulkarni.

However, veterinarian and forensic expert from Karnataka Dr Prayag HS said, ‘The deer cannot be termed albino.”

Dr Vinod Dhoot with Wildlife Research Training Centre (WRTC), Gorewada Rescue Centre, said, “The white spots are due to some mineral or vitamin deficiency. The discoloration of hair may be due to deficiency of copper since the mineral plays an important role in melanin formation.”

Wildlife vet Dr Bahar Baviskar said, “It looks to be a case of vitiligo or piebaldism. There should be long-term monitoring of such cases. Further investigation using molecular test will help in exact diagnosis. It may be case of piebaldism or vitiligo. In vitiligo, white patches will keep changing on body parts and in piebaldism the white patches will be static at one place.”

Dr Baviskar added, “There are many disease conditions in the free-ranging wildlife which need detailed study. These are acquired skin disorders characterized by white and depigmented patches. It is due to disappearance of functioning melanocytes and loss of melanin in the epidermis.”

Wildlife biologist with Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) Aditya Joshi says, “It is case of coat variation. If a large portion of the body is covered with such patches, they are called as piebald. But in case of the deer, these patches are small. It is a variation occurring due to unpigmented spots over the coloured coat. It occurs in several other species.”

118,['3/03/2020'],IGP: Dismantle anti-dacoity squads within 24 hours,"AURANGABAD: Special inspector general of police (IGP), Aurangabad range, Ravinder Kumar Singal on Monday ordered the dismantling of the anti-dacoity squads (ADS) in Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad districts within 24 hours.

In an order to the four superintendents of police under his jurisdiction, the IGP said, “These independent squads are unnecessary, not needed and are not performance-based.”

When contacted, Singal confirmed about this development. He told TOI, “The districts may have ADS squads working under the local crime branch (LCB). They are not working as independent squads.”

While expressing concern about the rising number of complaints, Singal said that he was compelled to initiate action in the larger interest of the police as well as commoners.

“These four districts are not prone to dacoity. Moreover, prevention and detection of dacoity cases can be carried out by the LCB with available manpower in each district,” he said.

Responding in the same vein as the IGP, a superintendent of police asked, “When there is already a dearth of manpower in the police department, what is the need of having another special squad and exhaust the resources?”

Sources in the police said that the decision had been taken after it came to the fore that internal rivalry and competition among the police officers was resulting in unfair and unethical practices, and allegations, apart from internal friction and groupism.

“There have been incidents where an ADS inspector, in an attempt to get replaced with the LCB inspector, made a deceased man’s family hold an agitation against the latter,” said a senior officer privy to the development.

Authorities said that it was then superintendent of police Arti Singh, who while heading the Aurangabad rural police, had dissolved the ADS in 2017. Incumbent superintendent of police Mokshada Patil too had abstained from forming the ADS since taking charge from last year.

In the case of Osmanabad district , Singal personally ordered dissolving the squad a few months ago given the rise in the number of complaints, apart from its increasing friction with the LCB there.

Beed and Jalna are the only two districts where the ADS squads are working full-fledged parallel to the LCB units.

Police authorities claimed that the internal friction had even resulted in sending named as well as unnamed complaints against each other to offices of the director general of police, IGP, superintendent of police as well as to the Anti-Corruption Bureau. “The internal friction is also giving bad publicity to the department as news are often planted against each other,” said an LCB inspector.

Sources said that inspector of LCB Bhagwat Phunde had gone to the IGP office with a request to hand over the investigation of the case to some other officer. IGP Singal expressed concern for the inspector for failing to act on his orders and issued him a showcause notice.

When contacted, Singal confirmed about the development. He refused to elaborate further citing that it was an internal matter.

Singal had appointed a special investigation team headed by assistant superintendent of police Gorakh Bhamre following a complaint from Jalna youth Anil Walekar. He alleged that he was falsely framed by the Jalna police’s ADS as well as Kadim Jalna police station in a case of ‘preparation of dacoity.’

Walekar alleged that right after Kadim Jalna police registered a case against him on January 4, he was taken into custody by Vaijapur police of Aurangabad rural, Newasa police of Ahmednagar district and Osmanabad district police for questioning in the pending house break-in and theft cases in their respective jurisdictions.

Walekar remained behind bars from January 3 to February 14. While on bail, Walekar collected the CCTV footage from the dhaba where he was picked up by the ADS constables and submitted it to the IGP.

SDMC had previously complained that of the 2.4 lakh taxis registered with Delhi government’s transport department, not even a lakh had RFID tags. “This is defeating the entire purpose of controlling pollution by allowing hassle-free movement of commercial vehicles at toll plazas,” it said.

An SDMC official said the civic agency raised the matter that taxi operators were not cooperating unlike other commercial vehicles. “These cabs cross toll plazas using free lanes meant for general public. This leads to confusion and monetary losses for the civic body,” he said, adding that the transport department is yet to come out with a circular.

Sunita Narain, member of EPCA, said the point was noted in the minutes of meeting and an agreement was made to issue a circular in this regard. “The matter could not be pursued due to assembly elections. But we will soon call a meeting to know the status of project and the plan for its implementation,” she said.

The civic official said that a number of cab operators, who had bought RFID tags, had failed to recharge them. “The whole purpose of RDIF project is to make transactions cashless, ultimately reducing bottleneck on borders. Once the transport department comes out with a circular making RFID tags compulsory for people applying for fresh registration and fitness certificate, we will request that these issues be looked into,” the official added.

Till date, SDMC — the nodal agency for operating toll plazas in city — has issued over 4 lakh RFID tags and claims to collect Rs 90 lakh to Rs 1 crore in toll taxes under the system. For months, SDMC has been complaining about thousands of private taxis and cabs crossing tolls from free lanes.

126,['3/03/2020'],ATMs run dry as cops weed out unsafe cash transit vans,"Residents queue up outside an ATM kiosk in Prayagraj on Monday

Prayagraj: Police crackdown against transit vans supplying currency to ATMs over security regulations has resulted into an inadvertent inconvenience: cash-strapped ATMs.

As people head to markets for shopping ahead of Holi, dried up ATMs are the last thing they want. The development comes days after police declared several cash transit vans unfit for operations for flouting security regulations recommended by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

In the wake of the forthcoming festive season, police on Monday have urged security agencies and banks to ensure that transit vehicles meet the mandatory security norms and to rope in more vans if necessary.

In a drive in February, police found that only two of 38 transit vans checked complied with RBI’s security guidelines. During the drive, only 15 vans were found working with functional CCTV cameras.

Following the drive, several such vehicles have been out of service, leading to the cash crunch. The checking drive was necessitated with recent cases of robbers targeting poorly guarded vehicles.

Long queues were also spotted at several ATM kiosks of various banks in Prayagraj on Monday.

Vinay, a customer, said, “ It took more than an hour to withdraw cash from an ATM in Civil Lines because of the long queue. Most of the machines near my home were out of cash.”\

IG (Prayagraj range) KP Singh said, “We have asked security agencies to see to it that their vehicles meet the required safety norms. Police had recently apprised banks and agencies about security regulations in a meeting.”

A senior official of a bank, preferring anonymity, said, “In the absence of cash transit vans, we are unable to fill up ATMs regularly. We are trying to resolve to the issue and things will be back to normal in a day or two.”

According to police, there are over 110 ATMs in Prayagraj and 70% of them are located outside banks’ premises.

127,['3/03/2020'],Rights panel seeks report on single-teacher schools in Thiruvananthapuram,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala state commission for protection of child rights has directed the state government to submit a comprehensive report on the difficulties faced by students and teachers attached to single-teacher schools across the state.

The commission chairperson P Suresh asked the education department to submit the report within three months. The commission intervention comes in the wake of the reports that a teacher in charge of a single-teacher school at Kunnathumala near here has been observing hunger strike in protest against non-payment of salary for the past five months.

The denial of learning opportunities to children on whatever reasons, including teacher strike owing to non-payment of salary, could not be accepted. According to reports, there are 270 single-teacher schools across the state and around 5,000 students depend on these schools for their education.

The government should immediately intervene to put an end to the plight of the single-teacher schools so that the educational rights of children could be protected.

The commission asked the general education secretary to submit a detailed report on single-teacher schools. The report should describe the condition of students in single-teacher schools, their academic standards, support available for their academic activities, infrastructure facilities, the service and salary details of teachers and availability of teaching learning materials.

Though the government had decided in October last to increase the salary of teachers in charge of single-teacher schools. But, it was claimed that such teachers haven’t received their salaries since then. Children in forest areas pursue their studies through single-teacher schools. The commission has the responsibility to ensure that students in forest areas also get ample education opportunities as promised by the Right to Education Act, it said.

The petitioner, P G Najpande, contended that on October 6, 2017, ministry of human resource development has issued a notification, giving one-time relaxation to assistant professors of national institute of technologies to appear for direct recruitment for the post of associate professor.

He said that in response to a petition, Punjab & Haryana High Court has struck down the notification and subsequent elevation of some assistant professors to the post of associate professors on the ground that jurisdiction to issue such a notification lies with the board of governors of respective national institute of technology and not the HRD ministry.

The petitioner said that some assistant professors of MANIT, Bhopal, were also elevated to the post of associate professors in accordance with the notification struck down by the Punjab & Haryana government as “null & void” and therefore, MANIT director should be directed to stop extending benefits, which such assistant professors are receiving upon elevation as associate professor.

He has also made associate professors, Hiralal Tiwari from civil engineering department and Dheeraj Agrawal of department of electronics, as respondents in the petition. Following preliminary arguments from both sides, the bench of Justice Sanjay Dwivedi issued notices to all the four respondents, seeking their response in four weeks.

Bhopal: Land marked for the main depot for Bhopal Metro rail development area at the Stud Farm has been converted into a car parking site. However, the Madhya Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation and district administration are yet to take notice.

According to reports, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) had recently penalised private two-wheeler dealers and four wheeler service station operators along the road for on-street parking.

“The vehicles were earlier parked on the main road in Jinsi. Post BMC action, two-wheeler dealers and service station operators carved out a space on the land that was allotted for Metro rail development corporation,” said Vikas Singh, a local resident.

Complaints of traffic congestion along the Metro development area have gone unnoticed by the administration.

“Furniture shops have been moved to the encroached area near the new flyover. Unauthorised parking is a huge issue, but the administration is turning a blind eye,” Singh alleged. The area is also next to a controversial slaughter house. So, 24x7 protection by private guards is needed in the area to avoid any damage to vehicles, said locals.

When contacted, Madhya Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation officials did not respond. “It is for the state government to clear the land and provide it for Metro rail development,” said a private company consultant with Bhopal Metro.

The area along Stud Farm is critical for Metro rail development. The main depot will be the command, control and service centre for all Metro rail trains operating in the city. Two Metro rail lines are being constructed in the first phase in Bhopal. It is behind schedule and, going by government estimates, the two lines are to start functioning by early 2022.

MEERUT: The count of people infected with swine flu reached 79 in Meerut district with the surfacing of a fresh case on Monday. This comes days after 17 PAC jawans were tested positive for the disease, sending shockwaves in the health department about the safety of other 370 jawans stationed here.

“One new case tested positive in Meerut on Monday, making the total 79 here. While no new case among PAC jawans has come since Friday, they have been quarantined and Tamiflu medicines were distributed to all of them,” said Dr Rachna Tandon, Meerut district epidemiologist.

Nine persons have died in Meerut so far due to swine flu, even as the health department is taking steps to contain the disease. A team from Lucknow, too, has visited Meerut to look for ways for better surveillance.

Meerut chief medical officer Dr Raj Kumar said, “All the people who have come in contact of those detected with swine flu have been given Tamiflu medicines. We have enough stock of medicines currently and if needed we will procure more medicines from the state authorities.

In counter, the state government passed orders of ‘No work, no wages” to force the agitators to back down.

However, leaders of the protesting employees said they have decided to continue with their plan to gherao Gairsain assembly premises on Tuesday — the first day of the budget session — and stop the emergency services across the Himalayan state from March 5.

The state employees, led by office-bearers of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees’ Association, including its chief Deepak Joshi and provincial general secretary Virendra Singh Gosain, boycotted work throughout the day on Monday. The protesters are demanding that the state government revokes its September 2019 order through which it has stopped promotion in government jobs.

The state government meanwhile was quick to react.

A letter written by chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh, addressed to all department heads, was sent out in the morning hours on Monday.

The letter mentions that the frequent strike and work boycott by the state employees was not only causing inconvenience to the people but at the same time was causing a hindrance in the implementation of government projects as well. It further mentioned that the work boycott was against the state government conduct manuals.

The letter added that “employees who boycotted work or participated in the protest or those who take leave to attend the protest” would be regard absent from work and would not get the pay for the particular period they are absent. “No work, no wages clause would be applicable on such employees,” the letter says.

Even after getting the ultimatum of the government, the agitating employees continued with their protest.

A delegation of protesting employees left Dehradun for Gairsain on Monday. Their leaders claimed that they would be joined by employees of other districts at Chamoli and that they will hold a gherao of Gairsain assembly building on Tuesday.

Provincial general secretary, Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees’ Association, Virendra Singh Gosain told TOI, “There is no question of backing now. Our demands are genuine. The Supreme Court has given a clear cut order on the issue and the state government has to comply with it. The state government is saying that it will inspect the issue. What is there to inspect?”

He added that from March 5, the employees would also stop emergency services across the state.

NEW DELHI: Most students have described Monday’s physics paper for CBSE’s Class XII examinations as lengthy and difficult. Some students have even started an online petition seeking lenient marking.

Shubham Malhotra, a student of Bhai Parmanand Vidya Mandir in Surajmal Vihar, alleged, “All sets of the paper were very difficult.” Malhotra, whose centre was a private school in the riot-hit Chand Bagh, was also supported by some of his friends.

Noshava Parveen, a student of a government school in northeast Delhi’s Tukhmirpur, said, “As soon as I saw the paper, I wanted to cry. The questions were tricky and even lengthy.” Another student at a centre in Yamuna Vihar said, “A question was even out of syllabus. I will be happy if I just clear this paper.” Some students complained that Set III was especially difficult. “The paper was JEE level,” claimed Ayush Prakash, a student.

According to the petition launched on change.org, “Last year’s Class XII batch had an extension of the moderation policy, which awarded grace marks, after Delhi high court intervened. CBSE has said the moderation policy has been stopped from this year. This is not fair as the previous batches had the moderation policy and the succeeding batches would have a reduction in the syllabus.”

A parent said her daughter had come back crying. “Today’s paper was confusing. CBSE says it is taking all steps to reduce stress. But today’s paper has put students under stress even for the coming papers,” said the mother whose daughter studies in a private school in south Delhi.

Last year, too, students complained about the physics paper being tough.

138,['3/03/2020'],Four CMs to discuss Sardar Sarovar dam on March 4,"Relief and rehabilitation of affected families will also be discussed during the meet

Bhopal: Six months after Sardar Sarovar dam was filled to its full capacity of 138 meters with Narmada water, leading to submergence in MP and displacement of about 32,000 families, chief ministers of the four stake holder states are likely to meet in Delhi on March 4 for a review on the project.

The meeting has been convened to discuss the height of the dam water, besides the relief and rehabilitation of the affected families. Besides Madhya Pradesh, the other states include Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The meeting is being held in the backdrop of controversies during the monsoon when MP levelled allegations of “violation of norms by Gujarat in filling up the dam”. Gujarat’s haste had hit the relief and rehabilitation work in the stat. MP has also demanded a few hundred crores from Gujarat as compensation for the loss it suffered.

The state government had even shot off a letter to the secretary of Union ministry of water resources to urgently convene a meeting of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA) in view of the “violations”.

The March 4 meeting is important for Madhya Pradesh as this is not a meeting of Narmada Control Authority (NCA), but it will be held under the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal, said Medha Patkar, the Narmada Bachao Andolan activist fighting for the relief and rehabilitation of the project affected families (PAFs). She said that MP should stick to the height of 122 meters till the rehabilitation process is not completed. However, highly placed sources claimed that this may not happen.

The four states “may not press for lowering the height of the dam water during the next monsoon”, sources in the Union ministry of water resources said. “It would be a national loss, but there would be a lot of emphasis on the relief and rehabilitation before the onset of the monsoon,” sources claimed.

After the dam was filled to its capacity more than 32,000 families in Dhar, Badwani , Khargone and Alirajpur districts of the state were displaced and farm fields, temples, mosques and government offices were submerged.

139,['3/03/2020'],UP sets up 24x7 cane procurement centres as pilot project in 3 districts,"Pilibhit: With a view to facilitating round-the-clock supply of sugarcane at cane procurement centres, the state cane administration is planning to set up model cane supply centres in 45 cane cultivation districts of the state under a pilot project. Till now, the cane was supplied by farmers to the procurement centres only between sunrise and sunset.

According to additional cane commissioner, UP, YS Malik, the project envisages at least one model cane centre in each cane supply circle of all the 119 sugar mills in UP. As the decision was taken late in the crushing season, 100% target will be achieved during the next crushing session.

“So far, five model centres have been set up in three districts. These include one each in Hardoi and Baghpat and three in Lakhimpur Kheri. Pilibhit will inaugurate its first model cane centre on Tuesday at Mathna Japti village under Kalinagar tehsil circle,” said Malik.

Under the pilot project, the model cane procurement centre will club two or three existing centres which are not giving the desired results.

The prime objective is to remove congestion of cane-laden vehicles at the centres and roads and address complaints of farmers regarding under-weighing and loss of juice content due to delay in procurement.

The model cane centres will be provided with adequate staff, trucks for transporting the procured sugarcane to respective sugar mills, sufficient labour for loading the sugarcane into trucks in addition to other facilities needed for prompt and unhindered cane supply.

Deputy cane commissioner at the statistics wing in the state cane department, RN Yadav, said, “UP produces over 215 crore quintals of sugarcane sown across 27 lakh hectare area. A major part of the produce is procured by 119 sugar mills.”

Meanwhile, Jitendra Kumar Mishra, Pilibhit district cane official, said the Mala cane centre, near PTR, has been merged with Mathna Japti model cane procurement centre. This centre of Pilibhit city-based LH sugar mill will be inaugurated by district magistrate Vaibhav Shrivastav on Tuesday.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: To reduce wastage of water and improve efficiency in water utilization, the Southern Railways has constructed a water recycling plant at Kochuveli railway station. The plant will be functional by the end of this month.

The water recycling plant has a capacity to treat around 1.4 lakh litres of water per day. The plant was constructed to meet the water demand and prevent water supply shortage at the railway station. The station will use treated water for washing coaches and for other cleaning activities.

As per railway policy, water efficient systems and water recycling plants are to be setup on railway land to improve water use efficiency by effective demand and supply management.

Ajay Kaushik, station director, Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station said, “Works of the plant has been completed. Now, water quality test is in progress. The water treatment plant will be commissioned by the end of this month”.

KWA connection is the water source at Kochuveli station. The water used for coach cleaning and maintenance work is let out through to the sewage lines. With the launch of the new plant, the water used for cleaning the coaches will be treated at the plant and will be used again for cleaning purposes.

The used water will be collected in large pits constructed at the station and a connection is given to the recycling plant. A ground-level reservoir with 1-lakh-litre capacity will store the treated water. From the reservoir, the water will be pumped to an overhead tank of 90,000-litre capacity and used for coach cleaning and maintenance work.

Kochuveli station is among the major coach maintenance centres of Thiruvananthapuram division and the water supply demand at the station is around 3.5 lakh litres.

Another proposal to construct a water treatment plant at Thiruvananthapuram Central station is under consideration.

Prayagraj: Popular messaging applications and wireless technology enabled devices are coming in handy for racketeers involved in mass cheating in Prayagraj and adjoining districts.

Investigations into the cheating racket busted on Sunday by the special task force (STF) have revealed that the college staff sent the mathematics question paper (intermediate) to a solver soon after the seal of question paper packet was broken.

A manager-cum-principal of a UP Board examination centre and his son were among three persons arrested on Sunday for running a cheating racket in trans-Yamuna area of Prayagraj district.

The accused were identified as principal Indrabhan Singh, his son Ashish Singh and a solver Vikas Yadav, all from Meja.

The STF is also looking for a former staff member of the college who was a key link in sending of question paper to solver.

According to STF officials, five screenshots of the question paper were sent to the solver through WhatsApp. The solver was provided both A and B sets of answer sheets in advance which had the code numbers of the college.

Talking to TOI, additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said, “The college staff was in constant touch with the solver outside the centre. He was immediately provided the question paper once the seal was broken for distribution.”

“STF had received a tip off about a gang of three running a copying racket in trans-Yamuna area. An STF team was active around the college which nabbed the solver while he was writing copies near a brick kiln,” said Pandey

“The college principal-cum-centre manager had provided answer sheets in advance for writing answers and computer teacher (son of college principal) was collecting the answer sheets,” he added.

The accused charged candidates around Rs 35,000-40,000 to provide copies of solved question papers of all subjects and a solver was paid around Rs 3,000-5,000 for writing a copy.

When cops nabbed the college principal, he initially denied charges against him claiming that the copies did not belong to his college.

However, when the police team showed him the college code written on copies, he confessed that he had provided A and B sets of copies to solver.

“The college was under STF radar for last three years. We are looking for a former college staffer, Shailesh, who has been sending question papers to solvers,” he said.

“Involvement of an assistant teacher, who was performing duty at an examination centre and currently evading arrest, has also been established in sending or receiving solved answer sheets in connection with Kaushambi answer sheet recovery case,” Pandey said.

The university, in association with the Madras Chamber of Commerce, is working on a software that will raise an alarm when it senses interaction between two students in the exam centre, passing of answer scripts, moving of seats or any other abnormal movement during the examination.“We are hoping to make the process more stringent to reduce malpractices. We can debar colleges from holding exams and students too will be asked to repeat examinations or be debarred if malpractices are detected,” she said.In February, the university had asked 35 exam centres holding MBBS exams in the state to livestream the tests. A team of officials were monitoring the livestreams from a control room in Guindy as 12,000 students wrote their semester exams. While it did help in creating a feeling that they were being watched, it was not adequate to catch malpractice such as mass copying or using gadgets to find answers.The medical university conducts examination for medical, dental, AYUSH (ayurveda, yoga & naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy) and other medical-related streams in around 500 centres.Medical students are given bar-coded answer scripts and question papers are sent to examination centres half an hour before the examinations.Exam centres must download the question papers using a unique password and print them out only minutes before they hand it over to the students to prevent any leaks.

Anand Mohan, the chief conservator of forests (wildlife) in Kota said, “ The miscreants have chopped trees using battery operated saws. There is a threat to the species. We are investigating the local people’s involvement, as felling cannot be done without their connivance.”

The forest officials of Kota, Baran and Jhalawar are having sleepless night as the trees are being cut at an alarming rate. Areas targeted by the timber mafia include Shahbad, Manohar Thana, Bakani where trees are available in plenty.

Jhalawar DFO Hemant Singh Shekhawat said, “ We have seized many vehicles in Jhalawar transporting khair illegally from Rajasthan to Madhya Pradesh. Two prime accused from Haryana and Gujarat who were alleged smugglers were also arrested in the district and handed over to MP officials for interrogation. We are awaiting the information about the location from where these trees were cut.”

The forest administration at Jhalawar has also issued direction not to release the vehicle carrying khair after compounding (paying off penalty).

As many cases are coming to light, forest officials also demanded to constitute Special Task Force (STF) in the state to check illegal felling and smuggling of khair trees similar to the force in Madhya Pradesh (MP). A forest official source said, “The government should issue advisory to make prior permission mandatory for felling of this species.”

Sources said, after the import of Gambier from Indonesia and Malaysia reduced, demand for khair wood increased as ‘kattha’ is prepared mainly from the water extract of the heartwood of this tree. The red part of the wood is used for making ‘kattha’, a main ingredient of the paan.

“The cost of this tree is four times than the usual ones. At present its wood is sold between Rs 5,000 and Rs 50,000 as per market demand,” said a source.

The tree also has medicinal value and is used for making medicines for treating ailments like skin, neck, tooth, diarrhoea and lung infections.

155,['3/03/2020'],Tobacco trader robbed of Rs 5.5 lakh,"Nashik: A city-based trader was robbed of Rs 5.5 lakh by two suspects in the Gandhavari Nagari area of the city on Saturday night.

According to an officer from Upnagar police station, the 61-year-old trader and his son were returning home after shutting their shop when they were intercepted by the suspects.

“The complainant and his son were in their car when one of the suspects broke the vehicle’s glass window and snatched the bag containing the cash. They have an agency of tobacco products in Subhash Nagar area of Nashik Road,” he said.

“The suspects might have kept an eye on the complaint for a long time. They must have followed the trader right from the time he shut his shop and started driving towards his home. The money was supposed to be deposited in the bank on the next day,” he added.

The suspects, after grabbing the bag, got into their car and fled. “The trader managed to note the registration number and make of the vehicle.

156,['3/03/2020'],"Bhopal: Opened in a hurry, new overbridge taken over by chaos, risky driving","Inaugurated on Feb 14, the much-awaited bridge has now turned into an accident-prone spot

BHOPAL: The recently inaugurated Bawadia Kalan railway overbridge is increasingly becoming an accident-prone spot.

In absence of proper signages, commuters, who want to go from Hoshangabad road towards Bawadia Kalan, often move wrongly in one-way, from both ramps. This poses risk of accidents on the bridge. It is a similar problem for commuters coming from the bridge, they too roll down from the wrong sides in one-way despite proper signages displayed above the bridge.

The other major factor which makes the bridge accident-prone is that barricades are arranged by the police ahead of the triangle-shaped island separating both the ramps coming from the side of Hoshangabad Road. Police have arranged the barricades as temporary dividers which often get dislocated from their position and pose risk of accident.

The 661-metre Bawadia Kalan overbridge was inaugurated on February 14. A TOI team visited the bridge to conduct a live check and found many vehicles running up on the bridge from Hoshangabad Road side in the wrong lane. Most of the people were not aware that they were taking the wrong lane to climb the bridge as there are no signage installed on both the ends of the bridge.

TOI also found that the barricades arranged temporarily to form divider by traffic police to segregate both the ramps connecting Hoshangabad Road were dislocated from their position and may cause accidents. There was no cop deployed on both the ends to guide people on one-way.

A major accident took place at BRTS cut point on Sunday night, in front of Bag Sewania police station in which a truck, which came from Bawadia Kalan overbridge, rashly took a U-turn at the BRTS cut point in front of Bag Sewania police station. Two bike-borne youths moving behind the truck couldn’t control the bike due to the sudden developments and rammed into the truck. A 25-year-old youth, who was riding pillion on the bike, died while his friend sustained injuries.

Investigation officer SI Virendra Sen said that although the incident took place 200 metres away from Bawadia Kalan overbridge, the root cause of the accident is that there is no cut point near the bridge so the vehicle rolling down from the bridge often take U-turn in front of Bag Sewania police station to go towards Mandideep and it increases the probabilities of accident.

ASI Ramesh Singh of Bag Sewania police station said that people take short cut from BRTS cut point in front of the police station and go towards the Bawadia Kalan overbridge in the wrong lane to take a short cut. It further aggravates the problem.

Traffic expert and assistant professor at department of architechture and planning at MANIT, Dr Anuj Jaiswal, said that there should be proper signage installed on both sides of ramp as it is mandatory to guide people in case of any diversion. He said that ideally there should be divider constructed ahead of the triangle-shaped island above the bridge and proper safety measures should be put up. Retro reflectors should also be put up along with one-way signages.

Dr Jaiswal said that traffic marshals should be deployed to make people aware of the one-way on Hoshangabad Road side.

SDOP (MIsrod) Anil Tripathi said, “Police will ensure strict compliance of one-way rule at the Bawadia Kalan overbridge.” ASP (Traffic) Pradeep Singh Chouhan said that he has already written a letter to the Bridge Corporation and asked to rectify the shortcomings, ensure all road safety norms on the newly inaugurated bridge. Police have made temporary divider using barricades to segregate both the ramps. The agency concerned should construct a divider as soon as possible and install proper signages.

157,['3/03/2020'],MJP varsity exams: 150 students booked for cheating in six days,"Bareilly: As many as 150 students — 130 girls and 20 boys — have been booked in the past six days for using unfair means during examinations conducted by Mahatma Jyotiba Phule (MJP) Rohilkhand University. On Monday, a total of seven students were booked in the three-shift examinations.

The annual examination is being conducted at a total of 322 centres in nine districts of Bareilly and Moradabad divisions. The exams are being conducted in three shifts — 7am to 10am, 11am to 2pm and 3pm to 6pm.

Examination controller Sanjeev Kumar said, “Most of the students booked for using unfair means were found to be copying from cheating slips. A special committee constituted for the purpose will decide their fate.”

According to officials, the answer sheets of such students were seized along with the cheating material and they were given new answer sheets. If it is proved that a student cheated during exams, s/he can be disqualified.

Regional higher education officer Rajesh Prakash said, “Every day, we seek details of students booked for using unfair means from the university to focus on the exam centres where cheating took place. As most of the cheating cases were reported from Shahjahanpur and Bijnor, we are paying special attention to the centres in the two districts through the live-monitoring system to check cheating.”

To monitor examination live at the centres and to keep a check on the use of unfair means, two control rooms have been set up in Bareilly — on the campus of MJP Rohilkhand University and at regional higher education office. The staffs deployed at the control rooms keep an eye on webcasting to check the use of unfair means. The monitoring is being done from 6.45 am to 8 pm.

A total of 4.57 lakh students — 3.33 lakh regular and 1.23 lakh private — were registered for the final exams of MJP Rohilkhand University.

158,['3/03/2020'],University final exams from today,"Prayagraj: With this year’s final examinations set to start from Tuesday, Allahabad University has introduced several measures to ensure a fair evaluation process.

AU controller of examinations (CoE) Ramendra Kumar Singh said this year the examinations would conclude a week earlier as compared to last year. “The exams would start from March 3 and will end on May 1. The examinations conducted in the second half of the day would conclude even on April 21,” he added.

Singh said that university plans to declare results by June 30. In 2019, AU had to issue over 600 provisional certificates to students applying to other colleges because of the delay in declaration of results.

He said an examination cell will be set up in constituent colleges with a senior teacher as its in-charge to ensure that examinations are conducted smoothly. “We have also formed a WhatsApp group with exam cell in-charges and college principals as its members. This would also help in sharing important information like corrections in question papers in the middle of exams without wasting time,” he added.

Singh said that the AU examination committee has also fixed norms for evaluation of answersheets. “Every examiner will have to complete evaluation of answersheets of theoretical exams and, submit the award sheet and evaluated answersheets within three weeks of getting them. Teachers evaluating practical exams would be given a week to turn in results and submit award lists.”

The authorities have also made changes in guidelines related to students caught using unfair means (UFM) during examinations. Students caught using UFM will debarred for a year from the university. The period was two years earlier.

AU chief proctor RK Upadhyay said examinees should enter the university only through the KPUC and Union gate and should not bring their mobile phones with them

160,['3/03/2020'],"Delhi: IGL will make gas meters, lines up Rs 1,100 crore war chest","NEW DELHI: Indraprastha Gas Ltd ( IGL ), the country’s largest CNG and PNG service provider by sales and number of vehicles serviced, will soon start manufacturing household gas meters to reduce dependence on imports from China and secure a piece of the Rs 4,390 crore market for such ancillaries expected to open up as the government expands city gas service to 407 districts.IGL managing director E S Ranganathan said the company was ready with a Rs 1,100 crore investment plan for expanding CNG stations and pipeline network to meet an expected double-digit growth in city gas demand in 2020-21. The company will have 559 CNG stations by the end of the month and plans to add another 60 in 2020-21. IGL took piped gas to 2.8-3 lakh homes in the current fiscal and will maintain the same pace in 2020-21.Ranganathan said the gas meter manufacturing foray was prompted by the fact that supplies will be vulnerable as majority of these are imported — mostly from China — as demand rises on the back of expanding city gas networks. “There is space and need for domestic manufacturing to reduce reliance on imports and promote ‘Make in India’. We will also supply meters to other operators after meeting IGL’s needs,” Ranganathan said.IGL will invest Rs 100 crore to set up the factory to manufacture 10 lakh mechanical and smart meters a year and partnership talks are at an advanced stage, he said. Analysts saw the manufacturing foray as part of IGL’s preparation for life after it loses the monopoly over Delhi, the country’s largest CNG and PNG market, as per the regulatory norms. “The backward integration is smart planning. The timing is also right as demand will rise as city gas networks start rolling out in the next few years. It will give IGL a competitive edge as it expands to newer cities,” an analyst said.A brainstorming session with states organised by the oil ministry to promote the use of natural gas pegged the market for mechanical meters at Rs 1,850 crore and smart meters at Rs 2,540 crore. The government has set a target of taking piped gas service from 55 lakh at present to 4 crore in the next 3-4 years.The city gas expansion drive is part of the Centre’s bid to cut India’s carbon footprint by raising the share of gas in the energy basket from 6% to 15% by 2023. Only 34 geographical areas in the country had city gas networks till 2014, when Narendra Modi became PM. Since then, his government has given out city gas network licences for 174 geographical areas that will cover 70% of the population and 53% of the country’s area spanning 400 districts across 27 states.The push for natural gas has seen the number of households with PNG connections rising to 55 lakh and CNG stations to 1,838, marking a growth of 14-15% in the last five years. Total PNG connections are expected to rise to over 4 crore, while the number of CNG stations are expected to swell to 10,000 by 2024 as more cities get city gas service.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74452413,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-84229,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/igl-will-make-gas-meters-lines-up-rs-1100cr-war-chest/articleshow/74449155.cms

162,['3/03/2020'],Inquiry committee of UP Bar Council stays KBA election,"Kanpur: The annual election of Kanpur Bar Association ( KBA ) has been stayed by the two-member inquiry committee of the Bar Council of UP on Sunday.

The two-member committee, comprising Panchu Ram Maurya (chairman) and Ajay Kumar Shukla, after hearing the representatives of the elders' committee and complainant Pawan Kumar Tiwari and others, observed that the representatives of the elders' committee had admitted that some names were added after the publication of the electoral list. Some of them had confessed in writing that as their names were included in the electoral list wrongly therefore their names should be deleted.

Pawan Kumar Tiwari, a candidate for the general secretary's post had raised an objection and filed a complaint before the Bar Council of UP, alleging that the elders' committee, which was conducting the annual election of KBA, had included some names without having COP number in the electoral list.

The inquiry committee observed that after perusal of the facts it is clear that the electoral list is disputed. For fair and free election, a perfect electoral list is mandatory, therefore COP and the computer departments of the Bar Council of UP were directed to cross-check the COP numbers of the voters of the electoral list and ensure that this work must be completed within a week, the committee said. It would be appropriate that the election was held after cross-checking the electoral list, it added.

The stay, which was a set back for several other contestants of the election, on Monday submitted a representation before the elders' committee in respect of the order of the Bar Council and urged to conduct the election on a pre-fixed date that is March 3.

The contestant claimed that the high court and even the Supreme Court had stated in several petitions that once the election process started then it should not be stopped. ""Since the election process of KBA election had already started in February last and only voting and counting is left, therefore, the election process cannot be stopped in the wake of citations set by the high court and apex court"", he added.

The sub-registrar of firms and societies in his order had directed the elders' committee on February 29 to redress the points raised by Pawan Kumar and others and conduct the election as per the rules of Kanpur Bar Association and therefore the committee should conduct the election.

Locals and tourists alike were surprised by the rain, which soaked the core areas of the town. The surrounding areas witnessed moderate showers.

By drenching the hills, the rain would help check forest fires, forest department officials said. “Wild animals will also benefit from the rain,” an official said.

Farmers were waiting for the sky to open up, said R Murugan, a local farmer. “Most of the agriculture land parcels are not cultivated because we were waiting for a good shower to wet the land. It is also good for standing crops like carrot and cabbage.”

The rain will benefit both farming lands and tea gardens, an official of the horticulture department said. “It was a summer shower. We expect a few more in the coming weeks,” he said. “We expect the plants in the Government Botanical Garden and the Government Rose Garden to bloom soon.”

The rain also brought down the temperature in Ooty. “Days had become very warm in the past weeks,” said a resident.

However, the showers did not reach Gudalur, Coonoor and Kotagiri taluks.

NEW DELHI: Doctors at a private hospital in the city recently removed a large mass of solid tumour, the size of a cricket ball, from the brain of an eight-year-old girl. It took nearly six hours to separate the tumour from the tissues and excise it.

Neurosurgeons said a neuro-navigation technique was used to conduct the surgery given the risks involved.

“Joyford Honest John, a Tanzanian national, was admitted to our hospital with complaints of recurrent seizures, vomiting, aphasia, urinary incontinence, diminution of vision, and right side weakness of the body. An MRI of the brain was suggestive of a large left frontal mass lesion with midline shift which was occupying more than half of the cerebral hemisphere with a tumour size of 8.7x8.6x7.8cm,” said Dr Anil Kansal, director and head of the department of neurosurgery at BLK Centre for Neurosciences.

He said brain tumours are rare in kids specifically and such large tumors are the rarest. “In John’s case, this highly vascular tumour presented several risks of surgery, including the risk of paralysis of a limb or any other neurological deficit. Excess bleeding was also a major risk,” he added.

Police said the students — around 17-year-old, were on their way home after appearing in the Class XII board exam when the accident took place. The injured were admitted to a private hospital, where they are under constant medical supervision, while the bodies were sent for autopsy. The victims’ families were informed about their death.

According to police, the victims — Sunny Pratap, Rajkumar Kashyap and Ranjeet, all students of Saraswati Shishu Mandir — were on their way home after the exam when their bike collided head-on with another bike. The collision was so massive that riders of both bikes suffered critical head injuries. They were rushed to a nearby private hospital, where Ranjeet was proclaimed dead upon arrival whereas Rajkumar and Rajat, who was riding another bike with his friend Deepak as a pillion rider, died during treatment, said police.

Rajat was a resident of Dataganj in Budaun district, while Ranjeet and Rajkumar were residents of Bhamora.

Omveer, elder brother of Rajat, who was riding the bike, told TOI, “My brother took my motorcycle as he had plans to spend some time with friends after their last paper. We were at home when police informed us about the accident. Rajat had passed away when we reached the hospital. My brother had been riding the bike for the past two years and he never met with an accident.”

Superintendent of police (SSP) Shailesh Pandey told TOI, “Three students of Class XII died after a head-on collision between two bikes. They were returning home after appearing in the board exam.

167,['3/03/2020'],Delhi: Bumps on Munirka flyover undo gains from new RTR flyover,"NEW DELHI: When the 2.7-km Rao Tula Ram Marg flyover — which branches from the Munirka flyover and ends before Army Research and Referral Hospital near Subroto Park close to National Highway-8 — was opened after a seemingly endless wait, it was expected to transform the lives of commuters.While the new flyover has indeed eased travel between Gurugran and IGI Airport , the macadam layer on the Munirka carriageway has come undone at various places, rendering it a bumpy ride. Potholes on the adjoining old RTR flyover have added to the chaos, with motorists having to slow down to avoid them.Public Works Department claims that it has put the task of resurfacing flyovers across the city on the fast track, but the ground reality is different. Motorists say the condition of the flyover surface has been unchanged for months now. “This is an important flyover and should be repaired at the earliest,” said a commuter, Rajesh, who regularly takes the route.Officer-goer Kishan Kumar added, “The situation here is terrible during the morning and evening peak hours. With motorists trying to evade the bumps, only a small part of the carriageway can be used and so traffic bunches up. For people who have offices near the airport, it’s a daily nightmare.” Most motorists TOI spoke to said they were spending at least 20 minutes extra on the road due to the bumps.The problem gets ramified because these two flyovers also connect several south Delhi colonies with IGI Airport and are used by a large number of foreigners and dignitaries visiting the capital. While the monsoons and the construction ban imposed by the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority in the wake of the rising pollution in the city have often been cited as the reasons for stalling of infrastructural work, officials are at a loss to explain why the broken roads couldn’t be fixed when all they required was overnight action.A PWD official said the flyover would be resurfaced by the end of March. “Since repairs were last conducted a couple of years ago, some patches have become uneven.

He also told them to identify vacant and unused land in different districts that could be used for industrial promotion or industrial clusters.

The chief minister also told the officials to prepare a list of the available land in each district and match them with the industrial requirements.

He has submitted a report on the sources for converting these waste land into use for various purposes, including industries.

The chief minister directed the officials to be in constant touch with the National Building Construction Corporation to have ideas on utilising unused government waste land.

The chief minister felicitated Gupta for visiting the state and providing inputs to the government on the Mission Build AP, an innovative programme to develop the state.

“Getting illegal arms is easier in the state while for a person obtaining licence for arms is very complicated,” Singh pointed out. The circumstances in the state now are such that a person essentially requires arms for self-defence and one’s own safety, however, obtaining a licence is not possible at all without higher approach, the MLA said. He added, “Not only this, getting his licence renewed for arms is also a complicated procedure.”

The Congress MLA added that contrary to ‘zero harassment’ policy of police the inherent successor of a deceased arms licence holder finds it difficult to get the licence renewed even a year after filing application.

On the other hand, anti-social elements can easily get illegal arms, the MLA said. “As many as 6,129 cases of illegal arms were registered in the state in last one year (between January-December, 2019) but the number of those who obtained legal arms stood at only 490,” he pointed out.

The MLA asked the state home minister to take a serious note of the issue.

179,['3/03/2020'],Delhi: Confusion over fire NOC for farmhouses,"Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: Confusion still persists over the requirement of fire no-objection certificate ( NOC ) while applying for the licence to hold weddings or events at farmhouses in south Delhi. The recent changes made by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in its policy regarding the issuance of fire NOCs has left the deliberative wing of South Corporation divided.

“As per DDA’s new policy, licences will be issued for weddings and events on the basis of structure, health and hygiene of the premises. However, it adds that the fire department will have to make its own arrangements for checking the fire-related facilities at the venues. We are working on the same lines, but the members of standing committee have decided to go through the DDA’s policy in detail before taking a final decision,” said Kamlajeet Sherawat, leader of the House at SDMC.

The issue was discussed in the standing committee meeting held on Friday, but no clear consensus emerged out of it as the councillors had mixed opinion over issuance of licence without the fire NOCs. Another meeting in this regard will now be held this week.

“Some councillors are of the view that the fire department should verify the facilities on its own. In case of violations, they can inform us later, and we can accordingly impose penalty or take sealing action. However, a few others say that it is the civic body’s responsibility to ensure that everything is in place before the permission for holding events at farmhouses is granted,” said the official.

In 2018, SDMC had allowed weddings and events at farmhouses amid opposition. It had then suggested mandatory fire NOCs from the fire department for the licence.

There are more than 100 farmhouses and motels across the national capital. As many as 38 farmhouses are in SDMC’s south zone and Najafgarh zone, and 31 others fall under the jurisdiction of North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

180,['3/03/2020'],India ready for bigger role: S Jaishankar,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In a world which is “fractured… with polarised debates”, India is willing to step up to the plate and play a larger global role, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Monday.

Addressing a conference by the Centre for Policy Research here on Monday, he said India’s challenge is “undertaking deep reforms and addressing long-standing governance issues.”

Referring to the emerging geopolitical landscape, Jaishankar said Indian strategy will have to be more “complex and nuanced in a world which is changing faster than we can imagine, as we struggle to absorb a nationalistic America, a rising China, a divided Europe, a re-emerging Russia , a normalising Japan , an insecure ASEAN, and an even more disturbed Middle-East. Other continents and regions are not without their own challenges, including ours. Economic rebalancing has now started to translate into its political manifestation. And that means a fundamental overhaul of the global architecture”.

The “rebalancing” of the world, he said, is “accompanied by growing nationalism across vast geographies. There is no question that the overall mood is more competitive; some would say more selfish. The very nature of politics has changed in different societies and the disapproval of those who lost out does not make it less legitimate”.

Multi-lateralism is a casualty, alliances have eroded as the US has changed its own outlook and demeanour, he said. Interestingly, this opens up the space for “pluri-laterals” and coalitions of the willing, as well as middle powers, like India which find greater space. “Perhaps it is only logical that India should emerge as an industry leader in this regard, whether it is the RIC, SCO, Quad or JAI,” he said.

An equally big challenge comes from the fact that while supply chains, connectivity , terrorism, climate change and pandemics cut across national borders, there is less inclination among the big powers to coordinate and work together, he said.

The foreign minister said the economic challenges had multiplied. “The world trading system has felt the pressure of gains that some accrued from structural advantages. At one stage, it had to turn political; it finally did. But today, this argument extends to non-trade domains like connectivity projects, technology choices, data protection and security as well as IPR adherence. All of them have strategic connotations…”

He said India’s economic decisions in terms of trade and opening up have acquired a different complexion. “Our economic engagement with the world also requires careful deliberation and effective preparation lest we end up eroding our own capacities ... it is a complex exercise that deserves serious strategising.”

He said India had made a difference to international outcomes in recent years. “Whether it is in terms of technology, best practices or resources, there is a proclivity to partner with a nation whose prospects are clearly so assured. … We have significantly shaped the connectivity debate at a time when the world was still confused. And backed that up with a plethora of projects, including in our immediate neighbourhood. Our single-minded campaign against terrorism has brought that issue into sharp focus in key world forums,” he said.

Calling for more “sober conversations”, Jaishankar said, “Not only has the landscape become more difficult but the very articulation of interests has come under challenge. Competition is not just amongst states but often within them, reflecting the tension between the older order and the emerging one. When ideologies, identities and history mix with business, politics and strategy, it can create a very potent cocktail.”

181,['3/03/2020'],Farmers likely to receive paddy procurement dues tomorrow,"Amaravati: Civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar said that the government will clear paddy procurement dues to farmers by Wednesday.

He refuted the charges that the state government was not procuring paddy from farmers. He said that they have already purchased about 44 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers during the Kharif season and gearing up to launch the Rabi procurement from April 1.

Speaking to media after a high-level review meeting held by chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, civil supplies commissioner Sasidhar, however, said there was a little delay in clearing payments to farmers due to the delay in reimbursement of the amount from the Centre.

He said that the CM had directed them to tie up with bankers and clear the dues by Wednesday. “We have yet to receive the second and third quarter dues from the Centre for paddy procurement which resulted in a delay of about two weeks in release of payments to farmers. We have cleared payments to over 80% of farmers,” said Sasidhar.

He said that a delegation headed by civil supplies minister Kodali Nani recently met the Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan and requested him to release the pending dues. “The CM directed us to take advances from banks and Nabard to clear the dues of the farmers before getting the funds from the Centre,” said Sasidhar.

He appealed to farmers to call on 1902 to get assistance regarding procurement centres close to their villages. He said that there was no truth in officials rejecting the farmers stocks at the procurement centres.

Bhopal: The all-students theatre group of Bhopal School of Social Science (BSSS) attempted to set a world record for the longest running drama covering ‘The Journey of India’ by staging a 48.5 hour long drama at the college auditorium from February 29 to March 2. Sixty students, part of the drama group, participated in the drama.

“The drama began at 12 noon on Saturday and ended at 1 pm on Monday. The play covered the rich history of India, starting right from the Indus Valley Civilization, the life and times of Gautam Buddha, Maurya dynasty, advent of the Mughals, the British Raj and finally the freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi,” said Manju Mehta, PRO of the college.

Mishkat Usmani, a third year student who wrote the script along with another team leader Shibli Saquib, told TOI the difficulties the students faced while planning and execution of the drama. “Last year we set the world record for staging a street play for maximum number of times. This year we wanted to set up another record for staging the longest play. But we were shocked to know that the current record for the longest play was a good 28 hours unlike our expectation of 8 to 10 hours. But it did not let us down. We accepted the challenge. A team of 60 students of the college drama group ‘Mayaar’ willingly accepted the challenge,” said Mishkat.

But it was not a cake-walk. “At first, we decided to stage the life of Mahatma Gandhi. However, we realised that a person who will play Gandhiji’s role will have to be on the stage all the time without getting any rest. So we opted to show the history of India, starting right from the Indus Valley Civilization.”

Speaking about coordination in over five months of planning, Shibli said, “We divided the students in two teams of 30 actors each. But as we were all so excited, hardly anyone slept.”

Each of the participants played six characters, practicing day and night to get into the skin of each character with dialect and accent. The play was inaugurated by public relations minister P C Sharma.

NEW DELHI: Pointing out that it is a policy decision, Delhi high court on Monday upheld the AAP government’s move to provide free travel to women on DTC and cluster buses. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar dismissed the petitions challenging the scheme.

Appearing for the government, standing counsel Ramesh Singh had earlier defended the decision arguing that the government had the power and jurisdiction to bring out enabling policies. Citing Article 15 (3) of the Constitution that provides special provisions for women and children, Singh submitted that the government’s decision can’t be termed discriminatory.

The court saw merit in the government’s stand and dismissed the combined plea opposing the free travel scheme on buses operated by DTC and Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System at the expense of taxpayers.

“It imposes a financial burden on the public exchequer,” the petition had contended and sought that the October 28 notification be declared as “illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory and unconstitutional”.

One of the petitioners was a woman. The woman lawyer urged that the free travel concession should be provided to the elderly, minors and poor segment of the society, irrespective of their gender.

The petition had challenged the government’s October 28, 2019, notification by which a provision was added in the Delhi Transport Corporation (Free and Concessional Passes) Regulation of 1985 to make travel free for women. The scheme and the regulation were contrary to the Motor Vehicle Act and impermissible under the Constitution, it added.

The plea also said that due to free travel for women on DTC and cluster buses, small-time operators were getting fewer passengers.

A detailed copy of the order with reasons is awaited.

Jodhpur: IIT Jodhpur has developed Rajasthani clay-based solid lubricant for industrial applications . This lubricant works well in temperatures ranging between -50 and 1,100 degrees with very low friction, resulting in less wearing of machines.

Presently, the most successful solid lubricant in vogue ails with fast decomposition and sulphur toxicity at temperature above 400 degrees, besides high costs.

“So we felt the need to develop a high-performing friction-reducing solid lubricant for various mechanical and tribological applications like in aviation, space, steel, cement and automobiles industries at variable temperatures,” said Rakesh Kumar Sharma, head of the research team of the chemistry department of IIT, which has been engaged in the development of clay-based efficient low-cost technology from the last one decade.

189,['3/03/2020'],Wrong entries in revenue records make life a struggle for farmers,"Amaravati: With the issue of prohibitory land register remaining unresolved, a group of farmers from Nambur village in Guntur district met the governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan recently and sought his intervention to resolve the issue.

According to Bonthu Ayyappareddy, who led the delegation, about 700 acres of land spread over 90 survey numbers in their village was earmarked as dotted land. “These plots of land are purely patta (private) land belonging to farmers. In the revenue records, prepared during 1912 and later, these dotted land were surveyed and recorded as patta (private) land and we were given giving patta numbers and pattadar names. After nearly 110 years, the revenue department has erroneously marked them as dotted land in 2015,” said Reddy.

Surprisingly, the situation has not changed even eight months after YS Jaganmohan Reddy took over the reins of the administration as the revenue department continues to be reluctant to resolve the issue. “Entry of agriculture land into dotted land register has completely ruined several families as they cannot sell their assets even in emergencies,” complained another farmer.

In the meantime, while the revenue department has failed to resolve the issue despite the expiry of several deadlines in the last few years, farmers having been running from pillar to post. The farmers have been rendered helpless as they are unable to sell their own assets due to the wrong entries in the revenue records. The land, which were in the possession of farmers for decades and generations, have also been pushed into prohibitory land register (dotted lands) leaving the farmers in distress.

After the issue taking political overtones, the TDP government hurriedly issued an ordinance to empower the joint collectors to resolve the dotted land grievances. However, the then governor ESL Narasimhan had turned down the ordinance. Then, the government had asked the district collectors to clear nearly 90,000 petitions filed by the farmers ahead of the general elections. However, the district collectors could not address even 5% of the farmers’ requests.

He was replying to a question by SAD MLA Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra, who claimed that farmers who left stubble in their fields had to face insect attack on the next crop of wheat. He had asked the government if it planned to compensate such farmers. “Such fields are lying vacant and farmers have spent large amounts, up to Rs 10,000 per acre,” he said.

Manpreet said losses were suffered only over 200 acres, and that too in cases where farmers did not consult the agriculture department on how to deal with the problem. He added the state government had taken up the matter with the Centre so that the compensation for tackling stubble was made a part of the MSP.

Chandumajra said the state government’s inputs were incorrect, and a committee of the House should be constituted to get a clear picture on the ground.

The deceased, identified as Yogesh Saxena alias Monu, used to work in a garments shop in Qutubkhana market.

The autopsy report has revealed that there were deep wounds caused by a sharp weapon on the neck which caused the death. Police have filed an FIR against unidentified persons under IPC section 302 (murder). They also suspect that the killer burned the body to hide the identity.

SHO Geetesh Kapil said, “The victim was unmarried and was speaking to someone over the phone when he was possibly attacked by his killer. Personal enmity seems to be the motive behind this murder as the accused didn’t even take the victim’s mobile.”

Yogesh’s elder brother Anurag told the police that his brother used to work at a garments store for the past five years. On Sunday, he left for the store in the morning but didn’t return home at night. The charred body of Yogesh was recovered on Monday.

“The accused attempted to conceal the identity by burning the body but couldn’t succeed. We have gathered certain evidence and a breakthrough is likely in 24 hours,” Kapil added.

Kanpur: The Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) successfully erected first pier (pillar) cap on Monday, in around three and a half months after the work of Kanpur Metro project work started in the city.

The achievement was accomplished by the UPMRC approximately three months earlier as compared to Lucknow Metro Project.UPMRC officials said that Lucknow Metro is being accredited with the title of Fastest Constructed Metro in India but the work of Kanpur Metro Project is going at even faster paster than that of Lucknow.

UPMRC managing director Kumar Keshav performed a puja at the site after which the very first pier cap was erected with the help of a giant crane. This pier cap has been erected at the Pier or Pillar number 19 situated between IIT-Kanpur and National Sugar Institute.

On this occasion, Kumar Keshav reiterated the commitment of entire UPMRC team in undertaking this project in a record time to give a world class Metro system to the city in the shortest possible time.

While SAD protested outside the assembly to demand release of graduation degrees, AAP MLA Meet Hayer raised the issue of non-payment of post-matric scholarship during a call attention notice.

In reply to Hayer’s question, cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharmsot admitted to the payment of scholarship being delayed. He said the Centre was yet to release the money for 2018-19.

SAD, meanwhile, said educational institutions had not issued the degrees because of the state government’s failure to release post-matric scholarship. SAD MLA from Dera Bassi N K Sharma said students who completed the final year of graduation in 2017-18 were still waiting for their degrees. “Last year, the Congress government earmarked Rs 800 crore for post-matric scholarship of Dalit students. But the finance minister failed to release the amount and now, these students are facing harassment by educational institutes,” said Sharma.

In reply to Dharmsot, Hayer said other states in the country were facing the same problem, but they had come to the rescue of students by releasing the scholarship money from the state exchequer. “Despite high population of Dalits in the state, the government is doing little to safeguard their interest,” said Hayer.

SAD MLA Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra took up the issue of adulteration in food items, such as milk products and artificial ripening of fruits. In response, Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu highlighted the government’s efforts in tackling the issue and also shared the figures of cases registered against those including malpractices of adulteration.

196,['3/03/2020'],Punjab assembly unanimous on Punjabi: Teach it in all schools till Class X,"Charanjit Singh Channi

CHANDIGARH: Punjab assembly on Monday unanimously passed a resolution to promote Punjabi language by making it compulsory till Class X in non-government schools and introducing court judgements in the language.

It was also resolved to push for suitable status to the language in Chandigarh. Moving the resolution, cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi said, “The House recommends to the state government to take necessary steps for teaching Punjabi language as a compulsory subject in all government and non-government educational institutions of the state up to Class X.”

He said the fact that certain private schools penalised students for speaking Punjabi on the premises promted them to bring in the resolution. He said all sign boards in the state should have Punjabi on top and the rules of the assembly should also be in Punjabi. The resolution added: “The House also recommends to the state government to enact necessary laws along with proper arrangements to check activities and steps to be taken foragainst the promotion of Punjabi.”

Channi demanded setting up of a commission, so that government officers and employees used the language for official work. As part of discussion, SAD legislative group leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said the decision to make Punjab teaching compulsory should be extended to convent and other private schools in the state.

Channi said as per a United Nations (UN) report, Punjabi was ranked 12th among 7,000 languages spoken across the world as more than 16 crore spoke the language in 150 countries. “However, UN has also warned that the language faces the threat of becoming obsolete in 50 years and we must address the worry,” he said.

“People feel it is English that needs to be focused on. Recently, South Korea approached us for hiring manpower, but insisted that they should learn their language first. We need to have a similar approach,” he said.

Channi narrated his personal experience wherein he could not perform well in science subjects as he was not very conversant in English. “That is why I got the books of technical education curriculum translated after I was given the portfolio,” he said.

“I met former Himachal CM Prem Kumar Dhumal some years ago and told him that his state should make Punjabi as second language, but he said it would lead to politics as Punjab might stake claim over Punjabi-speaking areas,” said Channi.

Supporting the resolution, LIP MLA Simarjit Singh Bains rued that recruitment exams of government bodies like PPSC and PSPCL were still conducted in English and many deserving students were left out. “English is seen as a status symbol and students are punished for speaking Punjabi,” he said. AAP backed the resolution and its MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the start for promotion of Punjabi should begin from the assembly, and the speeches of governor and CM should be in it too. “If that does not happen, we will boycott it,” he said. Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema sought a tribunal be set up to take action against private schools and officers who do not use Punjabi.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday sought a report from police on measures taken to treat and rehabilitate riots victims in northeast Delhi.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar posted the matter for April 30 when it would examine if police have complied with the court’s February 26 order, which directed them to ensure rehabilitation of the victims.

The court was hearing a plea where a bench headed by Justice S Muralidhar had ensured safe passage of ambulances to the injured. It had also appointed advocate Zubeda Begum as amicus curiae to monitor progress by various agencies in relief and rehabilitation work.

On the intervening night of February 25-26, there was a special hearing at Justice Muralidhar’s residence after he received a call from an advocate explaining the dire circumstances where it was not possible to move the victims from a small hospital to GTB Hospital.

Stepping in, the court had directed the police to ensure safe passage for the injured to government hospitals and provide emergency treatment. It had also ordered police to deploy all resources to ensure the injured received immediate treatment, if not at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital then at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) or Maulana Azad, or any other hospital.

The Monday’s hearing saw standing counsel Rahul Mehra informing the court that the existing number of helplines was still inadequate to deal with the sheer number of calls being made by the victims.

Advocate Suroor Mander, who appeared for the petitioner, Rahul Roy, told the court that most rehabilitation measures were being carried out by the affected community itself, and cited the February 26 order to urge the bench to ensure more measures were taken to set up relief camps. The bench, however, said it would wait for the police to file its response in three weeks before listing it for April 30.

Ankit, resident of Bahawadi village in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh, was found hanging from a shower fountain in the jail of the military station on Friday night. According to available information, Ankit had gone on an annual leave but he didn’t report on duty after the prescribed period. As per rules, on February 6, he was directed to spend 28 days in the makeshift jail as punishment.

Talking to mediapersons, Ankit’s brother Pardeep Malik alleged that despite his brother’s body being found in mysterious circumstances in the highly-secure military station zone, the family had been kept in dark. “We have been running from pillar to post asking the authorities to show us the spot from where his body was found,” he said, adding that even after three days, Ankit’s body had not been handed over to the family.

Ankit had been serving in the Army for the past five years. “Late on February 28 night, we were informed by the Army authorities that he committed suicide and postmortem of his body was also been done,” he said, adding that the way authorities had been dealing the case had raised suspicion.

When contacted, Abohar City-1 station house officer (SHO) Chander Shekhar said the police had imitated the proceedings as per evidence collected from the spot and statement of the Army officials, but if the family of the deceased had any doubt, the matter could be probed again.

Meanwhile, the higher officials at the Abohar military station assured the family that the entire matter would be investigated properly and if need be, the autopsy on the body would also be conducted in presence of a medical board, to their satisfaction.

199,['3/03/2020'],"In next 3 years, Raja Bhoj Airport to add 16 new aprons","Bhopal: Air connectivity from Bhopal is all set to undergo a sea change with enhanced services and frequency of flights as 16 new aprons will be added in the next three years. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) have already approved the proposal.

Thus, Raja Bhoj Airport, Bhopal will have a total of 33 aprons almost doubling the present 17.

Director airport, Anil Vikram confirmed to TOI that the Bhopal airport has recently received approval from AAI for the new aprons.

Airport apron or parking stand is part of an airport, other than the maneuvering area intended to accommodate loading and unloading of passengers and cargo, refueling, servicing, maintenance and parking of aircraft, and any movement of aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians necessary for such purposes.

The apron is not usually open to the general public and a permit may be required to gain access. The use of the apron may be controlled by the apron management service (apron control or apron advisory) to provide coordination between the users.

“We have 17 small and big aprons at the airport presently,” said Vikram. He added that the construction of the new 16 aprons will be done in next 2-3 years.

Asked the reason of more aprons, Vikram said, “In past one year air connectivity has increased drastically. In the next schedule, more is to come. In such a situation, we need to have more parking area at the airport. The decision has been taken considering the growth in flights and future prospects.”

He said that besides the aprons, two new aerobridges are also being constructed at the airport. “We have two functional aerobridges at the airport presently,” said director Vikram.

According to the tentative summer schedule, the number of flights, operating from Bhopal and connecting different cities, will be increased to 60 from the existing 42. To launch the international operations from Bhopal airport, state government is in talks with Indigo and Air India. Officials said that international airport operation from the state capital is set to start in 2020 itself.

State government is keen to get international operations from Bhopal to Dubai and Bangkok. Last year, a joint team of Union home ministry and Union civil aviation ministry had visited Bhopal airport to assess facilities available to start immigration facilities. The team had submitted a positive report stating that the facilities at the Bhopal airport were satisfactory to start immigration services.

200,['3/03/2020'],Rushikonda Beach inches closer to securing Blue Flag certification,"Visakhapatnam: Experts who were on a recent visit to Rushikonda Beach for auditing, inspection and a national-level meeting said that around 75 per cent of the work towards Blue Flag international certification is over. A few challenges remain to be addressed in order that the process of scrutiny and submission of the final application before the international body can be done before the June deadline.

To qualify for the certification, stringent environmental and safety criteria must be met.

Rushikonda is the only beach in Andhra Pradesh and one of the 13 beaches in India vying for the Blue Flag international eco-label assigned by the Denmark-based Foundation for Environmental Education ( FEE ). “For the last two years, works are in progress by the district administration and the tourism department for fulfilling the required parameters. The Centre is providing funds worth Rs 7.35 crore for the purpose,” informed Rushikonda Beach project manager S V Phanindra.

Speaking to TOI, Sujeetkumar M Dongre, national operator, Centre for Environmental Education (CEE) Blue Flag India and representing the Society for Sustainable Urban Development (SSUD) said, “The blue flag certification aims at ensuring coastal or beach protection and enhancing local livelihood through sustainable tourism activities. Factors that are being worked out include water quality in the bathing area, beach management such as preventing erosion, protecting the dunes and vegetation, fishery and so on, keeping the beaches clean and free from plastics, pollution and other non-biodegradable waste and looking into the safety aspects and making the beach disabled-friendly.”

Certain infrastructural facilities such as container-based toilet blocks and bathing rooms, first aid, parking facilities, boards and signages and food kiosks are being set up.

“However, apart from littering and accommodating small-scale hawkers at one place, multiple use of the beach simultaneously for bathing, fishing and water sports is a challenge. Timing for the above three activities should be earmarked and designated zones meant for each should not overlap. The beach management committees (BMC) constituted should oversee these conflicts,” said Dongre.

As per norms, if work continues without hurdles and the gap analysis is carried out, the BMC will have to apply for certification.

A national-level jury will scrutinise the shortlisted application and based on its satisfaction, the application will have to be submitted to the international jury in Denmark by June 9. The final scrutiny by the international body will then be undertaken before assigning the ‘Blue Flag’ certification.

203,['3/03/2020'],Cops ill-equipped to apply brakes on reckless drivers,"Vijayawada: Police and road transport authority (RTA) are struggling to check speeding on Andhra roads that accounts for 80% of the casualties in state. Authorities claim they are ill-equipped, in terms of equipment and manpower, to mitigate the accidents .

On average, around 600 people are killed every month in road accidents in Andhra Pradesh and speeding is one of the major reasons.

The ministry of road transport and highways report on road accidents state that 8,060 people were killed in Andhra Pradesh in 2017 and 7,556 people lost their lives in road accidents in 2018. The data further reveal that speeding was the reason for 6,196 fatalities in 2018 while the number of fatalities due to speeding was 6,768 in 2017.

In view of the fatalities in road accidents due to speeding, RTA has been monitoring the speed of vehicles by using over 13 speed laser guns (one in each district). “We require at least 20 more upgraded laser speed guns to book the offenders, who violate the speed limits rule in the state,” said SAV Prasada Rao, joint transport commissioner, road safety.

“The absence of display boards which cite the speed limit on some stretches is another reason for vehicles speeding. There is a need to make motorists aware of road-condition as a precaution to mitigate road accidents,” he added.

It is not easy to check speeding vehicles and negligent driving round-the-clock with the minimum infrastructure and manpower. Besides, monitoring the speed of vehicles at night is another challenge for the police, said a senior police officer.

In some countries, GPS system is installed in vehicles. The system tracks the speed of the vehicle and routes and helps the police and RTA check if the driver had been driving above the speed limit, RTA officials added.

There is no immediate solution to control speeding. The government has to come up with proper mechanism at major stretches in the state to reduce road accidents, said AH Khan, a member of Road Safety Committee in Visakhapatnam.

The STF had arrested the mastermind of the sex racket Ibrahim Khan and his wife Ruksar Begum from Pipili area in Puri district on January 21. Following the interrogation of the couple, the STF arrested another couple, Panchanan Padhi and his wife Preeti Padhi on February 5.

So far, the STF has rescued nine women, including seven trafficked sex workers from Bangladesh, during the course of investigation. “We are in touch with the ministry of external affairs (consular division), Patiala House in New Delhi for early repatriation of the trafficked women from Bangladesh. In turn, they will move Bangladesh high commission for nationality and other verifications of victim girls from Bangladesh,” a written statement by STF said. “After getting verification, the high commission issues travel permit for victims.

205,['3/03/2020'],Prolific chain snatcher continues to outwit cops,"Representative Image

NASHIK: A single chain snatcher, who has been wreaking havoc across the city over the past two months, has managed to evade the police .

While the police teams have his description and are out in good force to nab him, the suspect has so far eluded them. Senior police officers, however, said it was just a matter of time before the chain snatcher was arrested and put behind bars.

Over the past month, chain snatching cases have been reported at least once every two or three days. There have times when two or three cases were registered with the police on a single day. The highest number of chain-snatching cases were reported from the Mumbai Naka, Ambad and Adgaon areas.

In most of these cases, the police believe a single person is involved. Police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil said: “Based on the victims’ inputs, we have the criminal’s description. Frequent nakabandis are being organised to catch him.” The commissioner added that the criminal involved was a local man and not one of the chain snatchers who come to the city from places like Ambivali, Kalyan and Srirampur.

The chain snatchers usually target women either in the early morning or late evening hours. They also look for preys in the afternoon. While elderly women walking alone on the road are easy targets, young women too are not spared.

Police officers said that they were working on ways to control the menace. Most chain snatchers, who were on police record, are under vigil or behind the bars. Many have also been externed.

During chain snatchings, the victims often suffer injuries on their necks or even fall on the road. Market places, jogging tracks and deserted roads are where most chain robberies are committed.

206,['3/03/2020'],Glorification of violence: Artists from film industry call for ‘self-restraint’,"Patiala: The Punjabi movie industry has called for ‘self-restraint’ against glorifying violence and gangsters and also calling upon the government to follow laid down protocols to ensure artistic freedom.

Film artists from Punjab, including actors Japji Khaira and Deep Sidhu, film-maker Harpreet Devgan, singer-actor Singga, Yad Grewal, Vimal Chopra and Amarinder Singh Raju, while interacting with mediapersons at Patiala on Monday, maintained that the power of cinema to influence the society cannot be undermined and at the same time the youth should understand that movies are a source of entertainment and should learn to differentiate between real and reel world.

Sidhu said the kind of cinema being produced in Punjab had matured over time and become more intellectual. Any decision to ban a song or a movie should be taken after referring the matter to a competent authority, like the censor board, he said. While replying to another query, Sidhu said cinema was responsible for the kind of content that was being generated, but government should ensure artistic freedom. He said social and political environment should be conducive for the growth of art and music and the artists should not be made to live under the fear of FIRs and intimidations of police action.

He said the state should also evolve its education system to generate a sense of social responsibility among the youth and not just target the songs and movies for glorifying guns and gangsters.

Devgan said registration of cases against film producers was a bit out of context and governments should be more tolerant towards art.

209,['3/03/2020'],Certificate printing machines soon,"Nashik: The district administration has decided to install a machine at all tehsil offices where people from rural areas will be able to collect printouts of the certificates they need.

The viability of one of these machines — presented by a company through CSR funds — was being carried out at the district collectorate on Monday.

The district administration had decided to start the kiosks around three years ago to help the farmers take printouts of 7/12 extracts without anybody’s help.

“We wanted to integrate other services so that the data could be transferred on real time basis and the beneficiaries could take the prints and use them. This will cut down the number of visits people make to the Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLE),” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.

As many as 20 machines are likely to be deployed across the district. The designs of the machines were presented at the collectorate wherein the officials inspected the technical viability, user-interference and compatibility with the government’s expectations.

The machines will be installed at tehsildar offices and if the administration gets more such devices they would also installed at important market places.

“The machine will not receive any applications for the certificates. For applications people will have to go to the Aaple Sarkar Seva Kendra (ASSK) or even the VLEs. But when it comes to taking a certified copies or certificates, people can go to the kiosk, scan the receipt given to them at the time of making an application and collect the print,” a senior official said.

COIMBATORE: The city police deployed 100 personnel at Gandhipuram on Monday evening following a tussle at the pro-Citizenship Amendment Act protest venue on the Dr Nanjappa Road.

As many as 500 Hindu Munnani (HM) members had launched the indefinite protest against the indefinite ‘Coimbatore’s Shaheen Bagh’ protest, being staged by Muslim organisations at Athupaalam in the city.

Police said when the protest was about to begin, Shahul Hameed, an autorickshaw driver from Selvapuram near the city, walked by the protest venue, while taking over his mobile phone. “Hindu Munnai members confronted him and picked up a quarrel. They accused him of clicking pictures of the protest using his phone,” a police officer told TOI.

Following this, Hameed called his friends, who arrived at the spot in 20 autorickshaws, and picked up a quarrel with HM members.

Sensing trouble, the city police deployed a posse of 100 police personnel, including armed reserve police personnel carrying tear gas, at the spot. They pacified both the parties and sent Hameed and his friends away. Police personnel were also posted on the Gandhipuram Flyover.

The auto drivers went to the Kattoor police station and lodged a complaint against the HM members. They said the members used inappropriate words against them and attacked them. Deputy commissioner of law and order L Balaji Saravanan promised to investigate the incident.

HM members also lodged a police complaint against the Muslim men who, they said, had tried to film them erecting the canopy at the protest venue. They said the men used inappropriate words and threatened them. They would not call off their demonstration till the ‘Coimbatore’s Shaheen Bagh’ protest is called off, they said.

Muslim migrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan have settled in the city, HM functionary C Dhanapal said. “They should be ousted. As there is a false propaganda against the Citizenship Amendment Act, we are demonstrating in favour of the Act,” he said.

BJP, RSS and VHP have extended support to the demonstration.

The protesters vacated the venue at night after police instructed them. They plan to return on Tuesday.

The judge slapped a penalty of Rs 40,000 each on PSCB junior engineer C Arulmojy and mazdoor K Andrews Miller and a penalty of Rs 20,000 on area inspector P Kalidoss.

According to the prosecution, Arulmojy, Andrews and Kalidas entered into a criminal conspiracy and demanded and accepted a bribe of Rs 10,000 from M Tamilselvi for releasing the third instalment of financial assistance for constructing houses under Perunthalaivar Kamarajar centenary free housing scheme.

They entered into a criminal conspiracy again and misappropriated the third instalment of Rs 15,000 sanctioned to the beneficiary by forging her signature and failed to disburse the instalment to her.

The anti-corruption branch of the CBI booked the three following a complaint by Tamilselvi. The trial concluded before the principal & district and sessions' court. The judge found them guilty and convicted them.

219,['3/03/2020'],Edappadi K Palaniswami: BJP general secretary meets CM Edappadi K Palaniswami about pro-CAA rallies,"Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: BJP national general secretary Muralidar Rao on Monday called on chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to discuss the national party’s ‘ CAA outreach programme’ in Tamil Nadu. Rao, who is also BJP’s Tamil Nadu in-charge, told TOI that it was a routine meeting between the NDA allies. The meeting assumes significance as it comes in the wake of Bihar assembly passing a resolution against NRC and Palaniswami’s casual remark to reporters last week that his government was considering all such issues. The BJP has been organizing a series of pro-CAA rally across Tamil Nadu to counter the ongoing protests by Islamic organisations.

Meanwhile, state ministers P Thangamani and D Jayakumar were busy in New Delhi, meeting Union home minister Amit Shah. It is unclear what their Delhi agenda was and if they discussed the opposition’s anti-CAA narrative with Shah.

Muralidhar Rao said, “I shared with the CM our party’s outreach programme on CAA across the state. Everyone knows that CAA has got nothing to do with the Muslims. It has nothing to do with Indian citizens. It was a routine meeting.” The BJP leader had taken part in a rally in Kanyakumari district on March 1.

Accusing the DMK and its allies of indulging in a misinformation campaign on the citizenship amendment law, Rao said the AIADMK leadership and the BJP had a clear view on the subject. “We have good clarity on the subject. Are Muslims affected? Where is NRC? We discussed the issue as alliance partners,” Rao said. The AIADMK had endorsed the safe passage of CAA in both houses of Parliament in December. The ruling party has not heeded the opposition demand to pass a resolution in the assembly against CAA, stating that the matter was sub-judice.

Rao and the chief minister are said to have discussed the current political situation in Tamil Nadu, besides the state getting speedy sanction from the Centre for setting up 11 new medical colleges. On reports of Tamil Nadu ministers meeting Amit Shah in New Delhi, Rao said, “They might have gone on ministerial work. It is only a coincidence that I am here, and they are there,” Rao said. The state government chose not to issue a statement or photographs about the EPS-Rao meeting and AIADMK MPs, attending Parliament, seemed unaware of the ministers’ visit to the capital.

They sought protection from verbal abuse.

The workers also sought a piece of land to construct a temple in the area. This comes a week after residents from the area petitioned the collector stating that 2.15 acres of open space reserve were being encroached for building a temple.

The workers, both permanent staff and contractual staff, said they have been living in a section of Kamarajapuram near Ganapathy for the past 15 years. A few other residents are insulting them based on their profession and caste, they said.

Menaka Ilangovan, a contract worker, said, “They use degrading language and ask us why people cleaning excreta need a temple.”

Another worker V Palani Amma, a corporation employee for 23 years, said, “They call us sewage cleaners at places of public gathering like water pipe at the end of the street,” adding, “How can we pray in the temple with them.”

A week ago nearly 50 residents from Kamarajapuram urged the collector to not use 2.15 acres of open space reserve land to construct a temple or a church.

On Saturday evening, parts of taluka received very heavy rain. Some places were also pelted with hail. This damaged the standing crop in fields that were ready to be harvested, officials from the district administration said. The crop damage panchanama was carried out immediately by the district administration to assess the area affected on a primary basis. “As of now, it is estimated that crops on 900 hectare were damaged. The detailed panchanama is awaited,” the officials added.

They said in 13 villages, crops in 250 hectare were damaged by the heavy rainfall. Crops affected include wheat, maize, groundnut, gram etc. The area affected by hail was three times more — 750 hectare. Sources said the detailed panchanama was being carried out and the exact quantum of the crop loss would be calculated after that.

The numbers of farmers affecetd would be finalized in a week. The sources said that as of now, the government has not announced any help to the farmers hit by weekend’s rain and hail. However, the administration is preparing a report and the same shall be presented to the relief and rehabilitation department of the government for further action. The rain and hail lashed the villages in Jalgaon Khurd, Jalgaon Budruk, Kasari, Pokhari, and several others in the Nandgaon taluka.

2,800 hectare affected in state: Relief minister

Meanwhile, Maharashtra relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar told the legislative council on Monday the rains had damaged crops over an area of 2,820 hectare in the state and those affected will get financial assistance after assessment reports are finalised.

“The Centre offers financial assistance to farmers affected by hailstorm, but not those who lose crops due to untimely rains. We will try to address this issue.”

222,['3/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Builders needn’t wait endlessly for NoC,"CHENNAI: Individuals and developers planning housing projects may no longer have to run from pillar to post of multiple departments seeking no objection certificates (NoC) as the government would fix deadlines for each agency for issuing the certificate. The initiative would be part of ensuing a single-window clearance system which will be the lone online platform to apply for planning permissions across the state. Presently, there is no deadline for issuing NoCs in the manual process.Housing and urban development department sources said a list of departments that would issue NOCs would be displayed after a user logs onto the portal to file their applications for planning permission. “They need to just click and apply for NoCs to the respective departments. Then, the application would be sent to departments concerned for processing. If there is no response within a specific period, the application would be considered deemed-to-be approved,” a senior housing and urban development official told TOI.But, deadlines for each department have not been fixed yet, the official added. “The single-window clearance portal is likely to be launched in another six months after testing by Tamil Nadu e-Governance Agency,” the official said.Applicants are required to collect NoCs from five to ten departments and agencies including traffic, fire and rescue services, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, public works department, Airports Authority of India and the ministry of defence depending upon the location of the construction site. Securing NoCs is a cumbersome process as there is no deadline for issuing NOCs at present. Representatives in the construction sector have been complaining about delays in obtaining the key document, which adversely impact construction work.Retired professor of urban engineering at Anna University K P Subramanian said s deemed-to-be NoC comes with a rider. “In the event of violations taking place (after obtaining NoC), the concerned department or agency can take penal action against the applicant,” he added.Meanwhile, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) has sought that building permits issued by the local bodies must also come under the purview of single window clearance system. “It is the need of the hour to reduce the time in commencing constructions without any delay,” the association's Tamil Nadu chairman S Sridharan said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74450068,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125590,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/builders-neednt-wait-endlessly-for-noc/articleshow/74448397.cms
223,['3/03/2020'],"By 2030, pollution in city set to reach huge levels","Nagpur: 15-20% of the deadly particulate matter 2.5 is coming from coal-fired power plants located in and outside the city. By 2030, the pollutant’s emissions are expected to reach 81,250 tonnes in Nagpur.

This comes forth in an analysis done by UrbanEmissions.info — a repository of information and research on air pollution. Based on 2015 monitoring data, the analysis attributes nearly 27% concentration of PM2.5 to the industrial sector. Other major contributors of air pollution are transport, domestic cooking, open waste burning and other outside sources.

According to founder of UrbanEmissions.info Sarath Guttikunda, there have not been any changes in the sectors since 2015, in terms of interventions to curtain emissions at source. “Only intervention we are looking forward to is the BS-6 fuel from April 1, 2020,” he said.

The analysis also states that the vehicular emissions are expected to remain constant in the city by 2030, if BS- 6 standards are introduced.

Further stating that power plants within and outside the Nagpur’s airshed (geographic boundary for air-quality standards) is contributing around 15-20% of the overall PM2.5 in the city, Guttikunda stated that enforcement of emission regulations at old and new power plants is a must.

TOI has been regularly reporting on how the city is choking under apocalyptic pollution from five coal-fired power plants within a radius of 40 kilometres. Apart from this, two new units of 660MW each at Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) are set to add more toxicity to the city’s air. The units are awaiting terms of reference (TOR) for environmental clearance.

As per the analysis, the city needs at least 22 continuous air quality monitoring stations for efficient reporting on pollution. “This figure is based on the thumb rules designed by the Central Pollution Control Board in 2003, which takes into account the population density, urban/rural classification, industrial emission loads, and the level of commercial activities in the airshed. Based on estimated emission loads and population metrics, 22 stations are needed,” said Guttikunda.

In 2015, the average PM2.5 concentration in the city was twice the national permissible standard and over eight times more than the safe limit prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Suggesting mitigation measures, Guttikunda said, “Key interventions like aggressive promotion of public transport, immediate enhancement of waste management to cut down open waste burning; enforcement of emission regulations at old and new power plants and at all other heavy industries; encourage greening of the streets and parks; and regular maintenance of the roads to curtail road dust re-suspension are needed.”

""Planning permissions to construct houses would be issued only for approved and regularised plots,"" he said.The state government had announced an amnesty scheme after the Madras high court imposed a blanket ban on registering plots lacking statutory approvals in September 2016 following rampant conversion of agricultural land as residential plots all over Tamil Nadu. Owners of unapproved plots and unauthorised layout promoters were warned that houses coming up there would lose power connection, water supply, and drainage facilities.Meanwhile, the DTCP is also witnessing a jump in the number of layout applications in the last three years, thanks to curbs on unapproved plots.

As per the labour department rules, job workers are entitled to wage revision every three years, but wages have not been revised since 2014, they said in a petition to the Coimbatore collector. “We require a 50% increase in wages to sustain till 2023. Master weavers pay us Rs 3 to Rs 5 per a metre of cloth we weave depending on the variety, thickness and length. We weave 50 to 60 varieties of clothes using power looms. The wages for those varieties also depend on thickness and measurements,” association treasurer E Boopathy said.

The wages should have been revised in 2017, the official said. “But they refused and blamed it on the bad economy. Also, the government did not push it further. Three years have passed. We now want wages relevant now and for the next couple of years,” said Boopathy. “We owners have to meet a lot of expenses like rent, electricity and wages for our labourers.”

There are more than 500 job working units in the Coimbatore-Tirupur belt spread across 110 villages, which produce 70 lakh metres of cloth on a daily basis. “We employ a large chunk of the two lakh-odd power loom weavers in the belt,” Boopathy said.

The new blueprint has a longer road and thus requires more land, a petition said. “We represent residents and nearly 1,000 farmers who stay along the route of the new design, from Madukkarai till Narasimhanaickenpalayam. We are not against the bypass, but only want the officials to stick to the earlier design, under which the road was 27 kilometres long. It required less land. The new road will be 32.43 kilometres long and require more land,” the petition said.

The new design involves acquisition of nearly 355 acres of land, currently under cultivation. “Thousands of farmer families depend on the land for livelihood. They will find it difficult to buy another piece of land and conduct cultivation using the compensation amount provided by the government,” said Kandasamy, a farmers from Madukkarai.

The land marked for acquisition as per the new plan is fertile and has good irrigation facilities, the petition said. “Important crops such as foxtail millet, banana, turmeric and other long-term and short-term crops are cultivated on this land.

The court heard the petition filed by former legislator and TDP leader Tenali Sravan Kumar challenging the action of the police in detaining Naidu and failing to provide security to mass contact programmes of former chief minister.

Vishakapatnam police commissioner R K Meena and DGP D Gautam Sawang on Monday filed responses in the high court stating the reasons for issuing CrPC 151 notices to Naidu and detention.

The HC after examining the affidavits directed the DGP Sawang to present before the court and explain the reasons for the detention.

Former advocate general Dammalapati Sridhar argued on behalf of the petitioners. The petitioners argued that the police were imposing unreasonable restrictions on the rallies conducted by opposition parties. They argued that the police detained Naidu instead of controlling the ruling party mob who obstructed Naidu from going head with his Praja Chaitanya Yathra.

CHENNAI: Troubled by haphazard vehicle movement, Medavakkam residents have demanded that the highways department remove portions of the median at two intersections on Mambakkam Main Road to ensure smooth flow of traffic and for the safety of schoolchildren. The stretch, off the arterial Velachery-Tambaram Main Road, is one of the busiest roads in the area, frequented especially by parents and other vehicles ferrying schoolkids.

“There are five schools in the neighbourhood and residents use Mambakkam Main Road to reach them,” said M Guru, who uses the stretch frequently.

TOI visited the stretch and noted that motorists have to traverse dangerously at the intersections from Babu Nagar 1st Main Road and 3rd Main Road. A week ago, there was an accident near a temple along the stretch due to unregulated movement of vehicles, residents said. They are of the opinion that their demand to secede a portion of the median is not an extraordinary request. Residents also urged that steps must be taken soon to construct speed breakers on the stretch and relay access roads.

When asked, a state highways department official said traffic police have to assess the complaints of the residents for the centre median to be cut off.

Unchecked parking of vehicles, including water tankers, along the road has made life of motorists harder. Widening the road proved useless as carriageway space is reduced. Traffic on the stretch has also been affected due to delay in completion of the flyover on Velachery-Tambaram Road.

Residents are pining that a change in guard in the district administration will put an end to their woes. The village panchayat, which was with the Kancheepuram district, is now part of the newly carved Chengalpet district. “We have started petitioning the new district administration to elevate our neighbourhood into a town panchayat. Despite having a population of more than 50,000, the area is still a village panchayat,” said a resident.

Athawale had come to Nashik to pay tribute to Kalaram Temple agitation — started by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar for allowing entry of Dalits in the temples.

Talking about riots in Delhi that claimed over 45 lives, the union minister of state said that the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were responsible for the violence.

“The Narendra Modi-led government has been doing exemplary work for over five years. The Congress and AAP were unable to find any issue with the government. So they came together and made an issue out of nothing — the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) meant for the religious minorities in the neighbouring states. They took the opportunity and you see what has happened in Delhi,” Athawale said.

He also said that National Register of Citizenship (NRC) was limited to Assam and has nothing to do with other parts of the country. “Even if it did, we know the exercise would be carried out in a manner that the genuine people would not be affected by it,” Athawale said.

On the agriculture front, union minister said he was in touch with farmers from Vietnam about a sugar cane variety that consumes only 20% of the total water that is consumed by the sugar cave variety in India.“We are meeting on April 16 to understand the modalities of the sugar cane variety that consumes less water,” Athawale said.

232,['3/03/2020'],All broad gauge lines electrified in Bhusawal divn,"Nashik: With the electrification of all the branch lines, the Railways has completed 100% electrification of the broad gauge (BG) route within the Bhusawal division of the Central Railways.

The last leg of the BG electrification was taken up and completed in the Chalisgaon-Dhule section over the span of four years. For the first time on Monday, the Chalisgaon-Dhule passenger train ran on electric (instead of diesel) locomotive.

Railway officials said after Mumbai and Nagpur, Bhusawal division is the third division of Central Railway to complete 100% BG electrification.

According to the officials, Bhusawal-Igatpuri electrification was completed in 1968; the Bhusawal-Badnera section was electrified in 1988-90; the Bhusawal-Khandwa section was electrified by 1992.

There were two more broad gauge lines and two more metre-gauge lines to be electrified then.

While the broad gauge lines have been electrified, the two meter-gauge lines will be electrified only after they are converted into broad gauge lines.

The 16km Jalam-Khamgaon branch line, originating from Jalam junction on the main line, was electrified in 2007.

The work on the 57km Dhule-Chalisgaon line was carried over the past 5 years. Dhule-Chalisgaon experiences very heavy traffic. Several coaches originate at Dhule and are attached to two long-distance trains.

The electrification of the section will help the passengers travelling between the two stations as the turnaround time of the trains will decrease because of the better hauling and braking power of electric engines.

The electric engines will also reduce the per-kilometre cost of operations.

The diesel engines are very high on maintenance and other costs.

As far as travelling goes, passengers will take lesser time and will get more trains on the section which will be extended now. Later, the line will be connected to the Surat line after the work on the Dhule-Nardana line, as proposed in the current budget, is completed.

The apex court was hearing a plea filed by Doon-based animal rights activist Gauri Maulekhi who alleges that despite repeated reminders by the Supreme Court since 2001, majority of states only have “dummy SAWB”. Maulekhi claimed that even the states, which have set up SWAB, have not given any power or funds to the body. She alleged that SWAB exists only on papers in those states and the “helpless animals there do not get any protection”.

“In Uttarakhand, too, the state of affairs in this regard is really poor. None of the dog breeders or pet shop owners have registered themselves with the SWAB. This is a clear violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (dog breeding and marketing), Rules 2017 and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Pet shop) Rules 2018,” Maulekhi told TOI.

Notably, on September 25, 2019, R Meenakshi Sundaram, secretary of animal husbandry department, had released a government order asking all the stakeholders to ensure its implementation “in letter and spirit.” However, the order went unheeded.

According to the officials of SWAB, a significant percentage of dog breeders and pet shop owners in the country do not qualify for getting a registration. Reacting to this, Maulekhi said that “such facilities should then be closed.” “Any illegal practice related to animals should not be taking place,” she said.

CHENNAI: For about 10 months now, officials and staff at the Justice (retd) A Arumughaswamy commission , formed by the government in 2017 to probe the circumstances surrounding former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death , have been sitting idle at their office in Kalas Mahal in Chepauk.

On April 26, 2019, the Supreme Court stayed the proceedings of the commission after hearing an appeal filed by Apollo Hospitals. The hospital group had argued that only a medical board should look into the former CM’s treatment issues.

The government is paying salary to panel staff, all of whom were deputed from different departments, for doing nothing. This includes the judge himself and two cops who are deputed for security. Meanwhile, another extension of four months was given to the commission last week.

Sources at the commission said the government is trying to get the stay vacated but the next SC hearing is yet to come up. The panel with around 10-15 staff comes to office everyday and checks the Supreme Court registry in anticipation of the hearing date, sources said.

“The tentative date was February 25 and then it was pushed to March 3 and then 17 and now 24,” a source said.

The commission members correspond with government officials on next course of action as well as getting the affidavits ready, a source said when asked about the panel’s daily routine. The initial mandate of the commission was to file a detailed report within six months; however, it has been more than four times that time-period. Official sources said despite documenting testimonies of more than 100 witnesses including doctors from the hospital, the commission cannot start work on writing the report as it would be a violation of the SC stay order.

Retired Madras high court judge K Chandru said for the government it was important to keep the issue alive as it was started to ensure that some mouths were kept shut. “All commissions of inquiry are a waste of public money,” he said.

239,['3/03/2020'],Delhi: Lawyers volunteer to provide free legal aid,"On Monday, activists and lawyers were seen helping people at hospitals, police stations and government offices

NEW DELHI: Even as the riot-affected people try to come to terms with loss of life and property, a large number of volunteers are on the ground to provide legal and administrative help.

On Monday, activists, NGOs, volunteers of political parties and lawyers were seen helping people at hospitals, police stations and government offices.

In Mustafabad, members of Indian Civil Liberties Union (ICLU) had set up a help desk in a school. Abhisht Hela, a lawyer and an ICLU member, said they were taking complaints about homes, shops and automobiles damaged in the riots. “All these complaints will then be sent to deputy commissioner of police of northeast Delhi. We are also helping people fill up the compensation forms of Delhi government ,” Hela said.

Delhi government had last week announced compensation to the families of those who were either killed or injured or lost their properties in the clashes. For immediate assistance, the government is giving out Rs 25,000 in cash, while the remaining amount, depending on the injury or loss, will be handed out after verification of claims and documents. To claim the assistance, the victims are required to fill up a form and attach photographs and relevant documents.

At Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, two women running a helpdesk claimed to have assisted at least 30 people till now. “There were many who didn’t know what medical procedures were required. Then, there were some who had no idea about how to get their complaints registered. Many were looking for their loved ones who had gone missing, but didn’t know how to get an MLC done,” said advocate Mamtesh Sharma. She was assisted by a paralegal volunteer, Asha Mittal.

Harkaran Singh, another advocate based in Malviya Nagar, has been visiting various affected areas in northeast Delhi, counselling people on the remedies available to them.

“In places like Karawal Nagar, Shiv Vihar and Gokulpuri, we found several people who did not know how to claim compensation. Not only are we distributing Delhi government forms, but also guiding people on how to fill them. Another problem we came across was of police not registering FIRs or providing complaint numbers. We are asking people to wait for a few more days after which we may file a plea in court,” Singh said.

Many people have moved to different locations as their houses have been charred in the riots. They have pasted notes on the walls of the houses giving out their names and telephone numbers. “Policemen came and told us that we should do this so, to get registered for receiving compensation,” said Farooque, a victim.

The case in lower court was a result of a private complaint filed by a member of the Sikh community against the 11 petitioners. An inter-family dispute had found its way before the community elders for settlement around seven years ago. The petitioners contend that the respondent did not follow through with the promises made at the Gurudwara to resolve the dispute and disagreements from both sides. This ultimately led to the respondent approaching the trial court, orders being issued by the judge to proceed with the case and petitioners moving HC to quash the proceedings.

Advocate Amit Khare, who appeared for all 11 petitioners, told the bench headed by Justice Rohit Deo that the “process issued by the trial court against all the petitioners is unwarranted and abuse of the process of law by the respondents to harass the petitioners”. He prayed for a stay on the entire proceedings before the trial court at Nagpur during the pendency of the instant petition, which was granted. Advocate AN Ansari, who appeared for the respondent, has sought time to file a reply.

242,['3/03/2020'],Builder brings to Chennai ‘miracle’ from the Amazon,"The tiny, blood-red Miracle fruit originally belongs to the Amazon and when consumed, leaves a rich sweetness ... Read More

CHENNAI: Its scientific name may be the tongue twisting Synsepalum dulcificum , but its sweet-modifying quality has led to it being dubbed Miracle Fruit. And the berry is living up to its billing.

A city builder with a penchant for bringing exotic plants having tastes unknown to this part of the world has successfully raised the tiny blood-red fruit . The size of a large bean — it is originally from the Amazon — it leaves such a rich sweetness in the mouth that for the next two hours anything tastes sweet — a sour lemon tastes like litchis dipped in honey.

“Sweet without sugar, that is what it is,” says Jaswant Singh, adding that diabetics can relish the taste. Eating this fruit will reduce intake of crystalline sugar, which is dangerous to human body. Miracle fruit is a means for eliminating sugar without chemicals or dangerous man-made substances, he says.

Researchers have published articles in reputable international science journals of how the flavour-altering mechanism of miracle fruit is due to a glycoprotein named miraculin, which was first isolated by Japanese researcher Kenzo Kurihara in 1968. Although miraculin itself is not sweet, it binds to receptors on the taste buds and causes acidic foods to be perceived as sweet, they have found. “The effect typically lasts from a half hour to two hours, with the intensity declining over time,” said Jaswant Singh, who has made Chennai home for about five decades now.

It is a part of the evergreen shrub of the family Sapotaceae, he told TOI, adding: “I started searching for this plant after reading about it in some books six years ago. After several trials and errors, I managed to grow the plant to about 8ft last year. The red cherry attracts many birds. I grow them under another tree’s shade and ensure they are wetted frequently.”

A builder with more than four decades of experience behind him, Singh took up gardening nearly two decades ago. Now his house in Mogappair is a veritable jungle, home to a lot of exotic species. He has created a rain forest where chirping of birds never stops. A rough survey would show he has Mexican grass, grape ivy and ivy creepers, sandalwood trees, red sanders and more than 350 herbal plants, besides about 60 varieties of fruit plants.

The nature man, Jaswant Singh, strongly believes speaking to the plants, touching their barks, tendering leaves and watching them grow helps human beings maintain their equilibrium.

Kannur/Kozhikode: A few posters in the name of the Student Federation of India (SFI), which reads “this India is not my country”, has landed the organization in soup.

The posters had appeared in a few colleges, including Govt Brennan College , Thalassery, a few days ago, in the backdrop of the post-CAA turbulence in Delhi.

Though the posters were in the name of the SFI, the organization leadership distanced away from it and said it has no role in it and the posters do not reflect the stand of the SFI.

The posters have been stuck by some individuals and the SFI has no role in it, said SFI state secretary Sachin Dev. “We have faith and hope in democratic system, and we can’t agree with the content of such posters that are kind of emotional outburst inspired by social media,” he said, adding that they believe in democratic struggle.

In the backdrop of the CAA row, there is a public outcry, which might have provoked some students but it’s not linked to the SFI, Dev said. “We talked to the SFI units where the posters appeared, but they said they have no role in it,” he said, adding that the organization would probe if any SFI activists are involved in it and appropriate action would be taken if they have any involvement.

“We are investigating as to who is behind the posters, but we are yet to identify the people behind though they are in the name of the SFI,” said Thalassery DSP K V Venugopalan.

Similar posters in the name of the SFI had appeared at Government Industrial Training Institute in Malampuzha, Kozhikode Medical College and Madappally Arts and Science College as well.

SRIKAKULAM: Police arrested on Monday former MLA and government whip Kuna Ravi Kumar for using foul language against a government official in the district.

Sarubujjili police registered case against former Amadalavalasa MLA on a complaint filed by a junior official.

“Ravi Kumar was granted bail after we produced him before the court,” said Sarubujjili circle inspector B Prasada Rao.

According to the police, Ravi Kumar, in a phone call conversation, used abusive language and threatened to bury Gunapu Venkata Peda Appalanaidu, in-charge EOPRD, alive. Ravi Kumar called the official regarding release of fund to Ravivalasa panchayat.

An audio clip of the phone conversation was shared on social media.

In August 2019, a similar case was registered against Ravi Kumar for abusing Sarubijjili mandal parishad development officer A Damodar Rao and other staff. In another instance, Ravi Kumar abused a rural water supply official at Burja.

The district government staff staged protests against Ravi Kumar and threatened to go on strike if the behavior was continued. They had submitted a memorandum to speaker Tammineni Sitaram seeking action against Ravi Kumar. tnn

254,['3/03/2020'],Nashik: Events mark 90 years of Kalaram temple satyagraha,"Ramdas Athawale paying tribute to Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar

NASHIK: The Kalaram Mandir Satyagruhi Abhivadan Samiti organised a socio-cultural event at Gauri Patangan near the Godavari river on Monday to mark 90 years of the peaceful satyagraha movement that Dr B R Ambedkar had launched in Nashik for the entry of Dalits into the Kalaram temple.

A large section of the residents took part in the event. Union minister Ramdas Athawale paid floral tributes to Dr Ambedkar and others at Kranti Stupa, the site near the temple where the peaceful satyagraha was held.

Avinash Aher, a member of the Samiti, said they gather at the site every year to pay respects to Dr Ambedkar and to those who had participated in the peaceful satyagraha for more than five years. “Some of the participants of that stir had lost their lives,” Aher said.

According to the Samiti members, nearly 350 people continued the peaceful protest for more than five years. “Since Dr Ambedkar had to participate in the round-table conference, the responsibility of continuing the satyagraha fell on Dadasaheb Gaikwad. He took the lead and led the agitation,” added Aher.

During the programme, the Samiti members said that the satyagraha had a positive impact on their community. There were few presentations of songs followed by veneration of the present generation of the agitators.

A similar programme was also organised at Golf Club ground in the city. Athawale also attended the event.

“We had taken prior permission from the civic body and the police for the programme. We have also made water arrangements and rice preparations for the people coming to participate in the gathering from rural areas,” said Aher.

The iconic Kalaram temple houses idols of Ram, Sita and Laxman made of black marble.

255,['3/03/2020'],Experts want angiography replaced by reliable tech,"Vijayawada: Stating that angiography is prone to errors in judgement in cardiac cases, globally renowned professor of Interventional Cardiology Dr Robert Van Geuns of Netherlands said it is better to switch to advanced technologies such as fractional flow reserve (FFR). He said FFR would help improve precision in blood flow assessment and heart blockage assessment.

Speaking at conference held at Dr Ramesh Hospitals here on Monday, Dr Robert said angiography is still considered the gold standard to visualize blockages despite the fact that it does not provide physiological/ functional information. “Since angiography is a visual technique, it is prone to errors in judgement. FFR gives a numeric physiological assessment by measuring the blood pressure differences across a blockage which helps to assess if the blood flow is adequate or not,” Dr Robert contended.

He explained that FFR uses a calibrated micro-sensor technology to find whether a cardiac patient really needs a stent or bypass surgery or can he be treated through medication.

Besides FFR, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is another very powerful imaging technique that aids in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, he said adding that it provides a high resolution (HD) and detailed 3D view of the coronary arteries to assess the characteristics of the vessel and the blockage anatomically. “By using OCT, physicians can have the minutest view of the blockage and optimize stent placement, thereby improving stent performance/effectiveness,” said Dr Robert.

In fact, integrated use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and wireless FFR for PCI aids physicians with advanced physiological and anatomical insight to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, he said. Addressing the conference, noted cardiologist and Ramesh hospitals managing director Dr Ramesh Babu Pothineni said that an innovative technology has been introduced which allows realtime co-registration of OCT images with angiography (ACR – angio co-registration). “ACR provides stent road and apposition indicators on the angiography. This technology helps in precise positioning of the devices to treat the coronary lesion,” said Dr Ramesh.

256,['3/03/2020'],Demand for transfer of land in name of societies,"Pune: The Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Federation has demanded that the state government should transfer the title in the name of registered cooperative housing societies, which have completed 12 years, if their developers failed to convey the property despite receiving full amount from the residents.

There are approximately one lakh cooperative housing societies in the state, of which only 40,000 have been conveyed by the developer or by way of deemed conveyance, Suhas Patwardhan, vice-chairman of the Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Federation, said.

“Many housing societies have been pursuing with the developers to transfer the land of the society on the mutation extracts. However, such developers have been holding on to it as they want to keep the options of more construction,’’ Patwardhan, who is also the chairman of Pune district Cooperative Housing Federation, clarified.

Earlier, the federation had demanded that the state government should file criminal cases against the developers who were not signing conveyance deed for transferring the land of housing projects to societies. “Builders are unwilling to transfer the land as they want to continue to have a stake in the maintenance cost, open amenity area and redevelopment of societies. We tried demanding for criminal cases, but realized that developers have their own clout and can easily get away with political pressure,’’ he said.

Redevelopment of 30-40 years old societies are stuck in legal tangle as residents of such residential units have no ownership of land. The state government should give conveyance to such housing societies without asking for any documents, the federation demanded.

Patwardhan said the Maharashtra Ownership Flat Act, 1963, (MOFA) was soft on developers and must be amended. “Under RERA, the fine payable by the builder for delaying conveyance is up to 10% of the project cost, whereas under MOFA it is just Rs 50,000. The penalties should be high to ensure accountability,’’ a housing society member from Hadapsar said.

As builders were not executing conveyance, the state government had amended the MOFA to make provision for deemed conveyance in favour of cooperative housing societies. According to the amendment, after the expiry of four months of the formation of the housing society, the land and building is deemed to have been conveyed to the society and the society members can approach the government authority to seek the title of the land. However, for this too, there is not much response, experts said.

“Our society is 20-year-old and we want to redevelop it. However, we realized that the society has no ownership of land. Now, successors of the developer who constructed our building are claiming stake on the land and want share in redevelopment. They are also insisting that they will redevelop the society,” said M Thakur, resident of a Kondhwa society.

He said that they have already started an isolation ward in the fevers hospital in Gorantla to tackle suspicious cases of covid-19. “No cases have been reported so far. People should not get panic with the rumours. They should take advise from the doctors in case of trouble,” Dr Babulal cautioned.

Senior professor Dr Sudhakar said that the state government had taken all the measures to handle such cases as it rolled out detailed action plan in all the major teaching hospitals. He said that there was nothing to worry about the issue if proper care was taken. He said that fever, cough, severe headache and cold should be taken as primary symptoms of covid-19 and brought to the notice of the medical officers. Dr Lakshmi Kumari said that medical officers involved in treatment of covid-19 should also be very careful and attentive. She said that the government was providing full assistance to the doctors and staff posted in the isolation wards and they should be careful during the treatment if cases were reported. Dr Bhaskar and Dr K Prasanthi also addressed the doctors at the workshop.

Officials of the state medical and health department organised an awareness and training programme on the practical aspects of coronavirus disease management and IEC for doctors from Chittoor, Nellore, Kadapa, Kurnool and Anantapur districts.

During the training programme attended by joint director Dr D Mohana Krishna, SV Medical college principal Dr C Jayabhaskar, Chittoor district medical and health officer Dr M Penchalaiah and nearly 38 doctors from across the five districts, medicos were briefed on treatment protocols to be adhered to when treating COVID 19.

260,['3/03/2020'],Confiscated material turn ward offices into junkyards,"TimesView The Pune Municipal Corporation should have a time-bound action plan to dispose of items confiscated from hawkers. Ideally, one day should be reserved every month to clear the seized goods. This will ensure that items like handcarts and storage boxes do not turn into scrap and fetch the civic body decent money. Regular disposal will also free up much needed space in ward offices and improve overall cleanliness.

PUNE: Disposal of material confiscated during the anti-encroachment drives is proving to be a headache for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).There has been no auction for nearly a year and the material, including handcarts, storage boxes and vessels, are lying dumped at the ward offices in large numbers, turning them into junkyards.“The workload is increasing daily at the ward offices. The space available on the premises should be used properly. If the dumped materials are disposed of it will free up space, which can be utilised for public good,” said a senior official at a ward office, requesting anonymityVacant places like side margins or basements of ward offices are used for dumping the material. If vacated, they can be converted into parking lots. The city has 15 ward offices. Most of them have heaps of such confiscated goods.“The dumped material is neither helping the PMC, nor the hawkers. The civic administration has been left with no option but to auction them but even that is not happening. The PMC should have a policy on such matters,” said Balasaheb More of Pathari Panchaya, a hawkers’ union.He said that the civic administration spends money on transport and payment of anti-encroachment staff. This expense is going waste due to delay in disposal of the confiscated materials. If the handcarts and other hawking materials are given back to the hawkers after charging fines, the PMC will earn more money than it can earn from auctions.Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti-encroachment department, said, ""We have not got adequate response to the previous bidding process.

262,['3/03/2020'],BCA appoints former Mumbai cricketer its CEO,"Shishir Hattangadi

Vadodara: Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) on Monday appointed Shishir Hattangadi as its chief executive officer (CEO). The appointment came after a series of interviews of potential candidates that were conducted by a committee headed by BCA president Pranav Amin. Shishir will join the association from March 6 for a tenure of two years.

“We met many potential candidates and then interviewed the best four. We selected Shishir as his profile and experience match our requirement. Shishir was a cricketer and he also has a corporate background,” Amin told TOI.

Some members of the apex council, however, expressed their displeasure with the development. “We learned about the CEO’s appointment on Monday after his name was finalized. The apex council wasn’t kept in the loop about the potential candidates. We should have been consulted before making the appointment,” said Kalyan Haribhakti, member of the BCA apex council.

The association had received about 150 applications for the job out of which 50 candidates were shortlisted in the primary round that further went down to 10. A special selection committee comprising Amin, secretary Ajit Lele and joint Secretary Parag Patel interviewed the candidates and unanimously selected Shishir. But some BCA officials claimed that the interviews were merely a formality and Shishir’s name was finalized much before.

An opening batsman, Shishir was a first class cricketer who represented Mumbai in domestic cricket and went on to play 60 first class matches. He had captained Mumbai at all levels from junior cricket to university team, Under-22 and Ranji Trophy. Shishir has received Chhatrapati Shivaji Award for his contribution to the sport from Maharashtra Government in year 1989. He has also served as selector in Mumbai Cricket Association and senior selector in cricket improvement committee.

Shishir has also worked in senior positions with Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata Group and some other companies in the past. BCA officials said Shishir will focus on developing various strategies for the development of cricket and cricketers and execute them.

264,['3/03/2020'],"Delhi: At medical camps, help for scared and scarred","Many of the people approaching the medical camp are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder

NEW DELHI: Having found temporary shelters, the people affected by the communal violence in northeast Delhi are now seeking medical help for their bodily and mental well-being. Coming to their aid is civil society with makeshift clinics and psychological counselling.

At the medical camp set up in a madrassa in Chandu Nagar, Mohammad Yasir, a recent graduate of Jamia Hamdard, tended to patients, many of them riot victims. “We had started a small organisation called ‘Helping Hands’ to coordinate with doctors across the city on helping the needy,” Yasir said on Monday. “We have been running this medical camp for two days and providing medicines and other assistance to both the violence displaced and the locals.”

Many of the people approaching the medical camp are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They are uneasy and depressed. “Some people feel tense whenever they see someone in uniform,” said Yasir. “We are identifying such people for counselling.” Doctors are themselves going around speaking to victims because many are wary of consulting the medical experts.

Assisting Helping Hands is Mohammad Sohaib, a Dubai-born NRI businessman. “I decided to come to Delhi because I felt the need to help the riot victims, whatever their religion,” Sohaib said. “It won’t be easy for the people to get rid of their fears. When such events take place, people suffer mental trauma.”

At Al-Islah school in Babu Nagar, a medico-legal relief centre has been setup by members of civil society. Amreen Farooq, one of the volunteers, revealed that several people were regularly coming to the school which had been converted into a large clinic. They get their wounds dressed there and take home basic medicine for two days.

“Many are also being assessed for mental trauma,” Farooq said. “The state has almost non-existent facilities for this. We have received 450 medical patients so far, of whom we feel 150 are medico-legal cases.”

People are also thankful for the temporary shelters. At one such project in Chandu Nagar, Mohammad Guddu, a 24-year-old from Bijnor who worked as a help at a shop, has found some respite. “When I ran away from the rioters, I couldn’t carry anything from home. I roamed the streets in the same clothes that I left home in. It was only at the relief camp here that I found a change of clothes,” he disclosed.

265,['3/03/2020'],"Growing vehicular population worsens noise pollution in Vijayawada, Guntur","Amaravati: In what could be an alarming trend, recent epidemiological census found that about seven percent of the AP and Telangana population is suffering from significant hearing loss.

Growing noise pollution due to increased vehicular population is affecting hearing capabilities of the people. Children are also falling victims to hearing disabilities resulting in more health complications among younger generation.

The National Sample Survey (NSS)–2011 had indicated that hearing disability in Telugu states is anywhere around 4.5 percent of the population. Shockingly, about 32 percent of those with hearing disability are in the profound category, who could here nothing.

Although experts have different theories for growing hearing disability rate, majority are of the view that the increasing noise pollution levels particularly in urban areas have become a major cause for concern. Ironically, no government agency seems to crack the whip on those violating the norms despite the fact that Pollution Control Boards (PCB) in both the states have found noise pollution levels have reached alarming stage. While many of the areas including residential zones in Vijayawada and Guntur are reporting noise levels over and above 85db-90decibels (dB), the levels in Hyderabad city area anywhere around 70dB-80dB.

According to the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 of the Environment (protection) Act, permissible noise level in residential areas during the day time is 55db and night time 45db. “Since many commercial areas have extended into residential colonies in cities like Vijayawada, Guntur and Hyderabad, the governments are required to conduct fresh surveys and issue notification to classify the separate zones regarding air ambient quality. Otherwise, it will be difficult to contain the growing noise pollution,” said Tanguturi Narendra, senior audiologist.

He expressed anguish about the increasing incidence of hearing losses among children particularly below the age of 12 years. “Although there could be different congenital and medical reasons for hearing loss, recent studies have shown that increasing noise pollution in urban areas is having a serious impact on hearing capabilities of the children including infants as no one is following the noise level rules even in hospital zones, which should have been silent zones,” said Narendra. He said that the hearing disability rate might go up and touch the worrying 10 percent of the population by 2040-2050 if the noise pollution is not contained early.

According to a study carried out by Sravanalaya Institute of Speech and Hearing Institute of Narenda, about 2.4 percent of the children in Guntur and Vijayawada are suffering from hearing deficiency while it is anywhere around 6.5 percent among the adults and 8.3 percent in the elderly. Narendra said the trend is almost similar in Hyderabad city where noise pollution levels are relatively low when compared to Vijayawada and Guntur.

Professor Kusuma Sundara Kumar, who carried out an in-depth study on noise pollution levels in Vijayawada, noted that the situation had turned very sensitive in many areas of the city in the recent past. He said that their research team found that at least 15 of the 34 places in the city have noise levels over 90db which is almost double the permissible level.

He said that growing vehicular population is contributing to high-noise levels in cities. Curiously, the vehicular population was almost doubled in Vijayawada and Guntur cities in the last one decade.

GFX

HERE IS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR TIMELY ACTION

Nearly 5 lakh vehicles including cars, two-wheelers and autos are roaming in Vijayawada city while nearly one-lakh autos are plying on Guntur city roads

Disabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 40 decibels (dB) in adults and a hearing loss greater than 30 dB in children.

The causes of hearing loss and deafness can be congenital or acquired

Congenital causes

Congenital causes may lead to hearing loss being present at or acquired soon after birth. Hearing loss can be caused by hereditary and non-hereditary genetic factors or by certain complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including maternal rubella, syphilis or certain other infections during pregnancy, says Audiologist T Narendra

Acquired Causes

Infectious diseases including meningitis, measles and mumps; chronic ear infections

In recent most effective cause: Excessive Environmental / Ambient Noise. This leads to Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL): Narendra Tanguturi of Sravanayala hearing and speech therapy institute.

Excessive noise, including occupational noise such as that from machinery and explosions;

Recreational exposure to loud sounds such as use of personal audio devices at high volumes and for prolonged periods of time and regular attendance at concerts, nightclubs, bars and sporting events.

Impact of hearing loss

One of the main impacts of hearing loss is on the individual’s ability to communicate with others. Spoken language development is often delayed in children with unaddressed hearing loss.

Unaddressed hearing loss and ear diseases such as otitis media can have a significantly adverse effect on the academic performance of children. They often have increased rates of grade failure and greater need for education assistance

Social and emotional impact

Exclusion from communication can have a significant impact on everyday life, causing feelings of loneliness, isolation, and frustration, particularly among older people with hearing loss

Children with hearing loss and deafness rarely receive any schooling. Adults with hearing loss also have a much higher unemployment rate.

Among those who are employed, a higher percentage of people with hearing loss are in the lower grades of employment compared with the general workforce.

QUOTE: Half of all cases of hearing loss can be prevented through public health measures. In children under 15 years of age, 60% of hearing loss is attributable to preventable causes: Narendra Tanguturi.

NOISE PERMISSIBLE LEVELS AS PER ACT

Zone------ Day-Time-------Night Time

Industrial-----75dB----------------70dB

Commercial-----65dB--------------55dB

Residential------55dB--------------45dB

Silent Zone----50dB-----------40dB

SILENT ZONE

Silence zone is defined as an area comprising not less than 100 meters around hospitals, educational institutions and courts. The silence zones are zones, which are declared as such by the competent authority

The list of items to be exchanged has been catalogued but there has been no further progress since early 2018.

The state museum in Telanagana is headed by an additional director. The AP government is proposing to set up a new committee for its administration.

Sources in AP archaeology department said the government has sought names to be part of a new committee. The committee would be finalised only by June, said the sources.

In the case of Telangana, the top posts are yet to be filled after the department was renamed from archaeology to heritage.

Among the 60,000 valuable artefacts include 50,000 pieces of coins and other artefacts; some of them dating back to the Maurya, Satavahana period.

G Vani Mohan, commissioner, Department of Archaeology and Museums, AP, said: “So far no progress has been made. In Telangana, there is no director-in-charge of the department or a principal secretary heading tourism. Our correspondence with them has been one way.”

She added: “The state government has invited proposal to form a new committee.”

Sources said M Srinivasa Rao, minister for tourism, has urged the department to suggest names to form a new committee.

K Mallikarjuna Rao, deputy director, Archaeology and Museums, said: “We are waiting to hear from Telangana authorities. The artefact exchange is going to be a cautious process with each and every item accounted for. It would take time and will happen only when both the state committees sit together and sort things out.”

Sources in Telangana Heritage department said 67 artefacts belonging to Telangana are in the Visakhapatnam museum.

Telangana State Museum assistant director Ramulu Naik was not available for his comments.

Sources said the lack of political will over the last five and half years was the reason why the artefacts have not been exchanged.

HYDERABAD: A 36-year-old software engineer working with IBM killed his wife and two children before committing suicide at his home in Hyderabad apparently because he was unable to repay a loan of Rs 22 lakh.Police said the four died at their home in LB Nagar’s Hasthinapur area on Saturday but relatives came to know only on Monday. LB Nagar police identified the dead as K Pradeep Kumar, wife Swathi (28) and their children Kalyan Krishna (6) and Jaya Krishna (18 months). Cops said Pradeep first poisoned his wife and kids and then killed himself a few hours later.In his suicide note, found in a diary in the house, Pradeep said he made some hasty financial decisions because he wanted to start his own company and clear his pending home loan. Police officials added that Pradeep had also made various other investments, but the details were not known. “We seized his laptop and phone to get leads about his investments,” inspector Ashok Reddy said.Sources said that Pradeep may have borrowed money from private money-lenders as well, some of whom may be pressuring him to return the money.

269,['3/03/2020'],MK Stalin: Is Stalin fashioning his party as MGR DMK?,"(The writer is a veteran journalist)

CHENNAI: The DMK under M K Stalin is quietly fashioning a new strategy to woo MGR and J Jayalalithaa loyalists into the party. With the induction of former ministers Senthil Balaji and R S Raja Kannappan (a few days ago), Stalin has sent a message to the AIADMK cadres that the DMK’s doors are wide open for them. With former ministers S Regupathy, T M Selvaganapathy and S Muthuswamy given prominent party positions, as also MGR loyalists K P Ramalingam, and K K S S R Ramachandran, and Sekhar Babu, the DMK today looks more like an MGR DMK, holding out an olive branch particularly to the actor-politician’s followers in the AIADMK.Senthil Balaji has proved to be a useful acquisition for the DMK as he not only helped win the Aravakurichi assembly seat but has also shored up the party in the Karur district, generally considered weak for the party. Kannappan is an influential leader of the Yadava community, and brings in a vote bank which would be handy for the DMK. Besides, his association with the DMK could trigger an exodus from the old-timers’ camp in the AIADMK, feel DMK managers.Selvaganapathy in Salem and Muthuswamy in the Erode-Coimbatore belt are expected to push for a powerful DMK strategy to counter the dominance of the EPS-led AIADMK in the western belt. S Jagathrakshakan, who was aloof from the AIADMK for a long time, and was associated with MGR Kazhagam, formed by another minister of MGR’s cabinet, R M Veerappan, formally joined the DMK and is now the party’s MP. Jagathrakshakan is active in the field of religion and spiritualism, and his promotion in the party helps counter the criticism that the DMK is anti-Hinduism.Karur M Chinnasamy,a member of Jayalalithaa’s first Cabinet, and Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan, a minister in MGR’s cabinet, too, are projected by the DMK as its prominent leaders.Stalin’s subtle praise of MGR and Jayalalithaa, especially his commitment towards a full-scale investigation into her death, is aimed at Jaya loyalists, particularly women. At the same time, Stalin, who turned 67 on Sunday, realises he is walking a tight rope as he has to ensure his core constituency – leaders and cadres of his own party – is not upset over the influx of AIADMK members. The DMK top brass has managed to convince its second-rung leaders that they would not be deprived of opportunities, and that the new arrivals were meant to help expand their base. Stalin knows the leadership is aging and that young blood is a must, particularly to nip in the bud attempts by Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth to wean away DMK youth.The DMK had suffered in 1972 when MGR’s new party took away a chunk of the youth, who led the enthusiastic crowds during rallies and campaigning. The party cannot afford to lose this segment all over again. The arrivals could also offset or minimise any losses on this front. The DMK is looking to expand its organisational wings, bring in more leaders from the AIADMK to cut the latter’s vote bank. As taking away one vote from the AIADMK and bringing it into the DMK kitty amounts to two votes.The DMK’s top leadership, however, maintains there is no new strategy to get MGR loyalists. DMK spokesman T K S Elangovan says, ""We have taken in people from the AIADMK in the past if they accept the DMK ideology (like Nanjil Manoharan and Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan). Later too, K P Ramalingam and KKSSR Ramachandran joined us. However, it is true that there is an undercurrent in the AIADMK wherein many of its leaders are worried over the loss of MGR and Jayalalithaa. They realise that the party is rudderless and lacks decisive and strong leadership."" Elangovan says a section in the AIADMK feels Stalin is a leader, in whom people of the state see a future. ""The AIADMK leaders are also worried over the impact of the party’s close ties with the BJP, and the concentration of both EPS and OPS to grab posts for their supporters alone, leaving MGR and Jayalalithaa loyalists in the lurch. There is bound to be an exodus from the AIADMK to the DMK in the coming months as the AIADMK rule comes to a close,"" he says.The posts given to those who made the switch is a clear signal to the restless elements in the AIADMK that they would be well looked after in the new avatar of the DMK.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74451135,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-254148,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/is-mk-stalin-fashioning-his-party-as-mgr-dmk/articleshow/74448452.cms

NEW DELHI: Public health activists have flagged what they described as a breakdown of the government health system during the recent riots in Delhi and said government hospitals failed to provide treatment to the injured without discrimination and harassment.

They reported instances of refusal to give copies of medico legal cases (MLCs) and other documents related to treatment, which prevented the victims from accessing further care.

In a press conference on Monday, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a network of organisations working on public health, released a report based on the first-hand experience of volunteers who were on the ground since February 25. The report documented the alleged inability of the injured to reach healthcare facilities during the violence as mobs and, in some instances even police, prevented ambulances from taking them to hospitals or getting medical supplies to people who needed it.

The injured were released without proper documenting of serious injuries and forcefully discharged without ascertaining whether they were fit to be released, alleged the report. With such poor treatment in government hospitals, most victims did not have any trust in the public health system and, instead, chose private and charitable clinics and hospitals, it said.

Inayat Kakkar from JSA said patients were not being given an MLC number, postmortem reports and patient records, without which they were unable to get proper treatment. She demanded that Delhi government issue written orders to public and private hospitals to ensure that the injured were not denied care or treatment records. She added that they also came across several heartening instances of doctors in government hospitals and small private hospitals coming forward to provide treatment to the injured.

JSA has asked for mobile clinics in areas without mohalla clinics and availability of surgical services.

I cannot reveal much, but you will hear something good about the airport soon,” he said, while addressing the Pune International Business Summit (PIBS) in the city.

State government officials had hinted for the past month about the budgetary allocation to acquire land at the proposed site, with talks with landowners in the area. Around 2,300 hectare land has been marked for acquisition in the area, across seven villages.

Thackeray and Puri met on Sunday on the sidelines of the Asia Economic Dialogue, where they were headline speakers on sessions regarding India’s standing in a rapidly changing global economy.

The PIBS, organized by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA), was attended by prominent business leaders in the city, trade representative bodies from overseas, including participants from Germany, the United States as well as some Asian countries. Envoys from various countries were also part of the summit.

272,['3/03/2020'],Women deserve equal opportunities in armed forces: Lt Gen Madhuri Kanitkar,"After taking over as the new deputy chief of integrated defence staff (DCIDS) (medical), Lt Gen Madhuri Kanitkar said women officers should get equal opportunities, including in combat duty, in the armed forces. In an interview to TOI’s Sandip Dighe, she said women officers from the Army Medical Corps (AMC) have been performing exceptionally well in field areas as well, and they could do better in other arms and services of the defence forces.

Excerpts:

On combat roles

I have confidence that women officers can perform well in all duties. In the Army Medical Corps (AMC), I feel nobody pays much heed to gender as we have been training and working together as officers for many years. I have not faced any gender discrimination during my service. All male officers and soldiers have respected me as an officer. This mindset will develop further if more women officers get into commanding roles in the services.

On becoming a doctor

My grandmother, Sarladevi Khot, became a doctor during the pre-independence era and worked in East Africa. Her struggle and achievements had a great influence on me. She became a widow at the age of 8 and yet her grandfather encouraged her to pursue medical studies. She became a doctor from the BJ Medical College in 1928. During her graduation, she had proposed to classmate Gopalrao Khot (my grandfather) and they got married. They served in the British colonies in East Africa for 11 years before returning. My father was an engineer with the Indian Railways and would be on tours. We spent maximum of our summer holidays with our grandparents in Pune. Her stories inspired me and my sister (Nilima Kadambi) to become doctors. She completed her MBBS from BJ Medical College. I got my degree from Armed Forces Medical College.

On first posting

The lady officers of my batch were the first to be sent to field hospitals. I was first posted to a field hospital in Jodhpur. There was no proper accommodation facility, apart from a simple barrack. I was told that women cannot stay there I was told to stay at the officers’ mess. But I refused. While serving there, I played basketball, hockey and other games and also did physical training with the male soldiers.

On second field posting

This was in the Indian Army’s Northern Command and I led the medical services. This was the most challenging posting, when I learned the real-time requirements of combat medical care. We had to be always on toes to give best medical services to soldiers in the forward posts in J&K. As medical services in-charge in the Command, I had visited almost all forward posts, including Siachen Glacier, and took stock of the ground situations. The experience will help-me in a big way in the current role.

On priorities

Integration of tri-services medical services and providing best medical assistance to the armed forces personnel would be my first and foremost priority. Since the armed forces are creating integrated commands, we (the medical corps) also need to get prepared for catering to the required healthcare for the new formations.

He said after the YSRC government came to power attacks on Hindus have increased.

Addressing the media he said the state government is backing those who are attacking Hindu temples. “This government is acting against the wish of Hindus. Attack on Hindu temples becoming prevalent. Police are acting in support of the government. A person who torched the chariot of Prasanna Venkateswara Swamy at Nellore district was left without punishment saying that he was mentally unstable,” Lakshminarayana said.

The state government, however, dismissed the BJP leader’s allegations. Minister Vellampalli Srinivas said BJP was trying to provoke Hindus for no reason. Lakshminarayana never questioned TDP which destroyed hundreds of temples during Krishna Pushkarams. He is trying to attack YSRC on the basis of religion. Our government is giving top priority for temples and their development,” Srinivas said.

It will replace the existing Punjab Lokpal Act, 1996.

The new law, once passed by the Punjab legislative assembly, will be applicable to the chief minister, ministers, non-officials and officials of all public offices. The decision has been taken with an aim to improve governance and check corruption.

Former judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court, Justice Vinod Kumar Sharma (retd) is Punjab Lokpal at present. He was appointed on October 9, 2019.

Empowering the Lokpal institution was one of the pre-poll promises of the Congress in the run up to the 2017 state assembly elections.

According to the new draft, prosecution of the chief minister, ministers and MLAs can be sanctioned with 2/3rd majority of the legislative assembly. In addition, all sanctions by the state legislative assembly, whether or not permission to prosecute is granted, will be binding on the Lokayukta.

All complaints will be scrutinised by a screening committee of the Lokpal before issuance of any notice. The screening committee will also take the government’s opinion in the matter.

The new law bars a parallel probe into a complaint against any officer or public functionary if an inquiry is being conducted in the matter by the Lokpal. At the same time, the Lokpal will not have the authority to conduct a parallel inquiry of the matter if it is already under investigation by the government.

The chairperson and members shall be appointed by the governor on the basis of recommendations of a selection committee consisting of the chief minister as the head, besides speaker of the legislative assembly, leader of the opposition in legislative assembly, the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court and an eminent jurist nominated by the Punjab government as its members.

With this quashing of notification, pension would be given to those who retired after 2004, mainly the employees of the corporation who have contributed for pension fund from their salaries.

However, the court has given exemption to RFC that it can take action by adopting legal procedure prescribed under Section 48 of the RFC Act 1951.

A division bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice N S Dhadha gave this order while accepting the petition of Sudeep Kumar Pokhrana and others.

The court said that in an order of the high court by the order on May 7, 2018, the process of withdrawal of pension rules by the RFC has been declared wrong. Also, the Special Leave Petition (SLP) and reconsideration petition of the RFC challenging was also being rejected by Supreme Court, then this notification is also eligible to be cancelled.

Elaborating on the issue, counsel for the petitioner Saugat Roy said that the RFC had issued a notification on July 21, 2017 to discontinue pension of employees retiring after August 12, 2004 in retrospective effect. This was challenged in the high court by the RFC Officers Association.

278,['3/03/2020'],Joint land measurement order for Purandar facility likely soon,"Pune: The district administration is likely to send the joint land measurement order for the proposed Purandar airport to the deputy collectors this week.

Officials in the know of developments claimed that the joint measurement — the first step towards the actual land acquisition — would be initiated after parleys between the administration and the landowners, protesting against any moves to acquire land for the project for the past three years.

The land for the proposed airport is supposed to be acquired from seven villages — Pargaon, Kumbharvan, Vanpuri, Udachiwadi, Ekhatpur, Manjauri and Khanaudi — in Purandar.

“A deputy collector rank official has been assigned the task related to land acquisition in each of the seven villages. First, the joint measurement of the land earmarked for acquisition would be done and its order would reach us this week. But before anything starts on the ground, we need to initiate talks with the landowners. We intend to have some meetings with them by the end of the week,” an official, requesting anonymity, said.

Purandar MLA Sanjay Jagtap, who had earlier sought relocation of the project site, said he would act at the right time. “I have made my point. Things related to land acquisition have not started on the ground. No process has begun yet. So, why should I do anything at this moment? If the land acquisition process starts, I shall take steps,” he told TOI.

Another official from the district administration said the seven deputy collectors would visit the respective villages (assigned to them) with their team and initiate talks with the landowners. “We need to explain everything to the agitators. We feel they will listen to us,” the official said.

The proposed airport project could affect a population of more than 30,000 in the seven villages. The agitating landowners have warned the authorities against entering any of the villages for the land acquisition process.

Yuvraj Memane, a landowner of the Pargaon village, said, “No one from the administration came to the villages to talk to the villagers in the past two years. While no demonstrations are going on right now, things can flare up any moment if they (administration) enter the villages. Our stand remains the same and we are not panicking as nothing is happening on the ground. If they initiate acquisition, the protests will resume.”

279,['3/03/2020'],Testing times: It’s not just exams that’s stressing them out,"Delhi Police personnel offer flowers to students after they emerge from an exam centre

NEW DELHI: Friends Tanu Thakur and Isha Jain, students of a government school in Yamuna Vihar, reached their exam centre right on time on Monday to write their physics paper for the Central Board of Secondary Education Class XII exams. Like them, many others too reached their designated exam centres in northeast Delhi after the schedule had been disrupted for a few days by the rioting.

For the two friends, both residents of Bhajanpura — as it was for most candidates from the district — preparing for the exams wasn’t easy, their life was turned topsy-turvy in the past week by the violence and arson and the resulting loss of homes, schools and learning material. Even after the clashes ended, there still was tension and uncertainty in the air, creating an atmosphere that wasn’t conducive to serious studying.

“We spent some very stressful days,” said Thakur, perhaps understating her problems. “There was so much noise around that it was very difficult for us to sit and study.”

It was amid heavy security at the 86 examination centre in northeast Delhi that the exams were held on Monday. To alleviate their anxieties, police stationed at one of the centres handed roses to the students. CBSE later said an attendance of 98.2% was recorded on the day — of the 2,888 candidates registered for classes XII and X in Northeast district, 2,837 candidates were present, while 51 were absent.

Parents, as nervous and uncertain as their wards, accompanied the candidates to the centres and waited there for the entire exam duration of three hours. Mustafabad student Shoiba Parveen was escorted to her exam centre at Yamuna Vihar B Block by her mother. Her father went with her brother, whose exam centre was at Karawal Nagar.

“The three days of rioting were very frightening. It was overwhelming to return to books after hearing of what was taking place outside the house. But it is about a year’s effort, so we tried to forget everything else and just study,” said Parveen.

Some of the students had seen violence on February 24. One of them, a private school candidate, had gone that day to write his exam in the badly affected Chand Bagh. “Our exams got over at 1.30pm, but I reached home in Krishna Nagar only at 5.30pm. It was so frightening. The metro station was closed too,” he related.

At the Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School in Yamuna Vihar, Arif and Naghma of Tukhmirpur were waiting for their daughter. “Last Monday, when our daughter was leaving the school, there was stone-pelting going on in the streets and police were using teargas shells,” Arif, a daily wager, said. “Thankfully, our home isn’t far from her school, but if we had taken a wrong route that day, things would have turned out badly for us.”

Seeta, a parent from Bhajanpura, said the atmosphere had frayed the nerves of the students, already taut at the thought of exams. “But their teachers called to dispel their fears and to tell the kids to ignore the rumours and focus on studies,” she said.

A teacher, who was invigilating at one of the centres, confirmed, “We have been counselling the youngsters, giving them words of courage and motivating them.”

Directions were issued to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the role of officials who permitted and cleared the building plan in the catchment area.A division bench headed by Justice Rajiv Sharma passed these orders while deciding a 2009 case related to save Sukhna and illegal activities in the catchment area.The court pointed out the acts of Punjab and Haryana have caused permanent damage to the catchment area.

A team headed by senior inspector Jayram Paygude and assistant inspector Gangadhar Ghawate of cybercrime cell arrested the suspect after following him continuously in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar and Delhi.

Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam said the team had successfully arrested one of the two prime suspects in the case. He has been identified as Guddu alias Jitendra Kumar Awaghesh Singh (30), hailing from Shekhpura in Bihar.

Kadam confirmed that Singh was one of the two handlers of the card data thieves at the fuel station in Camp. The search for the other handler is on. “The handlers used to process the data of the cards and siphon off money from the cardholders’ accounts,” he said.

On January 15, the cybercrime police had arrested Mithun Ali, Noel Shaikh, Saimuddin Ali and Zulfikar Ahmed, all residents of Malda in West Bengal, after receiving about 100 complaints stating that data of their cards were misused after being swiped at a fuel station in Camp.

Citizens had complained that their cards were used to withdraw money from their bank accounts without their knowledge. Rs20,000-30,000 were siphoned off from the account of each cardholder.

Police found that Mithun, Noel, and Saimuddin had started working at the pump as attendants just a few months before they were arrested. They used a small skimming machine to steal data from the cards customers used at the pump to pay for the fuel. The trio used to note down the PIN (Personal Index Number) of the cards. Zulfikar used to send the stolen data to their Delhi-based handlers through a laptop, the police said.

Seven cellphones, as many as 20 fake debit cards, a total of 12 original debit cards, ID cards, Aadhaar cards and Rs 1,230 in cash were recovered from Mithun, Noel, Saimuddin and Zulfikar after they were arrested in January.

Kadam, the deputy commissioner of police (cyber), said the handlers paid hefty commission to the pump attendants and Zulfikar.

Looking for an alternate livelihood, the 34-year-old woman is among the five fisherwomen who are learning to drive under the ‘Skill and livelihood training’ (Salt) initiative by the Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation ( TNSDC ).

The Salt initiative that conducts training in driving , tailoring and electrical mechanic work has added flavour to the life of fisherfolk in coastal hamlets in Villupuram district. ""All that we know is to sell fish. Through the training more opportunities are opening up for us. In fact, my children are so proud of me. It has instilled confidence in me,"" said Jeyasudha, whose husband sustained an injury in a boat accident a few years ago and now runs a petty shop. At present, the training is on at six places in Villupuram and will soon be expanded to other districts.

The programme, a brainchild of assistant collector (trainee) of Villupuram V Sivakrishnamurthy, is aimed at bridging the gap between the market and skill sets of the fishing community members to provide them with sustainable employment. The unused multi-purpose evacuation shelters (MPES), constructed for use during natural calamities are being used to train the men and women. ""We interacted with members of the community to know their interests and educate them about market-driven employment opportunities,"" said an official. Within a week more than 1,300 enrolled for training.

Former panchayat president of Konimedu Kuppam M Ramesh said the fishing community welcomes the officials’ efforts. ""Youngsters are learning different skills for free and receiving a government certificate"" he said.

Officials also plan convergence of various departments to extend financial aid to youngsters to form self-help groups to start businesses. ""From the next phase of the programme we will diversify and offer new courses. Youngsters will be encouraged to start food processing units, come up with their own brand of ready to cook sea-food products and set up boat repair workshops,"" said the official.

Similar programmes will be launched in a phased manner in other MPES. ""We are planning to replicate the model in other coastal districts,"" said managing director of TNSDC V Vishnu.

295,['3/03/2020'],‘Cow protection law should be effective’,"Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has observed that it “expects” Haryana to make necessary amendments in the anti-cow slaughter act to make it more effective. HC made these observations while disposing of a matter related to problems in effective implementation of Haryana government’s newly carved anti-cow slaughter law — Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act 2015.

Haryana has also given an undertaking before the HC that suggestions given by the high court appointee, amicus curiae in this case, are also under its consideration for implementation.

Some of the suggestions given by the amicus in this case included handling of the crime under Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act-2015 by a separate wing headed by an SP-rank officer with a “secular mindset” and sufficient committed police force.

“The state counsel submits that suggestions given by amicus curiae in his report dated August 31, 2019, are under consideration of the state. Government is intending to make necessary amendment under Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015/Rules. Since nothing survives in the petition, the same is disposed of with expectation from the state government that it would carry out necessary amendments in the aforesaid act and frame rules to make the same more effective,” observed Justice Ramender Jain of the HC while disposing of the matter on February 28.

The matter had reached the HC in the wake of a plea filed by a resident of Nuh district seeking bail in relation to a case registered against him under the anti-cow slaughter law.

However, during the hearing of the case, HC found that most of the accused arrested in Nuh district by police under the anti-cow slaughter law, had been acquitted because of apparent lapses on the part of the police. HC was unhappy over the fact that till date, total 13 criminal cases have been decided by the courts of competent jurisdiction in Nuh district for commission of offences under the new law and all the cases, resulted into the acquittal and not even a single person has been convicted.

After finding apparent lapses on the part of Nuh police in investigation of cases registered under the anti-cow slaughter law introduced by the Manohar Lal Khattar government in 2015, HC had appointed an amicus curiae to prepare a report on the issue. A total of 792 cases under the new anti-cow slaughter act were registered in Nuh district till March 31, 2019.

JAIPUR: The marquee international week-long event on wildlife and environment of World Wilderness Congress scheduled to start from March 19 in Jaipur fell prey to the coronavirus, joining a growing list of cancelled events that has direct bearing on trade and businesses of Rajasthan.

Organisers of WILD11 had written to the co-host Rajasthan government to postpone the event and sources said a decision has already been taken to cancel it for the time being.

“Keeping in view the spread of the coronavirus and the interest of the participants and the people, we made a request to the Rajasthan government, our co-host for the event, to cancel the event for time being. We will keep a watch on the developments and accordingly decide the next date when the situation becomes normal,” said Sunil Mehta, managing director of WILD11.

Over 2,000 participants from 60 nations, which included names like Stanley Patrick Johnson, father of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson; Shannon Elizabeth of American Pie fame; Felix Padel, anthropologist and great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin; Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles; and host of others of similar repute.

Billed as the biggest travel-trade event in the world, the ITB Berlin exhibition, which was due to start on March 4 was cancelled. The travel trade industry in Jaipur said it is a big blow to the tourism and hospitality industry.

Event cancellations and fear of coronavirus have already impacted the hospitality industry with cancellations of foreign individual travelers (FIT) going up to 30%. Mohan Singh, general manager of Rajasthan Tours, said, “The FIT segment has witnessed cancellations up to 30% though groups which has already paid are still coming.”

A hotelier said travel advisories have been issued by many countries, cancellations of conferences and corporate events are now having a telling impact. “If the situation does not improve, we will also lose student groups during summers,” said the hotelier.

An Italian testing positive in the screening test for the virus on Monday is a pretty bad news for the industry as it will force many tourists to cancel their trips to the state, he added.

The gem and jewellery sector has also suffered as couple of big-ticket exhibitions have been cancelled and that would cause huge losses to the industry which depends on such shows.

Besides Punjab, Tata Power caters to Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Maharastra from its Rs 18,000 crore Mundra power plant. Gujarat government has agreed to the price revision but other states are yet to take a decision.

Punjab has decided not to deviate from the pricing agreed upon in the PPA signed with the mega power project. Under the agreement, the state receives power at Rs 2.91 per unit from Tata. Sources said since the state government was already facing brickbats over rising power tariff, it had decided not to let the private power producer hike cost.

After directions from the Supreme Court, Tata Power moved the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) last April for an increase in tariff. The company said this was necessitated by rise in the price of Indonesian coal used to fuel the Mundra plant.

The plea was allowed by the Central Commission, after which Tata wrote a series of letters to the five state governments. Last month, it decided to serve a notice to consumer states asking for a hike in tariff or discontinuation of supply.

Director (distribution), Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) N K Sharma said since there was a signed agreement, a unilateral decision to hike power tariff could not be taken. If Tata stalled power supply to the state, PSPCL would explore all legal possibilities, he said.

KOTTAYAM: Police have identified major irregularities in the maintenance of the death register in the controversial Puthujeevan Trust Hospital for Psychological Medicine and De-addiction Centre in Changanassery.

The hospital had come under the scanner after three deaths were reported in the past one week alone. Health minister K K Shailaja had formed a special medical board to probe the deaths.

The death register in the trust hospital showed that 33 inmates have died ever since the trust began in 2012. However, in a shocking finding, police have found out that three among them are still alive. These people hailing from Tiruvalla, Changanassery and an unidentified place were found to be alive. This irregularity was found out after police contacted the homes of every single name in the death list.

Police found out that 18 people in the list either died at the Puthujeevan Hospital or while being taken to another hospital or at another hospital. Four of them had committed suicide here itself. Seven of them had died after they had left the trust along with their relatives. Police haven’t got any info of one of the inmates. After police unearthed irregularities in the hospital, the trust authorities said the register was prepared by a former employee of the organization. “She had committed the error,” they said.

Meanwhile, the autopsy of Abraham Yuhanon, 21, who died last week, has revealed a high presence of lead in the body. It is suspected that the presence of lead has come from the medicines given to inmates. The Payippad panchayat will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday.

ADM Anil Oommen, who had inspected the trust hospital on Sunday, will file a report within two days.

He had conducted the inspection based on complaints from residents in the neighbourhood of the hospital located in Payippad panchayat. The residents had complained about the functioning of the hospital, its sanitation and licence under which it functioned. Meanwhile, the special medical board, which was formed to probe the deaths, will submit their report to the minister soon.

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has asked all property owners, including the defaulters , to clear their tax dues by end of this month or face legal action.

The civic administration has issued a public notice in this regard. The civic administration has also warned the water tax defaulters to pay their taxes at the earliest or their connections will be snapped.

A civic official said all six divisional offices of the civic body would function even on Saturdays and Sundays for collecting property and water tax dues from the citizens.

During the last financial year (2018-19), the NMC had collected property tax amounting to Rs 112 crore. It was for the first time that the civic body’s property tax collection target had crossed the Rs 100 crore-mark.

For the financial year 2019-20, the civic body had initially set a property tax collection target of Rs 218 crore, but so far it has managed to collect only Rs 135 crore. Owing to this, the NMC has revised the property tax collection target for 2019-20 to Rs 140 crore.

The water tax collection target for the ongoing fiscal was set at Rs 65 crore by the civic body, but till now only Rs 45 crore has been collected. Hence, the NMC has also revised the water tax collection target to Rs 55 crore.

There are a total of 4.5 lakh properties in the city that are under the tax ambit. Of these, around 1.92 lakh property owners have defaulted on their payments.

According to a civic official, around 1.41 lakh defaulters have property tax dues between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000, while 24,000 defaulters have dues between Rs 11,000 and Rs 25,000.

“There are around 10,000 tax defaulters who have property tax dues between Rs 26,000 and Rs 1 lakh, while around 2,000 defaulters with dues over Rs 1 lakh,” he said.

“We have also issued warrants to around 1,900 tax defaulters who have tax dues over Rs 1 lakh. We have warned them of confiscating their properties,” he added.

“We can partner with India in terms of funds and experience-sharing. These are the two fields where The Netherlands has considerable experience and expertise. We are looking forward to good proposals that are bankable, focused and result-oriented,” he said.

“An integrated approach is required to address the issue of floodings in India. In The Netherlands, we have an integrated approach with water governance, involving officials from all the areas. Public institutes are also a part of it. We have years of experience and expertise in flood control and will be happy to share them with India,” Berge said.

“The Netherlands attracts around 2,500 students per year from India. We concentrate on quality, rather than quality. Most of our universities nowadays teach in English. We provide the students a year to find jobs after their course is over. We are also considering what joint exercises, such as courses or research work, can be done with India,” he said.

307,['3/03/2020'],Sweltering summer in store for Gujarat: IMD,"Maximum temperatures will be 0.5-1 degree celsius higher than normal

AHMEDABAD: After the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s national forecast, the regional office of the IMD on Monday said that summer will be hotter this year.

Jayanta Sarkar, regional director, IMD, said their forecast for March, April and May states that several parts of the state will experience higher temperatures than normal.

“The forecast states that maximum temperatures will be higher than normal by between 0.5 and one degree celsius over the region,” he said. “This will be the second straight year in which higher than normal temperatures are expected. Heat waves will also be more frequent.”

The IMD had earlier forecast a ‘warmer than normal’ summer over most meteorological subdivisions of northwest, west and central India and some sub-divisions in southern India.

On March 29, 2019, the city recorded its second hottest March day in a decade, with a maximum temperature of 42°C. Average temperatures were frequently above 40°C, said experts, attributing the gradual increase to multiple factors including climate change. While a comprehensive report for winter is yet to be compiled for Gujarat , experts in the IMD said there were fewer ‘very cold’ days this season.

The short term forecast on Monday projected a slight increase in temperatures. Against the maximum temperature of 34.4°C on Monday, which was 0.4 degrees higher than normal, the maximum on Tuesday could hit 35°C.

“No large change in maximum and minimum temperatures is very likely over the region for the next three days,” the forecast stated.

With a maximum temperature of 35.4°C, Amreli was the hottest place in Gujarat, followed by Rajkot (35.2°C), Surendranagar and Keshod (35°C), Kandla (34.6°C), Ahmedabad and Deesa (34.4°C).

This was in connection with the protest during demolition of Banjara settlements in Nagaur district.

Rathore questioned as to how the police issued summons asking the MLAs to be present for questioning on March 2 when the house was in session. Police sent notice to RLP MLAs Pukhraj Garg and Indira Bawri asking them to be present at the range office of additional superintendent of police CB CID. He said the notices were pasted on the residences of both the MLAs in their absence. He alleged that it is part of a conspiracy to declare these MLAs as fugitives.

During discussion on motion for breach of privilege, minister BD Kalla intervened saying, “The rules for breach of privilege were not followed. Neither prior notice was given, nor documents attached. Encroachments were removed in compliance of high court order. Both MLAs could appear for questioning after assembly session.”

Speaker CP Joshi taking a tough stand on the issue said he would take a decision after the government’s response. He added that calling MLAs for questioning while the House is in session is a clear violation of the directions of the House.

“The assembly session is on. This is an attempt to prevent the MLAs from participating in the proceedings of the House. There is provision for waiver in special circumstances in introducing breach of privilege motion,” said Joshi.

The speaker also added that it is not MLAs’ responsibility to write to the police seeking fresh date for appearance but of the government.

311,['3/03/2020'],Anti-pollution panel orders closure of 5 industrial units,"Chandigarh: The Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) has slapped environment compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh on five industrial units for violating norms and ordered their closure.

Besides, show-cause notices were issued to 33 units and 133 DG sets owners for violating environmental rules.

TC Nautiyal, member secretary, CPCC, said the industrial units were inspected on random basis and action taken accordingly. The environmental compensation was slapped as per directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). “Action is being taken against units discharging waste water without necessary treatment and emitting air emissions without any air pollution control device. The drive against polluting industrial units will continue in the coming months,” he said. All these show-cause and closure notices were issued in last 10 days He clarified notices would be revoked of those who comply with the rules.

The CPCC is a regulatory body granting consent to operate for the operation of industrial units under Water (Prevention and Control of pollution) Act, 1974; Air (Prevention and Control of pollution) Act 1981 and under Environment (Protection) Act 1986. The consent is granted with certain terms and conditions which have to be abided by all industrial units.

The CPCC inspection revealed many units were not complying with the terms and conditions mentioned in their consent orders. The CPCC has also directed UT electricity department to disconnect power supply to a unit to whom closure notice was issued.

Industrial units are broadly categorized into three categories, red, orange and green in decreasing order of severity of pollution. In this classification, “red” represents highly polluting industries, “orange” represents moderately polluting industries and “green” marginally polluting industries.

Box:

The National Green Tribunal in November last year had directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to revise its mechanism for setting up of new industrial units as also expansion activities in critically polluted areas. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had also warned that it will take “coercive action” against the heads of state pollution control boards (SPCBs) for failing to take concrete action against violators. It said the CPCB data shows increasing air, water and soil pollution and violators of law cannot be allowed to have a free run at the cost of environment and public health.

316,['3/03/2020'],Cong slugs it out with CM over debt,"Chandigarh: Congress’s Raghbir Singh Kadian and ex-CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda got into a heated debate with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar over mounting public debt during Monday sitting of the Haryana assembly.

It began with a discussion on the state government planning to raise public debt to Rs 198 lakh crore by the financial year’s end.

Former speaker Kadian, while discussing the budget address with Khattar, said the state had recorded the highest revenue deficit this year and this could prove to be harmful to governance.

Kadian said figures quoted by the CM, while referring to growth in agriculture and allied sectors and other sectors, were misleading.

Hooda and Kadian claimed that the Khattar government took a loan of over Rs 100 lakh crore over a period of six years, against the norm of Rs 70,000 crore taken by previous governments in Haryana till 2013-14.

On this, Khattar asked Hooda and Kadian to add a loan of Rs 28,000 crore, which government had taken over power distribution companies in 2015, to the figure.

“UDAY scheme had disturbed the figure for us, despite the fact all this had happened during the Congress’s term. Hence, they should have added this with Rs 70,000 crore. If this amount is added, debt is under limit,” said Khattar.

Another issue which brought treasury benches and opposition benches against each other included multi-level parking scam of the Rohtak Municipal Corporation.

Congress Rohtak MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra raised the issue and Hooda too joined in later.

It ended with Khattar ordering a probe into the alleged scam.

BENGALURU: The city will get light showers this week, but there will be no respite from high temperature in summer. It will be 0.5 to 1°C higher than normal, the weather department said.

Blaming urbanisation and global warming for this, an India Meteorological Department official said: “January, which is ideally a continuation of winter, was also warmer than expected this year. We expect the next few months to be hotter than usual.”

The highest temperature recorded in March last year was 37°C, which almost broke the all-time record of 37.3°C on March 29, 1999. The mean average temperature for the month, calculated based on data from 1981 to 2010, is 33.1°C, which means that this year, the average temperature in March could touch 34.1°C.

The trend will be similar in April and May, even as some rain is expected periodically.

While it’s too early to forecast rain for April and May, the IMD predicted light showers for the next five weeks, bringing relief to Bengalureans and those living on the outskirts. This rain is the beginning of pre-monsoon showers and the next three months will see thunderstorms and hailstorms too.

IMD director CS Patil said, “Considering that there has been so much of heat, it is sure to rain over the next few days. Even if it doesn’t in the city, there will be light showers on the outskirts and neighbouring districts.”

Health concerns

The increasing temperature has left doctors worried. “Dry climate and high humidity can cause heat stroke, dryness in the nose and chapped skin, especially among children. It can lead to acute tiredness and dehydration too. One should drink more water,” said Dr SM Prasad, professor, department of paediatrics, Dr BR Ambedkar Medical College. He felt children should ideally not be made to stand for morning assembly in schools under the sun as it could lead to sunstroke.

They said they were coming across reports of virus-related deaths going up. “Every day, we are hearing at least 10-15 fatalities on the island. We are stranded in camps and not being allowed to go out. We want to return to India,” the workers said in a video appeal to external affairs minister S Jaishankar.They said since no flights were being operated, they cannot come back to India. Their company where they are working is also not taking interest to send them home. Anil Chauhan of Uttar Pradesh told TOI over phone from Kish Island that they work in with a construction firm. “We were first taken to Dubai as we were given to understand that we would be employed there. However, we were taken to Kish Island from there,” he said. The workers have been on the island for nearly six months now.A Telugu worker Narasimha Reddy urged the government to help them come back to their native. Narasimha told TOI that the coronavirus scare was spreading fast in Iran. “We cannot even go to the hospital for a medical check-up. Flights to India and other countries have been cancelled,” he said. He works in Tehran.Jaishankar said he has been working on the issue of Indian workers stranded in Iran anxious to return. “Have seen many tweets in this regard. We are collaborating with the Iranian authorities to set up a screening process for return of Indians,” he tweeted.Indian ambassador to Iran Dhamu Gaddam said in view of Covid-19, they are working to facilitate the return of the Indians wishing to go back home. “Discussions are under way with the authorities to work out travel arrangements,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74450929,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110634,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/workers-in-iran-worried-over-virus-call-on-union-govt-to-airlift-them-back-to-india/articleshow/74448973.cms
319,['3/03/2020'],Everyone Gets A Farewell With Honour,"Hyderabad: In the last six years, Goutham Kumar has performed the last rites of over 800 people – most of them abandoned, destitute and orphans. Each time he called family members or relatives, they either disconnected the call abruptly or bluntly said they had nothing to do with the deceased.

“But nobody deserves to die feeling unwanted. People who live in homes and orphanages do not lead happy lives. Do they not deserve respect and love even in death?” asks the 33-year-old founder of Serve Needy Voluntary Organization and Orphanage Home. He runs the organisation with help from his parents, C Venkataramana Reddy and C Lalitha Reddy, and a handful of volunteers.

The turning point in his life came in 2015, when Kumar saw a body at Gandhi Hospital, surrounded by mourning relatives. “I realised how alone people are in death. The wife sold her mangalsutra to get money for the last rites,” he said. Since then, Kumar’s NGO started gathering details about bodies from the police and homes and performing the last rites, following a thorough inquiry.

From getting the death certificate, obtaining necessary permissions and organising the items necessary for rituals, Kumar and his team do it all. They even conduct the post funeral rites, like ‘pind-daan’. About Rs 6,000 is spent on each funeral. Interestingly, it’s mostly women volunteers who help him with the rituals, despite a taboo around such practices.

Asked about the funding, Goutham said he either pays out of his pocket or uses the money left from donations that come in for other projects, he is involved in.

Speaking to TOI, Father Thomas of St Alphonsa Karunalayam at Rajendranagar said, “Earlier we were given a small plot by the GHMC. But villagers living around objected to destitute being buried. Caste would be one of their issues. Now we call Goutham and they readily help.”

But providing respectable funeral is only a part of what the NGO does. Their other social service projects include providing food and clothes to the poor, encouraging organic farming and distributing those vegetables in homes for free, making logs out of cow dung so as to reduce usage of wood in funerals , contributing basic amenities at government schools and recycling waste paper into notebooks that are then distributed among poor tribals.

320,['3/03/2020'],Progress can be achieved on a green path,"Hyderabad: The expansion of the national highway connecting Hyderabad-Chevella-Bijapur last year would have meant axing of over 9,000 trees , many of them decades-old Banyans. But the project was shelved, thanks to a sustained campaign by ‘Save the Banyans of Chevella’. The group — part of the larger ‘Nature Lovers of Hyderabad’— rallied for over two months at multiple locations to stall the green murder.

“The group is a mix of people with diverse knowledge and expertise. For us, it was important to present a rational and well-researched campaign to save the banyans on the Chevella–Vikarabad NH 163,” said Kobita Dass Kolli, one of the group members. Their determination to protect the trees could be seen at multiple fora. A protest in front of the forest department headquarters in Aranya Bhavan at the end of May last year stands out: They held a silent, non-violent demonstration that day, even as dozens of police personnel cordoned the premises.

The core group, which comprises about 20 people, includes teachers, doctors, researchers, homemakers and conservationists. With home-work balance to be maintained, members still find time to create awareness on an issue close to their heart. Through talks and nature walks, they have tried to make protecting the environment an inclusive issue. The crux of the group’s argument is that development projects can be planned without disturbing natural habitats.

“Project implementation agencies do not need to do away with trees—cutting or translocation are just different sides of the same coin. Based on existing Indian Road Congress guidelines, we prepared an exhaustive document with suggestions to retain trees that exist along roads,” said another member, Pranay Juvvadi

Group member Tejah Balantrapu says, “The group has produced a tree translocation protocol to help agencies make these decisions in a scientific manner. So, the impact of the group’s work has long-term implications.”

Since the time group was started in April 2017, Sadhana Ramchander says its work has come full circle. “Kobita and I set out to get people as excited as we get when we witness nature’s magic. We have succeeded with our work with children and through our tree walks with people of all ages. We got into a bit of activism when it was needed, and I am sure we will rise to the occasion again to speak up for trees and tree dwellers if the need arises.”

Meghwal said that at present, the work of regular Girdawari is going on from February 1 and will last on March 5. The actual status of the damage will be known only on receipt of Girdawari report. As per SDRF norms, agricultural grant is payable on receipt of 33 per cent or more crop coverage.

Meghwal, earlier replying to a question said that all farmers who suffered crop loss in Kharif season 2019 would be compensated by the state government before March 31. He said that this is the first time in the past 5 years that the state government has started giving compensation to affected farmers from February itself. Earlier, compensations to farmers used to be delayed till May-June.

Chicken is handled in the most unhygienic conditions at stalls and markets. They are transported to the city in filthy, stinking cages mostly from Salem and Namakkal.The abattoir at Pulianthope, the city’s oldest and largest, that gets around 500 goats and 300 cattle on weekends is in a mess and years of neglect has made it a health hazard for nearby residents.On Monday, TOI saw piles of bones, hooves and refuse all over. In the absence of a proper platform, workers spread animal skin on the ground so that the meat doesn’t get soiled when chopped. Dogs have made the sheds their home and were found lying on the floor where meat is handled.A meat vendor who has a stall inside the abattoir and lives in the neighbourhood said: “The refuse is not removed. We get scorpions and snakes in our homes. The stench makes it tough to live here.”Traders who bring their cattle and goats to slaughter are helpless and worried as their pleas to the Greater Chennai Corporation and politicians for a new building at the same location are not being heeded. Tiles have fallen down from most parts of the roof, which can collapse anytime.“The abattoir does not have basic facilities. As there is no proper platform to cut the meat, they are forced to spread the skin on the ground and chop the meat,” said Perambur MLA Thayagam Kavi. He said a toilet is ready but could not be used because there was no water and sewerage connection.As the abattoir is in bad shape, retail sellers are uncomfortable selling meat that comes from Pulianthope. In many markets -- including at Zam Bazaar in Triplicane -- they slaughter goats adjacent to stalls because buyers want the meat to be clean.S Salauddin, president, Chennai Mutton Merchant (retailers) Association, said, “The abattoir in Pulianthope is in bad shape. It is not able to handle the number of animals. The meat that comes from there is cut in an unhygienic manner. It turns red fast. But we have no option but to sell it when demand is high on weekends.”“We have asked the government to open abattoirs in Adyar, Porur, Tiruvotiyur, Mogappair so neighbourhoods there and get quality meat,” he said.Salauddin said the abattoir at Pulianthope should not have stalls. “These stalls were opened as piece market for the poor who used to sell the balance meat from slaughtering for a living. But now it has become a business,” he said.B Sampath, secretary, Chennai Mttiraichi Vyaparigal Sangam (beef traders association) said: “We are helpless. We have made representations to authorities to improve the condition. But they are not doing it.”The corporation has plans to improve the facility and build new sheds. “Three to four years ago we had repaired the floor but because the cattle are heavy, it got damaged. The renovation plan is likely to cost Rs 1 crore.

325,['3/03/2020'],Bengaluru: Open-school batches on regular campuses grow popular,"TimesView This is a welcome trend and a much-needed shift in the right direction. One of the biggest flaws of our education system is rigidity of the curriculum and the unreasonable expectations students have to meet, making school attendance the front and centre of everything. Different people need different kinds of education, and the acceptance of this fact is the first step towards that goal. While open schooling may carry a stigma for parents who want their children to be academic over-achievers, it fills an important need and, over time, this bias will end.

BENGALURU: Ahan Prakash, a class 10 student of Delhi Public School (East) in the city, is currently attending an All India Football Federation camp for the under-17 team in Bhubaneswar. What makes it possible for Ahan to juggle the two roles effortlessly is a parallel session that the school hosts for students enrolled through National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).“The best thing is Ahan doesn’t miss out on going to school, being part of regular classes and hanging out with his friends. At the same time, he also chases his passion for football. He doesn’t have to compromise on either,” said Tuhina Anand, his mother, a marketing-entrepreneur.The regular sessions run by some CBSE schools in the city for children enrolled in NIOS are gaining popularity among parents.These schools go beyond being a regular study centre. The same teachers who teach CBSE students, teach NIOS students too and engage them in every school programme, yet allowing them the flexibility of NIOS.The student community in these batches include those who are good at arts/sports and can’t attend classes full time, specially abled, those who do not want to learn all subjects a regular board mandates or anyone who has missed the opportunity of getting into a normal school. The students get to write classes 10 and 12 exams in April, October or on demand. They pay regular school fees.“Several families, where both parents are working, didn’t know what to do with their children enrolled in the open-schooling system on working days. They would want the kids to be in a school, yet not go through the drill of a regular curriculum, the very reason why they may not have put them in a normal schooling system in the first place. So, what started with three students in the mid-2000s (under NIOS) has now grown to 195 pupils in class 10 and 120 in class 12,” said Manju Balasubramaniam, principal, DPS (North).DPS (East), which has 43 students in class 10 and 22 in class 12 under NIOS, has had kabaddi, cricket, football and formula racers, apart from students who wanted to skip math or any of the science subjects in their batches.“Several people feel getting into NIOS is below their dignity. But, NIOS is on a par with any other board,” said Manila Carvalho, principal, DPS (East).For some schools, the NIOS session is a means to be inclusive. “Our NIOS sessions have trained teachers for students with special needs. For sports and fine arts classes, we involve these students with regular batches. We have shadow teachers to help them develop social skills and make education inclusive,” said Renu Benny, principal, Kensri School.Some of these schools also run classes for private candidates over the weekend.

Now, if the lease is not registered for three years after the issuance of lease deed, the deeds will have to be issued afresh. Also, if the property is sold without registration or in whose name the lease deed is issued and the person dies before the lease is registered, then a new lease will have to be issued.

The rules have been issued for the first time in the state. Till now there were no guidelines in this context and the all the civic bodies used different procedures. The bodies revoked unregistered leases for registration according to their own rules, for which they used to charge some fee. However, there was no time limit for which the lease deed could be revived and there was no three-year obligation.

According to the new rule, the lease for registration can be done for a period of three years from the date of issue of the renewal lease deed. An official said, “Under this rule, if a land owner does not get his house registered for some time after issuing the lease and the transfer of the colony takes place from the UIT or development authority to the local body, in such a situation the plot holder will have to get a new lease.”

The official further explained that the new lease deed will be issued in these conditions. First, three years from the date of issue of the lease, if the lease is not registered. Second, the jurisdiction of the lease issuing agency (UIT, development authority, local body or housing board) has changed. Third, the lease holder is dead or the person has endorsed or transferred the property.

This, as Dubai is not currently listed by the Union government among countries from where passengers aboard incoming flights are to be screened for the virus.That many travel from Hyderabad to Dubai and back regularly, either for work or recreation, opens up the possibilty of more suspects. What is also a worry is that the software professional who tested positive in Hyderabad, while in transit from Dubai through Bengaluru, may have left a long trail of contacts at various locations. These include passengers in the flight, bus depots and halt points. This makes tracing suspects a difficult task and is likely to involve multiple governments and other agencies.Presently, passengers aboard incoming flights from Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nepal, Iran and Italy besides China and Hong Kong are slated for screening upon arrival. “Dubai is currently not on the list as per the central notification. Now, with this case, it is likely to be added,” said state health minister Eatala Rajender.At the Hyderabad airport, as on February 29, around 17,000 passengers have undergone thermal screening.

332,['3/03/2020'],Cattle cover claims denied: MLA in House,"Hisar: Congress’s Gohana MLA Jagbir Malik expressed concern about the problems faced by cattle owners in getting claims under the special livestock insurance scheme (SCSP) for their dead animals. Highlighting the issue in the state assembly during the budget session, he said the insurance company rejected or delayed claims of many cattle owners despite them having paid the premium.

According to the state department of animal husbandry and dairying, 2,29,052 animals, including cattle were insured under SCSP.

Of these, 3,587 animals have died. Department data shows that of the dead animals, insurance claims of 1,469 (41%) were pending and 293 (8%) rejected.

Cattle owner Rohan Dalal said he got his buffalo insured on February 25, 2019 and it died 21 days later.

“When I applied for the claim, it was found that the insurance company issued the policy after the buffalo died.”

Several other cattle owners also shared similar stories with TOI.

A veterinary surgeon claimed that despite applicants completing all formalities and receiving Rs 100 per animal from owners, the company did not issue insurance policies to 80 of them.

General manager of Hindustan Insurance Broker Limited (HIBL), the company hired to insure livestock under SCSP, Umesh Sarin said, “We have processed around 2,200 claims this time. Earlier, only 600 to 700 claims were processed. Some claims that are being rejected are due to the death of the animal within 15 days of the policy being issued or their RFID tag being broken.”

Haryana Live Stock Development Board chairman Somveer Sangwan, who is an independent MLA from Dadri, claimed cattle owners are not facing any issues.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Monday directed the Tamil Nadu government to file its response on the anti-CAA protests being held across the state.

A division bench of Justice M M Sundresh and Justice Krishnan Ramasamy passed the interim order on the plea moved by a resident of Salem seeking to stall one such protest organised near the Salem old bus stand primarily on the ground that children are participating.

When the plea came up for hearing, counsel G Kannan submitted that the protests are causing inconvenience to the public without any regulatory steps being taken by the authorities.

Recording the same, the bench said, “Though the petition has been filed pertaining to protests at a particular place, in as much as it is a pro bono one, the response from the state may be called for on the similar protests going on throughout the state.” The bench asked the petitioner whether there were any laws that prevented children from participating in protests.

As the additional government pleader submitted that the advocate-general would appear for the state and sought time, the court adjourned the plea to March 9.

The petitioner said a detailed response from the government is required pertaining to the action taken on the protests that are going on across the state without permission.

In an earlier hearing, the court wondered whether there is any statutory bar against participation of children in protests and demonstrations.

JAIPUR: Till February 28, the Urban Development Tax collected by revenue officials at Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) since last April 2019 was Rs 64 crore which is higher than that collected (Rs 44 crore) in 2018-19 for the same period. The collection though better than last year, officials of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) are yet to collect more than Rs 500 crore of Urban Development Tax (UD Tax).

As per the officials, the UD tax is still being collected on the old property survey done in the year 2005 due to which JMC is in financial losses. The city has expanded in area and in population in two decades and more properties need to be added under those taxable.

Deputy commissioner revenue Naveen Bhardhwaj said that they have added 2,000 properties this year. “City has expanded so more properties need to be included. Taxable property survey is yet to be completed and till then we conducted our survey and added around 2,000 properties. That is one of the major reasons that we were able to collect more than last year,” said Naveen.

As per the revenue officials at JMC only 1.33 lakh properties have been registered as taxable in JMC although more than 7 lakh are still remaining. The project to complete the property survey in Jaipur was given to a private company in 2015 that should have completed the process till now. As the work is not completed even after five years, government has decided to terminate the contract of the company but due to this JMC will have to face severe revenue losses.

Officials of JMC were expecting to touch at least Rs 100 crore collection this year but this seems to be a distant dream. “We were busy in Swachhta Survekshan , now dates of urban body election is coming closer. After that population census or some other target will be given to the officials. When are we supposed to work when we will be engaged in other works,” remarked one JMC official.

JMC has started organising UD tax collection camps in different places of the city starting from Monday (March 1) till March 20, 2020.

In his FIR with Gujarat University police, Hemant Chaubey, a resident of Teachers’ Staff Quarters behind the girls’ hostel of Gujarat University, stated that he has been principal at Swarnim College for seven years.

On January 14, when Chaubey and his wife were home, they saw a puppy that was sick.

Chaubey’s wife wanted to help it and she searched Google for animal help centres.

“She found a website at the url ‘www.petshelpline.co.in’ and a helpline number with it. When my wife called the helpline, a man answered the call and began speaking to my wife in Hindi. He told my wife that she would need to pay Rs 10 via a hyperlink that would be sent to her phone, so that an animal rescue van could be sent there to help the puppy,” Chaubey stated in the FIR.

She clicked the link and paid the money but the man called Chaubey’s wife and told her that no transaction had taken place and then disconnected the call. After a while, she received text messages showing that Rs 44,997 had been debited from her bank account in four transactions.

Chaubey then approached cyber crime police station from where he was given a ticket number to lodge a complaint. One-and-a-half month later, Gujarat University police registered a complaint for breach of trust and cheating under IPC along with charges under the Information Technology Act.

According to the victim’s family, Maninder Singh (29) had flown to the US on a tourist visa around nine years ago and never come back. He was settled in Indianapolis and used to work at a store.

His father Avtar Singh, who retired from Punjab Police, said, “We got the information that Maninder had been shot in a robbery attempt.

339,['3/03/2020'],"Chennai CAA Protest: Amid rage of anti-CAA stir, kids bring a smile in Chennai","Children take part in the anti-CAA protest in Chennai

CHENNAI: It has been more than a fortnight since Washermenpet became the epicentre of Chennai’s anti-CAA movement. And every day since, four-year-old Mohammad Waseem arrives at the venue around noon with his mother Rehana Begum, a tailor in the neighbourhood, and is handed a tablet larger than his palms, on which he plays patriotic songs and Candy Crush Saga.

According to Rehana, all Mohammad knows is that “CAA is bad for the country and its people”, but in a little time when he’s old enough to understand, she will tutor him on why this is the case. “For now, he comes along, so that he remembers and registers that we stood up for our rights. H e should do the same,” she says.

Recently, activists and parents have been underlining children’s constitutional right to protest, against a National Commission for Protection of Child Rights’ (NCPCR) order discouraging their participation and offering them counselling. But here at Washermenpet, the children are the tribe that is softening and transforming an air set alight with ire and frustration into one that is heady with sweet, heart-warming art and music, to drive home the point like no adult can.

While the infants look on, rocking to the lullaby of ‘Nam Paarpome’ on their mother’s laps, older ones like Naseer Khan, 12, and Mohamed Yusuf, 13, are squatted in an open parking lot — also the protest’s ‘art corner’ — producing chart after chart of colourful, multi-religious families, the national flag and flying doves. Many hurry back to the site straight from school to meet friends, sing and draw, while some haven’t gone in days. “A government that is perceptive enough to worry about our children missing school days, can surely understand their right to a secure future in this country,” says one parent. Another young mother brings her toddler to the site because there’s no facility to leave her behind.

While few kids have fully gathered the intricacies of the issue, they’ve all imbibed key slogans their parents say are the heart and essence of the movement. “This is not a protest, it’s a revolution,” says Naseer. “We’re fighting for humanity, brotherhood and an equal future,” says Mohamed. And they’re constantly reminded to imbibe this spirit in their own little way by sharing snacks and juice bottles with those who need them, fight little and stay disciplined.

The children’s anti-CAA movement is different in many ways, but foremost, as a flipside to the crusade of fiery speeches, angry questions and raging slogans. With their little cheeks smeared with the colours of the Indian flag, their eyes gleaming through fragile paper masks of Begum Hazrat Mahal, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and Rani Lakshmibai, they hold hands and sing ‘Ae watan watan mere abad rahe tuh’ (Oh my dear country, may you always remain prosperous!). And suddenly, there’s no one on Sajja Munusamy and Aziz Mohamed street who doesn’t take a moment to smile, even tear up a little.

KENDRAPADA: A man who served a month in jail on charges of killing his wife in 2013, finally managed to track down the woman and her lover with the help of police on Sunday.

Abhaya Sutar of Kendrapada’s Chaulia village married Itishree Moharana of Samagola village on February 7, 2013. She went missing from her in-laws’ house after two months of marriage. Abhaya, who was 27, failed to find her and filed a complaint with Patkura Police on April 20, 2013.

Itishree’s father Prahallad Moharana lodged a counter-complaint on May 14, 2013, alleging that his daughter had been tortured by her husband for dowry and that Abhaya has dumped her body after killing her. This led to Abhaya’s arrest.

On being released on bail a month later, Abhaya, who suspected Itishree of eloping with someone, began his long search for her. He at last tracked her to Pipili, where she was living with her lover.

On being contacted by Abhaya and other sources, police went to Pipili and detained Itishree and her paramour, Rajiv Lochan Moharana .

“Both were produced in the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Kendrapada on Monday. In her statement, Itishree said she had been in an affair with Rajiv before marriage but her parents forced her to wed Abhaya,” said Sujit Pradhan, IIC of Patkura police station.

After two months of marriage, she had fled with Rajiv to Gujarat where they lived for seven years, Pradhan added. The couple, who have a son and a daughter, returned to Odisha recently. Rajiv works as an auto-rickshaw driver in Bhubaneswar.

“When police could not locate my wife, I started looking for her. I visited several places where I thought she could have gone. On getting information that she was staying with her lover in Pipili, I called police. I am happy that I have been able to prove my innocence after seven years,” said Abhaya.

Atul Soni was booked under Sections 307, 323, 498 A of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25-54-59 of the Arms Act after he allegedly shot at his wife with an illegal pistol at their house in Mohali in the early hours of January 19.

When TOI questioned the DSP, he replied: “Galat hai saara kuch (Everything is wrong).”

Soni, even after he was booked, had been busy promoting his Punjabi movie, ‘Jagga Jagravan Joga’ on his social media accounts.

The DSP had applied for anticipatory bail in the district court on January 21. His plea was rejected on January 23. On January 24, he moved the Punjab and Haryana high court and his arrest was stayed on January 28. Later, when the matter came up for hearing on January 31, his bail plea was dismissed. The Mohali police had even issued a look out circular against the DSP on February 25. However, one of the questions which remains unanswered is that from where the DSP got the illegal pistol?

347,['3/03/2020'],Cops put two-way traffic plan on FC Road stretch on hold,"Pune: The traffic police on Monday put on hold its plan to make the Veer Chapekar Chowk-Dnyaneshwar Paduka Chowk stretch of Fergusson College Road a two-way facility, three days after announcing the new arrangement.

The department had issued a notification on February 27, announcing conversion of the stretch from a one-way into a two-way facility. The department had then, in support of its decision, cited the inconvenience caused to FC-road bound motorists by the detours from Ganeshkhind Road, Patil Estate and Model Colony.

On Monday, the department issued a statement saying that the road had been opened as a two-way stretch after February 27. “However, heavy congestion all the way to Goodluck Chowk was noticed on the first day of the implementation as the carriageway is currently narrow due to the ongoing Smart City work between Hotel Lalit Mahal Chowk and Veer Chapekar Chowk.”

It added, “Only one lane of the road was available for traffic coming from FC Road, leading to the congestion. The SSC and HSC board examinations are also under way. Due to this, the notification to convert the stretch into two-way road has been put on hold.”

Model Colony resident Raja Mohan said the implementation of the two-way arrangement had triggered traffic chaos. “This is a proof that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and police need better coordination. I still maintain that FC Road should remain a one-way stretch. There is no space left anymore for two-way vehicular movement.”

Amar Jadhav, who frequently visits FC Road, said, “The road has two major problems — wrong-side driving and illegal parking. The police should address these problems first before trying these traffic experiments. Let the police install traffic cameras at Goodluck Chowk and outside the second gate of Fergusson College. This will ensure better traffic management.”

The traffic department had in 2008 made FC Road a one-way thoroughfare.

348,['3/03/2020'],Stir by drinking water units leads to rush at RO plants,"Madurai: People in large numbers have been thronging reserve osmosis (RO) plants installed by the Madurai Corporation for the last few days as the demand for the bubble top water can has increased following the strike called by the packaged drinking water manufacturers.

There are around 15 RO plants maintained by the corporation. The civic body is providing piped drinking water supply to 72 wards constituting the core city, while the remaining 28 wards are covered through tanker trucks. People in these areas are mainly dependent on private drinking water suppliers.

The number of people thronging the plants for water has increased from 275 to 350 on an average in a day. As water supply by private players has come down, people are not left with many options, said a person, who takes care of the RO facility in Iravathanallur, which became operational 10 years ago.

Officials said that the demand for RO water at the 15 units has increased between 20% and 50% depending on the demand in the respective areas. Crowd increased by 50% in places like Vandiyur, one of the newly-added wards, on Sunday.

“We are dependent of private drinking water suppliers. We could not find both the bubble top can suppliers and RO water supplying tankers for the past few days. So, we are making use of the RO units installed by the corporation,” said P Sankar from Iravathanallur.

The high court in a recent order had asked all packaged drinking water units to get NOCs from the PWD, directorate of food safety and administration and directorate of town planning and then apply for clearance from the Tamil Nadu pollution control board to continue operations. This has affected all manufacturers. Packaged drinking water suppliers have jumped into an indefinite strike as officials started taking action against units, which did not comply with existing rules.

A higher official from corporation said that he has instructed officials to run RO plants to its fullest capacity to alleviate the drinking water scarcity situation. However, each unit has its own capacity, which can serve only limited people, he said.

The incident occurred around 10pm on Sunday at Jambut phata near Narayangaon, about 82km from here. “The woman alleged in her FIR that Akshay Dandavate from Shirur also put a pistol to her head and attempted to kill her by threatening to pull the trigger thrice,” Arjun Ghode Patil, assistant inspector, Narayangaon police, told TOI.Ghode Patil said that the suspect was nabbed from near Ale Phata by a police team led by inspector T Y Mujawar. “We have recovered the firearm from him. We are probing from where Dandavate procured the country-made pistol,” Ghode Patil said.He said that the complainant and the suspect knew each other as they studied in the same college at Manchar.

350,['3/03/2020'],Formalin in fish? Officials raid market,"Representative image

CHENNAI: When two fish samples picked from the market turned blue during a spot test – food safety inspectors suspected that they might be lined with formalin, a cancer-causing substance commonly used in labs as an antiseptic or disinfectant, or to preserve bodies in mortuaries.

Coating fish with the chemical can increase shelf life of the meat that is highly perishable, said Chennai city district food safety official A Ramakrishnan. A team of food inspectors visited markets in Chinthadripet and surrounding areas such as Swami Pandaram Street and Palani Andavar Koil Street. Earlier, another team visited 25 shops in Kasimedu area and lifted five samples that looked ‘suspicious’. “We did not find much in the spot test, so we sent all seven samples to the lab for further tests,” he said.

The raid followed similar action in Madurai last week when food safety officials dumped nearly two tonnes of fish coated with formalin. “It was a cause of concern. We do not want people to eat fish coated with chemicals,” said another senior food safety official.

Fish coated with formalin are usually stiff, have a pungent smell and don’t have flies hovering above it. Although most of the formalin is washed off while cleaning the fish, it may still cause problems.

Studies show that although formalin can cause nausea, upset stomach, respiratory disorders or trigger allegoric reactions initially, long-term consumption can increase risks of cancer. “It’s good officials planned a similar raid in Chennai but instead of raiding the market on a busy Sunday, they raided it on Monday. Sunday is when they exhaust most of the stock. We are never sure which one of the fish is fresh,” said Subbiah Arul, who buys his weekly stock of fish from the Chinthadripet market.

The officer has since returned to his home in Bhubaneswar.

DIPRO Hemant Nayak joined his posting in Sambalpur on February 20, at the end of a long leave he had taken after being transferred out of Dhenkanal on December 27. After attending a government meeting in Bhubaneswar on February 27, the officer had taken the Bhubaneswar-Balangir Intercity Express back to Sambalpur on Friday, and had just got into his car around 11.30 am when the four men forced themselves into the vehicle.

“I don’t know them. They were speaking in the local dialect. One of them had a Mouser. They forced my driver to take the vehicle towards Ring Road and insisted that I sign a piece of paper saying I would not work in the district. In fear, I signed it, after which they got off the car. When I returned to my office, I got a threat call on the landline and was asked to leave Sambalpur or face consequences,” Nayak said, adding that he drove back to Bhubaneswar the same evening.

“I informed the director of my department, the collector and the SP of the incident. Since the collector was not in his chamber (located in the same campus as Nayak’s office), I sent him a message. Moments later, an inspector contacted me and I described the ordeal over the phone,” Nayak recalled.

While collector (Sambalpur) Subham Saxena could not be contacted, SP Kanwar Vishal Singh said a probe had been started. “The officer, however, is yet to register a police complaint,” Singh said.

Director (I&PR), Krupasindhu Mishra, confirmed that Nayak had spoken to him on February 28. “I asked him to report the matter to the collector and police. Since the allegation is criminal in nature, it is for police to probe. We, too, are examining the matter at the department level,” Mishra said.

PUNE: Pimpri police on Monday launched a search for a youth who shot at his friend with a country-made pistol when the latter taunted him for using “a toy gun”.

The incident occurred at Milindnagar in Pimpri.

Gurupreet Hardevsingh Javand (22) of Milindnagar sustained bullet injuries on his left shoulder. “He is undergoing treatment at a hospital and is currently out of danger,” Milind Waghmare, senior inspector, Pimpri police, told TOI.

355,['3/03/2020'],Weather systems trigger warmest February nights this time in 10 years,"Pune: Night temperature data with India Meteorological Department (IMD) for February in the last 10 years shows that Pune witnessed the warmest nights for this month this year.

The average night temperature in the city this February was a warm 14.8 degrees celsius, not only the highest average since 2010 but also significantly warmer than that during seven years in the last decade.

On most nights this February, Pune experienced a minimum temperature higher than 15-16 degrees celsius. In the previous years, the night temperature would be much lower, and even single digit during some years.

The second warmest February was in 2010 when the average minimum temperature was 14.7 degrees celsius in Pune. This was also the highest February average night temperature till last year, and then February 2020 took the spot recently.

The third warmest February nights in the past decade were in 2016 when the average night temperature was 14.6 degrees celsius in Pune. During most other years since 2010, the average minimum has ranged between 12-13 degrees celsius in February.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI that February 2020 witnessed considerably warmer nights. “The warmth was more conspicuous especially because after 2016, the city experienced much cooler Februarys till 2019. February 2020 played a spoilsport,” he said.

He said the presence of an anti-cyclone further north or an upper air cyclonic circulation over north Maharashtra from time to time or even a trough-line over Madhya Maharashtra to south Maharashtra during February blocked the entry of cold, northerly winds into parts of Maharashtra, especially central Maharashtra and Konkan.

“Moreover, the wind flow in Pune and other parts of the state was predominantly easterly/southeasterly and even westerly. While easterly winds come from the ocean region of the Bay of Bengal, westerly winds come from the Arabian Sea. These winds are relatively warmer and contain moisture as they come from the seas, which plays a significant role in keeping night temperatures high,” Kashyapi said.

Past studies have shown how the city’s minimum temperature has been rising. An Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) research in 2016 showed that the minimum temperature has increased faster than the maximum temperature over big and medium cities, including Pune.

As many as nine cities— Pune, Kolkata, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Nagpur, Bengaluru and Chennai— showed significant increasing trends in minimum temperature after 1971.

356,['3/03/2020'],Over 700 stranded Indian fishers face denial of essential supplies,"Madurai: The crisis faced by more than 700 Indian fishermen – most of them from Tamil Nadu – in Covid-19-affected Iran is worsening by the day as they face denial of essential supplies amid loss of mobile network connectivity. With employers threatening to cut supplies if the fishermen don’t go fishing, worried families of the fishermen petitioned the Kanyakumari district collector on Monday.

A fisherman in Iran’s Zero fishing harbour told TOI that their employers are forcing them to go fishing to retain essential supplies. “Two boats have already run out of supplies and we are managing with what is available on other boats,” he said. They will be able to manage for about two days and appealed to the Government of India to rescue them immediately. They said that owners of a few boats had warned the fishermen to go fishing or repay expenses incurred in bringing them from India.

“Fishermen working in Iran get a visa to Dubai, from where they go to work in Iran on a seaman visa. Fish caught in Iran seas is sold in Dubai. The Dubai fish market was closed for five days till Friday due to the Covid-19 crisis due to which there was no pressure on Indian fishermen from their Iranian boat owners,” South Asian Fishermen Fraternity (SAFF) general secretary Churchil said. After the market reopened on Saturday, pressure has mounted from the boat owners.

Meenavar Orunginaipu Sangam (MOS) secretary Charles Johnson said the seven to ten fishermen on each mechanised boat in Iran include an Iranian national who acts as the point of contact to get supplies to the boats and to get their mobile phones recharged. As fishermen have been sharing their plight and fear over Covid-19 outbreak in that country, boat owners have threatened to stop mobile recharging too. Led by SAFF, hundreds of kin of the fishermen petitioned Kanyakumari district collector Prashant M Wadnere.

Churchil said they have collected the names and particulars of 721 Indian fishermen and forwarded it to the ministry of external affairs. These included 528 from Kanyakumari district, 153 from other coastal districts in Tamil Nadu and 40 fishermen from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. Kanyakumari MP H Vasanthakumar has petitioned external affairs minister C Jaishankar calling for speedy repatriation of the fishermen from Iran.

357,['3/03/2020'],Pune Bank Fraud: Pune bank officers involved in cheque discounting fraud worth Rs 80 crore: Police,"Representative Image

PUNE: The economic offences’ wing of the city police on Monday established the role of another director of Shivajirao Bhosale Cooperative Bank in the Rs71.78-crore fraud, taking the number of people booked in the cheating case to 17.

The probe also revealed that non-performing assets (accounts) were fraudulently used to transfer Rs80 crore using the facility of “cheque discounting”. Joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve said the amount of the scam was increasing and the role of every person/party involved in it would be probe thoroughly.

Deputy commissioner of police (economic offences wing ) Sambhaji Kadam said apart from the cheque discounting fraud , the suspects misappropriated Rs2 crore despite the restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in late 2019. “We are investigating where the Rs2 crore has gone and who are the beneficiaries. With this, the scam amount increased to Rs153 crore,” he said.

The city police on February 26 arrested NCP MLC Anil Bhosale, also the director of the bank, with the bank’s chief executive officer, Tanaji Padwal, another director Suryaji Jadhav and officer Shailesh Bhosale. They are in the police custody till March 6.

The fraud came to light during an audit by a statutory auditor assigned in May last year by the RBI. According to the police, the bank’s directors and other officers fudged the entries of the bank’s cash balance records and siphoned off Rs71.78 crore to some other accounts for personal benefits during the 2018-19 financial year.

Kadam said, “The arrested persons and others diverted money to the account of a man under the cheque discounting facility. For these transactions, the suspects used the NPA (non-perming asset) accounts of the bank. Later, the bank officials attempted to show the cheque discounting transactions as adjustment against the NPA accounts.”

For cheque discounting transactions, a bank buys cheque before it is due and credits the amount (after deducting certain discounting charge) to the customer’s account. A fraud is perpetrated when typically, a buyer and seller, acting in connivance, win the bank’s confidence by carrying out a string of transactions, where the buyer agrees to honour the payment. As these come across as normal trade transactions, the bank agrees to raise the bill discounting limit. After a default, when a buyer fails to pay up, the seller comes up with explanations like product defect or cash crunch faced by the buyer for non-payment.

Kadam said the police would soon file another case against MLC Bhosale and others with the Deccan Gymkhana police pertaining to the misappropriation of Rs1.5 crore. He also said there would be more arrests in the case.

But along with southeast Asian countries, now it’s even Europe – we have our tickets booked for Italy which has now locked down the country for tourists,” she said.“With that route closed, several inquiries are now about destinations such as Almaty, Prague, Vienna, and Budapest, among others in eastern Europe including Russia due to cheaper airfare and hotels. This season, we have cancelled about 35% of overall bookings,” said Manish Sharma, secretary of TAFI’s Gujarat chapter.Tour operators also feel that domestic tourism too may gain traction. “Frequent travellers would surely travel, I believe that domestic circuit including Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and north-eastern states would gain Gujarati tourists,” Pathak explained.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/summer-holiday-bookings-dip-30/articleshow/74448621.cms

Chilu Rathwa (65) scolded his eldest son Popat as he was not working anywhere and for letting the cattle loose in their farm due to which the crop got damaged. Some minutes later when Chilu was sitting inside the house, Popat rushed there and picked up a wooden stick to hit Chilu on his head.

PUNE: An elderly man and one of his sons were arrested on Sunday, a day after they allegedly attacked and molested a 25-year-old woman in a housing society on Saturday night following a dispute over removing her and others from a WhatsApp group.

The Hadapsar police booked the man’s another son, too. The complainant, a homemaker, and the suspects are relatives.

The woman told TOI, “We had a family group on WhatsApp. My husband, parents-in-law and I were suddenly removed from the group. We then went to those who removed us from the group seeking reason behind the move. But they hit my husband with a remote, abused him and held him by his neck. They molested and misbehaved with me. We then decided to lodge a police complaint.”

An official from the Hadapsar police said, “Investigations revealed that the incident happened because of an old dispute between the complainant and her family members with the suspects. The incident is not serious.”

An offence of molestations among other charges of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the suspects. A police team has been fanned for arresting the third suspect on the run.

363,['3/03/2020'],Revived Panaiyur channel slowly turning into dump yard,"Madurai: The Panaiyur channel , which was recently cleaned by the corporation and put to use to carry water from the Vaigai river to the historic Vandiyur Mariamman Teppakulam, after several decades, is slowly turning into a dumpyard with residents dumping their garbage and debris into it.

The channel once used to carry water for agricultural purposes. Through a diversion at Old Ramnad Road it carried water to the sprawling Teppakulam. While water used to flow through the channel through gravity force, the channel stopped carrying water as the river’s surface level had gone down over the years. It was reduced to a mere sewage carrier. Efforts taken by the corporation brought the channel back to life last year. Officials had also stopped sewage let into the channel by closing the outlets.

S Saravanan, a resident of Munichalai said that garbage is littered particularly at places like Ismailpuram, Olaipattinam and Old Ramnad Road. Apart from household garbage, various other waste like debris is also dumped into the channel blocking water flow at various places. “Corporation officials should take steps to prevent dumping of garbage and take action against those who repeatedly involve in polluting the channel,” he said.

Chithra Devi, a resident of Pankajam Colony said that officials should take steps in educating people on the ill-effects of polluting the channel. Citizen groups can be formed to safeguard it. Points where ramping dumping takes place should be identified and fenced, she said.

A corporation official said that they are planning to take up various steps in safeguarding water bodies in the city. All the channels will be cleaned and maintained in good shape with the cooperation from the residents. They have already sensitized residents in various areas and people in Ismailpuram will also be sensitized, he said.

Vadodara: Eight months after a youth’s body was found from a pond near Bapod at Shankarpura village on the outskirts of Vadodara city, police have registered an offence of murder against three persons. The offence was registered at Varnama police station on the order of a court.

The body of Deepak Deore (26) was found from a pond near Bapod octroi post on June 25 last year. Postmortem report had revealed that Deore had grievous injuries on his head, yet police registered a case of accidental death.

Deore’s brother Mukesh too had submitted a complaint to register an offence against Sanjay Rabari, Chirag Vasava and Lala Rabari, but it was not taken note of.

Deore’s mother Meera approached a local court with a plea to direct cops to register an FIR. Looking into submissions made by Meera, the court recently ordered police to register an offence of murder against the trio.

Meera told police that on June 25, the accused trio had come to their home and asked her son to go with them as they wanted to talk about something important.

A few hours later, Vasava again came to their home to inform that Deore had accidentally fallen into a pond. Locals searched for Deore but his body was fished out by firemen in night.

Deore’s family had then alleged that he did not know swimming and hence would not venture near the pond. The family members said they were sure that the trio had killed Deore.

“We have registered an offence and formed teams to arrest the accused. It is only after they are interrogated, we would know the reason behind Deore’s murder,” said a police official.

365,['3/03/2020'],Gujarat Congress wants Priyanka Gandhi as Rajya Sabha nominee,"The Gujarat unit of the Congress will ask the party’s central leadership to nominate East UP general secretary... Read More

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat unit of the Congress will ask the party’s central leadership to nominate East UP general secretary Priyanka Gandhi as a candidate from Gujarat for the Rajya Sabha (RS) elections scheduled for March 26. Apart from the fact that the Congress is poised to win two of the four seats up for elections, Priyanka Gandhi contesting from Gujarat will give the Congress cadre a morale boost.

Election for four Rajya Sabha seats of Gujarat will be held on March 26 and the last day for nominations is March 13.

The Madhya Pradesh unit of the Congress, along with other Congress-ruled states where RS elections are to be held, have sought Priyanka Gandhi’s nomination. If it does take place, this will mark Priyanka Gandhi’s entry into electoral politics.

Paresh Dhanani, leader of opposition (LOP) confirmed the developments. “We will request party president Sonia Gandhi to nominate Priyanka Gandhi for the Rajya Sabha elections from Gujarat. We will soon make a formal representation to the leadership.”

About the candidate for the second RS seat, Dhanani refused to take any names. “There are a number of senior leaders and workers who can become Rajya Sabha members from Gujarat. The name decided by the central leadership command will acceptable to all MLAs,” Dhanani said.

On attempts being made by the BJP to ‘poach’ Congress MLAs ahead of this crucial election, Dhanani said, “We are set to wrest one seat from the BJP and win two of the four RS seats. If the BJP tries to poach our MLAs, it will face the same embarrassing defeat it did in the 2017 RS election.”

The BJP holds three of the four RS seats for which elections are to be held. With a maximum of 180 valid votes in the assembly, the Congress is in a position to win two of the four seats.

For the BJP to retain the three seats it presently holds, it will have to get Congress MLAs to cross-vote.

366,['3/03/2020'],"Pre-NPR exercise has Muslims sweating for birth, death certs","Nagpur: A security guard was deployed for the first time at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) birth and death registration department on Monday following brief commotion among certificate seekers who have been frequenting the office in the wake of National Population Register (NPR) exercise from May 1.

The rush has been getting heavier with people searching for certificates, applying for new ones or making corrections. On Monday, the figure touched a new high of 595. The graph is steadily scaling with 6,873 people flooding the department in 20 working days of February alone. Of this, 5,959 were Muslims.

As compared to 4,643 in January, the Muslim visitors saw a jump of 3% at 86.70% last month.

On Monday, citizens had to wait in queues for most part of the day as the 20-odd officials did their best to process each query as fast as possible. The figures for January and February combined are 50% of the applications received in entire 2019 and an average 12% of search reports in each of last three years.

In January, 5,581 citizens visited the department to search birth and death certificates. Tokens system too had been started to ensure smooth functioning. Also, an additional counter was opened where work now goes on beyond the office hours.

The large number people led to commotion on Monday afternoon. Medical officer and sub-registrar Ateequr Raheman Khan said a guard had to be deployed briefly. “Everyone is in a hurry. But we need some time to understand each case and process it. We are doing our best to streamline the process,” he said.

Khan too has started maintaining a register which indicated that he saw 105 people on Monday itself. These are cases where escalation is needed.

The people visiting the department are mostly seeking records prior to the year 2006, believing them as proof of citizenship, though no notification has been issued by the government so far. “After 2006, citizens can find details at zone offices,” Khan said.

The department witnessed a steep increase in the day long rush soon after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s assertion that there was “no harm in implementing NPR” in the state.

The situation seems to be alarming as many Muslims are still undecided about getting their documents ready ahead of the May 1 NPR to be carried out along with the Census.

Getting a birth and death certificate for people at advanced age or deceased too is a lengthy process. Those who are convinced of not finding any alternative to showing their certificates as a proof of citizenship are mostly the ones busy doing rounds of the department.

There was also a marked change in the class of people visiting the department. Initially, only the lower income group seemed to be worried and had been queuing up. In the past few days, people from all income groups are queuing up.

Javed Alam, who runs a private coaching centre, said Muslims were not fearful of losing citizenship but enthusiastic about fulfilling government norms. “We are doing it out of our love for the country. Some of us are not just collecting our records but are also helping the poor,” he said.

Asked about the agitation, Alam said the protests must go on but documentation too is necessary which many Muslims have realized now. “Every country enumerates it citizens and similarly India is doing it,” he said.

367,['3/03/2020'],Packaged drinking water dealers demand reopening of sealed units,"Trichy: The packaged drinking water dealers’ association here has approached the district administration, seeking permission to reopen 23 packaged drinking water companies sealed recently for not having mandatory licences.

At the weekly grievance meeting on Monday, the petitioners said that the closure of the water companies has hit the supply of packaged drinking water in the city.

As per the state’s government order number 142 issued in 2014, operating packaged drinking water units in the administrative blocks where groundwater is over-exploited or critically exploited is prohibited. Based on the GO and as per Madras high court directive, PWD groundwater division officials last week had closed the illegal packaged drinking water units as a part of the state-wide exercise.

Even the water companies in safe groundwater table blocks that were operating without renewing licenses with PWD were closed. “There were 34 packaged drinking water companies in the district, of which 23 were sealed. We need the state to make provisions in the GO to allow the existing water companies to operate,” D Kaliyamoorthy, president of the association said.

In support of the closed water companies, seven other companies that have proper licenses have stopped their operations in protest, since February 27. For the past few days, the supply of packaged drinking water cans in the city has come to a standstill.

The petitioners said that the state government can prohibit the launch of new water companies in the blocks where groundwater is exploited while permitting the operations of existing packaged drinking water companies. “District administration told us that our demands will be conveyed to the state government,” Kaliyamoorthy added.

368,['3/03/2020'],Over Rs 1cr fine slapped on traffic violators on Day I,"Bhubaneswar: A whopping Rs 1.06 crore fine was imposed on 3,870 traffic violators under the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act across the state on Sunday. Though the new MV Act was introduced on September 1, 2019, the state government refrained from its strict implementation for six months before starting the crackdown in the true spirit from Sunday.

The state government had imposed Rs 38.67 crore fine on violators under the new MV Act between September 1, 2019 and January 31 this year. But imposition of Rs 1.06 crore fine on violators in a single day was a record of sorts, though people appeared unfazed and continued to flout rules at many places on Monday.

Transport minister Padmanabh Behera said the Rs 1.06 crore fine was imposed by joint enforcement squads of the transport department and police. A little over Rs 88 lakh fine was imposed by the regional transport offices on 1,758 offenders, while about Rs 18 lakh penalty was collected by police officials from 2,112 violators on Sunday. “Our aim is not to collect fine, but to enforce the road safety rules to check accidents,” Behera said.

Till Monday evening, the joint enforcement squads had imposed over Rs 55 lakh in fines on several violators across Odisha. Two school buses were seized and penalized for flouting several provisions of the amended MV Act.

Congress on Monday slammed the transport and police squads for allegedly terrorizing motorists on the pretext of enforcing the MV Act. “We have been noticing the uncouth conduct of the transport and police officials while enforceming the new MV Act at different places. We will not tolerate this,” Congress MLA from Jatni constituency Suresh Rautray told media persons at a press conference here.

Behera, however, said the enforcement squads have been asked to be polite with people while enforcing the Act.

In medical literature, only two such cases have been reported in the Indian paediatric age group, but there is no report regarding surgical treatment for this condition, doctors claimed.Consultant paediatric cardiac surgeon Srinivas M Kini, who performed the surgery, said, “The child had problems right from birth. he would turn blue while crying, could not be fed properly as he was irritable due to lower oxygen levels in blood.”The child’s developmental milestones were grossly delayed, he started walking at the age of five. “He could walk only a few steps and would get tired and squat. He was, therefore, kept mostly indoors and had to be carried around when going outside,” the boy’s father said, adding, “The child could not digest any solid food and was only on milk-based diet. He weighed 10.5kg at the time of the surgery as against a normal weight of 21kg at least.”The father initially sought medical treatment at many reputed hospitals in Delhi where medical experts put him on medications. “His condition, however, did not improve,” the father said.Paediatric cardiac surgeon Srinivas said when when the child was brought to us, he was extremely critical. “Other padiatric cardiologists had advised a heart transplant, but I thought that his heart could be salvaged by open-heart surgery.

373,['3/03/2020'],Work on Thuvakudi-Palpannai service road yet to commence,"Trichy: Four months after Madras high court directed the state government and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to construct the service road in the missed-out portions of Trichy-Thanjavur national highway (NH 83), land acquisition is yet to begin for the road. Residents who have been demanding the road for the past eight years have announced a series of protests against the attitude of the district administration and NHAI.

Though the Trichy-Thanjavur stretch of NH 83 (old number 67) was completed during 2011-12, a 14.5 km stretch between Thuvakudi and Palpannai was not provided service road. Since there was hesitation among the stakeholders on whether to go with 45m wide or 60m wide service road, residents under the banner of Federation for Retrieval of Trichy-Palpannai-Thuvakudi Service Road filed a case in the high court demanding its construction at the earliest. The court ordered the departments to construct the service road in three different widths within six months. However, four months have elapsed, but land acquisition has not commenced.

“The district administration and NHAI should have published 3D notification for land acquisition by now, but no such development has happened while accidents are recurring on the NH due to lack of service roads,” S Sakthivel, organiser of the federation, said. Though the district administration appointed a special officer for the land acquisition process, residents are unhappy over the poor pace of development.

“Condemning the delay, we have planned to stage a series of protests from March 9,” S Subramanian, chief organiser of the federation, said. Official sources in the district administration said that NHAI is yet to hand over the Land Plan Schedule (LPS) for releasing the 3D notification comprising the extent of land to be acquired. When contacted, a senior official with NHAI Thanjavur project implementation unit (PIU) said, “We are revising the LPS based on the court’s order. LPS will be sent to the district administration by the end of March to initiate land acquisition.”

Local residents spotted the bag with the infant opposite to the shop around 6 am and informed the urban primary health centre (UPHC) in Kattur. A nurse rushed to the spot and took custody of the baby.

On being informed by the UPHC staff over the helpline, I Muralikumar of Sevai Child Line arrived at the spot and shifted the infant to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) on a 108 ambulance. The paediatricians checked the infant’s health condition and estimated it to be one day old. Since the infant was underweight, the doctors admitted it to the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) for a few days. Quoting the doctors, Muralikumar said the baby’s health condition was stable. Child Line lodged a complaint with Thiruverumbur police to trace the person who abandoned the infant and the parents.

AHMEDABAD: While travel to international destinations is expected to curtailed due to the novel coronavirus epidemic, hoteliers in Ahmedabad are also concerned about a decline in occupancy this summer for the same reason.

Industry estimates suggest that after March, occupancy in city hotels is largely driven by corporate clients, from India and abroad.

“Due to the coronavirus epidemic, it is likely that foreign business travellers will defer trips. Corporate and business travellers drive business in the summer, which is typically the lean season. It could thus affect business,” said Sandeepan Bosh, general manager, Radisson Blu Ahmedabad.

Industry sources said that occupancy levels and average daily tariff at hotels in Ahmedabad declines in the summer, i.e. from mid-March onwards.

Hoteliers are pinning their hopes on domestic travellers.

“International travel is expected to be affected by the the coronavirus epidemic. This could lead Indians to travel to domestic destinations and people visiting Gujarat will first travel to Ahmedabad. This may be the saving grace for hotel occupancy in the state,” said Narendra Somani, president, Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association (FHRA), Gujarat.

Shearvarayon forest ranger K Subramanian, who is leading about 30 foresters in this work, said forest fires are a yearly occurrence in the district. “A minor fire can spread quickly in summer due to abundant dry leaves and lead to devastation.”

At present, the foresters are clearing dry leaves near Salem-Yercaud Ghat Road, Yercaud-Kuppanur Ghat Road, Kottached, Vaniyaru and Arankadai reserve forests.

The officer said as many as four forest fire incidents were recorded in the district in the past three weeks. “Last year, a bamboo forest was gutted near Yercaud on Shervarayon Hill,” he recalled.

Bharuch/Vadodara: Tourists visiting the Statue of Unity (SoU) can now get the first hand knowledge of medicinal plants that have been used in Ayurveda since many centuries. A medicinal park ‘Arogya Van’ spread across 17 acres of land was inaugurated at SoU in Kevadia of Narmada district on Monday.

A dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the work on this park began in December 2018 and was completed in a record time of one year by the state forest department.

Pratik Pandya, deputy conservator of social forestry, Narmada, told TOI: “Aarogya Van has been developed with a variety of plantations that exhibit a wide range of medicinal plants and health-related landscapes. The idea behind developing this garden is to raise an awareness about the role played by medicinal plants in the wellness of people. We have also put emphasis on yoga and meditation as it is an integral part of a person’s well-being.”

One of the key highlights of the park will be an Aushadh Manush — a human body made using plants and shrubs. Each human organ represents a medicinal plant that is beneficial for that particular organ. The herbs and plants are meant for six senses of the human body.

The park is also home to garden of colours, alba garden, lutea garden, aroma garden, yoga garden, indoor plants section, digital display, souvenir shop and cafeteria serving Ayurveda-based foods with tribal music being played in the background.

Also, many household plants that are useful in our daily life have been put on display along with explanation of their usage.

GANDHINAGAR: The Congress on Monday sprang a surprise by offering the chief minister’s job to senior BJP leader and deputy CM Nitin Patel if he could engineer a split in the BJP and defect with 15 to 20 MLAs. Speaking at a function at Umiya Dham on Sunday, Patel claimed he was being isolated in the BJP.

Congress MLA Virji Thummar, speaking in the assembly and addressing Nitin Patel, on Monday said, “We heard your statement that you have become lonely in the BJP. You can join the Congress with 15 to 20 MLAs and become chief minister in a Congress government. Ma Uma and Ma Khodal will bless you for this decision.”

The statement caused a stunned silence in the treasury benches, but BJP leaders then stood up and asked the speaker to prevent Thummar from making such statements. Nitin Patel chose not to reply to Thummar’s offer in the assembly. He only said, “This is a personal statement about me. I will decide how, when and from what platform to react.”

State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja vehemently tried to counter the Congress. Chudasama said, “The whole party and government are strongly with Nitin Patel. Congress should stop daydreaming.”

In the evening on Monday, brushing aside the controversy, Nitin Patel said, “Such political comments in the house are normal. Regarding my statement on Sunday, state party chief Jitu Vaghani and Bhupendrasinh Chudasama have clarified that the government and party are with me and I am not alone.”

AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court has acquitted four persons in a 2011 case, in which a 25-year-old from outside the state was lynched by local people on suspicion that he had come to commit theft.

Four persons — Rajendrakumar Jhala, Ramesh Bharwad, Punam Thakor and Mukesh Thakor — were implicated by police on the basis of suspicion because they had gone to Vatva police station with the person, and his body was found one day later.

The police complaint said an unidentified person was found roaming the farms of the accused persons on the night of March 31, 2011. They suspected that he was a thief. He could not speak the local language. He was allegedly beaten, and the police were informed. The four accompanied the unknown person to police station in the PCR van but took him back because they did not want to register a complaint. This was also stated in an entry made at the police station early on the morning of April 1.

After the four left police station, a body was found nearly 2km from the police station packed in a gunny bag. Police arrested the four on charges of murder and destruction of evidence. Police recorded witness statements and obtained postmortem and FSL reports.

The PM reports revealed that the person had been tied with a rope, dragged on the ground and brutally beaten. His identity could not be ascertained. When the cops were questioned in court, they did not support the case. The investigating police inspector and complainant PSI said they could not say whether the four accused had killed the person, but there was no effort made to provide him medical treatment when he was brought to police station injured the previous night.

Police witnesses told the court that they could not say for sure if the same person who was brought to police station the day before his murder.

All independent witnesses and the witnesses to the inquest proceedings turned hostile in this case leading to the acquittal of the four accused.

A team lead by the head of the department of ophthalmology operated out leukocoria (white pupillary reflex) from the retina of the right eye of the baby in a 30-minute surgery.

“Of the 16 paediatric cataract surgeries conducted at our hospital, this was the youngest patient to undergo it.

After removing the white reflex, the baby is being kept under observation for a few days after which it will be discharged,” Dr Parthiban told TOI on Monday after dean Dr K Vanithamani visited the child. Born at the Orathur PHC, the baby had the white pupillary reflex in both the eyes. The parents identified the condition and brought it to the ophthalmology department of MGMGH.

The doctors said parents played a key role in the post-operative follow-up to ensure complete result.

“The surgery is part of the whole programme. The child can be normal but it has to go through continuous procedures at the district early intervention centre (DEIC) for a minimum three years for which we need the cooperation of the parents,” said the doctor.

The follow-up included optical correction in the form of Aphakic Glasses or contact lens or intraocular lens at different stages. Intraocular lens implantation should be done after two years of age. The doctors advised to check the refraction regularly every four months until two years of age and annually after five years.

Being a leading cause of visual deprivation, congenital cataract can damage the developing visual system of a child. Therefore, early diagnosis, management and long-term follow-up are essential, said the doctors while recommending red reflex screening of babies at birth and referring to ophthalmic centres.

While adults can wait for a long time without affecting visual outcome, children with congenital cataract should undergo surgery within a year of birth. On the cause of congenital cataract, Dr Parthiban listed out a few possible reasons such as intake of steroids, overdose of during pregnancy.

A bench comprising presiding member Smita Chandekar and Avinash Prabhune also directed Jaika Insurance Brokrej and district agriculture officer, both having offices in Civil Lines, to jointly pay Rs25,000 towards mental and physical harassment along with the cost of litigation to the widow. All three respondents were warned to comply with the forum’s verdict within a month, else they would have to pay the amount with 12% interest.

Flaying all three respondents for adopting “typical bureaucratic attitude”, the judges observed that the poor widow’s grievance could easily have been redressed if respondents would have fulfilled their responsibilities. “Their apathy defeated the very purpose of the insurance scheme launched by the government to lend helping hand to the families of distressed farmers after deaths of their sole bread earning members,” the judges tersely stated.

According to complainant Fula Bhalavi from Ramtek, her husband Suraj was insured for Rs2 lakh (from December 1, 2016 to November 30, 2017) under ‘Gopinath Munde Farmers Insurance Scheme’ which was launched by the Maharashtra government. On June 24, 2017, when he was standing under a tree in his farm, lightning struck and he died on the spot.

After completion of formalities like police complaint, the widow submitted documents to agriculture officer for claiming Rs2 lakh insurance amount. He forwarded her claim to Jaika and Oriental for clearance. However, it was rejected citing that the requisite documents weren’t submitted. Though she later submitted all papers as demanded, the respondents rejected her claims on March 23, 2018, forcing her to knock forum’s doors.

While noting the recommendations of insurance scheme, the judges pointed out that if family members of the deceased farmers claiming insurance amount were unable to gather the documents, it would be responsibility of joint agriculture director along with district and taluka officers to help them out. The government officials were even warned that they would be held individually liable, if they failed to help out the farm widows, they said.

“The consultant — Jaika Insurance — was entrusted with task of implementing insurance scheme successfully as per the government decision, but it failed to produce any evidence on its work. It failed to act as coordinator as named by the government and thus engaged in deficiency in providing services to the consumers,” the judges said before partially allowing the complaint.

Ahmedabad: Abdul Memon, a plastic store owner in Sabarkantha, celebrated birth of a girl child four years ago. Abdul and his wife have hearing impairment. But they were sure Khadija, the daughter, would turn out just fine. However, neighbours informed the duo that the toddler was not responding to any sound. A year later, the couple got another daughter, Bushra, who had the same impairment.

Recently the sisters, now 4 and 3, along with their cousin Mohammad Ayan, 3, got acoustic implants at Gandhinagar Civil Hospital.

Dr Neeraj Suri, ENT surgeon, who implanted the hearing aid on the kids’ ears, said that when they asked for history of the family, they were surprised to know that on maternal side, Khadija and Bushra’s mother has four siblings.

“Out of five, four - two brothers and two sisters - have hearing impairment and by extension speech impairment. Altaf, maternal uncle of Khadija and Bushra, had no impairment and he had got married to a normal woman. But his son Ayaan has impairment,” she said.

The family claimed that the earlier generation also had impairment. But as those with impairment were married to men or women with the same impairments, nobody actually raised the concern. A year ago, this scenario changed when a relative from Dubai got to know about the entire family communicating in sign languages and motivated Altaf, the only sibling with speech and hearing ability, to take the lead and get the next generation treated.

Dr Suri said that consanguine marriages could be one of the reasons for the impairment. “Even then, the families never got the children screened for genetic profile. We thus took the lead and got them tested. The results showed that the gene GJB2 was not found in affected persons of the family,” she said. “Now the chromosomal study is being done to prevent deafness in future generation. We have advised the family to go for genetic profiling of the prospective bride or groom to prevent hearing loss.”

Follow-up a challenge

For the doctors, however, rehabilitation and follow-up is a challenge. “The children have started hearing sounds and they would soon undergo training for speech as well. As the family is accustomed to the sign language, the children have also picked it up. We have advised the children to stay with the speaking members of the family for some time so that they learn by imitation,” said a member of the treatment team.

On Tuesday, about 400 families with the children with disabilities would gather at Gandhinagar GMERS Hospital auditorium and 50 kids with hearing aid implants would showcase their talents by speeches, singing and music, said hospital authorities.

387,['3/03/2020'],Class XII state board exams begin on easy note,"Trichy: The class XII state board examination began on Monday with a relatively easier Tamil language paper which had more questions related to grammar apart from general awareness. There were roughly 15 questions on grammar out of the total 47.

While the question paper was for 90 marks, S Hema, who appeared for the exam in Trichy, said most of the questions were easy. Question number 45 which dealt with the measures to be taken on reducing the use of plastics needs to be welcomed, said a teacher. Such questions are intended to check how socially aware students are and their approach towards the environment and surroundings, she said. Similarly, question number 46 dealt with road accidents. Another question on actor Sivaji Ganesan and his acting skills was perhaps a different approach from the school education department. With a total of 1,241 absentees, 31,171 students appeared for the board examination in the district.

In all, 32,412 students registered for the board examination this year for class XII. While a total of 124 centres were allocated across the district to write the examination, 2,269 teachers were on examination duty. This includes 199 teachers as scribes, 234 in the static team apart from 45 teachers in the flying squad.

388,['3/03/2020'],CBSE spins off rapper Emiway’s ‘Machaenge’ to beat exam stress,"Nagpur: After creating funny memes to connect with its young audience, CBSE has now expanded its creative boundaries by recording a rap song about beating exam stress.

The rap song is set to the tune and beat of underground rapper Emiway Bantai’s famous song ‘Machaenge’, and is said to be a complete in-house CBSE production. Titled ‘CBSE exam anthem’, the song was released on the board’s social media handle on Monday evening.

Lyrics of the three-minute long song were written by a small team at CBSE, which included even chairperson Anita Karwal, who penned a few stanzas. The song was sung and recorded by students of a Delhi Public School branch at the capital along with their staff members.

The song’s audio was first released on CBSE’s Shiksha Vaani app. CBSE has relied completely on its own schools for harnessing talent required to give shape to their latest venture. No professionals were hired to produce the first ever ‘exam anthem’ in a format which young students are likely to connect more with.

A CBSE official said, “The central board believes in honing talent within its ecosystem and promoting them on all available platforms. Even our videos about counselling videos last year were created by students who had taken up subjects like multimedia etc.”

Chairperson Karwal’s continuous efforts to reach out to the young target audience seems to have gained solid traction from this year once the memes started rolling out. At that time itself, CBSE had stated that they wanted “to speak the language which their students understood”.

For CBSE, the next step in engaging students is a plan to make them equal stakeholders in the memes campaign. CBSE is mulling options to open the memes designing to students as a contest through regional offices. However, given the reach of CBSE, this will have to organized in a very systematic way, else the central board will find itself flooded with millions of memes within a week.

The board will most likely go ahead with a contest format which begins at school-level. The quantity of selected memes will filter down to a very manageable number by the time they progress to national-level. It’s likely that by next academic session, this initiative will take a more concrete shape.

However, there have been allegations from some quarters regarding irregularities in the manner some companies — who were allegedly not ineligible — were allowed to participate in the bidding process.The financial bids for chopper services on three routes — Phata, Sersi and Guptakashi — leading to Kedarnath were invited last week. An official from UCADA, privy to the bidding activity, told TOI, “We got the lowest bid for Phata route. Five firms made bids for the route. On this route, the chopper fare is tentatively expected to be Rs 2,360 (one-way). In Sersi, the fare of chopper service will tentatively be Rs 2,439 (one- way). And on Guptakashi route, the service may cost Rs 4,545 (one- way). However, we are negotiating the fare amount further and final rates will be released after negotiations.”Meanwhile, raising questions on the bidding process, Rajeev Dhar, who runs a helipad at Triyuginarayan near Kedarnath, alleged that a couple of aviation firms, which have police cases against them, were allowed to take part in the tender process.“Few companies, which were blacklisted earlier, took part in the tender process. The chopper of one firm, which bagged the contract, had met an accident last year. But still, that firm was allowed to participate in the tender process in gross violation of DGCA guidelines. Some other firms, which took part in the tender process, did not meet the criteria of pilot training and flying-hour experience,” Dhar alleged, adding that he was “preparing to approach the high court against the manner in which the tender process was carried out.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Dhar, Ashish Bhatgai, additional CEO, UCADA, said, “We have strictly followed all the guidelines and norms of DGCA. The process has been very transparent and all details are available on our website. How can we resort to corruption or favoritism when everything is in public domain?”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chopper-tender-for-char-dham-yatra-proceeds-amidst-allegations-of-irregularities/articleshow/74446919.cms
390,['3/03/2020'],Census reveals drop in birds arriving in delta region,"Trichy: There has been a decline in the number of migratory birds arriving in the delta region this year even though their diversity has remained largely unaffected. This was revealed in the synchronised annual bird census carried out at three sanctuaries in Tiruvarur district and Point Calimere in Nagapattinnam on Friday.

The forest department had roped in Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (BCF) Trichy and ornithologists with an objective to assess the diversity of migratory pattern of aquatic and terrestrial birds in the region. Saying that birds are an indicator of an ecosystem, BCF founder-director A Kumaraguru said birds take a lot of effort and face challenges to reach a place. They ensure that the place they migrate to is rich in nutrients and ecosystem values.

“Drop in the number of birds could be the fallout of the devastating cyclone Gaja that hit the delta region in November 2018,” said Kumaraguru. But it was interesting to note that there was not much decline in terms of the bird species which remained between 115 and 134 in these places, he said. Confirming the decline in the number of birds arriving in the sanctuaries in the delta region, S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forests, Thanjavur circle, said, “About 15,000 birds were recorded in Uthayamarthandapuram bird sanctuary which is 5,000 birds less than last year. Similarly, there is a decline of about 5,000 in Muthupettai lagoon.” Flamingo population has been largely affected in Point Calimere. They appear to be migrating to Rameswaram because of Gaja cyclone last year which has affected the ecosystem in this region.

A Aroon Saayee, student of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) University, was part of last year’s census. Being part of the team carrying out boat survey as part of the census this time, he had a close encounter with birds. Aroon said there could be two reasons for the changing migration pattern.

“There could either be a delay in the migration of birds to this place or they have migrated to some other place,” he said. “It will take at least a year more for the feeding area to recuperate in these regions. Mangrove areas are being desilted so that micro-organism could feed in large numbers which are the primary feed for these birds,” said Ramasubramanian. “We have comprehensive data of the arrival of birds in the last four years. This will help us study the factors hindering their habitat,” he added.

THANJAVUR: A 60-year-old man was hacked to death by a three-member gang after one of them was reprimanded by him for stalking and harassing his daughter-in-law in Sethubavachathiram in Thanjavur district. The man’s wife and daughter also sustained injuries during the incident. The accused have been identified as Ayyadurai, 40, on Pillaiyar Temple street, Serubalakkadu Veeramani and Paduvankollai Periyasamy.

According to the police, the deceased has been identified as Ganesan of Karisavayal village in Sethubavachathiram, a farmer . He is survived by his wife G Pavalakodi, 55, and daughter G Sathya, 33.

393,['3/03/2020'],NU seizes promotion material tagged with student group name,"ABVP members submitted a memorandum to Nagpur University VC SP Kane on issues related to students

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) on Monday seized all banners and identity cards carrying the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar Students Association (BASA) for the promotion of sports and cultural extravangaza ‘Yuva Spandan’ after Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) filed an objection with vice chancellor SP Kane.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad accused the office bearers of BASA of politicizing the event currently under way on the varsity campus off Amravati Road. The event kicked off on February 28 and will go on till March 7.

The BJP’s student wing demanded recovery in case university funds were utilized by BASA. ABVP city president Amit Patle said if his organization’s name had appeared on the event publicity material, the media, students and teachers would have labelled it “saffronisation of university”. “We are not opposed to Babasaheb Ambedkar. Some students are misusing his stature,” Patle said.

Students development director Abhay Mudgal said the posters and identity cards were printed with permission. “It was done by some students associated with BASA. As per normal practice, an organizing committee of students is formed to look after the event arrangements. The committee included students affiliated to BASA. They didn’t show the proofs before sending them to print,” he said.

He said officials were busy with another event, Yuvarang, when the preparation for this event were going on. Mudgal gave clean chit to university officials and committee in charge.

Mudgal said as per the new universities Act, no specific organization can hold students’ activity on the campus. “Someone who coordinated the printing played the mischief. The event is going on smoothly without an hassle,” he said.

The director also informed that the NU is not going to pay for the material. No bill has so far been submitted.

BASA president Bhushan Waghmare said they were a non-political organization and any student organization can come forward to work for success of the event and not to push any agenda. “Since the application was given through BASA, students printed it on the event brochure and other material. ABVP started saying they too were participant and wanted their name. They are most welcome but only as students and not representative of any political group. We had given a letter that though student election was not held, student-centric event must go on. We carried out all awareness and promotion activities of the event,” he said.

394,['3/03/2020'],Sanjay Gupta’s wife denied anticipatory bail by HC,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court refused to grant legal protection from possible arrest to Neelu Gupta, wife of former IAS officer Sanjay Gupta, in connection with a money laundering case.

The Enforcement Directorate registered a complaint against her in 2017 and issued various summons over the past three months. Gupta did not respond to the summons for interrogation and instead moved the HC for anticipatory bail.

One of the charges the ED has levelled against Neelu is that out of the Rs 211.94 crore allegedly siphoned off by Sanjay when he was chairman of Metro-Link Express for Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad (MEGA), Rs 12.62 crore was transferred to a company named Purple Events, in which Neelu was a director. Out of this sum, Rs 10 lakh was transferred to her personal account.

The ED wanted to question Neelu and summoned her repeatedly to explain. Apprehending arrest, she submitted that the agency has attached properties worth Rs 36.12 crore belonging to her and her husband in the name of various companies. The ED has also provisionally attached a flat in Dhananjay Tower in Satellite. She claimed that she was director of Neesa Leisure Ltd between 2002 and 2013.

However, the ED claimed that she was actively involved in money laundering in Purple Events, where she was director and authorized signatory. “Though the applicant resigned from the post of director of the company before credit of proceeds of the crime into the bank accounts of the company, the applicant and her husband were controlling stakeholders, each with more than 40% shareholding of the company,” the ED’s counsel argued.

After hearing the case, Justice Vipul Pancholi said Neelu had not co-operated with the investigation.

396,['3/03/2020'],How 'City of Canals' lost its tag,"Dehradun: A series of canals once criss-crossed the Doon valley. On roads that ran parallel to the waterways, people would go for lazy strolls or slow tonga rides. Dehradun in the 1900s evoked the old- world charm of Venice. But the British-era canals that once meandered their way through the town are now disguised as public streets. When one of the last standing canals in the town went under in 2007, it was as if a lid was put on this part of history.

The seeds for Dehradun’s transformation from a sleepy city of canals to a bustling metropolis were laid when the municipality decided to expand transportation infrastructure to accommodate the burgeoning population and the automobile rush. The roads running through the city were widened and paved and the canals were filled in.

“It wasn't the best way to solve the traffic problem in the city. The city’s natural beauty was sacrificed to develop roads. But the traffic problem has only grown worse,” said Ramesh Narain Saklani, 86, an old-time resident of the city.

Among the prominent canals flowing through Dehradun were Kalapathar, Bijapur, Rajpur, Jakhan, Eastern Canal and Kalanga. Kalanga still survives because it was located on the outskirts of the city and has water gushing through it during monsoons.

Old-timers recall how canals that now lie entombed beneath asphalt were once the mainstay of the city’s social life. Water from the Rajpur canal passing through Paltan Bazaar — now a thickly populated market — was used to fill the pond near Jhanda Mela ground where thousands turned up to see the annual Dussehra festival.

Eastern canal flowing near Old Survey Road was a favourite with celebrated author Ruskin Bond, too, who loved taking long walks alongside the canal, collecting ferns. The Mussoorie-based author told TOI that his aunt once fell into the canal while trying to gather ferns. “ Another person who fell into the canal was writer Nergis Dalal who had to be rescued when she jumped into the canal after her dog,” Bond said.

While the foundation of the canals were laid in the 1650s during the tenure of Rani Karnavati who ruled over Garhwal for about two decades, it was English engineer Col Proby Thomas Cautley who expanded the five canals to cover the entire city in 1850s. Historians believe that the canals in Dehradun provided the learning ground for Cautley to build the Ganga Canal in 1854, hailed as an architectural marvel.

The canals in Dehradun, say historians, were planned with great ingenuity. They had tiny ducts at intervals which helped provide drinking water for horses. Dhobis were allowed to wash clothes at certain points and small flour mills operated beside the waterbodies. No garbage was thrown in the canals as the water was used for drinking. People paid a special tax to use canal water.

According to Doon resident Udit Ghildiyal, much of the credit for the popularity of Dehradun’s basmati rice should be given to the canals that irrigated the water-thirsty paddy fields. Mussoorie-based historian Gopal Bharadwaj adds that Dehradun was among the most fertile territories in the Raj-era due to its irrigation network.

The canals also ensured natural drainage flow. Thus, the city was never waterlogged even during torrential rains. Mahesh Bhandari, president of Doon Residents’ Welfare Association, says that the canals played a key role in regulating temperatures. “There was a time when nobody switched on fans here. Canals kept the city cool. Poor vision and lack of planning has robbed the town of its beauty and heritage,” Bhandari said.

However, irrigation minister Satpal Maharaj, when queried why the canals were covered up, claimed that they had outlived their utility. “Earlier, people lived in huge houses, running into several beeghas and needed canals to irrigate their personal lands. What's the need for them now?” he said.

Maharaj, however, added that if people felt strongly about the need to have canals in Dehradun, the government could look into the possibility of reviving some parts of these canals.

397,['3/03/2020'],"In U-turn, VC says no misappropriation in chai paani scam","Nagpur: In a complete U-turn, Nagpur University administration has now declined any misappropriation in chai paani scam at its academic and other sections.

Even after probe panel under LIT director Raju Mankar confirming the massive embezzlement worth crores, vice chancellor SP Kane told TOI that employees from NU’s academic section submitted corrected bills of lakhs amount spent on tea and coffee, which they earlier failed to a submit before the panel.

The panel was constituted by VC himself after a series of TOI reports exposed how members from the academic section submitted allegedly fake handwritten bills of Rs1.5 lakh on tea and coffee consumption by handful of NU’s board of studies (BOS) members in just three days. Same officials had consumed mineral water of staggering Rs24,000 in the same period.

“Since NU didn’t actually pay the bills from its treasury, it’s not at loss. When the panel quizzed employees on the bills, they failed to submit corrected bills. Now, they have come out with corrected ones. There was a loophole in the entire process which was later corrected that led to clearing of confusion on funds misappropriation,” Kane told TOI.

NU officials made another startling revelation that the employees from the academic section, in cahoots with a boy working with the nearby tea stall owner, used to inflate the bills and submit it to finance and accounts department. “It was a routine practice for them. As no one took objection for all these years, their greed grew and they increased the amount to unbelievable levels, which led the scam coming to fore. After TOI expose, the boy fled to his native place in North India, while the clerk who cleared the bills also went abroad,” they said.

Without naming anyone, the Mankar-led panel had pointed fingers on the entire chain of employees in the academic section from top to bottom of having allegedly involved in the scam. It failed to recommend any strong measures like lodging of police complaint, under apparent pressure from a lobby, which were making all out efforts to save the guilty officials. The panel failed to specify total amount of misappropriated funds and also to fix responsibility on particular officials. It only suggested “legal action” without any specifications, as per officials.

The VC also blamed panel members for failure in coming up with strong recommendations. “I have accepted the panel’s report as it is. Had it suggested any action, I would have acted accordingly,” he said.

Administrative problems in registrar’s interviews: VC

Breaking his long silence on vacant registrar’s post that wasn’t filled up for over 10 months even after two advertisements and spending over Rs5 lakh, vice chancellor SP Kane clarified that there were some “administrative” problems in the process. NU had received about 20 applications for the post. “I am trying my best to conduct the interviews before I demit office next month. After this week’s Senate meeting, I will try my best to fill up the post,” he told TOI.

He added, “City bus service came first and Metro Rail later so there should be no rationalization of city buses.”

TOI, on August 27, 2019, had reported MahaMetro had requested NMC to carry out rationalization of buses on Wardha road. Later, MahaMetro had submitted a detailed plan to NMC requesting to run buses as per its plan on two Metro Rail corridors and also provide feeder service to Metro Rail Stations.

On Monday, Borkar told reporters, “NMC’s city bus service is functioning since long. All routes and stops of buses are as per public demand and after vast experience. Any shuffling of routes will increase cost and cause inconvenience to commuters. I personally feel route rationalization of city buses should not be done. But NMC has to take decision, so I put the ball in the court of mayor Sandip Joshi who will take final decision at an appropriate time.”

Borkar also said NMC was ready to provide feeder service to Metro Rail wherever feasible. “NMC is providing two city buses to run feeder service from Metro Rail Station on Hingna road to colleges situated on Isasani road,” he said.

Borkar said, “NMC is incurring a loss of Rs 6 crore per month on city bus service. I had assumed charge as chairman on December 27 last year. Since then, the revenue has increased by Rs 1.78 crore compared to corresponding months in previous year. This was possible due to systematic increase in fleet and rounds of city buses. I banned use of social media groups by conductors and drivers. Fine of Rs 1.78 lakh was recovered from conductors found without ticket. ID cards of 194 conductors have been locked. Plans are in pipeline to reduce loss and provide better service to commuters,” he said.

Borkar admitted number of passengers in six women-special buses obtained from state government under Tejaswini Scheme was low and need to open some of them for all commuters. “I inquired with other cities like Mumbai and Pune. They too have begun using most such buses for general category, keeping only a few as women-special. I will discuss the issue with Joshi and others and take appropriate decision. Women passengers are facing problems when they want to use city bus service with their husbands or any male member of their family,” he said.

Borkar said tendering for procurement of 40 electric buses was completed and they may join service in coming months.

“Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami should announce that our territorial waters within 13 nautical miles will come under protected agriculture zone when he visits Tiruvarur on March 7 to participate in a felicitation for announcing delta as protected agriculture zone”, he added.

The chief minister should come forward to clarify the issues pertaining to the announced offshore projects. Will these projects be cancelled just as the government scrapped the order on petro investment region in Cuddalore, he asked. He said the Marine Fisheries (Regulation and Management) Bill 2019 would be a curse to the fishing community as their livelihood would be devastated.

The bill would pave the way for corporates to commence floating tourism, mines, oil exploration and natural mariculture beyond 13 nautical miles which comes under the control of the Union government, Kumaravelu said.

“There is already restriction within 13 nautical miles, beyond that fishermen will have to get permission from the Union government for fishing. So the life of fishermen will become miserable”, he added.

At present, all entertainment activities should be wound up by 10am in all cities. The time relaxation will help them to earn a bit more during festive seasons, as fewer people come forward to book drama shows, he said. tnn

KOLKATA: A 72-year-old Selimpur resident, who had lost her husband four days ago, was found dead on her bed on Monday morning. Cops sent her body for post-mortem after their son, who lived in Bangalore, suspected foul play in the back-to-back deaths and accused a domestic help, who lived in their second-floor flat and took care of the elderly couple , of hatching a plot.

The relationship between the son and his parents had allegedly grown distant and the elderly couple reportedly written their flat away to the domestic help in their absence.

Police said the health of Kabita Gupta (72), who had been bedridden for several months, deteriorated after the death of her husband, Sudhin Gupta, on February 28. Ever since, she had stopped eating and on Monday morning, she was found unconscious at her home. “The domestic help, who lives in the same flat with the family, was the first to notice that Kabita was not responding. She called the neighbours and her son, who was staying on the ground floor of the same building during his stay in Kolkata after his father’s death. She was taken to M R Bangur Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival,” said a senior officer of south suburban division.

Following a complaint lodged by the son, police started a case of unnatural death. “Police must probe my parents’ deaths. I believe since both my parents were ill, the help used the opportunity to somehow trick them into writing the property in her name and may have her hand in the sudden deaths of both of them in such a short interval,” the son told TOI, requesting not to name him. TOI tried to speak to the help but she was unavailable for comment.

Police said Kabita’s body bore no external mark of injury but since the son suspected foul play, they sent the body for post-mortem. “No external injury was found on the woman’s body. In fact, she had been bedridden for such a long time that she has developed bedsores. But we have still sent her body for post-mortem to clear any ambiguity, especially since she was found dead and there is an ownership controversy surrounding the ownership of the flat,” said another senior officer.

403,['3/03/2020'],"After 90 yrs, NU to hold senate meet at new building on March 6","Nagpur: For the first time since its inception around 1930s, Nagpur University would be holding its senate meeting on varsity budget at its new administrative block on Amravati Road on March 6.

Moreover, meetings of other statutory bodies like management and academic councils would also be held in the new building, which was inaugurated by chancellor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari in December last year.

All these years, NU used to conduct meetings of its statutory bodies at the historic convocation hall. “We’ve three to four big halls, one on each floor, in the new building for conducting meetings. Already, vice-chancellor SP Kane and pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande have started conducting their meetings with the officials on the new premises,” said varsity officials.

NU officials and employees are, however, complaining that the building lacks sufficient space for offices unlike the old heritage building of British era which was still serving the purpose. According to them, they were not consulted by the planners on their requirements before designing the building. “Even VC, pro-VC and registrar’s chambers are very small. NU is yet to receive permission for its lift,” they pointed out.

Endorsing the view, even management council members opposed conducting senate meeting in the new building stating that NU’s convocation hall has its historic significance. During a recent management council meeting, they had confronted the VC on the issue, but the latter did not heed to their suggestions.

Partially agreeing with the employees’ contention, pro-VC Deshpande said adjustments and modifications can be made only after shifting to the new offices. “There may be problems in the new building, but we can always do the necessary alterations. Currently, we’ve got permission to use first floor only while remaining three floors are yet to be ready for taking over. The officials should first occupy the new offices,” he told TOI.

Refuting the employees’ charges, VC SP Kane said the new building had huge space and once the employees would there they would get adjusted. “I’ve started attending the new office from Monday. I will remain there daily in morning hours and comeback to old building in evening. The management council members requested me to convene the Senate meeting in old building, but I told them that in future, we need to shift there as a spacious hall has been constructed there,” he told TOI.

A management council member told TOI that British era structures had got their own charm and grandeur, which could never be replicated. “The contractor is yet to complete three floors and even lifts are yet to be installed. Therefore, the civic body has not issued occupancy certificate for the remaining floors, even though the building was inaugurated in December last. The building work commenced on September 14, 2016 and December 2018 was set as deadline, but it was delayed by over a year,” he said.

All ABOUT NU’s NEW ADMINISTRATIVE BLOCK

* Work began on Sept 14, 2016 & Dec 12, 2018 deadline set

* Work delayed by over a year as contractor failed to meet deadline

* Additional floor added to G+2 building, cost increased to Rs26.40 crore

* Chancellor inaugurated first floor in December in presence of ex-CM

* Rs10 crore funded by industrialist Rahul Bajaj, rest contributed by NU

* Other three floors yet to be completed, no occupancy certificate till then

Naumova Jarina had come to India on a two-month tourist visa in January last year. Although her visa period ended on March 10, she continued to stay on and came to Madurai last week.

Meanwhile, a police team from the anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) led by inspector Hema Mala conducted a search at the hotel located in West Perumal Maistry based on a tip on Saturday.

Jarina tried to pose as an Indian national during the inquiry. Police found that the Aadhaar copy with her was in the name of Robiya Nishan from East Delhi.

“When we checked the details of the Aadhaar card copy with the government data, it was found to be fake. She had used her photo to superimpose on someone else’s Aadhaar to create a fake one. She did not have the original one,” said a police officer privy to the inquiry.

The police officer added that they did not register a case for overstaying as they need to first check with the officials from the embassy concerned. If the officials already know about her overstaying, she has to be probably considered as a refugee.

But a refugee cannot be allowed to move freely in the country. They could not coordinate with embassy officials since it was Saturday and Sunday. Hence, they preferred to register the case only for creating fake Aadhaar.

A case was registered with the Thideer Nagar police station under IPC sections 468 – forgery for the purpose of cheating - and 471- using as genuine a forged document.

She was produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in Madurai central prison from where she was transferred to Puzhal prison in Chennai, police said.

Apart from government representatives, the roundtable was attended by eminent transplant surgeons, hospital administrators, NGO representatives and academicians.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), had mentioned during the roundtable that the development was in final stage. “After deliberations, it was decided that it would be modelled on National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) website and would be hosted by National Informatics Centre (NIC) to address safety and privacy concerns,” she had mentioned.Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, on Monday said that the system has been launched from March 1. “Primary aim of the initiative is to ensure transparency. If the system is not transparent, it would not instil confidence among relatives of the potential organ donors. Due to privacy issues, the platform will not be open for public but all the stakeholders will have access to it where live updates will be available,” he said.

However, despite these directions, there are several places where animals are being slaughtered,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, the lawyer appearing for the petitioners in the case.The court has now given the DM two weeks to inspect all the sites and file a detailed report by March 16, when the case will be heard next.The PIL has also alleged that around 500 kilo litres of wastewater is being discharged from these slaughterhouses.Gupta said, “Our concern through the PIL is that due to the lack of a legal slaughterhouse in the capital, people are being fed meat and fishes from unhygienic places. We have said that meats should be procured only through slaughterhouses that are hygienic and comply with the guidelines of the FSSAI. These illegal slaughterhouses are not only violating the norms but these units are also contributing to pollution by discharging untreated wastewater. The volume of this wastewater is estimated to be over 500 kilo litres per day.”As reported by TOI earlier, the high court has already prohibited the slaughter of animals in illegal slaughterhouses in the state.

The minister had written to JDA as early as February 20 but the authorities are yet to carry out the orders.

The minister in his letter said that during the flowering season, its pollen is released in the air which causes increased incidents of allergy and asthma cases. This was substantiated by research done by SMS hospital and Asthma Centre run by Dr Virendra Singh, a former SMS superintendent.

He said holoptelea integrifolia trees are in abundance at the Central Park, gardens maintained by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation and horticulture department. He pointed out that tourists and walkers suffer from allergy and asthma due to the pollen of these trees. So, pruning of these trees should be carried out before the flowering season to save the tourists and locals from allergies.

410,['3/03/2020'],West Bengal: Howrah takes green way to beat plastic pollution,"A 300m stretch was laid with plastic on civic body premises

HOWRAH: Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) has followed in the footsteps of Hidco to build Bengal’s second green road. Work on the 300m road, laid with plastic, was completed within the civic body premises on Monday. New Town was the first township in the state to use plastic for developing a stretch.

“We executed the pilot project at a cost of Rs 25 lakh. We will build three more roads in Howrah town this year,” said HMC commissioner Bijin Krishna. Over 1km stretch close to City Centre II in New Town has been laid with plastic. A Hidco official said, “Experts found the condition of the stretch fine. Given the result, four more roads in New Town will be laid with plastic.”

Civil engineer Ram Ratan Chawdhary, who was in charge of the HMC project, said, “We used 10,000tonnes plastic granules and 800tonnes bitumen to build this road. The amount of bitumen is much less than what is required for a conventional road of this length. The most important benefit of a green road is that it will never develop potholes. The construction is also less polluting than usual. The load-bearing capacity of this road is 10 times more than that of a conventional road. This apart, construction cost of a green road is 8% less than usual. A road laid with plastic is more durable and will undergo less wear and tear than a regular tar road.”

According to the commissioner, single-use plastic is a major problem in a town like Howrah. “These can’t be recycled. At best, the recycling process ends with granules. Such plastic is invariably dumped in drains that damages the town’s drainage system. From now on, we will collect single-use plastic and convert them to plastic granules, which will be used for roads.”

In its press release, HMC stated, “Single use plastic items like shopping bags and foam packaging are ideal raw material for green roads. Impossible to recycle, they are a menace... But urban plastic roads are still a rarity in India. Howrah Municipal Corporation is a pioneer and an early adopter of the technology in building plastic roads from waste material. A recent road safety report by WHO found that 17% of world’s traffic fatalities occur in India with crumbling roads partly responsible for the high death toll. Plastic roads will not lead to formation of potholes and, thus, prevent accidents.”

In a pro forma, villagers were asked for their names, places of birth, nationality and religion. People had to mention the villages they last lived in along with descriptions of the places and the period of stay.

“Incidents of family members of patients abusing and assaulting doctors and vandalizing hospital property have become common across India. This is not only demeaning for doctors but it also puts them at a risk of serious injury,” said Dr S Gurushankar, president of TN Chapter of AHPI.

In September 2019, the Supreme Court had directed the central government to respond to a petition filed by AHPI (TN chapter) to make violence against doctors and other medical personnel a separate penal offence.

The petition sought immediate action against those indulging in violence against medical professionals and causing damage to clinical establishments. “The Prevention of Violence Against Medicare Persons and Institutions Acts, which have been notified in 19 states in the past decade, have failed to address the issue of violence against doctors. No one has been convicted till now in India for assaulting a doctor and police are not treating such complaints seriously. This has led to demoralization among doctors, with many refusing to service in rural areas. This can have serious repercussions on patient care,” added Gurushankar.tnn

416,['3/03/2020'],Class XII state board language exams begin on easy note,"Madurai: Amid tight security, as many as 36 ,346 candidates, including private candidates, appeared for Class XII board language exams on Monday. Appearing for the first time under the new syllabus, the general impression among the students was that the papers were standard and rather easy to handle.

The first day of the board exams this year saw students partake in prayers before assembling inside their designated centres to write their exams. Students were also frisked to prevent cheating. The staff meticulously checked even watches and belts worn by students. Some students were also asked to remove them.

In Madurai, out of the 36,346 students who appeared for the exams in 120 exam centres, 35,676 students wrote Tamil, 50 wrote Hindi, 7 wrote Arabic, 469 wrote French and 144 wrote Sanskrit. On the other hand, 1,704 students across the district were absent. Tight police security arrangements were also in place.

Although this was the first time the students were writing for a new syllabus especially without a blueprint, the question papers for all the languages was found to be standard and not tough to handle. “For Tamil, it was clear that the focus was not on rote learning. Instead of memory, the students’ creative ability to write was tested. However, the students were able to handle as they have adequately been trained. Some of the expected questions also appeared,” said a Tamil teacher from a government school.

417,['3/03/2020'],HC asks three civic bodies about space for last rites,"High court of Bombay at Goa

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has called for a reply from the Margao , Mapusa and Ponda municipal councils over inadequate space for crematoriums for Hindus, cemeteries for Christians and kabrastans for Muslims.

The court, which is hearing a public interest petition on the shortage of these facilities, has asked for the responses to be filed by March 5.

There is shortage of 43 crematoriums for Hindus, 50 cemeteries for Christians and 172 kabrastans for Muslims in the state, petitioner Sayed Kadri, a Merces resident, told the court. He has also sought directions to the government to provide land for burial to the Dawood Bohra community too

To resolve the issue of shortage of land for final rites, the government can provide forest land, allot government land, use comunidade land and even acquire land under the Land Acquisition Act 1894, Kadri submitted to the high court.

The petitioner is seeking separate crematoriums for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes who face discrimination while performing last rites as well as a solution to the pending matter of kabrastans for Muslims in Margao, Mapusa and Ponda.

In his petition, Kadri stated that he was compelled to move the high court as the government failed to provide land for final rites, despite him writing to the human rights commission, chief secretary, Goa governor, panchayats minister, minority affairs minister, National Commission for Minorities and MLAs among others.

The high court granted him permission to appear in person. Stating that it is the prime duty of the state government to provide space dor final rites, Kadri in his petition stated that if Goa fails to make provisions, the state will face problems in the future.

418,['3/03/2020'],Kolkata: Cyclonic circulation likely to bring rain from tomorrow,"The circulation is set to cause showers across south and north Bengal

KOLKATA: The city is set to receive rain between Wednesday and Friday under the impact of a cyclonic circulation . The circulation is set to cause showers across south and north Bengal, though they are unlikely to be heavy, according to Met office. Temperature could slide after the showers but the mercury drop is unlikely to persist for long.

Kolkata on Monday recorded a maximum temperature of 30.6 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 19.9 degrees Celsius.

“We expect Kolkata and south Bengal to remain largely dry till Tuesday. The western districts of the state, along with East and West Midnapore and Birbhum, may receive light rain, though. Thereafter, south Bengal could be lashed by rain. A cyclonic circulation has formed along the Bengal-Bangladesh border. It is being fed with moisture by a high-pressure zone above the Bay of Bengal,” said deputy director-general of meteorology Sanjib Bandyopadhyay.

Major parts of south and north Bengal are likely to face an impact of the circulation. The showers are, however, predicted to be light to moderate across most districts, including Kolkata. The rain could continue till late Wednesday afternoon, predicted the Met office. But the showers will never be intense like the ones that struck the city last month.

“Unless we have a very intense system, heavy showers are unlikely at this time of the year. Circulations may result in consistent drizzles, though. We have had two such circulations in February and this one is similar,” said a weather scientist.

On February 18, a cyclonic circulation had led to a cloud cover and intermittent drizzles that had brought the mercury down by five degrees. Maximum temperature plunged to 22.6 degrees Celsius, eight notches below normal.

JAIPUR: Prakash Vyas cannot stop thanking his stars as he had a narrow escape in the cylinder blast accident in the Walled City area on Monday. Vyas lost his sister-in-law in the blast, but he was saved when the door of his room broke and fell on him due to the explosion. He escaped with minor injuries. He was the first person to complain about the gas odour in the morning. The cylinder had been leaking probably the whole night.

“When I woke up in the morning I went near the kitchen and could smell the gas, I started feeling nauseous. I told my sister-in-law about the odour following which I went to the bathroom to wash my face when I suddenly heard a loud explosion. As I rushed out, the door of my room fell on me,” said Vyas.

Vyas somehow managed to get out from under the door and went out only to see that a part of the house had caved in. “The explosion occurred on the ground when my sister-in-law went to the kitchen and probably switched on the light. I was saved as my room is a bit far and luckily escaped death,” he said.

According to Vyas, as the house has been damaged, the family now does not have enough space to sleep at night. He added that the state government should help them in this tragic situation. Talking to TOI, he said, “Till now no government official has visited us. My brother has a private job and has to take care of his three children. We do not know if that portion of the house can be repaired or not as the damage is extensive and the adjacent buildings have also developed cracks. Keeping the situation in mind, we are hoping that the state government can help us financially.”

Indore is witnessing many initiatives- from attempt to get included Rangpanchami Gair in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) representative list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity to cow dung logs replacing wood for Holika Dahan.

Indoreans can celebrate victory of good over evil in an eco-friendly way on eve of Holi by using cow dung logs. Indore administration is roping in cow shed owners to make and sell cow dung logs that can be used in place of wood. The administration in coordination with the Regional Pollution Control Board is in talks with cow shed owners to prepare sufficient quantity of logs from cow dung for Holika Dahan.

“Indore has always set examples for others to follow. We have appealed citizens to discourage use of wood for Holika Dahan. Alternatievly, use of cow dung logs in bonfires will be promoted. We are tying up with private gaushalas/ entrepreneurs to ensure a functional supply chain,”said collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav.

Many trees are cut for Holi bonfires causing a host of problems. In Indore, bonfires are lit at around 3,000 places on the eve and a single bonfire requires a minimum of 100 kg wood, as per the board.

Chief chemist and lab head at regional pollution control board Dr DK Wagela said, “Efforts are being made to make sufficient amount of cow dung logs available in the market to discourage use of wood in Holi bonfires. This time, cow shed owners are being roped so that logs can be made available easily, otherwise in absence of supply, people go for wood despite knowing the harmful side of felling trees and burning wood.”

Officials said, many cow shed owners are ready to supply cow dung logs for the occasion and this would be a win-win situation for them as well as people lighting bonfires.

The board has also come out with an advisory for public urging use of eco-friendly measures in Holi.

Wagela said, “Certain market areas are being selected where cow dung logs can be sold and bought easily. We hope that easy availability of cow dung logs will encourage people to use them more.”

The administration is also promoting cow dung logs at crematoriums and plans to market products made of cow urine/dung to help cattle owners earn better remuneration.

426,['3/03/2020'],Kozhikode: Vehicles with altered number plates to face the music soon,"Vehicles with altered number plates to face the music soon

Kozhikode: The attempt by many national permit vehicles and other trucks to partially or fully cover the number plates has become cause for concern among law enforcers. Many trucks cover the number plates by affixing an iron rod at the rear of the vehicle.

The heavy vehicles which carry out service mostly during the night also cover the number plates with mudguards and decorative festoons.

This is to escape unidentified if the vehicle gets involved in road accidents.

According to police, heavy vehicles, especially from other states, cover the number plate on the rear and this would make it difficult for the victims or the witnesses to identify the vehicle.

Many vehicles in minor and major road accidents during the night hours escape without taking the injured to hospital or reporting the incident to the police, said a city police officer.

We have decided to initiate action against all those who try to hide the number plate, he added.

Rash driving by truck drivers during the night and use of bright lights pose a danger to other motorists. The police are also planning action against vehicles using modified number plates. The police have also decided to check the use of more than one number plate by vehicles involved in criminal activities like smuggling of unaccounted money, drugs and gold.

The use of forged number plate is common in areas hit by political violence. Many criminal gangs, including ones engaged in hurling bombs and murder attempts have reportedly started using two-wheeler vehicles with altered or no number plates while committing the crime.

The trend is more prevalent in Vadakara, Nadapuram, Koduvally, Thamarassery and Koyilandy areas where a number of attacks on people, vehicles, houses, and smuggling of unaccounted money, drug and sand are reported.

Though police have long been noticing criminals covering the number plates while committing crime, they feel that the use of fake number plates and use of dual number plates was something new in rural areas.

There is prescribed size for the number plate and the numbers should be clearly visible during day and night, said the police official. We are planning strict action against all those who fail to comply with the guidelines for number plates, he said.

427,['3/03/2020'],"Goa: With no head, women’s panel non-functional for four months","Despite women visiting to seek help, the commission’s office at Junta House, Panaji, wears a deserted look

PANAJI: Women in distress have been desperately calling up and visiting the Women’s Commission which has been non-functional since November.

The headless commission hasn’t been holding hearings for at least four months after its last chairperson Purti Patkar resigned. The government hasn’t appointed a new chairperson yet.

One of the complainants who alleged abuse and an extra-marital affair by her husband states that her in-laws have taken away her gold as well as one of her children and she anxiously wants to know when the chairperson will be joining.

“I’ve not seen my child for a year. I’m afraid my husband will take the child abroad with the rest of his family,” she says, pleading with the commission to at least make a call to her husband to instill some fear in him.

TOI, on visiting the commission’s office at Junta House, Panaji, was witness to the empty chairs and hearings not taking place, despite women visiting to seek help.

When minister for women and children development Vishwajit Rane was contacted, he told TOI that he is aware about the women approaching the commission with various problems. “I need to find the right candidate. Give me 10 days,” he said.

A legal aid volunteer was seen doing her best to assist in some of the cases but the counselor was absent and no hearings were scheduled.

Other complaints pending with the commission include cases of domestic violence, harassment by in-laws including forcibly taking away income and gold, dowry harassment, lack of financial support by husband to maintain children and mental harassment.

After its last chairperson Shubhalaxmi Naik resigned, the government dissolved the commission and constituted the commission with Purti Patkar who was the head of operation of GVK EMRI, as its chairperson.

Members under Shubhalaxmi such as Neena Naik, Dolla Rodrigues, Vavita Raikar, Sonia Asnodkar, Eslinda D’souza, Samira Cardoso and Jennifer Monserrate who hadn’t completed their term were replaced with MLA Alina Saldanha, Shaila D’Souza, Lawanya Shetye, Ketki Gadekar, Dr Pritha Mallya, Dr Sheela Gupte, Kishore Mandrekar.

Patkar later tendered her resignation but this wasn’t accepted by the government. Complaints were made over the chairperson’s post being given to a non-Goan. She was later promoted as OSD to the minister following which the post was left vacant.

Bailancho Saad convener Sabina Martins said the commission is an important statutory body that women activists fought to establish.

“We first fought for the law to set up the commission and then for an office. We worked hard and made it work despite lack of an office, infrastructure, budget and a vehicle,” Martins says.

Although a recommendatory body, the commission can advise the government on policies and has the power to summon parties. “When the public sees that action is taken on complaints, there is some restraint. If there’s no action, the acts of domestic violence and harassment proliferate,” she says.

But the Supreme Court said Karnataka can start construction only after getting permission from the central government and preparation of a detailed project report (DPR).Chief minister Pramod Sawant tried to put up a brave front and said the Supreme Court has said that Goa’s apprehensions “based on newspaper reports that Karnataka will carry out work does not survive and so application of the Goa government is not required”.He also said the Supreme Court has “clarified” that the tribunal ’s interim order of April 17, 2014, that no work can be started by Karnataka without getting all the permissions from the central government and preparing a DPR, continues to be in operation.The Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal’s interim order on April 17, 2014, stated that Karnataka cannot start work without a revised DPR which has to be approved by the Union government or the Mhadei Water Management Authority.However, Karnataka has already got the Centre’s nod after Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar in a letter on December 24, clarified that Karnataka doesn’t need any environment clearance and it requires only the wildlife and forest permissions for the Kalasa-Bhandura drinking water project.After Goa did not object to Karnataka’s plea to notify the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal award delivered on August 14, 2018, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to notify it.But the apex court also said its final verdict would depend on the outcome of the petitions filed by the three riparian states—Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra—the hearing of which has been fixed for July 15, 16 and 22.Goa had then approached the Supreme Court seeking an interim stay against any construction by Karnataka, which was rejected on Monday. But Sawant tried to downplay the Supreme Court’s rejection of Goa’s plea and said “the interest of the people of Goa and Mhadei is protected”.“We will, therefore, have to wait for the final verdict of the Supreme Court in August 2020 and for the decision of the Mhadei tribunal in the application for clarification/modification. In case Karnataka attempts to carry out illegal construction or diversion of water, the government of Goa will file a contempt petition before the Supreme Court,” Sawant said.Karnataka has always maintained that once the award is notified, it can take up construction of the Kalasa-Bhandura drinking water project without hurdles.In August 14, 2018, the three-decade-old dispute between the three states over sharing of the Mhadei waters ended with the tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5tmc, and allotted it only 13.4tmc ft, including 3.9tmc for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5tmc.Of 3.9tmc, the tribunal allowed the diversion of 1.7tmc ft at Kalasa, where Karnataka has completed canal work and 2.2 tmc at Bhandura where no work has started yet, a water resources department officer said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74451738,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-131666,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-rejects-goas-plea-to-stop-ktakas-mhadei-work/articleshow/74448784.cms
429,['3/03/2020'],Muslim girl’s heart gives ‘new life’ to a Hindu boy,"Artistes perform in play ‘Rudhiram’ in 59th Maharashtra Rajya Hindi Natya Spardha on Sunday

Nagpur: Rudhiram, a Hindi play, is an emotionally-gripping story of a Muslim girl and a Hindu boy. After sheltering the girl from goons, the boy, despite having a hole in his heart, donates his blood (a rare group) for her surgery which sadly results in her death. Touched by the boy’s loving gesture, the girl, in her death wish, gives her heart to the boy, who gets a new life.

The play, which transcends man-made religious barriers and brings to the fore human qualities like love and selfless sacrifice, was emotionally-gripping.

Raghav (Chandrakant Shinde) is the only child of Suman (Shraddha Potekar) and Sameer (Sameer Pant). Born with a hole in his heart, Raghav is wrapped with his parents’ love and care 24X7.

The medical disorder makes Raghav frustrated, all the more because he is confined to the four walls of his house.

The lives of the trio takes a dramatic turn when Sakina (Sharvari Thakre), a Muslim girl, enters their house pleading for help from harassment by goons of the area.

After being made to feel safe and secure by Raghav and his parents, Sakina informs her father and brothers and asks them to come and take her home. On reaching Raghav’s house, Suleman (Chandrashekhar Barne) misunderstands the situation. Assuming that his daughter was being harassed, Suleman orders his sons to cut off Raghav’s hands.

Sakina averts a tragedy by intervening and telling her father that Raghav and his parents came to her rescue and not the other way round.

On realizing the blunder that he was about to commit, Suleman profusely apologizes to Raghav.

Meanwhile, in their desperate search for Sakina, the goons create a situation of fear in the area locality. As they head towards Raghav’s house, Sakina faints. She is rushed to hospital where the doctor detects a tumour. Sakina urgently needs blood, but there is a major hurdle — her group is rare (AB ‘ve’) and not available in blood banks.

Raghav, who’s blood group matches Sakina’s, donates blood at the cost of worsening his own condition.

Shockingly, Sakina’s operation is unsuccessful and she is declared brain-dead. Amid a flood of tears, Suleman regains his composure and announces Sakina’s last wish — if her operation is unsuccessful then her heart should be given to Raghav who needs it.

Raghav getting a new life because of Sakina’s selfless heart was the defining moment of the play. Organized by Ambapet Club, Amravati, and staged at the Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar, the dramatic end of the play left many in the audience emotional and teary.

The moving play was written and directed by Chandrakant Shinde.

Alappuzha: With the opening of a new restaurant serving meals at Rs 25 at Mannancherry by the state government, Alappuzha now has more than five hotels (including one serving free food four times daily) in and around town serving food between Rs 20 and 25.

It was in 2018 March, ‘Snehajalakam’ Pain and Palliative Care Unit of CPM started a hotel named ‘Janakeeya Bhakshana Sala’ at Pathirapally in Alappuzha for serving food free of cost. This hotel doesn’t have a cash counter and only has a small cash box. The people, eat from here can donate money, if they wish to.

Vinod G Krishna, an active member of Snehajalakam said that this hotel serves breakfast, lunch, tea and snacks and supper daily. “At least 900 people eat from this hotel daily. “While 450 people directly eat from the hotel, it also serves food daily to at least 450 bedridden patients in their homes,” Vinod said.

The hotel run by P Krishna Pillai Memorial Trust at Deshabhimani Junction near Kanjikuzhi serves lunch daily for Rs 25. “The trust serves Elayil Onnu (Meals on Banana Leaf) for Rs 25. It also serves free food to the bedridden patients at their doors. The trust started functioning around two and a half years ago,” said K V Ratheesh, chairman of the trust.

People will get mid-day meals at Rs 20 from ‘Subiksha’ restaurant of the Food and Civil Supplies Department in Alappuzha municipality. Public works minister G Sudhakaran inaugurated the restaurant in August 2019 that meant to provide meals at a reasonable rate near Power House bridge. The restaurant functions at the ground floor of Alappuzha municipality’s night shelter complex. The project was kicked off as part of the state government’s Hunger-free Kerala project. This restaurant is being run by a Kudumbashree unit.

JAIPUR: Fifty-year-old Govind Narayan Sharma recalled his wife’s last cries for help as she lay buried under house debris. Husband of 47-year-old Manju Devi, Sharma and his three children had a miraculous escape in the tragic incident in which Manju died. While one portion of the house was completely damaged, the room in which they were sleeping remained untouched. Sharma told TOI that his wife was in the puja room when the blast occurred around 6.30am.

“I could hear her cries for help for a few minutes after getting buried under the debris,” said Sharma, while waiting for his wife’s body outside the post-mortem centre of Sawai Man Singh Hospital.

Manju Devi woke up early as per her daily routine. “She was awake. She came to the room in which we all sleep together along with our three children and asked my elder daughter to get up and study for exams,” a teary-eyed Sharma told TOI.

He said that when she went to the prayer room, there was a loud sound. “We rushed outside the room and found that one portion of the three-storey house has collapsed under which his wife was trapped. We tried to save her but as a big slab of roof covered her, all our efforts went in vain. I was just a mere spectator, until the rescue teams came and took out my wife in five hours,” he said.

Sharma is an employee at an Ayurveda hospital in the Walled City area.

Jaipur: Forty three-year-old Rajesh Sharma, who sustained 50% burn injuries in LPG cylinder blast , is battling for life. Rajesh’s 16-year-old nephew Abhishek Sharma died in the blast. They came to Jaipur after incurring losses in their milk business in Didwana.

The family came to Jaipur one month ago from Didwana of Nagaur district in search of a job to start their life afresh. It came as a relief for them as one of their known persons gave them accommodation in first floor of a three-storey building in the Walled City.

Rajesh got a job of a guard at a private firm in Chandpole area. But, he soon became jobless when the firm owner directed him to shift to guard his Malviya Nagar firm. “Since Malviya Nagar is quite far from his Chaura Rasta residence, he quit the job. He was living a life of penury. His employer did not pay his one-month salary,” said Manoj Kumar Sharma, brother of Rajesh, who has a publishing firm.

“He even did not have money for buying wheat flour. Rajesh called me yesterday asking me to get a wheat flour packet. I gave him money few days ago,” he said.

Manoj said that his nephew who was living with Rajesh had also come to Jaipur for work, but he died in the cylinder blast.

436,['3/03/2020'],CCP to consider extending pay-parking to 6 new zones,"Panaji: Satisfied with the functioning of the pay-parking system in the state capital, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) on Monday decided to initiate phase II by extending the pay-parking system to six new locations.

These may include M G Road, Dr Jack Sequeira Road from Gasper Dias to Science Centre (both sides) and EDC Patto Plaza, which the North Goa collector will have to notify as pay-parking zones.

The decision was taken at CCP’s ordinary council meeting, which was chaired by mayor Uday Madkaikar.

The roads where CCP can directly start pay-parking are T B Cunha Road from the church square junction, CCP building to Cafe Real, Azad Maidan, Menezes Braganza Road, Antao de Noronha Road, General Bernardo Guedes Road, Govenador Pestana Road and Caetano Albuquerque Road. These were notified as pay-parking zones in August 2014.

“After the last experience, where the contractor could not collect the funds, we decided to extend pay-parking in a phased manner. We have already taken a huge security deposit from the contractor and even taken post-dated cheques,” Madkaikar said.

Currently, pay-parking for two and four-wheelers is implemented in nine places in the capital.

The council also discussed the move to take over EDC’s Patto Plaza complex for maintenance of services such as sanitation, drainage, roads and pay-parking. The councillors, however, could not arrive at consensus on the issue.

“EDC has held two meetings with us, with our commissioner and our officers and, in principle, we have decided to take it over,” Madkaikar said.

He also said the city corporation will meet with relevant government departments to discuss preparations for Shigmo.

“We want to conduct the Shigmo parade on the old route, 18th June Road,” Madkaikar said.

The proposal will now be placed before the government infrastructure sub-committee for final approval.Once the flyover comes up, motorists will be able to drive to and from New Town to EM Bypass in less than 10 minutes. If the authorities get all the necessary administrative, environment and financial clearances, work is expected to start by the end of this year.According to KMDA sources, the proposed flyover will take off from Captain Bheri on EM Bypass, take a right turn from Chingrighata crossing, move parallel to the Metro alignment on Salt Lake Bypass along its right side till Nicco Park intersection. From here, the flyover will turn right and enter Sector V. It will move straight towards the SDF Building intersection and will then cross the Sector V Ring Road and enter Mahisbathan before finally entering New Town. The flyover will have entry and exit ramps close the Sector V Metro station.As per preliminary estimate, the cost to set up the entire flyover along with its ramps has been tentatively pegged at around Rs 800 crore.Earlier, a 500-metre flyover was planned in Sector V to decongest the busy College More crossing but the plan did not materialise as it was later found that it would not serve the purpose.KMDA officials said the alignment of the proposed flyover from EM Bypass to New Town has been made in such a way that it does not affect any waterbody. “The flyover alignment has been shown to move parallel to Nalban bheri but the waterbody is not being touched. There is a waterbody behind Sector V before the flyover enters New Town Action Area I area. However, there is a road in between the waterbody and the alignment has been proposed to move over the road area,” said an official.“The proposed alignment has been chalked up taking into consideration the best possible options so that no waterbody gets affected. However, the necessary environment impact assessment will be done,” the official said.The proposal to have a flyover from EM Bypass to New Town was mooted long time back to decongest the busy Chingrighata crossing and Salt Lake Bypass. The earlier proposal was to set up the flyover over the wetland but the plan was scrapped and the authorities came up with a few alternatives before zeroing in on the present alignment proposal, avoiding the wetlands.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74451460,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117534,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-bypass-flyover-plan-ready-awaits-nod/articleshow/74448838.cms

“With a warming ocean and increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the oceans’ chemistry is changing,” the geologist , who is presently collaborating with the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research, said.

An acidic ocean is bad news especially for creatures like clams and oysters, whose body structures are made of calcium carbonate.

“Many of the species that populate the ocean are now being impacted by the change in the chemistry of the oceans’ waters. Creatures that have a calcareous shell are less strong and are becoming more vulnerable,” Scott said.

He further said that this phenomenon will also affect the marine food chain . “All those species are interconnected through the food web. So, if the phytoplankton is being affected, the creatures that eat that and others that eat those creatures will be impacted,” he added.

While scientists around the world understand the importance of these changes, Scott said many don’t yet understand the magnitude. For this, sustainable solutions must be put into place.

“We must bring in an interpretation of what it might look like for the fish stock and how we can anticipate these changes because all of these come back to the sustainability of the oceans,” he said.

439,['3/03/2020'],Kolkata: TBM enters cave-in zone after six months,"The TBMs will be pulled out through a shaft in this area

KOLKATA: Engineers and workers engaged to burrow the East-West tunnels below Bowbazar and the residents of the area spent a restless Monday. They kept their fingers crossed ahead of TBM Urvi’s entry into the cave-in zone that had suffered subsidence when TBM Chundee had punctured an aquifer on August 31 last year.

Throughout the day, Leonard John Endicott, the Hong Kong-based geotechnical expert who is also the chairman of the expert committee mandated by Calcutta high court to supervise the rest of the East-West Metro tunnelling, checked and rechecked all the safety parameters. Nobody wants the August-31 script rewritten.

While implementing agency Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) is leaving no stone unturned to ensure safety, residents are going through fear psychosis. Ranju Laha is among the 12 evacuated on Sunday, ahead of this crucial phase of tunnelling. “I hope there’s no repeat of the August accident and my house is in one piece,” the 64-year-old resident of 1B Gour De Lane said. The cave-in zone amid the serpentine lanes off Bowbazar starts here and covers Shyakrapara Lane and Durga Pituri Lane, below which Chundee is now lying defunct. Around 700 residents were displaced as their buildings either fell or were damaged.

Out of 4.9km of the twin tunnels, 1.8km was left when the disaster took place in August. Urvi, on Calcutta high court’s order, resumed digging from the Nirmal Chandra Street-Chaintan Sen Lane crossing on February 18. The gigantic borer is moving slowly; it has barely covered 110m so far.

The Metro tunnels turn towards BB Ganguly Street from Nirmal Chandra Street in a steep curve. Urvi is currently on this 400m radius bend starting at the narrow Chaitan Sen Lane. This curve, however, is not as sharp as the other one that the giant borers negotiated below S N Banerjee Road to turn to Nirmal Chandra Street in June last year. The TBM had hit a water pocket after covering 200m of its second curve.

Around 150 old and dilapidated buildings fall on the curve, along the TBM’s influence zone (25m on either side of the tunnel paths). So far, KMRC and ITD ITD-Cementation, contracted to build the twin Esplanade-Sealdah tunnels, have listed 40 unstable buildings for evacuation. Urvi has apparently passed through five of them. Around 75 % of the 150 structures falling on the TBM’s influence zone have been propped up with iron beams, especially after some households claimed that Urvi’s second stint has left fresh cracks in their walls.

The experts are confident that water ingress is most unlikely this time around. “A four-pronged safeguard approach has been taken to arrest water inflow within an hour,” Endicott had told TOI recently. For instance, the TBM is now protected with additional grease supply lines that have been filled with Condat (world- standard greasing). Then there are the German-make Bullflex seals, customized especially for this project where the TBM digs through non-plastic and extremely porous soil. The seal of Urvi’s tail skin brush has been refurbished. Also, additional grout holes and steel plates are now in place to fill the gap between the machine and the rings.

Since the department hardly has any control over these private vehicles, enforcing regulations on these vehicles is next to impossible. So, as the first step, the state is likely to impose a ban on ferrying students in private vehicles and ensure that all pool cars and schoolbuses are strictly commercial.During the assessment, it was also found that return on investment against a compliant school vehicle remained very poor because of restrictions. “The regulation does not mean restrictions. While we will be regulating, we have to do away with restrictions to make their operations profitable,” said a transport department officer.Soon, the pool cars will be granted all-Bengal permit so that these vehicles can also work as normal contract carriage to ferry tourists, office-goers and outstation passengers. These flexibilities will allow vehicles to earn extra and thus prompt operators to comply with regulations, said an official. Currently, a school pool car with commercial registration number plate can ferry only students.The task force set up by the government will shortly meet all stakeholders to know the practical issues plaguing the sector. The force will meet pool car operators, parents, school authority and students as well to know the impediments against the regulatory measures. “We want to gauge the mood, perceptions and ground realities. We will ask parents what were forcing them to compromise with the safety of their wards.”During recent raids, police found several ramshackle vehicles ferrying students. “We impounded one such vehicle, but students were left with no alternative ti travel to school the next day,” said a traffic sergeant of south traffic guard. “We tried to reason with parents, who insisted on the release of vehicles.

The illegal business is mushrooming in the Walled City areas like Indira Bazaar, Chandpole Bazaar, Ramganj and in outer Jaipur including Jhotwara, Murlipura and others. Despite the fact that petroleum companies and district supplies have powers to confiscate under sections of Essential Commodities Act, still the action against them is negligible.

TOI scribe on Monday visited various markets in the city as a customer and found that various shops situated at Indira Bazar, Chandpole, Ramganj and others were selling these 4kg to 5kg cylinders illegally.

These are sold at Rs 600 to Rs 700 per cylinder and the cost is inclusive of the price of 4kg LPG gas. However, for its refill these traders are charging Rs 100 per cylinder.

“You can get it in Rs 600 to Rs 700 which includes one 5kg LPG cylinder having 4kg of LPG and a regulator (its regulator is smaller than the regular size regulator),” said a trader, who is also involved in selling kitchen items including ‘chulah’, burners, pressure cookers and other items, on condition of anonymity.

Without any fear these LPG cylinders are kept in the shops having no fire fighting devices. A few of the shops were situated almost 500 meters away from the shop where a firecracker shop had witnessed major fire almost a fortnight back.

At least six shops selling these LPG cylinders were found at Indira Bazaar.

When asked if these cylinders are refilled at the shops itself, a trader said, “No, we get them filled by other people who have the 14.6 kg full LPG cylinder and apparatus used to re-fill the smaller LPG cylinders,” the trader added.

The district food and civil supplies department is keeping a blind eye on the development as they maintained that they act on complaints reaching them. “We have confiscated LPG cylinders in 13 different cases between January and February so far under Section 6 A of The Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Under this section the dealers also have powers to confiscate, still they don’t do much in this regard,” said Kanishk Saini, district supplies officer.

INDORE: Chief minister Kamal Nath distributed agri loan waiver certificates to farmers under the third phase of Jai Kisan Rin Mafi Yojana in Agar Malwa district on Monday, and said that the farm sector has seen a sea change in the last 14 months.

“The crop loan waiver scheme has increased the purchasing power of farmers. The agricultural sector increases economic activity,” CM Nath said. Over 21 lakh farmers benefited from the scheme in the first phase, and loans worth Rs 135 crore of 9,448 farmers have been waived under the third phase in Agar Malwa district, he added.

“The state government is moving in the direction of bringing about a new revolution in the agriculture sector,” he said after distributing the certificates.

The youth are the priority of his government, Nath said, adding that it has been successful in bringing in jobs by attracting fresh investments. The expectations of the youth are different from those of the elders, the CM pointed out. “They want to work. We will strengthen the hands of the youth. Unemployment of youth will be removed by increasing economic activities in the state,” Nath promised.

The CM announced plans to start a horticulture centre in Agar Malwa area and laid foundation stone of development works to the tune of Rs 686 crore, including Rs 604 crore water supply projects for rural areas. Agar Malwa is the only district in Madhya Pradesh to get such a high amount of sanction for water supply projects, official sources said.

Nath paid tribute to those killed in the recent New Delhi riots. “It is sad that riots took place in the national capital. Our culture is inclusive, not divisive. The world sees us as people from diverse backgrounds standing under one flag,” he said.

MP held for black-flag protest

Indore: BJP MP from Dewas, Mahendra Singh Solanki , was detained briefly on Monday for showing black flags to the chief minister at a farm loan waiver programme in Agar-Malwa. The MP was invited to the event but walked out in a huff, apparently because he was denied a chance to speak. Solanki left the stage soon after CM Kamal Nath began his speech. He joined BJP workers in showing black flags to the CM, and accused Congress of trying to mislead people ahead of assembly bypolls Agar-Malwa constituency. Additional SP Pradeep Patel said the MP was arrested under Section 151 of CrPC and later released on bail.

443,['3/03/2020'],Courts not equipped to prevent riots: CJI S A Bobde,"CJI S A Bobde

NEW DELHI: The courts are ill-equipped to handle riot situations and take action against those who incite and provoke riots, a function that rests with police and law-enforcing agencies, Chief Justice of India S A Bobde said on Monday.

“The way the events happen and unfold, who incites, who provokes, the courts are not equipped to handle such situations. In general, the courts come into the picture after the incident has happened. We want peace but are not well-equipped to prevent such incidents,” a bench of CJI Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said.

The remarks came when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves sought urgent hearing on a petition by 10 Muslim riot victims seeking registration of FIRs against BJP’s Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Verma and Aditya Verma and their arrest. “If the leaders instigating the mobs to commit ghastly crimes have FIRs registered against them and are arrested and kept in jail, this would have an immediate and salutary effect on the situation. If not done, the violence can possibly exacerbate to a full-blown national law and order situation,” the petition said.

Gonsalves said people were being killed daily and the court needed to intervene urgently and set up a special investigation team (SIT) comprising police officers from outside Delhi to probe the riots. When CJI Bobde said “we are aware of the limitations of our power”, Gonsalves said the courts could surely step in to prevent deterioration of the situation by issuing suitable directions for security to the sit-in anti-citizenship law protesters, especially women and children.

Aurangabad-based Shaikh Mujtaba Farooq led the other petitioners from Shiv Vihar and Bhagirathi Vihar in alleging that the ‘desh ke gaddaron ko’ slogan and hate speeches by the four BJP functionaries, in addition to provocative speeches by right-wing members Tarun Chugh, Tajinder Pal Bagga, Vishnu Gupta, Ajay Bisht (Yogi Adityanath, CM of UP), Somasekhara Reddy and Tejasvi Surya incited mobs to indulge in rioting, arson and murder.

Commenting on Intelligence Bureau officer Ankit Sharma’s murder, the petitioners narrated how a mob arrived at Chand Bagh puliya and started throwing stones at the minority community. “This is the same place where the body of IB officer Ankit Sharma was found. At this stage, the police turned up and on the basis of an understanding with communal groups, began an indiscriminate assault mainly on the local minority community who were merely standing and watching the developments,” the petition said.

Seeking exemplary compensation to those killed and injured, they demanded a complete list of detained persons and access to them by family members and lawyers.

Meanwhile, another PIL by Yogita Bhayana through advocate Utsav Bains sought preservation of all CCTV footage and call data records in the riot-hit areas and setting up of a SIT to probe the riot cases, Sharma’s murder, destruction of a BSF jawan’s house and fixing of accountability on Delhi Police officers for failure to stop the riots. It also sought a direction to the government to provide urgent relief and legal aid to riot victims.

444,['3/03/2020'],"Thiruvananthapuram: Oppn bays for Behera’s blood, cites Rs 300 crore graft","Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has thrown his weight behind state police chief Loknath Behera in the wake of the opposition’s demand to remove the police chief from the post and order a CBI probe over the critical remarks against the police in the comptroller and auditor general’s (CAG) report.

Replying to the opposition’s demand in the assembly to remove Behera from the post while seeking leave for adjournment motion, the chief minister made it clear that the government will not replace Behera with another officer over the matters that are being debated now. He also criticized the opposition for attacking Behera and said that it is not right on the part of the opposition to attack a person who cannot answer the allegations against him in the assembly.

The chief minister also ruled out the demand for a CBI inquiry and said that the CAG report will go through the usual process as stipulated in the rules. He said that it will be scrutinized by the public accounts committee and an action taken report will be placed in the assembly. When the opposition sought why the government had earlier ordered a judicial inquiry over the CAG’s report against the former UDF government regarding the Vizhinjam project, the chief minister defended that the inquiry was not ordered based only on the CAG report alone. “In the case of Vizhinjam project, allegations surfaced much earlier and the government was thinking of taking steps on it when the CAG report on Vizhinjam also came up,” he said.

However, the issues that have been cited by the CAG regarding the purchases and projects of the police will be examined by the cabinet on what can be done over that, Vijayan said. However, he supported all purchases and the project implementation of the police that have been criticized by the CAG in its report. He also said that the report has gone through the period from 2013 to 2018 when there were different home ministers and different police chiefs.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the opposition has nothing to do with Behera as a person, and the demand is being raised based on alleged corruption to the tune of more than Rs 300 crore is involved in the purchases and implementation of projects of the police. He also slammed the central intrusion monitoring system (CIMS) and questioned the credentials of the firm Galaxon that has been chosen by Keltron to run the project. After speaker P Sreeramakrishnan refused to move adjournment motion, the opposition staged a protest, shouting slogans from near the podium of the speaker demanding a CBI probe against chief minister and Behera. Amid the sloganeering, the house passed the supplementary demands for grants for 2019-20 and ended the proceedings for the day.

445,['3/03/2020'],IIIT-H to earmark 25% BTech seats for female students,"Hyderabad: After witnessing an alarming decline in the number of enrolment of female students over the last four years, the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) has decided to earmark 25 per cent of the total BTech seats for women from the academic year 2020-21.

The institute is launching a diversity channel that will allow female students to seek admission through various modes such as an in-house entrance exam, special (SPEC) channel of admission and the Olympiad Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana apart from the regular JEE (Mains). It will not be on the lines of a reservation or a quota system. “These seats are kept apart for female candidates. They will not be eligible for regular seats unless the diversity channel seats are all filled up,” said Prof PJ Narayanan, the director of IIIT-H.

For example, if there are 100 seats and 25 girls in the first 100 IIIT-H ranks, then the diversity channel will be filled up, opening up the regular seats to everyone. “In theory, it could lead to more than 25 per cent of total student intake being women. The cut-off rank under this scheme is the same as the cut-off under the open quota. So in that sense, this works differently from traditional reservations,” clarified the director.

While in early years of its inception, the IIIT-H saw a decent ratio of women enrolments, it has witnessed a decline over the last four years. Authorities have attributed it to the launch of more Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and change in parents mindset of sending their daughters to institutions in close proximity.

“From informal conversations with parents, we found that parents (of girls particularly) prefer proximity to their home while choosing a place of study. In addition to an increase in the total number of seats, the introduction of supernumerary seats by the IITs too has diverted potential female candidates elsewhere,” said Prof Jayanthi Sivaswamy, dean (academics) at IIIT-H.

An analysis of female enrolments at IIIT-H institute in the early years indicates a higher acceptance rate by applicants from Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring states. In 2019, only four girls joined the BTech programme through the JEE Mains and all were from the home or neighbouring states, reinforcing the proximity factor.

446,['3/03/2020'],Auto drivers’ strike leaves many stranded on streets,"Indore: Thousands of auto-rickshaw drivers on Monday went on strike demanding ban on mobile application-based taxi services, which left the common man stranded on the streets.

The auto rickshaw drivers staged a demonstration in front of collectorate and submitted a memorandum to SDM Shashwat Sharma enlisting their 17-point demand.

Auto-rickshaw union leaders claimed that over 5000 drivers including those ferrying children to school had shunned work for the day to push for their demands that they claimed were important for survival in the profession.

Union president Rajesh Bidkar said services and web application of bike companies should be terminated as riders associated with the companies are operating without commercial licence, which is against the law.

Currently, 22000 auto rickshaws are operating in city, out of which some are unable to earn cost of insurance and EMI of vehicle as influx of riders has dropped significantly, he said. The union demanded that strict action should be taken against those auto-rickshaw drivers, who are not complying with the arranged meter fare and not wearing uniform. The other demands included increasing purview of rickshaw permit to the whole district, free parking arrangements at railway stations and bus stands and construction of auto-rickshaw stands at hospitals, malls and offices.

447,['3/03/2020'],"Not on GHMC list, activists launch ‘missed call’ campaign to save lake","Hyderabad: In an attempt to save the Kindi Kunta lake in Hydernagar, green activists have started a ‘missed call’ campaign to gather support. Details of individuals who call on the given number are being collected and the list will be submitted to the government to push for action.

The activists have already received 652 calls in just six days as part of the campaign and are hopefull of receiving more.

“The full tank level (FTL) of the lake used to be around 8.85 acres, but now it’s just four acres. While three sides of the lake have fences, one side is open and is vulnerable to encroachment,” said Shreedhar Ukkalam, an activist who has been working on saving the lake for almost one and a half years.

The lake, located along Nizampet road, is not on the list of priority lakes to be taken up for conservation by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). This, Ukkalam said, has led to its neglect.

“There is not a single park or open space in the area and this lake can be converted into a people-friendly public space,” he said, adding that he has approached several GHMC officials, the local corporator as well as the local MLA, but in vain. He says earthmovers are often seen dumping waste in the area.

Venkat Belede, a local resident, said, “I would like to take my child to an open space instead of being cooped up at home all the time. If lakes such as Kindi Kunta are developed, it will be a huge relief for all of us.”

Meanwhile, local BJP leader Srinivas Velaga pointed out that all the lakes in Hydernagar area suffer from the same problem. “Ali Talab, Kindi Kunta and Ambeer lake are yet to be revived. While work on Ambeer lake was taken up first, it is downstream and there is a danger that sewage from upstream can pollute the waterbody,” he said.

Irrigation officials said there are still many larger lakes that need to be revived. “This lake is not on the priority list and will only be taken up once work on others is completed.”

Sawant said that the Niti Aayog encouraged Goa to formulate the state strategy on resource efficiency (RE) and circular economy (CE). A circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste, and is geared towards the continued use of resources.

“We are extremely delighted to have been supporting Goa in preparation of the resource efficiency and circular economy strategy,” the ambassador said.

Draconian powers to the government without following principles of natural justice is an unacceptable proposition for us,” the CJ said.The Act gave enormous powers to the municipal commissioners to demolish any structure which they find as illegal without issuing any notice to the owner of the structure. The petitioner was urging the court to strike down this provision after declaring it unconstitutional.The case was posted to March 11.Talking tough, the bench said: “You (officials) went to demolish a house one fine morning because the owner obtained permission for the ground floor and first floor but later built third and fourth floors in an unauthorised manner. But, who knows whether your town planning wing had subsequently permitted the additional floors without informing the commissioner? Is it not unfair to demolish without giving the owner an opportunity to tell his side of the story?”Advocate general BS Prasad said that they take an undertaking from the owners that they will strictly adhere to the provisions of the sanctioned plan. “Even after this, one prefers to flout the norms, he or she has to pay a price. Aggrieved persons can knock the doors of the town planning tribunals,” he said.At this, the CJ was furious. After ascertaining from the state counsel that the government has not yet constituted the town planning tribunals and not framed the rules for implementing the new Act, he said: “You (government) will leisurely constitute the tribunals by 2022 and in the meantime, you go to the owners’ houses with your bulldozers.”Responding to a plea by the AG that the court should allow the government because illegal constructions have become rampant in Hyderabad and elsewhere, the CJ said the court has to strike a balance between draconian powers of the state and interests of the citizens. “The state must act within the confines of the Constitution,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74455176,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155278,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-govt-cant-arm-itself-with-draconian-powers/articleshow/74448865.cms
450,['3/03/2020'],Father killed polio-afflicted Inter student: Police,"Hyderabad: The sensational murder of a 19-year-old Intermediate student in Karimnagar was cracked with the arrest of her father on Monday. The accused reportedly confessed that he was fed up with the perinnial health problems of his polio-afflicted daughter and decided to kill her.

M Radhika, 19, was found murdered at her house in Karimnagar on February 10. As the family members also reported about missing gold jewellery, Karimnagar police had initially suspected that the victim was killed either by property offenders or a known person, who held a grudge against the victim or her family.

Eight special teams, comprising 75 cops, questioned hundreds of suspects, scoured through phone call details and CCTV footage to zero in on the offender.

“We got the first lead from the doctor who performed autopsy of the victim. We were informed about the murder around 5.30pm on February 10 and by that time rigor mortis (a process in which the body becomes stiff and completely unpliable) had set in, which normally happens five or six hours after death. The family members told us the victim had breakfast around 8am. By looking at the contents in her stomach, the doctor confirmed that her death occurred less than 45 minutes after having the meal. So, we looked for suspects who could have been at her house during that time,” Karimnagar commissioner VB Kamalasan Reddy said.

A day after the murder (February 11), police found the victim’s family members had washed clothes on the terrace. They then seized some items after noticing stains. On February 13, forensic experts of CLUES Team from Hyderabad visited the spot and carried out crime scene analysis using super light multiband light source and a chemical reagent to identify washed blood stains. “The blood stains were spotted on a ‘banian’ (vest) and the footwear of Radhika’s father. The items were sent to FSL for DNA analysis. Four days ago, we recieved a report confirming that the DNA found on the footwear and the vest of Komaraiah matched with DNA of Radhika,” the commissioner said.

When confronted with evidence, Komairah, who works at a godown, reportedly confessed to have killed his daughter. “Komaraiah had spent over Rs 6 lakh on the treatment of his polio-affected daughter. She underwent surgery some time ago and was able to walk with support. However, her health deteriorated recently and she developed some other complications. Komaraiah felt he would not be unable to take care of his daughter’s medical expenses. He was fed up and decided to kill her,” the officer said.

“As per the plan, Komaraiah made tenents vacate their portion in the house on February 6. On February 10 morning, after his wife left for work, Komaraiah smothered his daughter, who was asleep due to illness, using a pillow.

To make it appear like a murder by robbers, Komaraiah pulled down the body from the bed and slit the throat with a kitchen knife. He also hid his wife’s gold chain in a rice barrel,” the commissioner said.

After the murder, Komaraiah washed his blood-stained clothes and knife. He packed lunch and left for work at 9.22am, while consoling his neighbours, who had lost their pet. “After reaching the godown at 9.49am, the accused called his wife, two other family members and spoke to them about routine issues. When he was informed about the murder around 5.30pm by locals, Komaraiah, who was at the godown, acted like an innocent man. He told police that three tola gold and Rs 99,000 cash was stolen,” police said.

456,['3/03/2020'],"After twin birth, no maternity benefits for 2nd pregnancy: Madras high court","‘Try to consider case as exception as child may be deprived of benefits’

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ruled that a woman giving birth to twins counts as two deliveries , while denying maternity benefits to a CISF employee when she had a third child after a second pregnancy. Under the rules, a woman government employee can claim maternity benefits only for her first two deliveries.“When twins are born they are delivered one after the other, and their age and their inter-se elderly status is also determined by virtue of the gap of time between their arrivals, which amounts to two deliveries and not one simultaneous act,” the first bench of Chief Justice A P Sahi and Subramonium Prasad said in a judgment last week.The issue pertains to an appeal moved by the Union home ministry challenging the order of a single judge extending 180 days of maternity leave and other benefits to a woman member of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) under the rules governing Tamil Nadu government servants.Challenging the order, the home ministry contended that the claim of maternity leave is by a member of the CISF, for whom the maternity rules of the Tamil Nadu government would not apply. She would be covered by the maternity benefits provided under the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, the ministry said.When the appeal came up for hearing, the bench said, a second delivery, which, in the present case, has resulted in a third child, cannot be interpreted so as to add to the mathematical precision that is defined in the rules. The admissibility of benefits would be limited if the claimant has more than two children.“This fact, therefore, changes the entire nature of the relief which is sought by the woman petitioner, and has been overlooked by the single judge,” the court added.The court set aside the impugned judgment of the single judge, and allowed the writ appeal. If the appellants had power to grant any relaxation in exceptional circumstances, it may be worth consideration, the court said, as it entails financial consequences that may result in deprivation of benefits to the newborn child, who is no way concerned either with the framing of rules or the choice of parents to have a child.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74449895,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-217904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/after-twin-birth-no-maternity-benefits-for-2nd-pregnancy-hc/articleshow/74448871.cms
457,['3/03/2020'],Dist admin in action after complaints of poor-quality cylinders,"Edited

Jaipur: Complaints with regard to distribution of poor-quality cylinders to the customers and setting up of illegal sale points in the city had prompted the district administration to swing into action and call a meeting of the gas companies and distributors recently. Jaipur collector Joga Ram had directed the gas companies to conduct regular checks of the distributors’ warehouses, inspect functioning of the distributors, ensure regular monitoring and adherence to safety standards. On Monday, the collector reiterated the directions to the gas companies.

“The job of the district administration is to coordinate with the gas companies on creating awareness among people on safety issues. On emergency response mechanism, they were given directions to publicise the toll free number -1906. They were also told to improve the quality of the cylinders and the equipment supplied to the customers,” said Collector Joga Ram.

“We got a complaint that they were distributing poor-quality cylinders, which had thinned in size. We have asked them to ensure quality. There is a standard operating protocol (SOP) for the gas companies to destroy the poor-quality cylinders. They do ensure it, but some lapses could be noticed on their part,” he added.

“The gas companies were also asked to inspect functioning of the gas distributors on a regular basis. They were asked to conduct all categories of inspections at one time. We also instructed that the delivery boys must be trained by the gas companies,” said the collector. “In some cases, a joint team of inspectors from the supply department along with field officers of the gas companies can conduct the inspections. They were asked to ensure that the dumping points are done away with as these are all illegal. We got a complaint that cylinders were being sold at a roadside shop. The cylinders should reach the customers directly from the authorised storage points (distributor's godown),” he added.

An official said, “When we receive complaints of illegal refilling, we send a team to take appropriate action as per law. In terms of illegitimate sale of cylinders, we take action as and when we get directions from the police and gas companies. We received two-three complaints that poor-quality cylinders were being distributed in some areas.”

Meanwhile, a gas company official said, “The delivery boys are supposed to get the refill vouchers/cash memos signed by the customer. It is an undertaking by the customer stating that he/she has received the cylinder only after leakage check and checking the weight of the cylinder. If we receive complaints, we immediately do counselling of the distributors. Awareness among the customers is also very important. If the customer wishes, the delivery boy connects the regulator with the cylinder. The complaints are attended free of cost.”

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday asked a petitioner to ignore a mention about National Population Register ( NPR ) as one of the identity proofs for completing the customer identification process issued by SBI through a notification in January this year.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy said the anxiety expressed by petitioner Khaja Aijazuddin, an advocate, was highly-misplaced. SBI wanted to know its customers and listed various identity cards asking them to show at least any one of them to complete its know your customer ( KYC ) process. Aadhaar, ration card, voter ID, PAN card, driving licence, passport, etc., are among the many options that are available to the people and they can ignore the NPR option, the bench said.

“One among the options is NPR which need not be mentioned at all because the process of updating NPR has not yet commenced,” the petitioner insisted. The bench, however, told the petitioner that there are several dialogues in Hindi movies that have no meaning at all. Equating SBI’s insistence on NPR particulars with this, the bench advised the petitioner to ignore the NPR option. “It does not cause any loss to you even if you ignore it,” the bench said.

461,['3/03/2020'],Bullets missing during previous govt’s regime: Thiruvananthapuram Chief minister,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the assembly that the bullets had gone missing from the police during the previous UDF government’s regime. He tabled records to prove that there was an internal probe in 2015 about missing bullets , which was later sabotaged. He said the opposition’s criticism against the government regarding the bullet issue was for hiding their failure.

“Even before the CAG could find that the bullets were missing, in 2015 it was reported about the missing bullets. Even though the probe was sabotaged then, in 2016, a fresh probe was ordered and the issue was dealt very seriously. It has been found that 11 police officers are responsible for this,” said the chief minister.

Vijayan also made it clear that the CAG report, which was tabled in the previous session of the assembly, was leaked. “It is a fact that the CAG report was leaked and it is a serious issue. The report is tabled in the assembly and the leaking of such a report cannot be taken as a freak incident,” he said. On the findings of the CAG, the chief minister said that the crime branch probe is on into the findings made by the CAG. “It has been found that there are no missing rifles. The probe is on the right track and hence there was no need for any probe by an outside agency,” he said.

On the involvement of a gunman of the minister in the bullet missing case, the chief minister said the crime branch has initiated a probe against him and if found guilty, he will have to face department-level action. “There was nothing wrong in the crime branch parading the rifles before the media since there was a huge controversy over this. In fact, there was a need to prove that the rifles have not been lost,” said Vijayan.

462,['3/03/2020'],Record rabi paddy crop brings storage problems for state govt,"Hyderabad: An all-time high paddy crop of 77.73 lakh metric tonnes is expected in the rabi season starting first week of April. This would be the highest paddy production in the history of Telangana state and also in undivided state for Telangana region.

The state government had procured 37 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in ‘yasangi’ (rabi is also called yasangi) last year. Though the super bumper paddy crop is good news, it has brought challenges for the state government. The storage capacity of warehouses of state government, FCI and private put together does not exceed 50 lakh metric tonnes in Telangana.

“The challenges before us are to create storage space for 77 lakh metric tonnes of paddy,” said agriculture department secretary, B Janardhan Reddy. “Crores of additional gunny bags have to be supplied to rice millers, more tarpaulin would be required to save paddy from getting wet due to unseasonal rains, more procurement centres need to be opened, additional vehicles for transportation of paddy have to be arranged, several logistics have to be taken care off.”

What’s more, the government will require over Rs 15,000 crore to procure 77 lakh metric tonnes of paddy, and request the Food Corporation of India to send the paddy to other needy states after Telangana’s requirement through public distribution system is met. The government gives counter guaranty to Civil Supplies Corporation to obtain loan and procure paddy by depositing the amount directly into the bank accounts of the farmers.

The cabinet sub-committee, comprising agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy, health minister Etela Rajender, and civil supplies minister G Kamalakar met here on Monday, and instructed officials to make arrangements to procure every paddy seed and ensure farmers were not put to trouble.

Giving credit to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, the ministers said that the bumper crop is a result of round the clock power supply being given to agriculture sector, water availability from irrigation projects such as Kaleshwaram, Rythu Bandhu sops as part of which TRS government is giving Rs 10,000 per acre per annum towards input subsidy to the farmers, and crop insurance among other factors. Paddy was sown in nearly 40 lakh acres for rabi as against 31 lakh last year.

LUCKNOW: Scores of students from Lucknow are stuck in Iran after the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus in the country.

As many as 210 deaths have been reported in Iran where, according to the latest reports, about 1,000 cases of the disease have been confirmed over the past two weeks. With flights and trains mostly cancelled, students studying in different cities of Iran are finding it difficult to travel home and are facing the risk of being exposed to the virus.

Research scholar of Islamic ethics in Iran, Ali Abbas, 31, from Lucknow is in two minds about leaving the country. While Ali wants to return home to India, he does not want to risk exposing himself to the virus outside his home in the Iranian city of Qom. “Airports and railway stations are the most contaminated places. Moving out of my place would mean exposure. But I do wish to go home. Our university is shut though classes are being taken online and through social media,” Ali told TOI from Iran.

For Syed Muhammad Abul Fazl, 27, a theology student in Qom, the 14-day observation period in India is also a concern.

“I want to return to Lucknow but where will we be kept for testing and observation for 14 days in India? It would be better if we were tested for the virus in Iran itself and then given a medical certificate for Indian authorities,” he said.

Another student, Syed Iman Ahmad, 27, wants to return home for his family’s peace of mind.

Efforts from Lucknow are also being made to get these students back home safe. On February 28, Maulana Saif Abbas had written to the ministry of external affairs.

“I have requested for a special flight to Tehran or a nearby airport from where Indian nationals and students can be airlifted. After a lot of effort, foreign minister S Jaishankar has tweeted that they are working with Iranian authorities on the issue and there could be a solution soon,” said Abbas.

On Monday, Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind general secretary Maulana Kalbe Jawad also wrote a letter to the external affairs ministry on evacuation of Indians from coronavirus-hit countries.

NEW DELHI: Former JNU student Umar Khalid , who is currently on trial under sedition charges for provocative and anti-national sloganeering on the campus in 2016, is under the scanner of intelligence agencies for the purported speech given by him on February 17 in Maharashtra’s Amravati.

In the unverified video being examined by agencies, Khalid is heard asking people to come on the roads during US president Donald Trump’s visit.

Security establishment suspects, sources said, that the communal violence in north east Delhi was an organised effort that was timed to coincide with the visit of the United States president.

“I promise you that on February 24, when the US president, Donald Trump arrives in India, we will let him know that the Indian Prime Minister has been trying to divide the country. The ideals of Mahatma Gandhi are being tarnished. We will let him know that the citizens of India have been fighting against the government’s decisions. If the government wants to divide India, the citizens will unite and step out on the roads. Before leaving, I will tell all of you not to be demoralised. The fight is long.”

Sources pointed to the sudden decision of anti-CAA protesters to replicate Shaheen Bagh near Jafrabad metro station — a move which immediately attracted protests from a group led by BJP functionary Kapil Mishra who has been accused of making provocative comments.

Also under the scanner are few women activists belonging to far-Left women’s rights group, Pinjra Tod, to mobilise locals in northeast Delhi. According to police, the activists belonging to these groups had called for a gathering at Jafrabad metro station on the night of February 22. Even after the riots, some of their activists tried to gather at another spot but were forcibly removed. Some of them were arrested as well.

Delhi Police’s Special Cell has been looking into Khalid’s role after the video came to fore on social media on Monday. The video will be verified by forensic officials for any tampering and action taken accordingly, a senior officer said.

In the 17-minute-long clip, Khalid is head saying, “The home minister had said that no matter how much we protest or complain, the government won’t back-track on its decisions. Three days back, he agreed to talk to us. I would say if the camel has reached the hill it is only because of the women from Shaheen Bagh. They had tried to defuse the Shaheen Bagh agitation, but the more they tried to destabilise the movement, it grew more powerful. Today, there is a Shaheen Bagh in every corner of the country.”

As part of the work, the enclosures will be reconstructed or expanded in order to ensure more space for the animals . The sanction orders, however, are yet to be issued for work to commence.

“Till now, most of these enclosures were merely cages. They didn’t have night shelters or a separate enclosure for food or space for movement. As per the new guidelines of the central zoo authority (CZA), they must be reconstructed or expanded,” zoo director Vikas Desai told TOI.

Among the structures listed for repairs and reconstruction are the tiger moat, panther cage, bison moat, sloth bear moat and the hippo moat. The godown, where animal feed is stored, and the bus shelter for vehicles of the forest department will also undergo repairs.

The new constructions will include a gaur enclosure and a labour shelter. Meanwhile, the in-house veterinary clinic at the zoo will see some repair work and will also have a compound wall around it.

The forest department had also floated a tender for the construction of steel railings along the Bondla pond. The work orders have already been given to the PWD for the same and work is expected to begin soon, Desai said.

Other upgradation work will also be taken up for the beautification of the zoo. “More work will be tendered in the coming weeks,” he said.

PANAJI: Congress on Monday announced the names of 21 candidates for the March 22 zilla panchayat (ZP) elections.

Political commentators said that quite a few names, like that of AAP’s Benaulim candidate for the 2017 assembly polls, Royla Fernandes, who had emerged as a strong contender, and NCP MLA Churchill Alemao ’s close supporter Jose Santa Rita Coelho, are likely to raise eyebrows among political circles.

Royla will contest from Benaulim and Coelho from Navelim.

Among the other key names announced by state Congress president Girish Chodankar , former Mandrem sarpanch Mahesh Konadkar also stands out.

Konadkar, who returned to the party fold just a few days earlier, will contest from the Morjim constituency.

“Our main target is to defeat BJP. So if we find that there is a stronger candidate in a seat and our candidate is weak, then to defeat BJP we are ready to back the stronger candidate,” Chodankar said.

LB Nagar police said that Narender reached the flyover on his bike and parked the vehicle along the railing. Much to the shock of passers-by, he suddenly jumped off the flyover. The incident occured at around 2.30am. The people nearby immediately rushed him to the hospital, but Narender was declared dead on arrival.

During investigation, the police found that Narender often had arguments with his wife and used to drink alcohol. On the day of the incident, he drank liquor before riding his bike to the flyover. “We suspect that Narender took the extreme step due to marital discord. However, we found a suicide note where he mentioned that no action should be taken against his wife,” LB Nagar inspector Ashok Reddy said.

Drama prevailed near the farmhouse where Revanth had taken mediapersons. He alleged that the farmhouse was owned by TRS working president and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao although on paper the name of owner was different.

“The farmhouse is spread over 25 acres and the built-up area is one lakh square ft. It is located within the purview of GO 111 under which constructions are not allowed. A portion of Firangi Nala has been encroached upon. It is a benami property of KTR ,” he alleged while addressing a media conference, while producing photo copies and ‘documents’ of the farmhouse. Revanth did not even disclose to mediapersons that he would take them to the spot. He himself changed vehicles and reached the spot to avoid arrest. Tension prevailed as police reached the spot and tried take him into custody. A jostling ensued between Congress members and cops and in the melee Vishweshwar suffered an injury on his leg.

HYDERABAD: A 60-year-old Bahrain national was arrested for allegedly sexually exploiting a 25-year-old woman, a divorcee, from the city. Chandrayangutta police also arrested a salesman from Barkas in the case.

Police arrested Ebrahim Shukralla Mohamed Bairami, 60, a retired nurse from Bahrain, and Salam Bin Sayed Bafanna, 30, a salesman from Salala, Barkas. Two other accused, Saber and his wife Sameena, also from Barkas, were absconding.

On March 1, police received a complaint from a 30-year-old woman from Amberpet, who is the elder sister of the survivor. She alleged that on February 25 afternoon one Md Saber alias Volta Saber called her to his house at Salala, Barkas to discuss about the sale of her house.

Around 3 pm, the complainant, who is a divorcee, went to Saber’s house along with her 25-year-old sister, also a divorcee, . “Saber introduced them to Ebrahim Shukurullah and asked them if any of them was willing to marry him. They rejected the proposal,” assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Falaknuma, Md Majeed said.

Subsequently, both the sisters returned to their house. Around 9.30pm, the complainant realised that her sister was not at home. “She thought that her sister might have gone to her in-law’s house to meet her son. However, as there was no communication from her till February 27 afternoon, the complainant went to Saber’s house and confronted him. Saber’s wife slapped her and snatched her phone. On February 29, Saber and his wife gave her sister’s address (at Salala) to the complainant,” the ACP said.

She went to the house and found Ebrahim there with her sister. “Ebrahim told me that Saber had sold my sister to him. My sister said that Saber’s wife took her to Ebrahim and the latter confined her in the room and sexually exploited her. He did not marry her. He also burnt her feet with cigarette. When I asked Ebrahim to come to the police station, he tried to escape with his luggage. I snatched his passport so that he can’t escape,” the complainant said.

Based on the complaint, police registered a rape case against Ebrahim, who arrived in Hyderabad on October 21, 2019. “Ebrahim wanted to marry Hyderabadi women through Saber. With the help of Saber and his wife, Ebrahim raped the victim,” the ACP said. Police arrested Ebrahim and Salam Bin Sayed, who provided him shelter at Salala. Saber and Sameena were absconding.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and opposition leader locked horns over SNC Lavalin case in the assembly on Monday.

While replying to the opposition’s leave for adjournment motion with regard to the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report against the police, the chief minister said that he is no more an accused in the SNC Lavalin case at present. “Which Lavalin are you talking about? What concerns do I have in the matter? I have been discharged by both the trial court and later the high court that examined the trial court judgment,” he said.

However, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the chief minister was not completely free from the case as it is still pending with the Supreme Court. “The law does not permit anyone to become absolved from a case without trial. The matter is still pending with the Supreme Court and it will come up there for trial,” he said.

He also reminded the CM that former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad, who was absolved in the fodder scam by the lower courts, was finally convicted by the Supreme Court. He added that the chief minister will still have to face the case in the Supreme Court.

In the wake of increasing road accidents, the transport department has initiated multiple steps to ensure that all long-route vehicles, including container lorries and buses, are plying safely and by adhering to the rules and regulations, transport minister A K Saseendran said. Replying to a submission in the assembly by MLA A N Shamseer, he said that joint teams of police and motor vehicles department have launched operations round the clock to ensure that long route vehicles adhere to safety regulations, including following lane discipline. Road safety commissioner has been entrusted to monitor the initiative through state police chief and transport commissioner, the minister said.

Saseendran said that the public works department has been entrusted with the task of identifying locations where the transport department can set up basic amenities for drivers of long-distance vehicles. It has also been decided to prepare a detailed roadmap to regulate the timings of truck drivers, by a committee under labour department by including labour commissioner, transport commissioner and road safety commissioner. The government will request the Centre to amend section 90 of the motor vehicles rules so as to restore the condition that long-distance trucks will mandatorily have to maintain the services of more than one driver in their trips.

In the wake of the recent KSRTC bus accident at Avinashi in Tamil Nadu, the bus driver and conductor’s kin will receive Rs 10 lakh each, as the corporation had entered into an insurance scheme with the New India Assurance company. He said that they will also receive Rs 10 lakh from the general insurance scheme of the government, as they are permanent employees of the corporation. If the government decides to provide any financial aid to the relatives of the deceased in the bus accident, the bus driver and the conductor will also be included in that, the minister replied to another submission by MLA Eldhos Kunnappally.

NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation will utilise brickbats and stones collected from the riot-affected areas of northeast Delhi to make tiles, paver blocks, kerbstones and other items.

During a joint drive from February 26 to March 2, the civic agency has collected over 700 tonnes of debris to clean the main and internal roads in Shiv Vihar (Brijpuri Tiraha), Yamuna Vihar, Bhajanpura, Ashok Nagar, Kabir Nagar, Karawal Nagar and Kardampuri. Most of the material have been sent to the construction-cum-demolition waste plant at Shastri Park.

“The police and local administration pointed out that the stones scattered on roads obstructing movement of people. As soon as we received directions from them, tippers and staff were sent,” said a senior EDMC official.

The corporation, on average, collects 500 tonne demolition-and-construction waste every day from east Delhi. “We collected much more than the average quantity of stones from just eight-nine riot-hit areas in two days,” said the official. The tiles, kerbstones etc are mostly bought by government agencies and used in road construction.

The civic agency is also helping police remove burnt vehicles through 20 excavating machines. So far, 456 burnt vehicles have been lifted, an EDMC report mentioned. “We are taking them to the sites meant for case property on the direction of Delhi Police,” said the official.

During the riots, garbage lifting vehicles also stopped visiting the affected places as police didn’t allow it and staff also didn’t feel safe to enter inner lanes, said the official. “But now we have removed all backlogs from roads. Some inner lanes and drains still have garbage but that will be cleaned soon,” he assured.

475,['3/03/2020'],Farming competition turns students into agriculturists,"Hyderabad: Partially ditching their books to practice farming on the campus, the students of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGKUT) cultivated about 1.5-acre land to grow organic vegetables.

To ensure that they follow best practices, they turned the ordeal into a competition - campus farming, by dividing the land into nine parts, which was handled by students of nine different streams.

“Teams were allowed to follow any method of cultivation. But to give them all a level playing ground, we provided them with the same quality of seeds,” said A Aditya, a final year engineering student, who was part of the organizing committee of ‘Techies for Karshak’. He said that students spent about 45 days cultivating organic spinach and coriander.

Mechanical engineering students, whose crop was judged as the best by the farmers , said that using tools they created for cultivating gave them an edge over other teams.

“After cultivating the field, we made use of hand rake to ensure that enough air reaches the soil. Likewise, we made use of several handy tools at the time of seeding, for removing weeds and harvesting,” said Sandeep A, who was part of the mechanical team, adding that they also showed the tools they made to farmers who visited their campus.

Students said that as part of ‘Techies for Karshak’, about 100 farmers from five villages visited their campus.

They said that next year, they are planning to use more land to grow rice, wheat and maize among other crops.

476,['3/03/2020'],Nods to 80 food carts in Panaji set to be suspended,"Picture used for representational purpose only

PANAJI: Continuing the crackdown on food carts and mobile stalls operating in the state capital, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) took a decision on Monday to suspend the trade licences of 80 food carts operating without permission from the directorate of food and drugs administration (FDA).

During the ordinary meeting, which was chaired by mayor Uday Madkaikar, the council found that only 12 of the 92 mobile food stalls had the required permissions. One of the main decisions before the council was the relocation of 40 food carts that were seized from near Don Bosco school and Miramar.

“The FDA has objected to the functioning of the gaddas as they don’t have licences from them. That is why the licences of 80 food carts will be suspended,” Madkaikar told the councillors.

Since the end of January, CCP had seized 14 food carts in the paved area near Don Bosco School and forced them to shut their operations after they were found dumping food waste directly into the drains. Since then, the food carts continue to be in CCP’s custody. The food carts used to sell everything from ros omlette and Chinese to biryani and chaat .

Interestingly, one of the reasons cited for cancellation of the licences of the food carts, was a complaint by hoteliers and restaurateurs that the brisk business done by the food carts was eating into their revenue.

Madkaikar said that Panaji BJP MLA Atanasio Monserrate requested CCP to look into the complaints and take an appropriate decision.

“The gadda owners obtain a trade licence for one activity but it is seen that they are running more than one,” the mayor said.

Madkaikar assured the CCP council that the civic body is in the process of earmarking a dedicated zone to accommodate the food carts, which are presently spread across at Miramar, Campal, Caranzalem, St Inez, and other places.

478,['3/03/2020'],Illegal layouts: Registration dept alleges rev loss post crackdown,"Hyderabad: Notwithstanding the crackdown on registration of open plots in unapproved layouts, the registration department alleged that the municipal administration authorities have written to it to stop registrations without first providing any list of illegal layouts.

The registration department is unhappy with the municipal administration wing for stalling their revenues even as the financial year is coming to a close. For instance, in Mancherial municipality, only six survey numbers were identified as illegal layouts. But, the commissioner of Mancherial wrote to the registration department to stop registration in all unapproved layouts. The situation is almost the same in other urban local bodies.

“Before writing to us, the municipal department should have done groundwork and notify us under section 22-A of the Registration Act for prohibition of registrations apart from putting out the list of unapproved layouts on their website. Without any basic exercise, we have been asked to stop registrations. As a result, the department is losing revenue,” a registration official said. Moreover, some developers are coming up with layout copies but there is no mechanism to check genuineness of the sanctioned layouts, the official said.

According to officials, Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) had identified about 800 layouts in three districts -- Rangareddy, Medak and Mahbubnagar — that came under HMDA limits a couple of years ago. Even in the list, survey numbers, layout names and promoters’ names were missing in the layout details that were posted on the authority’s website. Besides that, the actual number of unauthorised layouts was more than what was identified. There has been no proper enforcement to stop development of layout before developers sell them to gullible people, officials point out. “There could be more than 3,000 to 4,000 unapproved layouts around Hyderabad. HMDA, which is imposing several conditions such as a minimum 40-ft road width for layout permissions without any rule in the Act, is indirectly encouraging unauthorised layouts,” S Chandrasekhar, an RTI activist, said.

Municipal administration principal secretary Arvind Kumar said every layout which is approved will have registration details. “All others are unauthorised. Onus is on the applicants to show the relevant papers,” he said. Architect S Ramarkrishna said the state had exempted projects sanctioned prior to January 2017 from RERA, but no such exemption was given to the old layouts.

“He is disturbed by the fact that the party did not stand by him when the government started targeting him soon after BJP formed government in UP. It was only later on that some senior leaders spoke about it,” said Azam’s brother-in-law Zameer Ahmed Khan . Talking to the media outside the Sitapur jail where Azam is lodged, Zameer said the senior SP leader is so miffed with the party that he is not willing to meet the senior leaders who are visiting him.

People close to Azam are of the view that the veteran politician was feeling cheated by the manner in which the party quietly saw his arrest. Though SP chief Akhilesh Yadav visited him in Sitapur jail the day he was shifted from Rampur prison, the party decided to stay away from public display of resentment over their leader’s arrest.

“Protests at the district level may have been futile in terms of any relief from jail but would have at least made Azam feel wanted,” said a close Azam aide.

The Khans are also upset over the manner in which the family was being treated by the government in terms of cases being lodged against them. Azam has been booked for offences like stealing books and goats. The MP feels it is only because he is a Muslim, said Zameer.

Azam along with his wife Tazeen and their son Abdullah were sent to Rampur jail on February 26, 2020 after they surrendered before a court. The three are accused of filing a forged date of birth certificate for Abdullah’s candidature in the assembly elections.

AGRA: A video has turned up online in Firozabad, where a government teacher was found dancing on Sapna Chaudhary ’s ‘Teri Aakhya Ka Yo Kajal’ song in a locked classroom, while her colleagues, including male teachers, were found showering cash on her.

The three-minute-long video was shot in Gaurishankar Degree College of Kutukpur Chanura village in Narkhi block of the district. The clip shows the teacher gyrating to the peppy number as others in the classroom are either making videos of her electrifying performance on mobile phones or showering cash on her.After the video, six teachers, including the teacher found dancing in the video, were suspended by Firozabad’s basic education officer.

According to sources, at least 150 primary school teachers were called for a five-day training programme under the central government’s initiative, called 'Nishtha' (National Initiative for School Head’s and Teacher’s Holistic Advancement). “It is a capacity-building programme for improving the quality of school education through integrated teacher training. The programme aims to build competency among all the teachers and school principals at elementary stage,” said the source.

“The dance party was organized after lunch inside the classroom by a group of teachers, who were supposed to attend the Nishtha programme from 9 am to 5 pm. In the video, teachers were also found showering cash on their fellow woman teacher, who had taken the centre stage for the dance,” said a source.

“Prima facie, the dance video was found to be true. The indiscipline of teachers is unacceptable. Their act has tarnished the image of the education department. Therefore, six of them have been suspended,” said Arvind Pathak , the BSA.

MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar told TOI that MGP has decided to contest around 19 seats.

The rest of the names will be announced soon. He said MGP, which plans to focus on issues including the Mhadei water dispute, agriculture, industries and unemployment in its ZP campaign, expects to win at least 10 of the 19 seats it is contesting.

The party’s North Goa candidates are Priyankar Naik for Torxem; Atmaram Dhargalkar for Dhargal; Shridhar Manjrekar for Morjim; Sandeep Vernekar for Chimbel; Narayan Tari for Mayem and Yogesh Pednekar for Karapur -Sarvan.

In South Goa, its candidates are Vishwajit Naik for Betki; Priya Chari for Curti; Damodar Naik for Veling - Priol; Ganapat Naik for Kavlem; Baburao Salelkar for Borim and Manuel Cruz for Siroda.

Dhavalikar said that in some constituencies, the party has an understanding with Congress. During the last zilla panchyat elections, MGP had contested in alliance with BJP. Dhavalikar, however, expressed confidence that MGP would be able to make a dent in BJP’s vote share and that they would go on to form the zilla panchayat with Congress.

MGP initially wanted all opposition parties to join hands to fight BJP at the ZP polls.

The party is even said to have received feelers from other political parties for the same. However, no final seat sharing agreement has been reached yet.

Apart from MGP, so far BJP and NCP have announced their ZP candidates’ names.

Talking to TOI, Mathura DM Sarvagya Ram Misra said that Khan, who was booked under the National Security Act (NSA) for alleged inflammatory statements during an anti-CAA protest in Aligarh, is absolutely fine. He said Khan is fully secure inside the jail and the allegations of “inhuman” treatment being meted out to him are baseless.

Senior superintendent of Mathura district prison, Shailendra Maitrey, said Khan’s condition is being monitored every half an hour and the report is written in the gate book. He said his ECG was found normal on Sunday and the blood pressure was also under control.

He said Khan was demanding checkup by a cardiologist, but since no specialist is available in the government hospital here, his request could not be complied with. However, the jail authorities have forwarded his request to the chief medical officer.

He said Khan is in 20x60 feet barrack, which is fully ventilated, and he shares it with 50-60 prisoners known for their “good behaviour”.

Shabista, in a letter to the chief justice of Allahabad HC, additional chief secretary (home), and director general (jail), had alleged that her husband was being treated inhumanly in the jail. She feared that an attempt could be made on her husband’s life inside the jail and had demanded adequate security for him.

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Monday accused former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP chief whip in assembly Narottam Mishra of trying to lure Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh with “offers of Rs 25 crore to Rs 35 crore each for switching sides”.

Talking to mediapersons in New Delhi, he claimed that Chouhan and Mishra have come to an “agreement”, under which Mishra would “leave the post of chief minister to Chouhan and accept the position of deputy chief minister”. “Following this, they are making calls to Congress MLAs and offering them huge sums of money to switch sides. But Congress MLAs are no up for sale,” Digvijaya said, adding: “Madhya Pradesh is not Karnataka and efforts of BJP leaders to topple the Kamal Nath government won’t succeed.”

When reporters asked if he has evidence to substantiate his charges, the Rajya Sabha MP said: “I don’t make allegations against anyone without factual proof.”

The BJP rejected these allegations. “It’s an old habit with Digvijaya to tell lies and create a sensation. Perhaps, he wanted to show his importance or blackmail chief minister Kamal Nath. He may be creating pressure on the chief minister, which is why he is making such allegations,” said Chouhan. Mishra said, “Digvijaya Singh is suffering from Narottam phobia.”

“He (Digvijaya) might be putting pressure on Kamal Nath. Earlier, he had alleged that I met Congress MLAs at some dhaba in Sheopur but he could not prove it. Sometimes, he accuses me of getting embroiled in EOW (economic offence wing) cases. Sometimes he involves my friends or my staff with EOW. This is mere pressure tactics,” Mishra said.

Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava said Congress is a divided house and its leaders are apprehensive of their MLAs switching loyalty any day. “If Digvijaya Singh is putting an MLA on auction, it is the insult of the MLA and democratic values. In MP, there is no culture of horse trading,” he said.

488,['3/03/2020'],Father of deputy I-T commissioner among 3 killed in Firozabad dist,"Agra: Three separate cases of murder have been reported from Fariha, Tundla and Linepar areas of Firozabad district on Monday. One of the victim was the father of a deputy income tax commissioner, Shailendra Singh, currently posted in Lucknow.

The first incident was reported from Barthara village under Fariha police jurisdiction, where one 47-year-old Umshankar Singh was shot dead. Originally hailing from Nagla Dhani village of Jalesar, Umshankar had shifted to his in-law’s house at Nagla Kaansh 15 years back.

Superintendent of police (rural) Rajesh Kumar said, “The victim’s body was found in a pool of blood on a cot. He was shot on the face while sleeping in his agriculture field. It is a case of murder. His relatives have given a written complaint to lodge an FIR.” The body has been sent it for autopsy. “During investigation, it was found that the victim had left home to guard his potato farm at night. The matter will be investigated, the SP said.”

The second murder was reported from Charrbagh village under Linepar police jurisdiction, where a 30-year-old man, a daily wager, was stabbed to death and his private parts chopped off. The body of the victim, Dhayan Singh of Sofipur village, was thrown on the roadside. The circle officer of Sadar, Baldev Singh, and a team of local police rushed to the spot to initiate a probe. According to police, it seems to be a case of revenge killing.

“The victim had been married for 10 years but was living separately from his wife for the past one year. Once his family gives us a written complaint, we will lodge an FIR. The body has been sent for autopsy,” said CO Baldev Sigh.

The third case of murder took place at Tundali village under Tundla police jurisdiction, where a 79-year-old man was bludgeoned to death. Victim Narayan Singh was the father of a deputy income tax commissioner. The victim had gone to his farm when someone attacked him and dumped the body in a drain.

Superintendent of police (city) Prabal Pratap Singh said, “Prima facie, it is a fallout of an old rivalry. The victim’s family is yet to lodge an FIR. Once we receive a complaint, action will be taken accordingly.” “The victim was attacked with a hard object on the back of his head twice. We are waiting for the autopsy report,” the SP added

Deepika (27) of Vanasthalipuram was arrested by police for blackmailing the woman from Rangareddy district through the fake Instragram profile. She lodged a complaint with Rachakonda police in January and during the investigation, cops identified the accused as Deepika, who turned out to be her schoolmate.

“The accused obtained the phone number and other details of the victim at the wedding of a common friend in 2019. She created a fake Instragram account. Posing as a man, she started blackmailing the woman saying that she has her private photographs,” cybercrime inspector P Laxmikantha Reddy said.

As the accused started using abusive language and threatened to post morphed obscene photos of her, the woman transferred Rs 2 lakh into the bank account of the accused, Reddy said.

After getting Rs 2 lakh, the accused remained silent for sometime but later started harassing the victim for more money. Unable to put up with the harassment, the victim lodged a complaint with police who arrested Deepaika on Monday. “Deepika’s family was unaware of her criminal activity,” the inspector said. The accused woman was sent to judicial remand.

KOLKATA: One could call it a sense of helplessness associated with being forced to stay away from family when things are not quite alright at home. A section of technicians and engineers from China who are stuck in Kolkata prefer to call it guilt, though. Some of them were supposed to return to China by now but could not travel as all flights to the country have been cancelled due to Covid-19 scare.

“I accompanied some project cargo to India when nobody was even aware of the virus. My work is nearly done here and I would like to be with my family at this time of crisis. Though the Chinese government is doing everything possible, I feel guilty for staying at a place that is considerably safe. My home is a few hundred kilometres from Wuhan and I am in constant touch with my family,” one of them said.

Another engineer said that the Chinese consulate has provided all assistance but news from home is not always available. “What we see on television or read in newspapers or online is scary. Our families say there are several restrictions on movement. Even our families have little information about what is going on around them. Even they can’t say when the situation will improve. We feel helpless,” he said.

The companies where the engineers and technicians work have also been issued restrictions by the Chinese government and are not giving out much information. “We heard that nearly 2,000 people are dead in China. The figure could be higher. While we are in touch with our immediate families, not much information is available on other relatives. There are restrictions on movement in our country to prevent spread of the virus,” a technician said.

Another one spoke of how a relative who had fever was quarantined till the test results came out to be negative. His family back home and others in the area are facing severe restrictions as there has been an outbreak in a region nearby. He attempted to fly to another country and then enter China but failed.

“Information is scarce. My family does not want to say much as they don’t want me to worry. From friends, I came to know that people in my neighbourhood are being allowed to leave for shopping only once for two hours in two-three days,” he said.

492,['3/03/2020'],Agra: Decks cleared for 24-hour water supply project for Tajganj,"The area around the Taj Mahal will get uninterrupted water supply.

AGRA: Under the Agra Smart City project, vicinity of Taj Mahal and nine municipal wards of the Tajganj locality are proposed to be developed as a model for all-round development.

Retrofitting of 2,250 acres of the area around the monument is proposed to take place under the area-based development plan (ADB), which also includes facilities like 24-hour uninterrupted water supply. For this, a 1,200 mm diameter water supply line will be laid directly from the Jeevani Mandi waterworks station to Tajganj.

Besides, four overhead tanks will also be constructed for storing water. The Agra Smart City Limited (ASCL) has received all the required approvals for implementation of the plan.

Presently, the area gets water supply from the Jeevani Mandi waterworks station. But the supply pipeline network is around 70 years old that often burst, causing immense loss of water. This disrupts supply and causes major inconvenience to residents.

According to the civic body officials, the work plan is estimated to cost Rs 142.60 crore. It will take at least two years to complete the work. Following this, water meters will be installed at all houses across the nine wards of Tajganj locality.

Arun Prakash, municipal commissioner, said, “The main supply line will be laid from Jeevani Mandi waterworks station to Tajganj locality. Four overhead water tanks will also be constructed. The entire work will be completed in the next two years. The quality of work will be monitored by Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The area around the Taj Mahal will get uninterrupted water supply. Around 1.46 lakh people will get benefited.”

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After the physical verification of the guns, the crime branch (CB) probing the missing cartridges case of the police, undertook a physical verification of the cartridges here on Monday. Refuting the findings of the comptroller and auditor general’s (CAG) report, the CB team found that there is a shortage of only 3,836 cartridges in the force.

Under the supervision of the CB director Tomin J Thachankary and IG S Sreejith, the CB team probing the case physically counted the cartridges after accumulating them at the special armed police battalion in the capital. After the verification, the CB chief said that the probe in the matter will continue.

The CAG report had found that 12,061 cartridges and 25 Insas automatic rifles were missing from the police force. The CB had earlier conducted a physical verification of the guns and had reported that no rifle was missing from the force and the CAG findings were a result of not accepting the acknowledgement receipt of guns that were moved from a unit to another.

However, the CB had undertaken a detailed investigation in the case of missing cartridges, and a case was registered against 11 officers. Of this, one of the officers who was found to have forged the empty cartridges has been arrested and is in judicial custody. The CB is preparing to interrogate all the quarter masters and assistant commandants from 1996 to 2018, during which the cartridges had gone missing.

The committee, which issued strict guidelines, has granted permission to parade the elephant only in Thrissur and Palakkad districts. A 10-member elephant squad formed by the monitoring committee will accompany the tusker in all the parades, it said.

Also, four mahouts should be present near the tusker and five-metre distance should be maintained between the crowd and the elephant. If the wounds on the hind leg are not healed on time, the elephant will not be allowed to take part in parades. The doctor, who treats the tusker, should issue a fitness certificate every week. It has also been instructed that the elephant should not be stressed out and crackers should not be burst near it.

In case of the tusker showing any unnatural behaviour, the forest department will impose a ban and all the programmes of Ramachandran should be informed to the divisional forest officer and the district veterinary officer concerned.

The committee said that Thechikottukavu devaswom will be liable for any harm or damage caused by the elephant. According reception to the tusker on its arrival at any venue will not be allowed. The temple committee has also been told to submit an affidavit saying that they agree with the monitoring committee decisions. “If the owners violate any of the guidelines, strict action will be taken against them,” said Thrissur ACF P M Prabhu.

Earlier, an expert team constituted by the monitoring committee had recommended rest to the elephant till March 2, considering its health. Ramachandran, who is 56 years old, is the tallest domestic tusker in the country, which makes him the most sought-after one in the festival circuit. Last year, forest department had banned the tusker after it was involved in an incident in which two people lost their lives.
