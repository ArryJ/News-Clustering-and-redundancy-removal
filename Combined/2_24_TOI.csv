1,['24/02/2020'],Vishal confirms taking over as director of Thupparivalan 2; Mysskin responds to reports of him not sticking to budget,"The first time Mysskin and Vishal came together for Thupparivalan , the film received critical and commercial acclaim. The two had then announced that they would be reuniting for a sequel to the film, which went on floors last year. And now, looks like all’s not well between the director and the actor, with Mysskin leaving the film and Vishal taking on the director’s mantle. So, what transpired?Reports suggest that problems cropped up on the set when Mysskin said he’d require `40 crores more than the agreed-upon budget, which didn’t go down well with Vishal, who’s also producing the film. However, that’s not the only issue, we hear.A source in the know told us, “Mysskin had started location hunting in London in August and had spent about a month-and-a-half there. But when they started shooting in November, there were problems pertaining to location permission. Usually, when you shoot abroad, you need to have permissions in place at least a month in advance. But the team had no proper plan in place and the shoot had to be halted for several days because there were no permits. This cost them a lot of money. They shot in London till December 11 and returned to India, after spending about `12 crores for that schedule. That, coupled with this requirement for additional budget, erupted into a huge problem. Tension escalated during a discussion between them last month when Mysskin had refused to direct the film.”The source added that Vishal and Mysskin are likely to come to a legal agreement soon, after which Vishal will direct the film.We reached out to Vishal, who is presently shooting for Chakra at the police academy near Vandalur, asking if he was going to direct Thupparivalan 2 . He responded to our text with a ‘True’.Meanwhile, Mysskin’s response to us was full of sarcasm. He said, “No, I didn’t ask for `40 crores. I’ve asked `400 crores.” He continued matter-of-factly, “I have finished 50 per cent of the film in `100 crore. I have asked for another `100 crores for the rest of the film. For the climax portion alone, which will feature a scene of Vishal jumping from a satellite, I want an additional `100 crores. So yes, I have asked for `400 crores.” Sarcasm on point!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74267328,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-557556/74267328.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/vishal-confirms-taking-over-as-director-of-thupparivalan-2-mysskin-responds-to-reports-of-him-not-sticking-to-budget/articleshow/74267328.cms
2,['24/02/2020'],Mohanlal: Priyan and I have an understanding; I know exactly what he wants and vice versa,"In 1999, after the success of Kaalapani , which was Mohanlal-Priyadarshan combo’s most ambitious project then, the late scriptwriter T Damodaran had narrated the idea of a movie on Kunjali Marakkar IV to the director. “It was inconceivable back then to make a film that was extensively set at sea,” says Priyadarshan Now almost 21 years later, after four months of shooting and over a year of post-production to perfect the visual effects, Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham has been censored and is gearing up for its pan-Indian release in multiple languages. It’s the biggest (ad)venture yet for the superstar-director duo, who have worked together in over 40 films in their prolific careers spanning four decades.In an exclusive interview with Kochi Times, Mohanlal and Priyadarshan talk about the challenges of working in the period film that features a star cast from all major film industries in India as well as British and Chinese actors, and how much they have influenced each other.Kunjali Marakkar IV is part of our history but nothing much is known about him. We have used our creative freedom and cinematic elements to tell his story on a big canvas, in an entertaining manner. Telling this story has been a big dream for Priyan and me. Scale and artiste wise, after Kaalapani, we haven’t done such a project. Once we decided to go ahead with the film, it took its own shape in terms of production design and the star cast and became massive.Essentially, it is a story of a patriot. But what makes it different is that almost half the story is set at sea. Creating the old mast ships, war galleys of the Portuguese and the battle sequences in the sea were some of the bigger challenges we faced with the film. I believe that it is the most perfect film using VFX to be made in India. We took 14 months after the shoot to get there.Another aspect that will stand out is that generally such films herald heroism. Though Marakkar has those elements, it is also an emotional film. There was actually a film on Kunjali Marakkar that released in 1957, the year I was born. It won the National Award for National Integration that year, but we could never see what it looked like because we couldn’t find its print.I did some research on him and whatever I could find in history was completely contradictory. In the European version, he was a villain because he waged war against them, but the Arabs hailed him as a God. There were four Kunjali Marakkars and it is believed that their bloodline ended with the fourth. So, what I did was take the basic thread of his story from a text I had learnt when I was in Class 3 and give it my spin.We have also tried to keep the scenes and characters realistic than take a cosplay approach like in most movies based on Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern ballads of Kerala) and Kappalottiya Thamizhan.Yes, for instance, I had observed that the temperature rose by 3.5 degrees every century and that’s why in the 16th century, kings and soldiers used to have their entire bodies covered. The peak summer temperature in Kerala would have been only 21 degrees and this is how it is shown in the movie. Also, it doesn’t make sense for soldiers to fight in waters, bare-chested.As Priyan said, the basic idea when we started out was to make a patriotic film. If you see, every foreign power that made it to India, first touched base in Kerala – be it the missionaries, traders or explorers. So, Kerala has a huge significance to our country’s history.As for Kunjali Marakkar IV, when foreign powers were trying to invade our land, he was at the forefront of resistance and that’s probably why he is regarded as the first Naval commander of India. He was an expert navigator and that’s the reason we have dubbed him the Lion of the Arabian Sea. I consider it a blessing to play a historic figure like him.Also, contrary to what most people think, Kunjali Marakkar IV died when was about 53 years old. So, screen-age wise, I thought it was a perfect character for Mohanlal. Heroic figures like Marakkar or Velu Thampi Dalawa had this aura about them and Lal has that. After putting on the get-up of Marakkar, many said he looked like Jesus. But the most important aspect is his enthusiasm to do such a role. Most people would ask themselves if they can pull it off, but he doesn’t doubt himself.We haven’t analysed what makes our friendship work yet (laughs). We just have that understanding; I know what he wants and vice versa. The director-actor relationship is only on the sets; after that it’s Mohanlal and Priyan. For many, that might not be the case. But I have been like that with every director. Perhaps because I have done so many films with Priyan, our chemistry might be a shade better.The burden of expectations. I think the audience must forget about our previous movies and stop expecting us to repeat that kind of magic. If we did that, there would be nothing novel from our side.It would be unreasonable if people watch Marakkar and complain that there is no comedy. We have been trying to do something different with every film – be it Advaitham, Oppam or other movies that had a lot of dark humour.In a way, Marakkar was born out of that thought; What can we offer that’s new? That we have never done before? That’s why we wanted to do a pan-Indian film that would propel the Malayalam film industry to the next rung.When I went to Bollywood and used to give actors instructions, many of them would tell me that I am acting out exactly like Mohanlal. I learnt from one of the best actors in the country and I am proud of that. There are things that he does with the characters I scripted that I never could have imagined. He breathes new life into them through his nuances. He has acted in over 300 films and worked with some of the greatest directors in the country including Bharathan, Mani Ratnam and Ram Gopal Varma. I am sure he can conceive a film in his mind and can execute it well.Both of us have our own individualities. Priyan has worked in so many films with other actors too and I have also collaborated with a lot of directors. When we meet, however, we share beautiful moments while doing a film. Working with him is like a picnic. If there is stress on the sets, he doesn’t distribute it to the team. He takes the responsibility of solving that himself. This again is because of his experience; he is approaching his 100th film and is well versed about the challenges of filmmaking.I don’t think you can compare it with Priyan’s films. He has been part of Barroz’s script discussions but apart from that I don’t think you would find the similar magic of his films in my directorial. Barroz is a mystery about a child and a ghost.There might be some influences that might creep in unknowingly. His best quality is that he takes only the shots that are necessary for a film and that saves a lot of time. That is how I want to approach a film too. I believe we must have clear absolute clarity about the movie we are making.We will begin shooting by June end, with Goa and Kerala being the main locations. A lot of portions will be shot inside a studio set because it’s a 3D film.With every film, he is growing and that’s what makes me happy. A film is like a huge dream, and Priyan is someone who keeps himself updated about the progress in cinema. I am sure his next movie would be even better than Marakkar because he has that passion. When you do a movie with him, there are so many possibilities for an actor to learn and grow. I believe that is why everyone likes to work with him.I think for Mohanlal, it’s how popular he became with people of all age groups. His humour appealed to children, his action-oriented roles made him connect with the youth and his mature roles worked for the middle-aged audience. Above all, the audience saw him as an ordinary person, one among them whom they could relate to. I don’t think majority of the audience associate Mohanlal with a creative, genius artiste; it’s just that they see themselves in him.That is not true. If this movie becomes a success, I am hoping it would give us the boost to collaborate again on even bigger projects.I think our best film is yet to come.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74264745,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-60798/74264745.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/mohanlal-priyan-and-i-have-an-understanding-i-know-exactly-what-he-wants-and-vice-versa/articleshow/74264745.cms

And his students try their very best to come up with effective excuses to dodge this Herculean task. That’s what makes up the premises of this rather relatable play — My Homework Ate My Dog — that is being put together by the students of Theatre Dots. To be staged at the Bangalore International Centre on February 29, the cast includes 53 children between the age group of 8 and 18, who have also contributed to the script in many ways. “We have used inputs given by the students and it has helped make the narrative contemporary and funny,” says Pooja Singh , a founder member of the theatre group,who has directed this play. “The idea was to help understand the student’s perspective — the pressures and stress they go through as they attempt to meet project deadlines. The story also reflects on how our education system works — wherein the intelligence level of a student is judged based on the marks one scores. This play, however, also involves students of theatre in various aspects of the production. This is an attempt to use theatre as a medium to help students gain confidence and develop skill sets through hands-on experience,”explains Pooja.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74266695,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-161631/74266695.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/this-english-play-is-a-humorous-take-academic-pressure/articleshow/74266698.cms

5,['24/02/2020'],Are you ready to play with Keanu Reeves?,"Remember playing the famous Japanese arcade game Pac-Man fighting off Pinky, Blinky, Inky and Clyde? Launched in 1980 for almost all the platforms, this maze game was, and continues to be, a delight for players till date. But the gaming scene has, of course, taken a quantum leap since then. From single-user games to those involving multiple players, gaming is getting more futuristic, with better storylines, improved consoles and graphics and so much more. There is no dearth of entertainment or thrill, which should explain why hard-core gamers eagerly await the launch of the 2020 editions of new and updated games. Here’s the lowdown from professional gamers about the most awaited games of 2020, and why...USP: The story! Players are all excited to hit the road again with Ellie and Joel in this emotional journey. The new version is set five years after its prequel. Here, players control 19-year-old Ellie, who meets a mysterious cult in post-apocalyptic United States. Players can use improvised weapons, and stealth to defend themselves against hostile humans and bloodthirsty creatures.USP: Apart from the thrill of fighting really powerful supervillains, many customisation options, such as new and improved abilities and costumes, are available for players who can either play this offline or online on multiplayer mode. This game will feature evergreen favourite characters celebrating the unveiling of their second headquarters in San Francisco. Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor, Hank Pym, Hawkeye, and Miss Marvel will fight supervillains like Abomination and Taskmaster.USP: The weapon stack is huge! It has twice as many demons with more superpowers. The story resumes two years after the events of 2016’s Doom, wherein Earth is being ruled by demonic forces. This one will be the final game in the series.USP: One of the longest-running and most successful game series, FIFA, is for hardcore football lovers. FIFA 21 is the newest game in the football simulation video game series and the excitement around it is contagious.USP: The biggest attraction for players is that apart from the graphics and the storyline, they get to play alongside Keanu Reeves’ character Johnny Silverhand who has his own agenda. He accompanies the player around the city. The game is set in the fictional Night City that is fraught with gang wars. Players can take on the role of a customisable mercenary.USP: Prequel to Beyond Good and Evil, released in 2003, it takes the players on an intergalactic voyage. It has all the Star Trek feels, but with more informal and funky characters. The trailer has created quite a wave since its release. This adventure game set in space, promises loads of action with players planet-hopping and helping societies living there.Gamer Ankit Panth is excited about what the new decade holds for gaming. “Graphics are getting better, storylines are improving and with virtual reality picking up slowly, I think it is only going to get better in the future. As a gamer, if I don’t like the graphics, the storyline or the feel of the game, I wouldn’t play it. A game should make you believe that you are in it and that’s what makes it worth playing,” he says.(inputs from gamers, Ankith Panth, Kiran Noojibail, Saransh Jain, Vishal Rangwani, Aakash More)",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74266221,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-175641/74266221.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/are-you-ready-to-play-with-keanu-reeves/articleshow/74266221.cms
6,['24/02/2020'],Sandalwood’s problem of aplenty: Too many films scramble for screen space,"Did you know: Number of hits in Sandalwood is often less than 5-10 % of the total number of films released in a year?February can easily be dubbed the death month for the Kannada film industry. With only one Friday left in the month and at least nine films releasing every week, an average of 40 movies lined up for theatre halls in just 29 days. In effect, Kannada film audiences had more than a film a day as an option to see. This trend, say those in the know, is only a continuation of what’s been happening in Sandalwood in the past few years, what with over 200 films releasing annually. But what is pushing this trend? At a recent event, actor Jaggesh pointed out that the industry banks on an audience of seven crore Kannadigas, while the ground reality is that a measly 4 lakh of them actually watch Kannada films on the big screen. Add to this the fact that Kannada films have to battle hard for screens in a market peppered liberally with movies from other languages, and the stark reality of the fate of these multiple releases hits home.In a recent post on social media, director Chaitanya KM wrote, “Here’s what has happened to Kannada cinema. We should celebrate it instead of regretting. In the last few weeks, a whole bunch of good films are in the theatres, struggling for space. You have Love Mocktail, Dia, Malgudi Days, Gentleman, and many more. All good films, waiting for an audience. My film Aadyaa released with Popcorn Monkey Tiger, Shivaji Surathkal and a bunch of others. Some promoted themselves well, others have fallen short. But all of us have done it because we love cinema. It is up to the audience to make us all win. Just go watch our films in the theatre. Don’t wait for it to come on TV or digital platforms. Filmmakers can’t make a film work. Audiences can.”In the present scenario, the ideal way out would be to have a cut-off for the number of releases in a week. But who is to decide which film gets to make it to the theatres? Veteran movie distributor and producer, Jayanna , says, “The problem with Sandalwood is that we do not have that one authoritative figure who can push for discipline in this process. Our best bet then is to have a few senior members get together and frame guidelines to stop situations like these when more than 10 films release in a single week. The regulations should come from our end. If you look at the break up of releases across Karnataka , new films do not get halls in a lot of centres barring Bengaluru. And when they do get halls, they have no audience. In the end, producers, exhibitors and distributors face the brunt of this surplus.”Producer and distributor Karthik Gowda explains that a regulatory board to control the number of release may not work. “This was tried and tested in Tamil Nadu and it did not work. Moreover, if film bodies like the Karntaka Film Chamber of Commerce intervene, filmmakers can drag them to court to release their films. The onus lies in the hands of the filmmakers themselves to solve this. Hopefully, genuine filmmakers will understand that they made a mistake by hurrying into a release date with their films and will plan their next ventures better,” he says.The Kannada industry has always taken pride in celebrating landmark theatrical runs like 25-day, 50-day and 100-days. But distributors point out that the shelf lives of films are a lot lesser now. “One needs to score within the first week itself. Also, the audience ends up thinking that when so many films release in the same week, they must all be bad and are just pushing for a theatrical outing to be able to sell digital rights. Take the case of a film like Dia, it took a few days to attract audiences. This despite the fact that the director had earlier made a big hit film like 6-5=2. It required many stars to come out and speak in support of the film. Similar was the case of Love Mocktail. Had it released with fewer films in competition, it might have done even better,” says Karthik, who adds, “Take, for instance, the case of single screens in a predominantly Kannada city like Shivamogga not playing Kannada films. I do not blame the exhibitors because they are also businessmen and will pick their best bet among the 12-odd films across languages.”Films released2019 — 2052018 — 2352017 — 1872016 — 174Films for prestigeOften, when a producer outside of hardcore Gandhinagar releases his film, he only targets his homemarket, often settling for just one or two screens with long theatrical outings.Reasons for the rushed release* Producers without any filmi knowledge* Fear of big star films* Films made on frugal budgets released for subsidy* OTT/dubbing/TV sales being more important over theatrical collectionsMultiplexes do co-operateThere is a rule that each multiplex chain has to give a local language film a show in at least oneproperty. They do adhere to this rule, but by bending it a bit and giving the films that do not have much buzz a show in a miniplex or a hall at a distant location.Advance blocking of screensThere are filmmakers who pay advance rent to single screens to keep screening their films irrespective of the ticket sales in their bid to be able to boast long theatrical runs.

8,['24/02/2020'],Lal Bagh’s new wall art puts the spotlight on animal cruelty,"This story is from February 24, 2020

On Friday afternoon, a bunch of 60-odd youngsters were very busy doing up the walls of the Lal Bagh Botanical Garden. At first, it seemed that the walls were getting an uplift in shades of blue, yellow and more. But as it turned out, there was far more to this painting drive, than just beautifying this stretch of the wall. Organised by an NGO that works against animal cruelty and promotes veganism and environment preservation — the drive saw the 60 volunteers , most of who were college students, put their ideas about animal cruelty into images for all to see.

Ankit Puri, founder of the organisation and a student at Christ (deemed-to-be) University, said, “This is the second wall painting drive that we have taken up. The first one was in Jayanagar. With an event like this, we want to create awareness about animal cruelty, veganism and animal rights. We feel that art and pictures have a greater impact on people. In fact, there were many passersby, who stopped and asked us about the paintings and even joined us.”

The paintings urged people to adopt dogs instead of buying them. One of the volunteers, Dhanushree H, a student of Mount Carmel College , says, “As an individual, I refrain from buying leather products and even urge my friends to do so. To be a part of this painting drive feels nice, because you meet like-minded people, who have similar beliefs, and brings together artists.” Ankit adds, “In addition to promoting animal rights, we also feel that paintings like this beautifies the city.”

The efforts, however, have been time consuming. “We have to juggle between our college life and work related to the organisation. For this event too, we had to get the required permissions for this particular space. We were told that the wall (Lal Bagh) was for advertising

purpose to generate revenue, but after a lot of persuasion, we were allotted a small part of the wall to do our work.” says Ankit.

NAGPUR: National Basketball Association (NBA), the organizers of World Best Basketball League in America, will for the third time conduct its comprehensive youth basketball initiative for three days in the city Tuesday.

The grass-root basketball initiative is for school going boys and girls is a part of the Reliance Foundation Jr NBA program. The Nagpur District Basketball Association (NDBA) will provide all the local support.

In the opening day of the three day event, the American association will make the school students in both the boys and girls category work out in a Skills Challenge at the twin courts of Nagpur University at Ravi Nagar on Tuesday. Players in three age categories above 10 years will be eligible to participate in the event which is free for all the schools.

The skills challenge will be conducted by International Jr NBA Coach Marko Lepovic of the US. Lepovic is an accomplished coach who has been involved in training in three countries - Serbia, Norway, and the United States.

On February 26 and 27, a two-day inter-school basketball championship for U-14 boys and girls will be organized. Last year the NBA selected two city cagers - Shomira Bidaye and Dhara Phate - to represent the country in the Jr NBA World Championship at Florida.

Santi Cazorla. (Getty Images)

CHENNAI: Amidst talks of Liverpool 's invincibility and Manchester City 's two-year ban from UEFA competitions, a team which has managed a bit of a turnaround of their own in the English Premier League is Arsenal . The Gunners might be 10th in the table currently, six points behind Tottenham Hotspur in fifth, but they have stayed unbeaten in 2020 so far in their nine matches.

While there might still be plenty of room for improvement, Arsenal have looked more resolute under coach Mikel Arteta and a former Gunner and current Villarreal midfielder Santi Cazorla feels that the former champions are headed in the right direction. ""Arteta deserves to be the boss. He was always a leader in the dressing room. It was the right decision to put him in as the manager. It made sense and he has everything you need for the job. I hope he takes Arsenal up the table,"" Cazorla, who had won two FA Cups playing alongside Arteta at Arsenal, told TOI in an interaction facilitated by La Liga.

The 35-year-old was forced to leave Arsenal after a stint of six years in 2018 following a recurrent ankle injury. But his career witnessed a renaissance of sorts since he rejoined his old club Villarreal. Cazorla has scored 12 goals and six assists for Villarreal so far this season and his performance has even earned him a recall into the Spain team.

With Euros starting in June, Cazorla is expected to retain his place in the side and play a crucial role in the midfield. However, the Spaniard doesn't want to read too much into Spain's chances in the tournament. ""We are one of the favourites but it won't be easy for us. Spanish football is undergoing a transition. There is a new generation of footballers and we need to give them time. We have to trust them and have faith in their abilities. It's going to be tough for us to win the Euros. But we won't give up easily. I hope to be fit and ready whenever the coach wants me,"" Cazorla said.

The midfielder, though, is presently focused on the current job at hand - to help Villarreal qualify for the Champions League. The Yellow Submarines are sixth with 38 points from 24 games and can enter the top-four if they manage to beat Atletico Madrid. ""The secret of our performance is that we play as a group. Our aim is to be in Champions League and we have to beat top teams if we want to go there. But it won't be easy. Atletico have beaten Liverpool, which has only lost twice this season. So we have to play an organised team game to beat them,"" he said.

MIAMI: US fourth seed Reilly Opelka rallied to defeat Canadian second seed Milos Raonic 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 Sunday to reach the ATP Delray Beach Open final.

The 22-year-old American, whose lone ATP title came at last year's New York Open, will play for the title later Sunday at the rain-hit Florida venue against Japan's 63rd-ranked Yoshihito Nishioka .

Opelka beat Nishioka 6-4, 6-4 last week in the second round at New York in their only prior meeting.

In a match postponed by rain from Saturday night, Raonic took the lone break of the first set and battled into a second-set tie-breaker, which Opelka led 5-0 before the Canadian roared back with six points in a row.

Opelka blasted his 15th ace to save match point, then watched Raonic send two forehands beyond the baseline to force a third set.

Raonic send a backhand wide to surrender a break in the seventh game of the final set and Opelka blitzed him in the last game to advance after two hours and seven minutes.

Nishioka, who won his only prior ATP final in 2018 at Shenzhen, ousted French sixth seed Ugo Humbert 1-6, 6-4, 6-0 on Saturday before the rain.

The 24-year-old is projected to crack the ATP's top 50 for the first time in Monday's rankings.

17,['24/02/2020'],Arsenal revival gathers pace as Aubameyang downs Everton,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang applauds fans after the match. (Reuters Photo).

LONDON: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang boosted Arsenal 's hopes of gate-crashing the race to reach the Champions League as his double clinched a 3-2 win against Everton on Sunday.

For much of a troubled season Arsenal have been written off as also-rans in the battle to qualify for Europe's elite club competition.

But, recovering from the wreckage of the Unai Emery era, their revival under Mikel Arteta is gathering pace.

Rocked by Dominic Calvert-Lewin 's first-minute goal at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal equalised through Eddie Nketiah and took the lead thanks to Aubameyang.

Richarlison levelled for Everton to cap a dramatic first half, but Gabon striker Aubameyang had the final word seconds after the break.

Arsenal climbed above Everton into ninth place and sit four points behind fifth-placed Manchester United .

With second-placed Manchester City banned from European competitions for the next two years, as it stands finishing fifth could secure Champions League action pending the result of City's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

There is growing belief at Arsenal that they could take advantage of the punishment for Arteta's former club.

The Gunners are now unbeaten in their last 10 games in all competitions, including seven without defeat in the league after a second successive victory.

Everton must recover quickly to avoid their own European hopes being dashed after a first defeat in six league games.

Carlo Ancelotti's side were hoping for a statement victory and they made the perfect start after 49 seconds.

Gylfi Sigurdsson's inswinging free-kick was met with a misjudged attempt to head clear from David Luiz , who only succeeded in glancing the ball up on the air off his shoulder.

Calvert-Lewin's reaction was inspired as he threw himself into a spectacular overhead kick from six yards out that left Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno rooted to the spot.

It was the 22-year-old's seventh league goal in his last nine games.

Already reeling from their limp start, Arsenal were dealt another blow when left-back Sead Kolasinac was forced off with his right arm in a sling after an aerial collision with Djibril Sidibe.

There was a saving grace to the substitution as Bukayo Saka replaced Kolasinac and made an instant impact.

Saka is only 18 but the Arsenal youth academy graduate already has a reputation for producing devastating crosses and he conjured another to lay on the 27th-minute equaliser.

Surging onto Granit Xhaka's pass, Saka whipped a pin-point cross into the six-yard box where the 20-year-old Nketiah got behind Yerry Mina to cushion a volley past Pickford.

Before their latest meeting, Arsenal had scored 327 top-flight goals against Everton, more than any other opponent has scored against another in the highest tier of English football.

They took that tally to 329 with a classic counter-attack in the 33rd minute.

For all Luiz's faults as a defender, the Brazilian can unfurl a pretty pass and his superb through ball sent Aubameyang clear of Sidibe to guide a clinical finish into the far corner.

Richarlison was fortunate to earn just a yellow card for a rash lunge that sent Dani Ceballos flying.

And Arsenal were left to rue that decision as Richarlison bagged his 12th goal of the season in first-half stoppage-time.

When Sigurdsson's scuffed shot bounced high into the penalty area, the Gunners defence stood flat-footed and Mina headed on for Richarlison to poke home from close range.

Arsenal responded emphatically, emulating Everton's fast start to the first half with a goal 26 seconds after the interval.

Nicolas Pepe curled in an inviting cross and Aubameyang got clear of the hapless Sidibe to guide a glancing header past Pickford for his 19th goal of the season.

Leno preserved Arsenal's victory with a fine save from Calvert-Lewin, who also headed inches wide in a tense finale.

19,['24/02/2020'],US Deal with Taliban: Trump express optimism for US peace deal with Taliban,"This story is from February 24, 2020

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Sunday he's ready to sign a peace deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan if a temporary truce holds in America 's longest war. ""Time to come home,'' he said.

""They want to stop. You know, they've been fighting a long time. They're tough people. We're tough people,"" Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to India. ""But after 19 years, that's a long time.""

The two sides earlier this month announced the truce, which took effect last Friday and set the stage for a broader deal aimed at ending 18 years of war in Afghanistan and bringing U.S. troops home.

If the truce proves a success, it will be followed by the signing of the peace accord on Saturday, wrapping up the United States' longest-running conflict and fulfilling one of Trump's chief campaign promises.

``We think they want to make a deal. We want to make a deal. I think it's going to work out. We'll see,'' Trump said.

For the Taliban, the successful completion of the truce and Afghanistan peace talks would give the militants a shot at international legitimacy, which they lacked at the time they ran the country and gave Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida associates safe haven.

U.S. officials have noted the possibility that ``spoilers'' uninterested in peace talks could disrupt the truce. Determining who is responsible for potential attacks during the seven days will therefore be critical.

On Sunday, Trump expressed cautious optimism about reaching a peace deal.

``You know we have a certain period of nonviolence. It's been holding up, it's a day and a half so we'll see what happens. But people want to make a deal, and I think the Taliban wants to make a deal too, they're tired of fighting.''

There are more than 12,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

20,['24/02/2020'],"As stories get real, supporting actors grab the spotlight","Today, the focus of a film has slowly moved from the heroics of the leading actors to the soul of the story. With more films exploring subjects that mirror social realities, writers and filmmakers have given birth to a clique of actors who are not called the ‘lead’ in the credits, but nonetheless, shoulder the film like pillars with their stand-out performances. Be it Aparshakti Khurana (Dangal, Stree, Patni Patni Aur Woh, and Luka Chuppi), Abhishek Bannerjee (Stree, Dream Girl and Bala), Seema Pahwa (Bareilly Ki Barfi, Shubh Mangal Saavdhan , Bala), Pankaj Tripathi (Stree, Bareilly Ki Barfi and Newton), Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta (Badhaai Ho and Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan), or Siddhant Chaturvedi and Amruta Subhash, who won the awards for the Best Actor in Supporting Role — Male and Female for Gully Boy (2019), the list is long. BT spoke to some of these talents, including writers and directors, about the change in the way supporting roles are now viewed by the industry and the audience.: It’s not just a golden period for actors, but also for writers and directors because there’s room to experiment since all kinds of stories are being consumed by people. After Badhaai Ho worked at the box office, people were encouraged to try something new with their narratives. Actors my age started getting roles that fitted them and were extremely important to the story. With so many new avenues and so many different roles, this is the best time to bean actor.: A few years ago, when filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap and Rajkumar Gupta started seeking new actors for crucial parts, this profession (casting director) also got its due share of respect. After films like Gangs of Wasseypur, No One Killed Jessica, Omkara and Haider, people realised that we are not mere coordinators. As an actor, I continued to audition, though mera selection hota hi nahi tha. I was rejected for films like Ghanchakkar, but working in short films got me noticed. Finally, Ajji and Stree made people believe that I can act. For changes like these, we should also credit producers who hire actors through auditions.There was a time when actors like me didn’t have work for years. Things changed with Aankhon Dekhi. Today, even the role of a mother is not stereotypical. Hum mein se kuch logon ne himmat ki kuch alag karne ki, aur aaj sab ko himmat aa gayi hai. Ab character actors ke saath woh dhokha nahi hota jo kabhi hota tha. There was a time when there were few stories about the aam aadmi; escapism ruled. Gradually, realism took over. Today, the audience is younger and far more exposed to a world of content.There’s no need to underline kaun kis division ka actor hai. Everyone plays a character in a film, including the hero. It’s good that our audience has evolved and understands this well. Badlaav darasal unke andar aaya hai. Today, as discerning consumers, they can appreciate a nuanced performance, a great story and technical brilliance.A hero and heroine don’t complete a story. Dost, dushman, rishtedaar — every aspect is important, and the stories being written today reflect that very tactfully. With great writing, every actor gets his tools out. Mulk and Article 15 had enough for each actor to do and the narrative didn’t centre around one man or woman.: Apart from the writing, a lot depends on a film’s edit. In Badhaai Ho’s (Amit directed it) case, we had two couples and the story was about the senior couple getting pregnant at an advanced age. Had we not been careful with the edit, we would not have arrived at an honest narrative. The focus could have easily shifted to Sanya (Malhotra) and Ayushmann’s love story. But with a set of secure actors like the ones I had, I knew that we could say what we wanted to, without any compromises.The credit for this should go to writers who curate strong and well-etched parts, even for the supporting cast. Directors are crucial in the process, too; they captain the ship. Everyone wants to do something unique and that is forcing them to think differently. I should also thank leading actors like Ayushmann Khurrana , who are choosing films where supporting actors have a lot to do.: Aparshakti’s character was crucial in Luka Chuppi; he’s the buddy who is always shadowing you. Pankajji’s character is the sort of tharki jo aapko lagbhag har mohalle mein milega. Stories don’t move on their own; characters take them forward, and so, writing them with care is important. In life, everyone is a hero in their story, and they have strong supporting actors who take their narrative forward, and the same holds true in films, too.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74266352,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-87601/74266352.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/as-stories-get-real-supporting-actors-grab-the-spotlight/articleshow/74266354.cms

Religion does not divide anyone… We celebrate Diwali, Christmas, Eid all together, and what a beautiful thing that is, that we can stay together, respect each other’s beliefs, and be in harmony and progress with each other.If we look into the depth of religions and try to understand their origin, every religion in India propagates only one idea — peace, unity and humanity. It is only the flawed idea of extremists who try to make you believe that religion divides people. That’s why I think that all the religions in India only stand for unity.Coming from a country like India, a secular state, I would definitely say that religion unifies us.

In an interview with BT, she spoke her fitness goals, focusing on the game and how she draws inspiration from her child to achieve her dreams. Excerpts:The biggest inspiration was to get back to playing competitive tennis. But that wasn’t the only reason I lost weight. I needed to regain my strength and fitness levels. I have always believed in being healthy, and post pregnancy, I did not feel healthy anymore. It was never about my weight, but how I felt. I wasn’t feeling good inside and that was the reason I embarked on this journey. I started it a few months after my son was born.Yes, the process was tough. After you give birth, you have to start from scratch. Being an athlete, I am used to being fit and strong, and I had taken my fitness for granted. I got a reality check when I got on to the treadmill and found out that I could not walk for more than three minutes. The first two months were extremely tough because I was not allowed to do core exercises and could only do cardio. I did that for two-and-a-half hours every day and followed a strict diet. Since I was breastfeeding at that time, it was more challenging. After I had lost 15-17 kilos, I moved on to weights and my core recovered. I did not cheat on my diet for four months. I stopped consuming dairy products, gluten, processed sugar and red meat. I would eat spinach, fish, eggs, chicken and continued to consume carbs. Whoever said that carbs are your enemy, is not right; they can be your friends, too. The initial days were tough, and often, I did not want to follow my diet or go to the gym and do cardio as it was boring. However, I am stubborn and disciplined, too, and so, I was able to curb the temptation to cheat on my diet. But the toughest thing was to keep off chai (laughs!). I love my chai, and I missed it a lot for four months. Since you have to look at the bigger picture and keep an eye on your goal, all the cravings went away after the initial few weeks.I feel anything is possible if you put your mind and heart to it. Being a mom is one of the most satisfying experiences of your life. Moms don’t take a break; I have learnt that from my mother. I also feel that just because you have a child, it does not mean that you can’t follow your dreams. If a woman wants to pursue her professional goals, it does not make her a bad person or a bad mother. In fact, just like me, all sportswomen should draw inspiration from their children to achieve more in life; you can have it all.I think trolls are the biggest faceless cowards sitting behind desktops. I feel sorry for them, but mostly, I laugh at them. How can you continuously keep swearing and abusing people who you have never met? If you observe a celeb’s social media account, you will find that a certain section constantly hates them, and I can only laugh at it because it’s quite entertaining. I am amazed at how they find the time to vent such strong feelings towards anyone. Having said that, I do take occasional breaks from social media as it can get toxic, and it was no different at that point, too (during the 2019 World Cup).My son is learning to walk and talk now. He is at that age when he is learning new things every day, and that becomes extremely entertaining for everyone in the house. Shoaib and I often spend time at home, because otherwise, we are constantly travelling. Whenever we are in Dubai, we enjoy walking and going to the parks because Izhaan is a social baby. Being a mother has made me selfless. I cannot express my love for him in words. The only challenge I face with him sometimes, is putting him to sleep at night. Since I am an athlete, I feel sleep is important, but if he is awake, then I am awake, too. Without my husband, parents, sister and my entire team’s support, I would not have been able to go back to my training and do what I love. As they say, it takes a village to raise a child.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74266590,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-54611/74266590.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/fitness/sania-mirza-i-got-a-reality-check-about-my-fitness-when-i-got-on-the-treadmill/articleshow/74266590.cms

But when it comes to that one person who they can fall back on for ironing out every little crease in their work flow, every filmmaker has their own secret weapon — their very own Jeeves, who knows everything from how to brew the perfect cup of coffee to finding a DOP in the dead of the night. Read on...‘Sekhar is an honest and dedicated person’I just can’t function without my production controller Sekhar Chakraborty . He is a one-man army. Sekhar gives me inputs on my scripts, location and casting as well. I like his honesty. He is always careful so that we don’t exceed our budget. He knows exactly when to book studios for dubbing or to fetch my actors to the set. There have been several occasions when he has handled problems on his own because he never wanted the film to suffer. I haven’t seen a more dedicated person like him.‘Soumik has always been my go-to Man’Be it on the set or off it, cinematographer Soumik Haldar is my constant companion when I am working on a project. From conceptualisation till the time our film reaches edit table, Soumik is my go-to person. We gel well and think alike. We are on the same wavelength on the sets. What I like about Soumik is that he keeps his personal style aside and gives importance to the story and script. However, there are times when we think differently. But we argue with logic. After all, both of us have the same objective — to make a story come alive on screen.‘Ivy was in total control on sets’Ivy Chatterjee, my former associate director and production supervisor, is one person I really miss on the sets. We worked together in more than six projects. Be it pre-production, managing the cast or planning shoot schedules, she was in total control of everything. There are certain rules one has to follow on my sets, like no one can ask me a question while I am checking the first scene on the monitor, nobody can smoke or use a mobile phone either. Ivy used to take care of everything. Now, Apurba Bose has been appointed in her place and though she is a trainee, she is doing well.‘Prasenjit would boost my morale’While I was the good cop on the sets, Prasenjit Biswas, my former associate director and friend, was the bad cop. We started off together in 2006 with Aamra. He used to boost my morale constantly. He taught me to not let success go to my head. That’s how our working association was — lots of love and debates. He worked with me in over a dozen films, till Ghare & Baire in 2017, after which I forced him to take time off and concentrate on filmmaking. Even now, after I finish a new script, I send him the first draft for his opinion.‘Kanchan always treats our projects as his own’Kanchan Bhattacharya has been working with us since 2000. He is the production guy, without whom we simply cannot function. I like his positive attitude and the way he manages everything. It is because of him I can totally focus on my work. Kanchan has been a part of this team through thick and thin and he can read our moods. The paan with kancha supari that he gets from home is my only addiction. He treats our projects as his own.

26,['24/02/2020'],"Trump India visit 2020: Not just bilateral, regional &amp; global issues also on Modi-Trump platter","This story is from February 24, 2020

NEW DELHI: The India-US strategic partnership will see the two countries focusing on four key objectives this week — peace and prosperity in the Indian Ocean, counter-terrorism, free and fair trade, and energy. President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi will also consider ways to promote regional connectivity based on transparency, responsible debt practices and, importantly for India, without violating sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Beyond attempts to weed out irritants in bilateral ties, regional and international cooperation will be an important focus area for Trump and Modi when they meet on Tuesday. While the US is expected to encourage India to further promote stability and security in Afghanistan, the Indian side will seek an unambiguous condemnation of cross-border terrorism so as to ensure Pakistan doesn't feel further emboldened at a time it is openly claiming credit for the Afghan peace deal.

Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was quoted as having said on Saturday that the peace deal between the US and Afghanistan was a “historic breakthrough’’ and that it would be signed in the presence of Pakistan “because it was impossible for the deal to come through without our efforts’’.

The two countries had declared in 2015, after the Modi-Obama summit, that the India-US partnership could turn into a defining counter-terrorism relationship for the 21st century by deepening collaboration to combat the full spectrum of terrorist threats and “keep their respective homelands and citizens safe from attacks’’. Focusing on cross-border terrorism, the 2015 joint statement had named groups like LeT and JeM and also called on Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of Mumbai attacks to justice.

The India-US joint statement after Modi’s summit with Trump two years later was even more unequivocal in addressing India’s concerns on cross-border terrorism. Modi and Trump then called on Pakistan to ensure that its territory was not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries. They also called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of Mumbai, Pathankot and other “cross-border terrorist attacks’’ perpetrated by Pakistan-based groups.

Whether or not the condemnation of terrorism targeted at India is as unambiguous as in the previous two joint statements will be one of the things to watch out for when the two leaders meet on Tuesday.

Modi and Trump are also expected to take stock of efforts in the recent past announced to prevent terrorist travel and to disrupt global recruitment efforts by expanding intelligence sharing and “operational-level counter-terrorism cooperation’’. The two countries are already working together for exchange of information on known and suspected terrorists for travel screening.

As the joint statement said on the last occasion, India and the US are looking to further strengthen exchange of information on plans, movements and linkages of terrorist groups and their leaders, as well as on raising and moving of funds by terrorist groups.

27,['24/02/2020'],Coronavirus: China and India spar over Coronavirus curbs,"NEW DELHI: In what seemed like a tit for tat, China on Sunday asked Indian authorities to not block export of China’s “much-needed items” required to control the Coronavirus epidemic. The Chinese embassy here also called upon India to follow WHO which, it said, had opposed trade and travel restrictions and resumption of normal trade and personnel exchanges as soon as possible.India responded almost immediately with MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar saying the precautions taken by India were in accordance with the WHO’s advisory about the outbreak of coronavirus infection, which was a global public health emergency.The Chinese embassy’s statement, apparently in response to a media query about a ban on export of medical and protective gear by India affecting relief efforts, came a day after India accused Beijing of delaying approval for a relief flight it wants to operate to Wuhan and back. The C-17 military transport aircraft will also evacuate about 100 remaining Indians from Wuhan.The Indian official said some restrictions had been imposed on export of certain medical equipment in view of the fact that these items were in short supply here too. “Just like any other country, India with a billion-plus population has the responsibility to take the necessary measures to combat the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak, which, if not properly managed, can become a global risk,” Kumar said, adding that responding to the needs of “our Chinese friends’’, India had allowed a one-time exemption for export of some items which had been restricted for export.“Further, PM Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping and offered assistance in the hour of need. In a humanitarian gesture of medical relief, a gift reflecting the solidarity of the people of India with the people of China, is expected to be delivered to Wuhan by a special flight. We have also called upon the Chinese authorities to allow Indian citizens and those of our neighbouring countries to return by the same flight. We hope that they will give it positive consideration,’’ he said.“It is hoped that the Indian side could review the epidemic situation in an objective, rational and calm manner, handle China’s much-needed items in a cooperative and constructive way, and resume normal personnel exchanges and trade between our two countries as soon as possible,’’ Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong had earlier said.Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong had made similar remarks earlier this week. However, while Sun had urged India to act in “humanitarian spirit’’, the fresh statement called upon India to act in a cooperative and constructive manner on China’s need for medical equipment.Indian officials said the government had earlier this month removed the ban on export of certain types of protective gear like gloves and masks. They also said the flight, still awaiting permission, was itself meant to carry relief supplies for China and in keeping with Modi’s letter to Xi in which he offered assistance to the Chinese government.An angry Indian government on Saturday accused China of deliberately delaying approval even while allowing other countries to evacuate their citizens. The delay, official sources said, had caused great amount of mental stress and anxiety to Indian nationals in Wuhan who were looking to return immediately to India.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74274892,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-247971,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-india-spar-over-corona-curbs/articleshow/74274740.cms

29,['24/02/2020'],"Violence erupts in north-east, south Delhi over CAA, 15 hurt","This story is from February 24, 2020

NEW DELHI: Violence erupted in the Jafrabad area of northeast Delhi on Sunday evening when two groups of anti and pro-CAA protesters came face to face, leading to heavy stone-pelting and vandalising of vehicles and shops in the area. The police and paramilitary forces managed to restore calm by late evening but the area remained tense. Fifteen people, including six policemen and two camerapersons were reported injured.

Jafrabad — which was tense through Sunday as over a thousand men and women had gathered under the Metro station and blocked the main road to protest against the amended citizenship law — erupted when a group of pro-CAA protesters reached the Maujpur-Baburpur Metro station, less than a kilometre from Jafrabad, around 3.30pm. They were demanding that the police remove the barricades. They were led by former MLA Kapil Mishra, who had given a call on twitter for people to reach the spot for holding a demonstration in favour of CAA.

The group assembled at Maujpur chowk, next to Jafrabad, and started shouting slogans. Around 4pm, it came under a volley of stones from the other side. Some people in the group retaliated and in no time it became a free-for-all. Half an hour later, with the situation getting out of control, police had to fire several rounds of tear gas shells and use mild force to disperse the rioters.

Police and paramilitary personnel conducted a flag march in the area and appealed to people to maintain restraint. An FIR of rioting has been registered and the stone-pelters are being identified through video footage.

Similar stone-pelting was reported from Chand Bagh , also in northeast Delhi. South Delhi’s Hauz Rani and Malviya Nagar too witnessed some police action to restrain anti-CAA protesters. Shaheen Bagh, however, stayed calm and the main road remained blocked with the SC-appointed mediators choosing to stay away on Sunday.

The Jafrabad Metro station had been under siege since Saturday night with the main road being blocked by locals to protest against CAA. According to police, tension was simmering in the area since Thursday evening when Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar ‘Ravan’ visited northeast Delhi and addressed the locals, asking them to observe his call for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Sunday.

Over 400 men and women had gathered under the Metro station in Jafrabad around 11pm on Saturday. The police tried to disperse them but could evict just a handful. The gathering started swelling in the early hours of Sunday with people chanting azaadi slogans. After police’s intervention, one of the carriageways going towards Gokulpuri and connecting with Wazirabad and GT Karnal Road, was opened and a rope placed to let two-way traffic pass.

In the morning, the protesters had also erected a stage using “chaukis” and tables but police swiftly removed them. By 10am, heavy police force and paramilitary forces were moved into the area. However, by Sunday noon, the protest had spread to adjacent localities in northeast Delhi like Khureji, Maujpur and Chand Bagh. The stone-pelting at Chand Bagh was contained quickly by elders.

Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Eastern Range) said: “The situation is under control now but many people are on the street. We are continuously speaking to the local leaders so that peace prevails in the area.”

The clashes, which broke out around 4pm, continued intermittently till 5pm, when the police conducted a flag march and created a buffer zone between the two protesting groups, deploying more than 800 personnel to prevent contact.

Arvind Maurya, who works as a tailor near Maujpur Chowk, said that as soon as the stone-pelting began, he and two others at the store rushed towards the residential lanes near Sabzi Mandi Chowk . Maurya said there was stone-pelting in the narrow lanes as well with people rushing indoors for cover. “I saw a couple of people who were hurt and bleeding. People were offering help, using Dettol and cotton. We too took refuge inside and came out only after 6 pm to find out what had transpired,” said Maurya.

“We have been asking them to move since last night but they have refused,” said the deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya. “We are also in touch with their religious leaders and aman committee members to reach a possible solution.”

Though the stone-pelting had stopped by around 5.30pm, provocative chants continued near the Maujpur-Babarpur Metro station from both sides. During this, the anti-CAA protesters towards the Jafrabad side had used ropes to block one side of the road for preventing clashes from breaking out.

Mohammad Zakir, one such local stationed there, said both groups came face to face on the Jafrabad main road, with the pro-CAA group allegedly raising chants that were inflammatory. “The stone-pelting began and people from both sides became extremely angry. We tried to clear the area soon after so that any further incident could be avoided. The women sitting at the Jaffrabad metro station are being protected by men from the area,” said Zakir.

NEW DELHI: Hours after US President Donald Trump ’s departure from India, two other 'guests’ whose presence is certain to raise eyebrows, more so in Washington perhaps, will land in Delhi. The two, who will not officially be hosted by India, are Georgy Muradov and Irina Kiviko , the deputy PM and finance minister respectively of Crimea , which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 leading to sanctions imposed by the US and EU on Russia.

Sources told ToI that the two leaders were not official guests and they were here only for exploring trade and investment opportunities. ``No Indian leader will hold a meeting with them. The visit is not official. It’s exploratory in nature,’’ said a source, while confirming their visit. Both Muradov and Kiviko are Russian nationals.

He added that the timing of their arrival had nothing to do with Trump’s visit. Significantly, Russian Senator and deputy head of the committee for international affairs Andrey Klimov will also visit India next week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has himself in the past himself expressed appreciation for India’s ``restrained and objective’’ position on Crime/ Ukraine. Then NSA Shivshankar Menon had famously said in 2014 that there were legitimate Russian and other interests involved and that India hoped they would be discussed and resolved. The Modi government too has stood by Russia on the issue despite Moscow’s isolation by the West.

The presence of Muradov and Kiviko is unlikely to go unnoticed in the US though. Crimea leader Sergei Aksyonov in 2014 had mysteriously appeared in Delhi in December 2014 after he managed to travel in a plane packed with Russian officials who were accompanying Putin to Delhi for his summit with Modi. India had then clarified that Aksyonov was not a part of Putin’s delegation even though he signed an MoU with Indian businessman.

The State Department was quick to react though, saying the US was troubled that Aksyonov had appeared in India possibly as a part of Putin’s delegation and that it had sought a clarification from India on that.

Sources said the two senior leaders from Crimea might also want to discuss a possible visit by an Indian cultural delegation. Muradov has been a controversial figure for the Americans as he has encouraged Iran to defy US sanctions by using Crimea’s port facilities to export oil. The two leaders are expected to visit Delhi and Mumbai during their two-day stay in India.

33,['24/02/2020'],"In Agra, a bit of awe but little admiration for President Trump","This story is from February 24, 2020

AGRA: Donald Trump means different things to different people. But the most commonly-held opinion among a cross-section of middle-class citizenry in the town of Taj Mahal is that the India visit of the US president is primarily intended to boost his image for the forthcoming polls back home. And that he shouldn’t have offered to mediate on Kashmir .

Those TOI spoke to – professors, shopkeepers, factory owners – do not follow Trump on social media. Their views on the 73-year-old businessman-turned-politician have been largely shaped by Hindi and English newspapers and news on TV.

Mohd Arshad, who teaches sociology in Agra University, reiterates that Trump is trying to project himself as a popular international leader to his domestic constituency. “That’s why he is constantly referring in his campaign speeches to the 6-10 million crowds which he says will line up for him in Ahmedabad,” he says.

Cloth merchant Gagandeep Singh agrees with that view adding that he is also trying to impress NRIs, Gujaratis being prominent among them. To bolster the point, he also points out that the US president is not signing any major trade deal during the two-day tour.

Hundreds of banners have been put up in Agra to welcome Trump. The optics underline the friendship and closeness between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi . One of the banners picturing the two says, “Do mahaan desh, ek bemisaal dosti (Two great nations, one matchless friendship).”

But retired English professor Nirupama Sharma says genuine friendship between two political personalities of different nations is unlikely. “There are no friends or foes in politics. It changes as per needs. Such relationships are transactional,” she says. Arshad too believes there is a coalescing of interests between the two world leaders. “Both share good chemistry. And both have an autocratic style of functioning,” he says.

Sharma also differs with Trump’s America-focussed policies. “I see the world as a global village. You cannot isolate people. I believe in living together, not raising any kind of barrier for other people,” says Sharma, who has discussed the subject extensively with her friends and relatives in the US.

Durgesh Kumar, who sells kids-wear in Bijlighar shopping area, looks at Trump as a businessman always in search of a good deal. “India is a big market and the country offers opportunities for him. Which is why he is also trying to wean India away from Russia,” he says.

Durgesh has issues with Trump offering to mediate on Kashmir. “Kashmir belongs to India. Where’s the need for any mediation?” he says. Dinesh Kumar , who runs a small factory for leather goods, also agrees with that assessment. He feels that Trump wants to dominate India. “He wants us under his thumb,” says Dinesh. “It is probably due to Modi that he is unable to interfere as much as he wants to,” says Durgesh.

What’s undeniable is that Trump has made a major impact on the mindscape of people. They even recall policy decisions pronounced by him several years ago. One of them remembered him imposing travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries in 2017.

Trump may not evoke admiration but being the US president he does evoke awe. Brajmohan Singh, who sells petha for a living, said that it is good news that the most powerful man in the world is visiting India. “We can only expect something positive,” he says.

Several individuals didn’t know much about Trump, except that his impending arrival has spruced up the city and galvanized the local administration to action. Stationary mart owner Kulwinder Kaur laughed while speaking about what Trump had said last week: 6-10 million are likely to turn up for him in Ahmedabad. “But I like the way he keeps saying, ‘Believe me, believe me,’ in his speeches,” she laughs again.

34,['24/02/2020'],PM’s radio message: From aiding artisans to being ‘student for life’,"This story is from February 24, 2020

NEW DELHI: Starting the 62nd edition of his monthly address “Mann Ki Baat” with reference to his recent visit to Hunar Haat at India Gate , PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said one should attend such events to know India, to experience India and contribute in the progress and prosperity of hardworking craftspersons, especially women.

“A few days ago, at a small place at the Hunar Haat in Delhi, I witnessed hues of our country’s diverse expanse, cultures, traditions, cuisines and the warmth of emotions,” the PM said and shared his experience of interactions with some of the artisans.

“Listening to a divyang woman at Hunar Haat was a source of fulfilment. She told me that earlier, she used to sell paintings on the pavement. Her life changed after she connected with Hunar Haat. Today, she is not only self-reliant, she has purchased a house too,” Modi said and urged people to make it a point to visit the event.

He mentioned relishing Bihari delicacy ‘litti chokha’, which he had tweeted after his visit. He also mentioned specialities of other states including idli-dosa, chhole-bhature, daal-baati and khaman-khandvi.

Modi spoke about science, technology, biodiversity and upcoming exams while insisting on fitness, saying a country which was fit would always be hit and urged people to explore adventure sports during vacations.

He narrated stories of courage and strength to convey that 'age and disability' cannot be a hurdle in achieving goals. He gave the examples of 105-year-old Bhagirathi Amma who cleared 'level 4' examination in Kerala recently and 12-year-old girl Kamya Karthikeyan , who scaled Mount Aconcagua, the highest peak of the Andes mountains in South America, which is about 7,000 metres high.

“If we wish to progress in life, we should develop ourselves, if we wish to achieve something in life, the first pre-condition for that is the student within us must never die,” he said.

Modi also talked about Salman of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. Salman, a specially-abled person, set up a slipper manufacturing unit, overcoming all odds. “While Salman himself found it difficult to walk, he decided to manufacture slippers which help others to walk easily,” he said.

Modi said similar determination was manifested by residents of Ajrak village in Kutch , Gujarat. In 2001, after the devastating earthquake, most villagers were migrating from the village. However, one person, Ismail Khatri, decided to stay back and nurture his traditional art form of 'Ajrak print'. The entire village joined in on their traditional handicraft and fused it with contemporary fashion.

Modi hailed the use of a mixture of 10% indigenously produced bio-jet fuel to fly an IAF transport aircraft, saying such efforts would not only help bring down carbon emissions but also reduce the country's dependence on imported crude oil.

“This was the first time that this mix was used in both engines. Not just that, the airport from which this plane took off from Leh is not only one of the highest altitude airports in India but also in the world,” the PM said. He pointed out that the bio-jet fuel was prepared from “non-edible tree-borne oil” and was procured from various tribal areas of India.

35,['24/02/2020'],Uddhav to set up 3-party panel to study NPR issues,"This story is from February 24, 2020

MUMBAI: A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met NCP chief Sharad Pawar to thrash out differences between the allies on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR), Thackeray on Sunday announced the setting up of a three-party panel of ministers which will look at “problems” that could emerge during NPR’s implementation in the state.

“I have made my stand on the issue of CAA very clear and we are still discussing the issue with the allies. Though on the surface there seems to be no problems with NPR, a decision to form a committee with members of the three parties has been taken to take a closer look at the problems that could arise with it,"" said Thackeray on the eve of the budget session, his first full-fledged one in the assembly as CM.

The move to set up a panel is a concession by the CM to his allies who have, in principle, opposed the NPR while he has likened it to the Census. The panel represent the coalition’s intent to present a common front in the house during the session.

On Friday, Thackeray along with his son and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray had met Prime Minister Modi and afterwards Thackeray had said CAA and NPR will be implemented in the state. ""No one needs to fear CAA. The NPR is not going to throw anyone out of the country,"" he said, prompting his allies to caution the need for more circumspection and consultation with allies on the issue.

Subsequently, a meeting was held by Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar to forge a joint strategy on the issues. A senior minister said the government is expecting the opposition to try and exploit differences between the ruling allies on issues like CAA, NPR, Elgar Parishad and Savarkar.

Thackeray on Sunday drew a distinction between the Aghadi’s and the BJP’s handling of sensitive issues saying Maharashtra has seen several anti-CAA protests but no riots or law and order problems. ""In Delhi, where the police is under the Centre, a mob enters JNU and assaults students. In my opinion they were no less than terrorists. In UP, there were riots and police action on anti-CAA protestors,"" he said.

Regarding the Elgar Parishad case, Thackeray said he did not hand it over to the NIA, it was the Centre using powers vested with it which transferred the case to the central agency. ""There is no question of me handing over the case to NIA. We are upset with the manner in which it was taken away. It looked like they questioned the competency of the state investigating agency. We are upset about it and have conveyed the same to the Centre,"" said Thackeray.

Asked why the BJP, his ally in the previous government, boycott the customary tea party on the eve of the session, he said the party was only criticising him for the sake of it and that a capable opposition must also learn to appreciate. ""I would like to tell them that our government has stabilised and taken many decisions and I think they cannot digest the fact that people are very happy with our government,"" said Thackeray.

The BJP has demanded a welcome motion to acknowledge the contribution of Veer Savarkar during the budget session. Thackeray said they would decide on it once the sessions begin. ""Savarkar and Hindutva is not BJP's property,"" said Thackeray.

36,['24/02/2020'],AGR Dues: Finance ministry against penalty relief for telecom cos,"(Representative image)

'Telecom should not be monopoly or duopoly'

NEW DELHI: The finance ministry on Sunday objected to deferring or waiving a part of interest and penalty for the telecom industry hit by the Supreme Court’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) burden, effectively blocking a reprieve for the beleaguered mobile operators.At a specially-convened meeting in the telecom department headquarters, finance ministry officials said any concession on payment of penalty would “set a wrong precedent and lead to similar demands” from other sectors, sources told TOI. A full meeting of the multi-ministry digital communications commission is likely on Monday.The government is working overtime to sort out the mess as telecom companies have time till March 17 to clear the dues. The order of the top court has asked the companies to pay Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the DoT, and this is in lieu of previous licence fee and spectrum usage charges dues, apart from the interest and penalty. A large chunk of the demand is in the form of interest and penalty. For example, of the total licence fee dues of Rs 92,641 crore, only Rs 22,589 crore is the principal. Besides this, telecom companies owe Rs 55,054 crore in spectrum usage charge (SUC) dues.At Sunday’s meeting, there was unanimity that “all efforts need to be taken to save the existing companies” – which, if done, will provide a much-needed relief to Vodafone Idea that is on the brink.“There should not be a monopoly, or even a duopoly, in the sector,” a top government source told TOI.Vodafone Idea, which needs to pay Rs 53,000 crore in past dues, has paid only Rs 2,500 crore so far, while Airtel is required to clear Rs 35,000 crore (Rs 10,000 crore paid) and Tata group Rs 14,000 crore (paid Rs 2,197 crore). The discussions, led by telecom secretary Anshu Prakash , were attended by top officials from the finance and commerce and industry ministries as well as Niti Aayog. Sources said Prakash made a detailed presentation on the options on the table.One of the proposals was to offer soft loans to companies to help them tide over an immediate cash crunch and clear the AGR-related dues. But government authorities were split on the modalities.“However, it was mentioned that any such credit window should not be given through the telecom department, since it is also the receiver of the dues. Thus, it was proposed that public sector banks or other financial institutions or instruments can be used to provide emergency credit,” a source said.The government is worried that closure of any company may create panic in the Indian telecom market and disrupt the ambitious Digital India programme. Also, the upcoming 5G auctions look set to be hit hard due to the existing financial crisis that the industry is facing. While Airtel chief Sunil Mittal has said that his “company is safe, and was never unsafe”, Vodafone Idea has made it clear that it will not be able to survive without a government bailout.Vodafone Idea Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has already met finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , where he has spoken about the need for a relief package.Only Reliance Jio, the country’s biggest mobile operator, is safe from the financial mess as its past dues were only to the tune of Rs 200 crore that it has already cleared.The Supreme Court’s AGR judgment was given on October 24, and had originally ordered the companies to pay the amount by Jan 23 (in three months). However, after the telecom department gave them a relaxation in this, the court expressed unhappiness over the issue, and asked the government to collect the money immediately.If the government is not able to collect the full amount, it will have no option but to invoke the bank guarantees submitted by the companies. And if this is also insufficient to collect the dues, then in “extreme cases”, the telecom department may cancel the mobile licence of the companies.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74275048,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35906,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finance-ministry-against-penalty-relief-for-telecom-cos/articleshow/74275047.cms

NEW DELHI: Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury ’s decision to boycott the President’s banquet for US President Donald Trump has triggered questions if his counterpart in Rajya Sabha too will follow suit.

Congress sources said leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad was likely to attend the dinner.

Chowdhury has slammed the Modi government for not inviting Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to a meeting with Trump, saying it had reduced the foreign dignitary’s visit to a BJP function. His claim of BJP having slighted Sonia appeared to turn the party’s presence at the banquet into a tricky issue. According to a report, Azad ducked queries on the subject after a function in Mumbai.

But not all in Congress appeared comfortable with the idea of a boycott as it “involves diplomacy”. Till Chowdhury’s announcement, Congress had appeared set to attend the banquet through its two members. Party spokesman Anand Sharma said, “In the past, the Centre always arranged meetings of foreign heads of government with opposition leaders as foreign policy is bipartisan. This government has ended it.”

IMPHAL: The political science paper of the Class XII state board examinations in Manipur has become a political football, thanks to two questions — “Draw the election symbol of Bharatiya Janata Party” and “Examine any four negative traits of Nehru’s approach to nation building”.

Opposition parties on Saturday accused the Council of Higher Secondary Education, Manipur, for trying to promote BJP and encourage Nehru-bashing. PCC spokesperson Kh Joykishan said the questions were part of an attempt to instil a certain political mindset among students . Council chairman L Mahendra Singh claimed neither question was out of the syllabus.

State BJP general secretary N Nimbus Singh said it was “relevant” to ask students about the “negative traits of Nehru’s approach to nation building” because he was the country’s first PM.

Representative image

PATNA: Around 40,000 teachers of government-run secondary and higher secondary schools have decided to go on indefinite strike from February 25, Bihar Secondary Schoolteachers’ Association (BSSTA) president and MLC Kedarnath Pandey said on Sunday.

Addressing media persons at BSSTA office here, Pandey said the teachers would not back off from agitation despite the warnings issued by the state government. “We are not scared of education department’s threat of strict action against agitating teachers for not joining the evaluation duty from February 26,” he said.

Pandey said the association had already written to the state government about the indefinite strike. “The Constitution has granted us the right to protest and no one can snatch this right from us. From February 25 onwards, we will boycott the state government’s work and evaluation duty,” he said.

The protests of secondary and higher secondary schoolteachers would start a day after the completion of Matriculation exams of Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). Over 4.5 lakh contractual and some regular primary schoolteachers are already on strike since February 17 under the banner of Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS) in support of their eight-point charter of demands.

The state government had warned on Saturday that if the teachers boycott the evaluation duty, they be suspended and complaint will be lodged against them.

Pandey said the association has organised several protests since April 2019 in support of its three key demands – service condition for contractual teachers, sparing the teachers from non-academic work and removal of discrepancies in reimbursement of salary to teachers under the Seventh Pay Commission.

“In July 2015, the state government had announced that the contractual teachers will get all the benefits like pay hike, transfer, continuity of service, maternal and medical leave and promotion. However, nothing has been done so far,” the MLC said, adding the teachers should not be involved in non-academic work like election duty, preparation of mid-day meal and vaccination.”

Additional chief secretary of education department R K Mahajan, on the other hand, said regular teachers, teachers of government-aided schools and even some contractual teacher have promised to join the evaluation duty. “I have held a meeting with executive officers of zila parishads, DEOs, DPOs and executive officers of urban local bodies regarding evaluation of Intermediate answer sheets,” he said.

Mahajan said the government would rope in college and retired teachers for evaluation work. “Action will be initiated against the teachers if they fail to join the evaluation duty,” he said.

PATNA: Siddhu Koda , a top Maoist leader of Bihar and Jharkhand, died in police custody late Saturday night. He was arrested from Dumka in neighbouring Jharkhand on Friday night. Koda (30), a native of Jamui district in Bihar, was facing around 100 cases of Maoist violence in Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

An alert has been sounded in the bordering districts of Bihar and Jharkhand after the death of the self-styled ‘lieutenant general’ of banned outfit. Bihar and Jharkhand governments had announced a cash reward of Rs1 lakh and 10 lakh, respectively, for Koda’s arrest.

DIG, Munger range, Manu Maharaaj said on Sunday that Koda complained of pain in his chest and stomach on Saturday evening. He was rushed to the Sadar hospital at Jamui where doctors declared him brought dead. Koda was wanted in around 100 cases in three states, he said.

The DIG said Koda’s postmortem was conducted under the supervision of a medical board as per the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The postmortem was videographed and a magisterial inquiry was ordered into his death, he said, adding that Koda was chief of the CPI-Maoist’s East Bihar and North Jharkhand region.

Koda’s two associates — Illiyas Hembram and Sushil Hansda — were arrested from Chakai police station area in Jamui district on the basis of information elicited from him. One AK-47 assault rifle, one Insas rifle, one regular rifle, all looted from security personnel, a hand grenade besides a number of live cartridges were recovered during the search operation.

Jamui SDPO Ram Pukar Singh said Koda complained of pain in his stomach and heart during the search operation in deep forest and hilly terrain of Jamui. He was given the first line of treatment at a hospital from where he was referred to the sadar hospital at Jamui.

The SDPO said a joint team of the special task force (STF) and Dumka police had arrested Koda when he had gone there to collect extortion money from a contractor. He was brought to Jamui for interrogation and subsequently asked to accompany a police team during search operation. “The postmortem report will reveal the cause of Koda’s death,” he added.

Koda had blown up a patrolling team with detonators leading to the death of three people, including a patrolling magistrate, near Dipkarhar under Khaira police station in Jamui district in 1998. He had looted the weapons from security personnel. In 2001, he was appointed self-proclaimed area commander of the banned Naxal outfit. In 2003, he attacked the cavalcade of Jamui DM and SP in which a police officer was killed.

The major operation carried out by Koda at Mahulitand on the borders of Nawada and Jamui under Kauwakol police station in Nawada district in 2014 had left 11 security personnel, including the SHO of Kauwakol police station dead. In 20013, he had killed an STF jawan under Khaira police station in Jamui district.

Besides, an assistant commandant of the CRPF, Heera Kumar Jha, was killed by Koda’s armed squad. “The list of the cases pending against Koda is long,” said a police officer associated with anti-Naxal operation in Jamui district.

The police have also started probe into assets accumulated by Koda in Bihar, Jharkhand, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Kolkata through unlawful activities. Authoritative sources said Koda had made huge investments in real estate and some contractors were on the radar of the state investigating agency.

He said the Centre was hell bent on snatching constitutional rights from SC, ST and OBC communities. “They want to make a new Constitution and take away the voting rights of weaker sections of society and minorities. Implementation of CAA is a step in this direction,” Manjhi said.

JAP-L chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav also protested at Dak Bungalow crossing along with his supporters. The party workers shouted slogans and stopped a train at a Patna Junction.

State president of Bhim Army Amar Azad said the Centre was playing dirty politics with the weaker sections of society. “The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act should be incorporated in the 9th schedule of the Constitution so that no one can interfere in dalit’s rights,” he said near the Kargil Chowk.

In Ara, the bandh supporters squatted on rail tracks for 65 minutes and blocked Ara-Patna road for four hours. At Ara railway station, the protesters were led by the CPI-ML’s Tarari MLA Sudama Prasad. They halted at least three passenger trains.

In Biharsharif, anti-government and anti-CAA, NPR and NRC slogans were raised by the bandh supporters. They burned tyres and blocked Biharsharif-Bind and Biharsharif-Sheikhpura roads for hours. Movement of vehicular traffic in Nalanda and Sheikhura districts was also affected.

The bandh supporters took out a procession in Sitamarhi where shops and business establishments remained closed in the morning hours.

In Samastipur, the protesters blocked the main road to Darbhanga for a few hours by burning tyres.

The bandh also paralysed traffic movement on NH-31 in Begusarai. Supporters of Bhim Army and JAP-L also blocked the highway near the Begusarai railway station. Vehicles remained stranded on the highway for several hours.

In West Champaran, the bandh had no effect. All shops were open in Bagaha town. However, the bandh supporters took out a procession in the town.

46,['24/02/2020'],POCSO cells to handle sexual harassment cases in all Bihar government schools soon,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), a wing of the state education department, has decided to form ‘Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( POCSO ) cells’ in all government-run schools from the 2020-2021 academic session.

Students as well as women staff of schools will be able to file their complaints regarding any kind of sexual harassment and exploitation with the POCSO cell.

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act , 2012 aims to punish those engaging in sexual crimes against children, while safeguarding their interests at every stage of the judicial process.

The BEPC has directed all the district education officers to ensure that the government-run schools set up POCSO cell. A letter in this regard was issued last week by the BEPC’s state project director Sanjay Kumar Singh to all the DEOs.

Kiran Kumari, state programme officer of BEPC, said the POSCO cell in each school would be headed by the school principal. “A male teacher, a woman teacher, a non-teaching staff (clerk) and two students, including a girl, will be the members of the cell. The cell will initially be formed in secondary and higher secondary schools. The primary schools will be covered gradually,” she said, adding the schools have also been directed to display the child helpline number (1098) on their notice board.

“A complaint box should be placed in government-run schools for the students. After receiving the complaint, the POCSO cell will initiate action, like informing the local police station and child helpline about the sexual offence,” the letter issued by Sanjay read.

Sanjay said all the DEOs have been asked to notify schools regarding this and establish cells with immediate effect.

Kiran said the decision to form POCSO cell was taken following rise in sexual harassment and exploitation cases against women and children. “We have also started an awareness campaign – ‘Bal Sanrakshan aur Suraksha’ – in schools,” she said.

“Under the awareness campaign, the schools will make kids aware about the safe and unsafe touch, sexual harassment and cyber security. The BEPC is in the process of making 3-4 short videos as part of the awareness drive. One of the videos is based on cyber safety and the others are on bullying and bad impacts of porn sites,” Kiran said.

She added that the POCSO cell and awareness campaign would be monitored by the BEPC through ‘Unayan’, a mobile application for government-run schools. “The school principals have been asked to upload the daily report to the mobile application of BEPC,” she said.

47,['24/02/2020'],Surat: Five rounds fired at a jeweller,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Assailant emptied a magazine and was about to reload it, when staff caught him

SURAT: In a shocking incident, at least five rounds were fired from a pistol on an owner of a jewellery showroom in Mini Bazaar of Varachha on Sunday. Police suspect that the attackers may either have been assigned the contract to kill the jeweller, or it may have been an attempt to loot Amar Jewellers, the jewellery shop.

While the person who shot at the jeweller was caught, two others who were sitting outside on a scooter, escaped from the spot. Police identified arrested accused as Vijay Karpada, while his associates are Dinesh Shukla and Mayursinh Jadeja.

In the attack, shop accountant Sanjay Patel suffered bullet injuries on his hand and stomach, though cops claim he is out of danger. The attackers had come to shoot Nitesh Vavaiya, owner of the showroom , who, however, escaped unhurt as he rushed into his cabin after firing began in the front area of the shop. The bullets only hit his cabin glass.

Karpada emptied the first magazine and was about to reload it, when shop’s staff caught him. They later handed him over to the police. Police suspect that the accused have come to kill Vavaiya in some land dispute. The attacker were given contract to kill Vavaiya by some notorious criminal from Rajasthan. However, police are yet to reveal the exact details.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the trio — Karpada, Shukla and Jadeja — had escaped from Limbdi sub-jail of Surendranagar district on January 12 and an offence has been registered in Limbdi police station. Total four prisoners had escaped from the jail.

RAJKOT: As many as 50 pickpockets , chain snatchers and mobile thieves had been nabbed during the four-day Maha Shivratri fair in Bhavnath Taleti (valley) of Junagadh that concluded on Saturday morning.

Deputy superintendent of police Pradeepsinh Jadeja had formed four teams of Rajkot special operation group, local crime branch and D staff of Bhavnath police station along with Junagadh A division and B division police stations.

“The cops dressed in plain clothes mingled themselves into the crowd and nabbed 50 persons on the basis of suspicion. When we check the criminal records of those arrested on Pocket Cop App, we found that 12 were history-sheeters involved in pickpocketing, cellphone thefts and chain snatching,” said DySP Jadeja.

The Pocket Cop App is a special mobile application designed under e-Gujcop project launched by the state government.

The arrested accused were from Rajkot, Junagadh, Porbandar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Surendranagar and Gir Somnath districts.

A total of 15 cellphones lost in the fair were found by the police and returned to their owners. During this year’s fair, a total of 370 cases of purse and cellphone thefts were reported.

49,['24/02/2020'],‘Muslims should focus more on education’,"This story is from February 24, 2020

GAYA: Muslim opinion makers should not be bogged down on trivial issues like triple talaq and common civil code and concentrate on larger issues like education, jobs and participation in democratic institutions, political activist Yogendra Yadav said in an interactive session at Gaya on Saturday evening.

“For too long you have allowed the conservative elements to retain the leadership to work as vote bank brokers. Shaheen Bagh has shown the way by discarding the traditional leadership. The spirit of Shaheen Bagh has to be promoted by allowing women and youth to replace self servers as community leaders,” Yadav said.

Regretting the extremely poor ratio of Muslims both as students and faculty members, Yadav quoted latest official figures and said the community comprised nearly 15% of the population in the country, but its representation as students in the institutions of higher education was just about 2.5%. The scenario was even worse in respect of faculty members where the representation of Muslims was just about 1.5%.

The community leaders cannot be absolved of their responsibility as, instead of concentrating on real existential issues like jobs and education, they remained preoccupied with personal law related issues like triple talaq. Triple talaq, besides being against the true Islamic spirit that empowered women was inconsequential as the divorce rate among Muslims in India was less than the national average (of all divorces).

CAA has unwittingly done some good to the community as it has broken the inertia gripping them and provided an outlet to its genuine grievances, he said.

When one of the participants raised the issue of MY (Muslim-Yadav) doing little good to the Muslims, Yadav said being a votary of value based politics, he never approved of political combinations along caste and religious lines.

Democracy to be really successful has to go beyond numbers.

The prominent participants included Dr Farasat Hussain, Dr Hamid Hussain, Samvidhan Bachao Morcha convener Omair Khan @Tikka Khan, Philosophy Professor Javed Anjum, Economics professor Abdul Hannan, CPI leader Masood Manzar and activist Javed Khan.

‘Namaste Trump', is a paean to Donald Trump's two-day visit to India

Surat: ‘Sher ne sher ko bulaya hai , vo bhi yari nibhane aya hai’ , a melodious song composed and sung by Chirag Thakkar, a city-based musician , has become popular on social media. ‘Namaste Trump’, a paean to Donald Trump's two-day visit to India from Monday, is dedicated to the friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the US President.

It being the first visit of Trump to India, Thakkar planned to welcome him with a song and got it recorded in just 15 hours thanks to support of his friends namely Vihul Jagirdar and Darshan Zaveri. The 4.45 minute song is sung by Thakkar, Jagirdar and Pooja Modi Kalyani. The group has shot a video of the song as well.

“It was not pre-planned but after it was confirmed that Trump was indeed coming, we decided to honour the US President and Modi with a song. I think it is first time that a President of the USA is directly coming to Gujarat and it is a matter of pride for me,” Thakkar said.

“Trump is going to visit Sabarmati Ashram as well. Mahatma Gandhiji's favourite devotional song Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram too is there in 'Namaste Trump',” Thakkar added.

“Trump is arriving in Ahmedabad and as a Gujarati, we wanted to greet him. I have focused on the personalities of the two leaders. They both are loved by the people of their respective countries,” lyricist Jagirdar said.

‘Namaste Trump' starts with Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram tune. “We remember the Father of the Nation at the start of our song,” added Jagirdar.

52,['24/02/2020'],Rough diamond sales of De Beers reduced by 26%,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Surat: For the first time , the rough diamond sales of the world’s largest diamond mining company, De Beers , has fallen by 26% in 2019 , due to the ongoing crisis in the Surat’s diamond industry and weak market conditions.

In its 2019 financial report, De Beers noted that due to the difficult market challenges, the rough diamond sales declined 26% at $4 billion in 2019 compared to $5.4 billion in 2018. However, the company asserted that the long-term outlook for global diamond demand remains positive, with significant growth prospects in the emerging markets.

Industry sources said that the rough diamond imports in the country had been on the decline during the whole of 2019 as the diamond unit owners exercised reduction in the diamond production due to the challenging market conditions and weak demand of polished diamonds. The manufacturing of diamonds was slashed to almost half due to the huge pile up of diamond inventory in the pipeline.

Diamond industry analyst Aniruddha Lidbide told TOI: “The diamantaires have reacted smartly to the challenging market circumstances by reducing the rough diamond import. Even as the mining companies reduced prices by over 6% to lure the diamantaires. Still, the industry is sitting on a good amount of polished inventories, which needs to the cleared. The rough imports will continue to be affected in the coming few months.”

Lidbide added, “There is a coronavirus threat looming large on the industry. The export of polished diamonds to Hong Kong and China is badly affected, which will further aggravate problems in the industry.”

According to the figures from the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the import of rough diamonds between April-January-2020 declined by 15% at Rs 77,000 crore against Rs 90,000 crore during the same period in the previous year. Also, the polished diamond export between April-Janauary-2020 declined by 17% at 1,16,000 lakh crore against Rs 1,37,000 lakh crore.

A sight holder of De Beers on the condition of anonymity said, “De Beers had offered deferment of goods at few of its previous sales last year due to the challenging market conditions. There was 50% decrease in the sale as many deferred the purchase of goods. At present, the industry is focused on clearing its piled up inventories of polished diamonds.”

Newly built Digha flyover open for people in Patna on Sunday

PATNA: The Digha flyover , constructed with an aim to ease traffic on Ashok Rajpath-Danapur road, was thrown open to public on Sunday. The flyover connects Nahar Road near Patipul Ghat to the approach road of Digha rail-cum-road bridge.

The 1.2km-long flyover, built with an expenditure of Rs 80 crore, has come as a boon for people going to Sonepur, Chhapra and Hajipur via Digha Setu from Phulwarisharif and AIIMS-Patna.

On Saturday, a trial run was conducted on the new flyover. It was inspected by Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, managing director of Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDC), and executive engineers of road construction department.

Agarwal said one-way traffic movement will be allowed on Digha flyover for the next 15 days. “The vehicles coming from Phulwarisharif, AIIMS-Patna and Naubatpur will be allowed to use Digha flyover to reach Digha Setu. Vehicles coming from Digha Setu end cannot use the flyover for 15 days,” he said.

“The start of Digha flyover means that buses will no longer be unnecessarily parked on Ashok Rajpath-Danapur road. It will ease traffic on the road, especially during the peak hours,” Agarwal, who is also the Patna divisional commissioner, said.

Agarwal said heavy vehicles were not allowed to take U-turn from Ashok Rajpath-Danapur road due to the construction of Digha flyover. “As a result, traffic jam near Digha was a big problem. People of the city will now heave a sigh of relief, thanks to the Digha flyover,” he said.

Agarwal added, “The traffic cops will regulate traffic movement near Digha flyover and 200-metre approach road connecting Digha Setu. The service lane below the Digha flyover will be ready in next 15 days.”

Meanwhile, the locals have welcomed the opening of the new flyover. Suresh Kumar, who owns a medical shop near Digha, said it would ease traffic in the area. “Trucks and vans used to cause traffic congestion near Patipul,” he said.

Anshuman, a resident of Ashiana Colony, the flyover would come as a relief for schoolchildren as well. “Many school buses will also use the new flyover now,” he added.

54,['24/02/2020'],Puma India revenues grow 22% to Rs 1413 cr in a slowdown year,"This story is from February 24, 2020

(Representative image: AFP)

BENGALURU: Sports lifestyle brand Puma has seen its sales grow 22% to Rs 1,413 crore for the 12 months ending December 2019. The growth was aided by increasing sales to women customers and higher demand in tier-2 towns across the country despite a slowing economy.

The German multinational has roped in a slew of brand ambassadors like cricket team captain Virat Kohli and boxing champion Mary Kom over the last few years. It expects to continue a similar growth momentum of over 20% this year even as it faces increasing competition from relatively newer entrants like Under Armour and Skechers. “India is a strategic market for Puma. The growing sportswear market, coupled with the country’s aspirational youth, poses a huge opportunity for us to tap into,” Bjorn Gulden, global CEO of Puma, told TOI.

He added that globally it has also been a record year for the brand with revenues of 5.5 billion euros. “Being the No.1 brand in India is a reflection of how well we understand our consumers and how pleased they are with our products.” Puma wants to double down on India, with plans to open about 20 exclusive stores in an existing network of 373 across the country.

Puma was one of the first major brands to actively tap the online retail sales route on Flipkart and Amazon India. This channel accounted for around 29% of sales in 2019, compared to 24% in 2018. Puma’s India MD Abhishek Ganguly sees this number stabilising at about 30%.

What has significantly been increasing sales for Puma is its business in tier-2 and -3 towns as it contributes 48% of the total online channel in 2019 from just 15% in 2015. These smaller towns — like Jalandhar, Bhopal and Nashik — also contributed 40% of the total offline sales in 2019 as compared to 22% in 2015.

In terms of overall growth rate, Puma has been able to edge past major rivals like Adidas (Rs 1,251 crore in FY19), which has been growing at 10%, while others like Nike (Rs 831 crore in FY19) and Reebok (Rs 407 crore in FY19) have been stagnant in India for the last few years. But these companies follow an April to March financial year, while Puma follows a calendar year format (January to December) for its results.

The competition in the segment is set to increase as Under Armour has opened 10 stores in India while US-based Skechers, which operated through a joint venture with Future Group, also consolidated its presence by buying out the Indian partner in the previous year.

56,['24/02/2020'],Companies sniff better chance of consumer connect with exotic smells,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: ‘What’s visible would sell’ has been the basic principle followed by marketers. On a deeper, sensorial connect, it’s: ‘What smells good would sell good as well’. Sensorials play a very critical role when it comes to consumers’ choice of products.While over the years traditionally rooted fragrances like jasmine and sandalwood have had a distinct contribution, especially for soaps, a combination of fruity-floral fragrances are now gaining traction with marketers wooing younger consumers. Today, the more exotic the fragrance, the better the connect, say experts.CKC Aromas CEO Rishabh Kothari said there is a lot of experimentation happening in the fruity-floral space and some oriental notes such as ‘oud’ are catching up among the more affluent Indians who are looking for something different. “With the trend of naturals in FMCG, we also see a huge demand for notes which smell natural,” said Kothari, who is one of the leading players in the sensory market.Dabur recently launched a ‘floral bliss’ variant, which is a complex floral fragrance, and a ‘daffodil’ variant under its Odonil brand. Dabur India marketing head (home & personal care) Rajeev John said popular fragrances like jasmine and sandalwood continue to be relevant today, and these have also extended beyond beauty to enter the home care space. However, he added, one is now seeing the younger generation embracing newer exotic fragrances and floral fusions.“Fragrance is highly important as it is usually the first point of contact for any individual with a product. You tend to smell the product first before touching or experiencing it. Many a times, particularly in categories like personal care and home care, a fragrance becomes one of the most important factors when it comes to final product selection,” said John, who claims that the Odonil Zipper range has been a success mainly because it got the fragrance right.Godrej Consumer Products CEO (India & SAARC) Sunil Kataria said, “A product has to appeal to all senses of consumers to gain approval, with look-feel-smell forming a critical role. This is the very reason why some air freshener brands or variants have done well, while others haven’t — be it in personal care or air fresheners. When we test for fragrance in our products, we check for fragrance liking, fragrance strength (just right), fragrance spread (especially for air fresheners) and how long lasting the fragrance is.”Affluence is one of the reasons for the growing demand for newer experiences in fragrances. Over the years, as multiple brands of FMCG products moved into urban Indian households, traditional fragrances gave way to newer ones. Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting CEO Vineet Agrawal, however, said non-metro markets are still a one-soap household and often decision on the brand is made by the home maker. Jasmine and sandalwood products, thus, continue to have a stronger hold in these markets.According to Kataria, the occasion or space also determines which fragrance works well and where. “If the objective is to counter malodour like in a bathroom, consumers prefer stronger fruity fragrances. However, if the objective is to enjoy me-time in one’s bedroom or have a relaxing time with friends or partners in the living room, people prefer softer notes like aqua, fougere,” said Kataria.Some brands command a loyal consumer base owing to the fragrance, like Dettol Original, Cinthol Original and Pears original soap.

SARAN/PATNA: Tension grips Saran district following the murder of a noted trader and close relative of district board chairperson Meena Arun under Marhaura police station in the district around 9am on Sunday. The deceased, Arjun Singh (55), is stated to be the elder brother of Meena’s husband and former mukhiya Arun Singh.

Meena was released from jail recently. Her name had figured in the killing of two policemen, including sub-inspector Mithilesh Kumar Sah, who was also heading the SIT in the district. An AK-47 assault rifle and a pistol were also looted in the incident under Marhaura police station in August last year. Meena’s licensed revolver was recovered from the spot.

Sources said Arjun’s son Subodh Kumar Singh is the main accused in the killing of police personnel Mithilesh Kumar Sah and Md Faruq in August last year. “Both Meena and her husband have been made key conspirators in the double murder case,” a police officer said.

Police said Arjun along with an acquaintance was on way to his shop at Marhaura from his native village Awari on a motorbike when the assailants fired at him near Marhaura railway station. He was rushed to the referral hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead.

A trainee IPS officer, Sandeep Singh, and Marhaura SDPO Dhirendra Kumar Sah rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. The police had to face the wrath of the deceased’s supporters who also blocked the Chhapra-Marhaura road and disrupted vehicular traffic demanding immediate arrest of the accused.

“The reason behind the murder is yet to be ascertained. Some suspects have been picked up for interrogation on the basis of information shared by the man, who was accompanying Arjun,” the SDPO said.

DIG, Saran range, B K Verma and Saran SP Har Kishore Rai visited the spot. “Those involved in the murder wont’ be spared,” the DIG said.

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Highlighting the growth of cooperative movement in Bihar in the recent years, CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday said the number of Primary Agriculture Credit Cooperative Societies (PACS) members in the state has now gone up to 1.24 crore.

Addressing a joint conference of 7 apex cooperative bodies of the country, Nitish said the number of PACS women members has now gone up from 2 lakh to 36 lakh. He said his government was committed to meeting the expectations of the cooperative societies.

“People in the state are aware as to what were the condition of PACS and Bihar State Cooperative Marketing Union (BISCOMAUN) about 20 years ago. After coming to power in 2005, we started constituting new PACS and held their election on a regular basis. This led to sharp increase in the number of PACS members. These societies are engaged in procurement of paddy at a large scale across the state,” Nitish said.

He also said his government has allotted Rs56.35 crore for constructing altogether 22 ‘Sahkar Bhavan’ (cooperative buildings) in 17 districts and five divisional headquarters to promote regional cooperatives.

Referring to certain delay in procurement of paddy this year, Nitish said the government was working to sort out few issues in paddy procurement which were cropped up due to change in climate. “The cooperative minister and the chief secretary are monitoring the matter,” he said.

Nitish also said agriculture equipment worth up to Rs15 lakh would be provided to each PACS in the state. Of the total amount, the Centre would provide Rs10 lakh while state government provides Rs5 lakh as subsidy.

The CM requested the PACS chairpersons to purchase at least four agriculture equipment — happy seeder, zero tillage machine, rotary mulcher and reaper binder — for their members. State government is providing 75% subsidy on the purchase of these equipment, he said, adding the government recently made payments through government e-marketplace (GeM) portal for purchase of equipment in 2,917 cooperative societies.

Nitish said the state government has begun the process for appointment of 25 woman assistant managers in the cooperative banks.

Agriculture minister Prem Kumar, state cooperative minister Rana Randhir Singh, LJP MP Chirag Paswan, BISCOMAUN chairman Sunil Kumar Singh and Bihar State Cooperative Bank Limited chairman Ramesh Chandra Choubey also addressed the conference.

PATNA: Motorcycle-borne criminals shot at a jeweller and looted cash and jewellery worth over Rs 11 lakh from him in Madhubani district on Sunday. The victim, Shrawan Kumar, was admitted to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for treatment.

The incident took place around 8.30am when Shrawan was on way to his shop from his house under the Rajnagar police station area in the district. Five criminals riding two motorcycles intercepted him near Narhari Bhagwanpur and attempted to snatch his bag containing money and gold jewellery.

One of the robbers pumped three bullets into Shrawan’s body when he resisted the loot. The criminals then escaped with the bag containing Rs 1.25 lakh in cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 10 lakh. The injured was rushed to the Raj Nagar referral hospital from where he was shifted to sadar hospital at Madhubani.

“The borders of the district have been sealed and vehicle checking drive launched to arrest the criminals involved in the incident,” Madhubani additional superintendent of police Kamini Bala said.

The victim’s younger brother, Manohar Kumar, told police that Shrawan had left home around 8am for the shop at Rajnagar on his motorbike. “I reached the hospital after being informed by some local residents, who had admitted Shrawan to the hospital for treatment,” a police officer quoted Manohar as saying.

RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav addresses 'Berozgari Hatao Yatra' public meeting at Veterinary College Ground... Read More

PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said on Sunday that if voted to power in the coming assembly election, his party would introduce a domicile policy and reserve 85% of the state government’s jobs for natives of Bihar.

Launching his much-publicized ‘Berozgaari Hatao Yatra’ from the Veterinary College ground here, Tejashwi said if voted to power, he would advertise vacancies and hold competitive examinations on a regular basis to provide jobs to the youths. “A strong political will is needed to remove unemployment . We have that political will. We will carry out all necessary exercises to provide jobs to the unemployed youths of the state,” he told a large gathering.

The younger son of incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad criticized the NDA government in state for failing to provide enough jobs to the unemployed youths.

He asked CM Nitish Kumar to either provide jobs to the unemployed or join his ‘yatra’ which was aimed to highlight the burning issue of unemployment. “In the last 15 years, Bihar has witnessed an unprecedented increase in the unemployment rate,” he claimed.

“This yatra is being launched to expedite our struggle against unemployment. State’s unemployment figures are highest in the last 45 years. Bihar is the youngest state, but I am sad to say that it has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 11.47%. We are fighting to provide you jobs but CM Nitish Kumar ji is busy in saving his job (chair),” Tejashwi, who is the leader of opposition in the state assembly, said.

Tejashwi, who is projected as the RJD’s CM face for the coming election, also accused the Nitish government of “killing reservation” in the state. “Nitish government is behaving like a contract killer. They are killing reservation. They are murdering the spirit of the Constitution,” he alleged.

The RJD leader also said he would set up special economic zones and information technology parks in the state to create job avenues for highly qualified youths.

It was for the first time that the picture of Lalu Prasad was conspicuously absent from the dais of an RJD event. Even after Lalu was sent to jail following his conviction in the fodder scam cases, his picture used to dominate the RJD podiums.

61,['24/02/2020'],Bihar: 2 universities plan revival of near-extinct scripts,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Two universities in Bihar have taken up the challenge to keep alive scripts such as Brahmi , Kaithi , Mithilakshar (Tirhut) and several others that are on the verge of extinction.

Patna and Munger universities plan to train students in writing and understanding these endangered scripts to help conserve valuable manuscripts and historical documents.

While Patna University is contemplating a workshop on the importance of these endangered scripts, Munger University (MU) has decided to introduce a certificate course. These scripts were widely used in Bihar, parts of Nepal and Uttar Pradesh until recently by scholars.

PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh told this newspaper that all records of government offices and courts were mostly written in Kaithi script, but now it is difficult to find people who can easily decipher them.

“The number of people using this script even in courts has dwindled considerably in recent decades. Hence, it is essential to train youngsters to read and write in this script. The university will soon organize a series of workshops and training programmes in this regard,” Singh said.

MU vice-chancellor Ranjit Kumar Verma said, “The curriculum for the certificate course in endangered scripts such as Kaithi and Mithilakshar has been prepared and the course would be introduced from the next academic session.”

The former head of PU’s ancient history and archaeology department, Jayadeo Mishra, said the importance of Kaithi in north Indian society can be measured by the activities for which it was employed and by the number of materials written and printed in the script.

“Use of Kaithi for administrative purposes is attested from at least the 16th century through the first decade of the 20th century. Kaithi was selected by the government of Bihar as the official script of the courts and administrative offices of the Bihar districts in 1880. Thereafter, Kaithi replaced the Persian script as the writing system of record in the judicial courts of Bihar,” he explained.

“Government gazetteers report that Kaithi was used in a few districts of Bihar till the 1960s. It is possible that Kaithi is still used today in a very limited capacity in these districts and in rural areas of north India. On account of the magnitude of documents in Kaithi, the script remains important for modern scholars working with such sources,” Mishra added.

The former head of PU’s Hindi department, Dinesh Prasad Singh, expressed his concern over these scripts on the verge of extinction. He said, “Maithili scholars have stopped writing in Mithilkshar and surprisingly enough, even the name of PU Maithili department is not written in Mithilakshar script.”

Singh demanded the implementation of the recommendations of the committee constituted by the Union HRD ministry in 2018 for the promotion and protection of Maithili language and its scripts. “A major recommendation of the committee was to establish a script and manuscripts centre in Darbhanga either at K S D Sanskrit University or at L N Mithila University,” he said.

“The committee had suggested completion of preparation of Unicode Script for Mithilakshar by Technology Development of Indian Languages and creating audio-visual teaching material for teaching Mithilakshar,” he added.

Bihar governor Phagu Chauhan

PATNA: The monthlong budget session of the state legislature will begin on Monday with governor Phagu Chauhan addressing the joint session of the state assembly and legislative council in the central hall of the extended legislature building. It will be the present governor’s first address to the joint session of the state legislature.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi will table the Economic Survey Report for 2019-20 and follow it up by presenting the state budget on Tuesday. The budget session will have 22 sittings and the House will be adjourned on March 31.

The budgetary allocations for expenditures in the 2019-20 fiscal had been Rs 2.05 lakh crore. However, with the Centre constrained on the financial front, the state government’s expectations regarding the money flow from the Centre during the 2020-21 fiscal might not be bullish, the observers felt.

Around mid-March, Modi will also table three separate budgets – gender budget, child budget and environment, forest and climate change budget – giving details on the amount of money allotted by the government for expenditure during the 2020-21 fiscal.

While the opening day of the budget session would witness noisy scenes, the things might not remain the same on other days. “We will not disrupt the Question Hour on any day because we also the House to function in a peaceful manner. However, if the government does not give its replies on the burning issues, we will definitely register our protests,” senior RJD legislator Bhai Birendra said.

The CPI(ML), which has three members in the House, has decided to organize march to the state assembly on February 25, demanding a resolution passed by the House that the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens would not be implemented in the state.

Students who were washing utensils were around 12 years old

JAIPUR: While chief minister Ashok Gehlot allocated highest budget to the education sector stating education to be the top priority, students can be seen washing utensils in the government schools in Jaipur.

On Wednesday, the TOI reporter visited Government Higher Secondary School , Sanganer, where the students could be seen washing utensils. There were big steel pots and plates near water taps in the school. After the mid-day meal was served, three to five students were involved in washing utensils during school time.

Looking at the reporter clicking photographs, one school staff immediately called the students back. The students who were washing utensils were around 12 years old.

Later, one school staff who did not wish to be named said that the government has removed the cook-cum-help, which has made it difficult for the teachers to cope. “Since 2016, when Akshay Patra started supplying food to government schools, the government removed the cook-cum-helps from the schools. I agree that the food is not prepared at the schools, but we have big utensils where the food is collected from Akshay Patra. Who is supposed to wash them?” said one school teacher.

When TOI contacted district education officer, Ramchand Pilaniya, he said that department will look into the matter. “Government provides funds to schools to hire any person for washing utensils, but if the students are made to wash dishes, we will look into it and required action will be taken,” said Pilaniya.

Teachers however deny any financial assistance from the government. “Government provides Rs 500 for the milk scheme. Who is going to wash utensils in Jaipur city for Rs 500? Whenever we try to hire someone he/she asks for at least Rs 8,000 a month. Government should re-transfer the cook-cum-help in the schools. This is the only solution,” said another school teacher.

As the blame game continues between the teachers and the administration, students are washing utensils during their study hours.

Agra: An order of the district administration directing the ASI not to sell any entry tickets to the main mausoleum on Monday – the day of the US President Donald Trump’s visit to Taj Mahal – has led to a lot of confusion as online sale of these tickets has already taken place and hence entry of tourists cannot be stopped.

The order, signed by SSP Babloo Kumar, which was issued on Sunday, directs the ASI to ensure that only entry tickets to the Taj should be sold for Monday and the main mausoleum be kept out of bounds.

The order also states that the ongoing Taj Mahotsav should not be held on Monday due to Trump’s visits. The SSP’s order has left the ASI officials in a quandary.

“We cannot stop the entry of the tourists with valid tickets,” said an official.

When contacted, ASI superintending archeologist, ASI (Agra circle), Vasant K Swarankar, said that tickets are available online and are pre-booked and it will be very difficult to stop sale of the tickets or the entry of the tourists who have bought them.

Surprised with the district administration’s move, Rajiv Saxena, vice-president of Tourism Guild, Agra, said that the government should ensure that the visit of VVIPs should not affect the trip of common tourists to the monument. They should understand the importance of tourism.

He said while it is understandable that movement of tourists is restricted during the VVIPs’ visit but “people should not be harassed in the name of security arrangements”. He said, “It’s unfortunate that the movement of golf carts was stopped on Sunday from Trident and elderly tourists were made to walk.”

The Union Ministry for Culture and Tourism had introduced a separate entry ticket of Rs 200 to the main mausoleum in December 2018. Prior to it, there was a single entry ticket for entering the Taj premises.

Meanwhile, ASI issued a notice that Taj Mahal will be closed for public from 11:30 am for one hour before the monument is closed on Monday. According to ASI officials, US President Trump will reach the monument by 5:10 pm and will leave after 65 minutes.

The committee members called SMC Employees Union (SMCEU) members to record their statements as well as provide details of the victims. However, SMCEU sources informed that the complainants’ names will not be divulged for fears of reprisal as well as not to breach confidentiality.

The committee will also record statements of the gynaecologists in SMIMER and other senior officials. The committee has randomly chosen a few probationary clerks who underwent the gynaecology tests for fitness certificate and called them to register their statement.

VARANASI: The city will soon have its own Madame Tussauds Musuem housing life-size sculptures of the famous personalities of the city, though not in wax.

In a bid to attract more tourists, a plan to establish a ‘ Hall of fame’ like structure, with memorials dedicated to famous or illustrious personalities of the city, especially recipients of Bharat Ratna, Padma awards and those who have earned name in different fields living in other cities or abroad, is being worked on. The galleries dedicated to selected dignitaries will also have their life-size sculptures on the lines of Madame Tussaud ’s museum, although in place of wax, the sculptures will be made of metal, stone or clay here.

Disclosing the plan of the proposed museum of dignitaries to TOI on Sunday, UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism, culture and religious affairs Neelkanth Tiwari said, “Apart from heritage and religious tourism we are also working for the promotion of cultural tourism to ensure more tourist footfall here. Stepping ahead in the same direction, a plan of developing a museum of dignitaries and legends of Varanasi had been conceived a few months ago and its detailed project report is also being finalised now.”

“The project will be collectively executed by the culture and tourism departments,” he said adding that apart from exploring venues to establish this mueseum in the limits of the city, areas area also being explored in outskirts of Varanasi as this museum is being proposed in 15 acre land. Huge land is required for the museum as the basic idea is to dedicate gallery to each dignitary to display his life since birth till death with achievements in fields concerned, said Tiwari.

Regarding the dignitaries selected for exhibiting in the proposed museum, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “So far a list of 100 dignitaries including Bharat Ratna, Padma awards recipients and others, who, though living in other cities or abroad, remained associated with Varanasi and earned name in different fields, have been prepared. Basic documentation on their work and achievements has also been started. The work is likely to complete by March end. After the finalisation of this documentation and DPR by the end of the current financial year, it will be forwarded to the state government with the commencement of new financial year 2020-21 in April.”

The list of dignitaries to have galleries dedicated to them includes the names of Bharat Ratna awardees- Bhagwan Das, former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Sitar maestro Pt Ravi Shankar, Shehnai exponent Ustad Bismillah Khan, founder of Banaras Hindu University Pt Madan Mohan Malviya and Padma awards recipients, who have a huge number in Varanasi from the fields of music, dance, religion, academics, medical, weaving art and social works.

The material to be used for creating sculptures of the selected dignitaries has not been finalised yet, said Tiwari. As per the sources, initially use of stone and bronze was proposed to make the sculpturs for this mueseum. But, now the possibility of using clay for sculptures is also being explored to promote clay artistes and also to bring down cost of the project, they added.

NEW DELHI: BJP leader and former MLA Kapil Mishra on Sunday gave a three-day ultimatum to Delhi Police to remove the Jafrabad blockade . Mishra landed up with his supporters and party workers in the area on Sunday afternoon after which protesters threw stones at them and tension simmered in the area. According to police personnel present on the spot, stone-pelting started after Mishra left.“Dilli Police ko teen din ka ultimatum — Jafrabad aur Chand Bagh ki sadkein khali karwaiye..iske baad hamein mat samjhaiyega...hum aapki bhi nahi sunenge..sirf teen din..,” (Three-day ultimatum for Delhi Police — Get the roads of Jafrabad and Chand Bagh vacated...after this don’t try to persuade us...we will not listen to you...just three days) he tweeted at 5.11pm. Mishra had tweeted at 1.22pm asking people to assemble at the Maujpur Chowk traffic signal at 3pm to support CAA .Speaking to TOI, Mishra said the anti-CAA protesters who blocked the Chand Bagh road in north-east Delhi had forced him to come out and protest. “They have blocked two major roads, which will restrict the movement of over 35 lakh people living in that part of the city.

The BJP leader, however, insisted that the pro-CAA protesters didn’t indulge in any kind of violence.Speaking at the spot, Mishra said “These people want Delhi to keep burning which is why they have shut the roads and are making a riot-like atmosphere. We have not thrown any stone from our side,”Mishra then pointed at Ved Prakash Surya, district DCP, and said: “The DCP is standing with us, and I would like to let him know on behalf of you all (protesters) that till US President Donald Trump is in the country, we won’t do anything.

Representative image

JAIPUR: After a long gap, the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has decided to re-launch the alkaline water units with new features in 200 places across the city.

To provide safe and clean drinking water to Pink City residents , JMC had launched these units in 2018. Initially, they were installed in 15 places. Later on due to revenue issues between JMC and contractors (EKA JAL), the units stopped functioning. Now, after an agreement, it has again begun.

JMC deputy commissioner Arun Garg said after due consideration, the units were again given a green light. “In few places, the units have started to function,” said Garg.

The company has even proposed to install sanitary pad vending machine, wi-fi and security cameras in the water units. Sanitary pad vending machines will be installed in front of the university, colleges and hostels. Camera will be connected to police headquarters for security purposes.

First opened at the time of former mayor Ashok Lahoty, these were meant to supply alkaline water with a content of silver. The normal cost of this water starts from Rs 600 to Rs 10,000 per litre in the world, but the company will be providing it to JMC for free with the help of the monetary help from the World Bank. About Rs 15 lakh has been spent on one drinking unit.

Currently, the units have been installed at JMC, one near Rajasthan University , railway station, at Jawahar Circle, Ganesh Temple, two on MI Road and other places. At many places, construction has started and is expected to be completed within a year.

LARONDA (AGRA): As Agra is decked up like a bride to welcome US President Donald Trump and First Lady Milenia Trump on February 24, a village barely 15 kilometres away from the city reminisces a winter afternoon spent with another US president over six decades ago.Older residents of Laronda village in Bhichpuri block of Agra, especially those in their 70s and 80s, still remember how a convertible Dodge Kingsway of 1956 model had gently been driven into their village on December 13, 1959 with Pandit Jawahalal Nehru and then US President Dwight David Eisenhower perched on top of the backseat.Preparations were made beforehand. But they were nothing compared to what Agra has witnessed in the past week.“New roads were constructed, a proper drainage system was developed, a few ducks were brought for the village pond and all pucca houses and a primary school were painted white after putting a thin layer of cow dung. In fact, Pandit Nehru had flown to Agra a few days before the VVIP visit and inspected the preparations,” said Sukhbir Singh, 67, son of Tikam Singh, then block pramukh of Bhichpuri.Life was much simpler back then, recounts Ramesh Chandra, 69, son of then gram pradhan Karan Singh.“The village had a population of just 1,600. All of us gathered around Eisenhower and Pandit Nehru showering petals of roses and marigold on them. We offered them a simple lunch of bajre ki roti and lassi and then we roamed round the village with the leaders of the two nations, showing them our farms, cattle barns, school, pond and a newly constructed ‘panchayat ghar’,” Chandra said.“It was like a festival for us, which lasted for two hours. My mother Barfi Devi, now 91, brought an aarti thal to welcome the two leaders. During the aarti, Eisenhower was curious about the veiled faces of village women. To which, my mother and other women explained to him the importance of veil for Indian women,” he said.Barfi Devi has now lost her hearing ability, but her face beams when she is shown a picture of her her husband Karan Singh standing with the two leaders. “He (Eisenhower) was a tall man with a stately built. He bumped his head at the entrance of my house twice,” she recalls.Kale Devi, Barfi Devi’s sister-in-law who still covers her face with a veil at 81, said, “We explained to the US president that Indian women show their faces only to their father, husband, brothers or sons. On hearing this, both Eisenhower and Nehru told us to treat them as fatherly figures. We removed our veils and served them the lunch.”“During interaction with the villagers with the help of translators, Eisenhower revealed that he, too, came from country background and easily got attached to people who till land for a living,” Chandra said.The visit of Eisenhower brought both perks and plaudits for the village. The model village of 1959 still retains the crown.Kripal Singh, 54, the present gram pradhan of Laronda, said, “Our village has a prepaid water ATM, library with WiFi, solar street lights, two schools (a primary and a junior high school), water harvesting facility, concrete roads, city-standard drainage system and piped water connections. Besides, almost 75-80% of our population is literate and only 25% of the population is engaged in agriculture. Others work in factories, stores, private and government jobs. This happened because of Eisenhower’s 1959 visit.”The icing on the cake, however, was a letter the villagers later received from the White House.“…through my visit to Laronda, I learned much about the way of life in India’s half a million villages and their problems as farmers. I spent my own boyhood in a farming centre and when I am not in Washington, I’m on my farm. Thus close to the people who till the soil.“I was particularly interested in learning about the institution of the panchayat as counterpart of the kind of grass roots democracy we know in America,” Eisenhower wrote.Ever since that winter of 1959, both the village and its inhabitants had become a fond footnote to the history of Indo-US relations.",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74275735,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150753,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ahead-of-trump-visit-agra-village-recalls-tryst-with-another-us-prez-60-yrs-ago/articleshow/74273498.cms

NEW DELHI: This story is all about how things have been spiralling out of control in northeast Delhi and how misguided youths have decided to take the law in their hands by unleashing violence based on religious identity.My horrifying experience began when I reached Maujpur Metro Station around 12.15pm. I was taken by surprise when a Hindu Sena member suddenly approached me offering to put tilak on my forehead saying it would make my work “easier”. He could see me with cameras, which identified me as a photojournalist. However, he was insistent. “You are also a Hindu, bhaiya. What is the harm?”Around 15 minutes later, stone-pelting began between two groups in the area. Amidst slogans of “Modi, Modi”, I spotted black smoke billowing in the sky. As I rushed towards the building on fire, a few men near a Shiv Mandir stopped me. When I told them I was going to take photographs, they told me not to go there. “Bhai, aap bhi to Hindu ho? Kyun jaa rahe ho? Aaj Hindu jaag gaya hai. (Brother, you are also a Hindu. Why are you going there? Hindus have woken up today,” said one of them.I stepped aside and after a short while navigated along the barricades to reach the spot. As soon as I started taking photos, a few men wielding bamboo sticks and rods surrounded me. They tried to snatch my camera, but my reporter colleague, Sakshi Chand, stepped in front of me and dared them to touch me. The men decided to slink away.A short while later I realised they were following me. A youth accosted me and asked, “Bhai, tu zyada uchhal raha hai. Tu Hindu hai ya Musalman? (Brother, you are acting very smart. Are you a Hindu or a Muslim?)” They threatened to take off my pants to confirm my religion. I then folded my hands and said I was just a lowly photographer. They then gave me a few threats, but let me go.Desperate to leave the area, I started looking for my office vehicle, but it was nowhere to be found. I then walked a few hundred metres towards Jafrabad when I spotted an autorickshaw. The driver agreed to take me to ITO.I later realised that the name embossed on the auto could land us in trouble with the mob around. As fate would have it, we were soon stopped by four men. They caught hold of our collars to drag us out of the auto. I pleaded with them to let us go, saying I was a press member and the auto driver was innocent.When the driver dropped me off, I realised he was shaken to the core. “I have never been questioned about my religion in this grotesque manner in my life,” he said before parting ways.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74293478,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-320267,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/are-you-hindu-or-muslim-toi-photojournalist-recounts-maujpur-horror/articleshow/74291844.cms

Indrayani river

PUNE: The district administration is working on a plan to set up four sewage treatment plants (STPs) at Lonavla, Talegaon Dhabade, Kuruli and Alandi over the next one year for curbing the pollution of Indrayani river .

The condition of the river has deteriorated substantially as almost the entire stretch of its surface is covered by water hyacinth. This is the resultant effect of pollution. Release of untreated sewage water, generated at Lonavala, Talegaon Dhabade, Pimpri Chinchwad, Moshi and Alandi, has contributed to this situation.

""We plan to complete the STP projects in a year and have assigned work orders for the STPs at Lonavala and Talegaon Dabhade. Work orders for the Kuruli and Alandi STPs will be released in a few days,” Pune district collector Naval Kishor Ram told TOI.

The river originates from a spot near Lonavala and passes through Kamsheth, Talegaon Dhabade, Dehu, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Alandi before merging with Bhima river in Tulapur village, Shirur tehsil.

The Lonavala Municipal Council (LMC) has begun construction of 6 MLD capacity STP at Dongargaon village around 6km from the main town. “The old STP of 3.5 MLD capacity was not functional owing to multiple failure of systems in the last few months. The new STP’s work has begun at the site and we plan to complete the project by December 2020,” said Sachin Pawar, the LMC’s chief officer.

A 20km stretch of the river goes through the PCMC area. Many housing societies have released their drainage lines directly into the river at multiple locations. “We have initiated work for a drainage line network in Chikhali, Moshi and other areas which will be linked to STPs at Moshi and Charoli village. The work of a 15 MLD capacity STP at Chikhali is held up for now in view of a litigation before the NGT,” PCMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar said. “Alandi already has 4 MLD capacity STP which is not sufficient. We have decided to install new plant in coming months,” said Ram. Activist-lawyer Vilas Kate from Alandi said, “The river has literally turned black and remains the same all year .”

MEERUT: Three youths were detained while a local activist was put under house arrest to prevent any probable flare up in Meerut zone on the occasion of ‘ Bharat bandh ’ called by Dalit group Bhim Army on Sunday.

Badar Ali was put under house arrest. Ali had earlier led a protest march against Tabrez Ansari’s lynching case a couple of months ago that had turned violent. Meanwhile, Meerut SSP gave strict instructions to SHOs not to allow any “mob formation”.

Meerut SSP Ajay Sahni said, “All the station house officers were instructed to ensure that no crowd assembles on various road crossings and police were deployed at every location. All the station house officers were instructed to remain on their toes at the major crossings to ensure law and order.”

Members of the Bhim Army had called for a ‘bandh’ on April 2, 2018, to protest against SC/ST Amendment Act. At that time, vehicles were vandalised and burnt on Kankerkhera crossing. Shobhapur police post was also burnt. At least 200 people were arrested and sent to jail at that time.

The intelligence department had alerted the police about possible protests by Bhim Army on February 23, especially in the backdrop of CAA and NRC. In this regard, police officials in Meerut stepped up their security in Soti Ganj, Sadar Bazar, Partapur, Mavana and Parikshit Garh, among other areas.

PUNE: Requesting two men to avoid open defecation near his house on Friday night proved costly for a 45-year-old transport operator from Shel Pimpalgaon near Chakan , about 40km from here.

A man assaulted him with a sharp weapon while his accomplice tried to attack the victim’s tenant. The victim, Avinash Shitole, sustained blows on his back, left hand and near his left ear. Shitole’s tenant escaped unhurt as he dodged the blows.

The Chakan police arrested Nitin Karale (21) and Sandip Sonawane (30) both of Shel Pimaplgaon under sections 307 (murder attempt) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC.

Shitole was discharged from the hospital on Sunday night. He told TOI that on Friday around 9.15pm, he was sitting outside his house. “I heard some noise, so I went to check along with my tenant Ramu Prajapati. I saw two men defecating in the open near my house,” Shitole said.

He requested them not to do it in the open. “Karale began abusing me and removed a sharp weapon and threatened to kill me. He assaulted me. I received three blows on my body and fell,” Shitole said. The other man tried attacking Prajapati. “He dodged the blow and fled. My relatives took me to a hospital,” he said. “We have arrested the duo” a Chakan police officer said.

AGRA: Fragrance of jasmine and itra will welcome US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at the Taj Mahal today. Hundreds of garlands of jasmine and dozens of diffusers with itra, especially supplied from Kannauj, have been placed in the vicinity of the Taj.

On February 19, during his visit to Agra to check preparations for hosting the state guests on February 24, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had expressed discontent over stench in the vicinity of the monument. Mayor Naveen Jain had told CM that it is due to the Taj east drain. The CM had issued strict orders to the local authorities to get time-bound solution for the problem.

On the next day, the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) started deep cleaning of the Taj east drain located just 200 metres away from the east side of the monument.

Using bioenzymes supplied from Visakhapatnam, on Friday, phytoremediation process was started to reduce foul smell emanating from the drain.

According to the civic body officials, the scientific process takes 72 hours to remove any foul smell from the time it is implemented.

AMC executive engineer (environment) Rajeev Rathi said, “Phytoremediation process is doing its job. Best results will emerge by Monday morning. Now, no foul smell can be experienced in the vicinity of the Taj Mahal. The jasmine flower garlands and diffusers with itra have been placed by the horticulture department.”

The civic body in coordination with the horticulture department has installed pots of variety of flowers on footpaths and at roundabouts. Exotic flowers have been planted on the road dividers.

Meanwhile, teams of AMC workers began final washing of the 14-kilometre VVIP route from Kheria airbase to Taj Mahal on Sunday afternoon. Trees on the route are also being washed using water sprays. The work will continue till 12 noon on Sunday.

PUNE: The 3 Maharashtra NCC Air Squadron of Pune has started giving four air sorties to its senior division air cadets to acquaint them with flying training and teach nuances of aircraft and its cockpit systems.

The squadron could arrange only one or no air sortie to air cadets due to administrative reasons like unavailability of aircraft and runway in the recent past. As a result, most of the cadets could only learn the theory aspect of the training.

The city’s NCC’s Group Headquarters got two new microlight aircraft – Pipistrel Virus SW 80s — to facilitate flight training for its cadets in 2018. Since then, the squadron has been conducting training sessions on a regular basis at the NDA runway.

“Our endeavour is to give maximum first-hand flying experience to our cadets. Hence, we have increased sorties from one to four for the first time. In the first sortie, air cadets just get confidence about flying and in subsequent sorties, they understand many aspects of aircraft system and its functioning. This clears several concepts that they have learned in theory syllabus,” Wing Commander Vikram Thiagaraman, commanding officer of the squadron, said. The flight training curriculum stated that an air cadet would accompany an IAF pilot in the cockpit for a sortie that can last in the range of 15 minutes to an hour.

NCC Group Commander Brigadier Suneel Limaye said, “Getting flying experience in the formative years of career makes a positive impact on students. We are also giving flying exposure to rural students.”

It was inaugurated by Madurai MP Su Venkatesan and minister for co-operatives Sellur K Raju, who gave away nutrition kits for pregnant women in the presence of district collector Dr TG Vinay and other senior district officials.

Around 1,000 people took part the medical camp held at Thiru Vi Ka higher secondary school in Aruldaspuram. Doctors from around 10 different specialities including dentistry, dermatology, ophthalmology, gynaecology and orthopaedics were available at the event. “Everyone who registers get their basic height, weight, BMI and blood pressure checked. Then, a general medicine doctor would see them and direct them to the necessary speciality. We even included ECG and ultrasonogram facility for pregnant women,” said a medical officer.

Cancer screening for women, including breast examination was also done. Pregnant women were also educated about various nutritious foods they should include in their diet. Spot registration for getting Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) ID, a unique identification number mandatory for all pregnant mothers, was also done at the mela.

Various exhibits were also kept by health department officials about both communicable and non-communicable diseases including AIDS, dengue and leprosy to create awareness. “We cannot afford to go for health check-ups regularly and nor do we have the luxury of going to different specialists. Such camps are helpful for us since we can find all services of different specialists at one place,” said Kanimozhi K, a resident of Aruldaspuram.

In Tuticorin, a special medical camp and eye care camp was inaugurated by information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju. The minister also gave away free spectacles to those diagnosed with poor eye sight.

NEW DELHI: Walking from Jafrabad metro Station towards Maujpur-Babarpur station , I could never imagine that the second day of the protests would be as ugly as what unfolded in front of my eyes.As I stood a few metres ahead of Maujpur-Babarpur station, I could hear rounds being fired one after the other. My first instinct was that it was a gun going off, but after seeing a white plume of smoke I realised that police were firing tear gas shells. Minutes later, I saw two men running carrying an injured policeman on their shoulder. The cop was rushed away in a police Gypsy.Some youths were putting tilak on the forehead of passersby and when they approached me, I politely refused. The loudspeakers at Maujpur Chowk were constantly blaring “Jai Shri Ram”.I soon saw anti-CAA protesters on one side of the road near Kabir Nagar and pro-CAA agitators on the other side. The small bridge over the drain was the only saving grace as police stood guard there creating a no man’s land. Mediapersons trying to move ahead were asked to stay back as stones were being hurled. The stone-pelters were wearing helmets.Even as police tried to defuse the situation, news of protesters setting a house on fire spread. I ran towards the chowk and saw a tower of smoke coming out from near a garbage dump. I saw a mob breaking the locks of shops with lathis and throwing something on fire inside.When I tried to capture it on my cellphone, a youth shouted: “Snatch her phone.

A mob soon came charging towards us and I managed to hang on to a railing with the help of TOI photojournalist Anindya Chattopadhyay. This happened twice.I walked back to Maujpur Chowk and saw a 60-strong mob asking a man walking out of Kabir Nagar for his identity and then thrashing him. Police rushed in and the man with a bloody face was carried away by four people. I next saw a man breaking the nameplate of a bakery with the others around him clapping gleefully.The biggest fear I witnessed was walking out of the area. Walking over the stones and bricks, people thought I was a stone-pelter. Luckily, I and two other reporters managed to reach our car. The fear of a stone being thrown from a rooftop hitting me still haunts me.

Varanasi: District administration, police and education department officials in Ballia are making concerted efforts to hit at the root of copying mafia who are still facilitating admissions to candidates as regular students in local colleges assuring help in copying during examinations.

District magistrate, Ballia, Hari Pratap Shahi on Saturday talked to 43 students from Saharanpur and Shahjahanpur districts of UP and also from Uttarakhand, who quit the examination as they were not helped by copying mafia as promised, and directed Bansdih police to lodge FIRs against the persons named by the candidates.

Talking to TOI on Sunday, Shahi said: “These 43 students revealed how they were contacted by middlemen, who offered them to facilitate admission as regular students in schools and colleges in Ballia and get registered for UP Board examination without attending classes.”

He said the accused men had even assured students that they would help them pass the examination. “The students said despite paying huge amount they could not get chance for copying due to which they had no option but to quit the examination,” Shahi said.

He said in view of notoriety earned by Ballia due to copying mafia in the past, the district administration ensured deployment of static supervisors at all 213 examination centres in Ballia, besides deploying zonal and sector magistrates.

These measures are apart from implementation of all other directives of state government like covering examination rooms with CCTV network and webcasting of all centres.

District inspector of schools (DIoS), Ballia, Bhaskar Mishra said: “Besides these 43 students, 12,431 examinees of high school and 8,049 of intermediate have quit UP Board examination in the district this year. As many as 82,206 and 77,099 students, respectively, were enrolled for high school and intermediate examinations.”

Earlier, sector magistrate and tehsildar Gulab Chandra ensured the arrest of a peon Biskut Yadav. An FIR was lodged against Yadav and Ram Kumar Shukla, manager of Sukhpura Public Higher Secondary School, on Saturday in connection with copying.

SDM, Bansdih, Dushyant Kumar Maurya in Ballia also detected a case of mass copying at Panchev Devi Rajmuni Devi Inter College in Bigahi Bahuara. A case was registered against the centre in charge who managed to escape.

The DIoS said re-examination of physics (intermediate) examination at a centre in Bhauara area had been recommended following detection of mass copying.

“So far, 35 students have been caught for copying. A candidate was arrested after it was found that he was appearing for both high school and intermediate examinations,” he said.

84,['24/02/2020'],"To cut costs, Jaipur metro phase-II route will be totally elevated","This story is from February 24, 2020

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot addresses a gathering at Birla Auditorium on Sunday

JAIPUR: Jaipur Metro phase-II corridor proposed between Ambabari and Sitapura, which was scheduled to run partially underground, will be entirely elevated.

To reduce the cost of the Rs 13,000-crore project, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has proposed to construct approximately 23-km corridor overground.

Sources said the DMRC had prepared the revised DPR, which is likely to be forwarded to the state government this week. The approval of detailed project report (DPR) will be made in the state cabinet meeting.

The project cost is expected to be reduced to half if it is elevated. “Now, we have proposed to construct an elevated corridor on major part of the route. While construction cost of an elevated corridor is Rs 200 crore per km, it goes up Rs 550 crore per km underground,” said a senior Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) official.

In the DPR prepared in 2014, it was mentioned that project required land worth Rs 2,000 crore. “It would require less amount than mentioned in the previous DPR. The estimated cost for acquiring land will be reduced to Rs 800,” said a source

The official further said Metro stations, which will be constructed under the Jaipur Metro Phase-II, will not be lavish and spacious as the existing ones. JMRC has proposed to construct small structures, which would occupy less land and need less funds. The decision was taken after taking a cue from Delhi and Chennai. To bring the cost down, suggestion to run three coaches has been also been proposed.

“Many cities in past adopted rationalisation method during the construction of new Metro projects. In Jaipur too, few ways including reducing width of the viaduct by 15%, cutting down length of Metro stations, reducing size of the two Metro rail depots and outsourcing fare collection system are proposed,” said a JMRC official.

After the change in regime, hope of launching the Phase-II project has revived as Metro was the pet project of chief minister Ashok Gehlot in his previous tenure. The JMRC prepared its first DPR in 2011 during the Congress government’s tenure.

New Delhi: A day before the Centre begins the process of seeking environment clearances (EC) for the new Parliament and Central Vista project , Delhi high court on Monday heard a plea challenging the move .

The court asked the Centre and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to respond to the plea seeking that no EC be granted to cut trees for the expansion and renovation of the Parliament building, which is part of the Central Vista redevelopment project. Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued a notice to the housing ministry and CPWD to submit their stand on the application filed by a Delhi resident, Anuj Srivastava.

While refusing to stay the ministry’s expert appraisal committee from entertaining CPWD’s application for EC on Tuesday, the judge said its decision must be communicated to the court immediately.

Srivastava has earlier filed another petition opposing the entire project on the ground that it involves a change in the land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices. On Monday, the court pointed out that even if EC was granted, CPWD could not cut trees as the main legal challenge on the land-use change had been pending.

Appearing for CPWD, additional solicitor general Maninder Acharya assured the court that the trees cut for the project would be transplanted at a suitable location and if any of them didn’t survive, trees aged 7-8 years would be planted as replacement.

AMROHA: A pedestrian, who “in all likelihood” got mowed down while crossing Delhi-Lucknow highway in UP’s Amroha, was reduced to bones as hundreds of vehicles passed over his body taking away bit-by-bit of his flesh in their tyres for over 12 hours, without noticing him.

According to sources, there were several police response vehicles in the region around National Highway 9, but none noticed the body or got any information about it lying in the middle of road.

The man allegedly met with the accident on Saturday evening, soon after the darkness fell, and police was informed about it on Sunday morning. In between, hundreds of heavy and small vehicles continued to trample on it. Police had to scrape off the remains of the body from the road. It was only in the post-mortem room that doctors and policemen identified the gender of the body with his clothes.

“There is still no clue about who he was,” a police officer said, adding that the incident took place close to Shahwazpur gate in Amroha’s Gajraula area.

Gajraula’s station house officer (SHO) Jaiveer Singh said, “The accident might have taken place during the wee hours of Sunday. The body was crushed badly. It was very difficult for us to lift the pieces. It has been sent to district hospital for autopsy. We will preserve its DNA for identification.”

The incident brought to the fore the apathy of the passersby, and also that of local police. There were several ‘Dial 100’ cars patrolling on the stretch of NH-9, but none got the information about the body.

On June 5, 2016, a man was crushed to death on NH-74 and hundreds of vehicles passed over him in a similar manner. He is yet to be identified.

“In the city, most of the deaths are due to own-damage or accidents involving pedestrians and not involving multiple vehicles,” he said.

“Apart from accident reduction, the centre median will also help to streamline parking on city roads. Once median is introduced, space available for parking of vehicle will be reduced. Naturally, no one will park on a road realizing the disturbance it would cause to traffic movement,” he said.

DMK president M K Stalin

MADURAI: “The Palaniswami government has no right to celebrate the birth anniversary of Jayalalithaa as girl child protection day, when crimes against women are on the rise in Tamil Nadu ,” said DMK president M K Stalin on Sunday.

Stalin was addressing a meeting organized in Madurai as part of welcoming former AIADMK minister R S Raja Kannappan with thousands of his followers to the DMK. Pointing at the death of Subashree in Chennai and the Pollachi crimes against women, he said that the government has no right to celebrate the day.

He said that he did not want to politicize the issue, but a Tamil magazine, in its recent issue, had spoken about deputy speaker Pollachi Jayaraman’s son’s involvement in the crime in which more than 250 women were abused. “People booked as goondas in the case have been released, because police had not registered the case properly. But Stalin will not rest till the real culprits are brought to book, and this would be ensured once we came to power,” he said.

The AIADMK government was only interested in its own wellbeing and did not care about people. It is also making false claims about its achievements, he said. “I have been asking Edappadi K Palaniswami to come out with a whitepaper on his claims of Rs 3 lakh crore investments. It is not done and he continues to fool people,” he said.

The government is talking about its achievements, as they have gone down in all indexes compared to other states, including human resources, economic growth, and industrial growth. But it stood second in crimes against women, he said.

The AIADMK government is full of corruption. There are pending cases of corruption and wealth accumulation. Even a case against Edappadi K Palaniswami is pending before the court. Stays can be obtained for these cases till AIADMK is in power, but its rule will come to an end in 12 months. Then these cases will be taken up, he said.

Stalin said that Palaniswami was also trying to fool farmers by declaring the delta region as a protected agricultural zone without doing anything. He also listed out the developmental activities in the state, from naming of airports after Kamarajar and Anna, metro rail, roads and bridges and said that all of them had been implemented during the DMK rule.

Former AIADMK minister R S Raja Kannappan, who switched over to the DMK with his followers, said that the AIADMK had become a rule of slavery, corruption and commission and that he was joining the DMK as he saw Stalin as the future of Tamil Nadu.

Former ministers K N Nehru, I Periyasamy and Madurai North DMK organising secretary P Moorthy spoke.

Jaipur: Looking at the drop in national rankings and poor performance of the districts in four different categories under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Grameen ( PMAY-G ), additional chief secretary, rural development and panchayati raj, Rajeshwar Singh has expressed concern over this. He has directed collectors to complete the Aadhaar seeding of the beneficiaries and complete construction of the remaining 19,616 houses at the earliest to improve the state's tally in the rankings.

The top ranking by a Rajasthan district is 29th (Ganganagar) and lowest ranking is 250th (Tonk). In 2018-19, the state’s ranking in implementation of the scheme was 3rd and 4th. Now, the overall ranking of state has slipped below 4th position.

Currently, Aadhaar seeding of 1.76 lakh beneficiaries is yet to be done in all the districts. “Due to shortfall in the 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding of the registered beneficiaries in 2019-20, the state has a deficit 1.48 points compared to the other states,” the order stated.

The order states, even after four years of introduction of the scheme, the Permanent Wait List (PWL) has not been uploaded on AwaasSoft in 96 gram panchayats across the state and due to this 7,881 beneficiaries are still deprived of the benefits of the scheme. “The total deficit due to this is 1.54 points (compared to other states). This has affected the state’s overall ranking directly,” it states.

Therefore, the collectors have been directed to upload the PWLs on AwaasSoft in two days.

MANGALURU: The markings for all the new and existing speed-breakers will be done within 10 days, said MCC commissioner Shanady Ajith Kumar Hegde .

“The new asphalted speed-breakers only pose a hazard to motorists who are involved in erratic driving,” he alleged.

Shanady’s response comes after several complaints from motorists and the public that unmarked speed-breakers pose a hazard to motorists in the city.

On Wednesday, TOI carried a report on how unmarked speed-breakers pose a hazard to motorists in Mangaluru city.

One social activist from city said, “With the Mangaluru City Corporation hardly being bothered about spending a little more on the warning signs which are very necessary, it has put vehicle users at risk. One evening a few days ago, a two-wheeler rider went flying after he failed to notice an unmarked speed-breaker, and crashed into the divider, after which he bounced and fell back on to the road. Larger vehicles had to swerve away with their tyres screeching, to avoid hitting him. The motorist’s full-face helmet was unstrapped and perched on his forehead, resulting in him sustaining deep scratches to his face. He managed to limp away to safety. The incident took place near Nanthur.

In another accident, which took place on Wednesday morning, a mother taking her son to school, fell down from her scooter, as she failed to notice the new speed breaker installed near Kadri. She and her son escaped with a few bruises.”

The new and old speed-breakers with no marking, pose a great danger, especially at night, when motorists cannot see them.

“We cannot highlight speed-breakers immediately after they are asphalted. It has a curing period for two weeks, only after which the white marking is done. MCC has built more than 40 speed-breakers in the city limits as per Indian Roads Congress (IRC) standards. IRC is the apex body of highway engineers in the country. According to my knowledge, only erratic drivers are at risk due to them,” said Hegde.

MEERUT: With two more patients testing positive, the number of swine flu cases has risen to 37 in Meerut on Sunday. Despite efforts, the health department is yet to contain the H1N1 virus.

“As many as 37 patients have tested positive for swine flu in Meerut so far. The number of cases has been on the rise since January-end. In this backdrop, all the residents are being advised to ensure cleanliness and hygiene so that the infection doesn’t spread,” said Dr Rachna Tandon, Meerut district epidemiologist.

“We have over 20,000 Tamiflu tablets – which is enough stock. When and if needed, more stock will be procured from the state authorities. Awareness camps are being set up in the district to spread awareness about the disease and also inform locals about the symptoms to look out for. They are also being informed about the preventive measures that one should take,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

The flu spreads from person to person either by inhaling the virus or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth or nose. Fever, cold, cough and vomiting are common symptoms, which may prove fatal if not attended to on time. Therefore, one must consult a doctor as soon as possible.

Doctors have advised that only one member of the family should engage in taking care of a swine flu patient to prevent everyone from contracting the infection. One should wash one’s hands frequently, wear a mask when in the vicinity of the patient, take care of cleanliness inside the patient’s room and use separate utensils for the patient, doctors said.

In areas where swine flu cases have been detected, surveillance is being conducted to check if there are more cases in proximity. Awareness camps are also being organized there so that people in those areas are aware about it. Also, epidemiological study and travel history of patients is being checked, the health department authorities said.

He was speaking after launching a new TNSTC service from the Arapalayam bus stand here in the presence of the district collector Dr T G Vinay, corporation commissioner S Visakan and MLAs on Sunday.

“DMK president M K Stalin is trying to divide the people for his personal gains by spreading false information among Muslims and minorities,” he added.

JAIPUR: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) Jaipur is geared up to receive Air Force One carrying US president Donald Trump in case weather plays truant in Delhi on Monday.

As a backup plan, a US Air Force Boeing 757 landed here on Sunday evening to ferry Trump in case there is a technical snag in his plane. In addition, a C-17 Globemaster landed here for the second day with some more equipment needed for ground-handling.

According to sources, at least 50 people including security personnel, officials of US embassy, technical surveillance experts and others are already in town to take care of arrangements.

Reliable sources from Jaipur airport said security personnel from the US arrived in the Boeing 757. The aircraft landed at 7.48 pm.

However, citing security concerns Jaipur airport authorities refrained from commenting much on the developments.

“We are not much aware on this. We have received a Boeing 757 aircraft of America at our airport. We don’t have any further directions or intimation about it,” said a senior officer at the airport.

Jaideep Singh Balhara, director, Jaipur airport said, “All what I can tell you is that we are ready in case the aircraft carrying American president Trump and others land here. Our airport is an alternative airport in case Delhi’s weather goes awryon Monday.”

Security has also been fortified in and around Jaipur airport. “If this diversion happens, we may witness the landing of the aircraft carrying Trump and his team by 1pm to 1.30 pm on Monday,” said an officer.

MUMBAI: Gangster Ravi Pujari , on the run for 20 years, was hauled to India on Sunday by officers from the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) and the Karnataka Police , who camped in Senegal for three days to obtain the fugitive’s custody. The plane carrying Pujari arrived in Delhi on Sunday afternoon via Paris. Pujari is the latest in a long line of criminals including Abu Salem, Chhota Rajan , Ejaz Lakdawala to have been deported or extradited to India.

Sources said Pujari was taken to an undisclosed location where he was questioned by RAW, IB and Union home ministry officials for more than four hours. A source said he was showing symptoms of high blood pressure and diabetes. He was taken to a hospital for a check-up before being handed over to Karnataka Police. In the evening, he was to be flown to Bengaluru, as confirmed to TOI by Karnataka DG & IGP Praveen Sood.

Pujari, who jumped bail and went missing after being nabbed in Senegal 13 months ago, was rearrested in a remote village in South Africa on Saturday and taken back to Senega l.

Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai told TOI th e ministry of external affairs had coordinated Pujari’s deportation. “(He was to be) brought to Bengaluru as early as possible. There were a few legal hurdles which have been sorted out,” Bommai sai d.

Pujari has over 200 cases against him in India, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion. Ninety of those cases are in Karnataka, including 39 in Bengaluru and 36 in Mangaluru. The most well known of them include the murder of builder Om Prakash Kukreja and an attempt on the life of advocate and MP Majeed Memon.

Senior Union home ministry and external affairs ministry officials coordinated with Senegalese authorities to deport Pujari at the earliest. Compared to extradition, a long-drawn process, deportation is simpler. The team that was with Pujari on his flight included Bengaluru cops led by joint commissioner of police Sandeep Patil, and additional DGP Amar Kumar Pandey.

Ne ws of Ravi Pujari’s rearrest was kept secret as the agencies did not want to risk a repeat of what happened last year: Pujari got a false cheating case registered against himself in Senegal and delayed deportation; later, he jumped bail and went missin g.

Sources say the Union government plans to hand over all Pujari cases to the CBI , like it did for gangster Chhota Rajan, with state police departments assisting investigations.

Pujari’s arrest brings the curtains down on another chapter in Mumbai’s gangland era. Barring Dawood Ibrahim, who is a fugitive living in Pakistan, and some of his accomplices, many others including Abu Salem, Dawood’s brother Iqbal Kaskar, Chhota Shakeel ’s brother-in-law Arif , Pujari’s own aide Ashok Devadiga, Tariq Parveen, late Mustafa Dossa, Bunty Pandey, Chhota Rajan, Santosh Shetty, Fazlu Rahman, and Ejaz Lakdawala were all brought to heel.

AA Road, which connects Arasaradi with DD Road at Arapapalayam bus terminal

MADURAI: AA Road, which connects Arasaradi with DD Road at Arapapalayam bus terminal , is riddled with potholes and giving bumpy ride to hundreds of motorists using it regularly.

The busy road, which connects important commercial areas and thick residential areas on either sides, has been in shambles for long although intermittent patch work have been carried out.

More than the bumpy ride, motorists are concerned about the safety of people as potholes result in accidents. P Vijayaragavan from Melaponnagaram said, “AA Road is not only giving bumpy ride to commuters, it also poses threat to people as many make sudden turn to avoid hitting potholes. It results in accidents.”

The traffic on this road is peak in the morning and evening as a large number of parents and students use it to reach schools. “If the entire stretch is in a bad shape, people will drive slowly. But, it has sudden potholes which result in people making sudden stops and turns. While regular commuters know the road well and adjust to the condition, incidents happen because of people who rarely take this road,” said K Vijayan, a resident of Ellis Nagar.

CPM area secretary for Melaponnagaram V Stalin said that apart from AA Road, nearby stretches like DD Road, New Jail Road and Melaponnagaram Main Road are also in a bad shape. They had recently staged a protest mobilizing public highlighting pathetic condition of the road, but officials are yet to act. They have also met officials in zonal level and petitioned them to take up road works, he said.

When contacted, an official from Madurai corporation that they will fix the road in a few days. He acknowledged the problem on other roads too and said that all roads will be taken up for repair one by one.

The award carries a purse of Rs 25,000, and will be presented to these achievers at the two-day Abbakka Utsav that the district administration is organising at Assaigoli Central Ground in Konaje village near here from February 29, said district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari.

Announcing the names of the awardees on Sunday, Poojari said a seminar and poets meet will be held in the run up to the utsav at Ravindra Kala Bhavan of University College on Thursday. Kotresh, HoD of history, Tumkur University, will chair the seminar on the topic ‘Tulunadina Raniyaru’. Arathi H N, senior programme executive, Doordarshan, Bengaluru, will chair the multi-language poets meet to be held later that afternoon.

The administration has arranged for essay and painting competitions for primary and high school students at St Jerosa High School, Jeppu, at 9.30am on Tuesday.

106,['24/02/2020'],Sathwaras flagged for genetic disorder,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Ahmedabad: Practice of marriages within specific geo-cultural groups has led to founder mutations of genes in several parts of India. While two communities from Gujarat were flagged by researchers for genetic disorders earlier, experts on Sunday said that new studies have also identified Sathwara community in Gujarat and Agarwals of Mumbai having tendency for founder mutation leading to muscular dystrophy (MD).

Dr Siddharth Shah, a paediatric neurologist based in Ahmedabad, said that their study on Sathwara community has found genes responsible for the same type of MD. “In an earlier study of Agarwal community in Mumbai, it was found that two ancestral founder mutations were leading to MD. It might have arisen due to the practice of intra-communal exogamy,” said Shah. He was speaking on the sidelines of Annual CME Conference 2020 organized on theme of ‘Diagnosis, Screening, Treatment and Prevention of Rare Diseases.’

While prevalence of MD is very low — 1 case per two lakh live child births — such knowledge can help identify the signs earlier and can also motivate the community members to go for genetic match before matrimonial, said experts.

Dr Jayesh Sheth, chairman of the conference and chairman of city-based Institute of Human Genetics, said that earlier studies had pointed at prevalence of Tay Sachs in Parmar and Morquio in Patidar communities due to mutation of specific genes present in the community. “The motive of the conference is to encourage more paediatricians, neurologists and general practitioners to go for genetic tests for identification of rare diseases,” he said. “The school health programme is now identifying several of these cases.”

The conference highlighted rise in prevalence of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a disorder where the person’s adrenal glands doesn’t function normally and affects metabolism and immune system among other symptoms. Practitioners said that they used to see about three to four cases annually but now a few of the practitioners are attending to three to four cases on monthly basis.

BOX

‘These disorders can be treated’

Dr Nitish Vora, a city-based paediatric neurologist and one of the speakers at the event, talked on diagnostic approaches to paediatric neurology diseases. “Collectively, genetic disorders affect about 15% of the total population which is not a small number. Many of these disorders can be treated and can also be prevented from spread in next generation with proper treatment. Need of the hour is better awareness and genetic tests,” he said. Dr Vykunta Raju, a speaker from Bengaluru, said that in Karnataka availability of specialists in identification and treatment of these disorders has increased in past few years which has resulted in better identification and treatment.

BOX

Disintegration of nerve cells

In multi-centre study published in Journal of Human Genetics last year, the researchers found that a specific gene mutation leading to Tay Sachs disease — leading to disintegration of nerve cells in brain and spinal cord — was found in five of the patients, which was 14% of the study, from Gujarat. Median year of detection was 15 years and boys’ number was slightly higher than the girls. Experts at the conference on Sunday said that they have advised dissemination of information related to the mutations not with the names or genes but common symptoms associated with it so that even the health professionals in rural areas can conduct primary screening for the same.

MANGALURU: There are no foreseeable signs of water scarcity in the coming summer across Dakshina Kannada . The district administration in conjunction with the panchayat raj department has already taken stock of the situation at a review meeting recently, and will periodically keep reviewing the water situation based on which future decisions will be taken, said Kota Shrinivas Poojari , minister for fisheries and religious endowment.

Interacting with the media on Sunday, Poojari, also district minister, said there is steady inflow of water into Thumbe vented dam, the main source of potable water for this coastal city. The administration is maintaining water at a level of six metres at the dam, and excess water is being allowed to overflow from the vented dam, he said. The survey to determine the land that will be submerged if the water level is raised to 7 metres too is under way, he said.

Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh said state chief secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar, who visited the vented dam recently, too has suggested that the district administration and Mangaluru City Corporation maintain the water level at its present height of six metres. As things stand now, we do not foresee any immediate water scarcity even as summer is approaching, she said, basing this optimistic assessment on continuing inflow into the vented dam.

Noting that the district administration is carrying out a survey to determine the extent of land that will be submerged if the water level is raised by an additional metre, Sindhu said another road barrage-cum-vented dam that the minor irrigation department is constructing at Adyar, downstream from the Thumbe vented dam, will further augment water availability. This barrage is expected to be ready in the coming two years, and tenders for it have been finalised, she said.

KANPUR: Activists , allegedly belonging to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), on Sunday morning created ruckus at Shiv Katra area of Chakeri in the city over ‘religious conversion’ of people.

After knowing about the incident, the circle officer (CO) Cantt RK Chaturvedi along with heavy police reached the spot, pacified the mob and brought the situation under control.

According to police sources, the VHP activists reached the house of one Anand Singh in Shiv Katra locality that was being used as a church and alleged that religious conversion of people to Christianity was going on there.

The CO said a probe into the matter was on and Anand Singh was being questioned.

“We have questioned Anand Singh, who denied the VHP’s allegation of religious conversion. He claimed that as usual, Sunday prayer was underway at one of the rooms which he often used as a church in his house. Security has been beefed up in the locality to prevent any untoward incident” the CO said. “Both groups have lodged complaints. After verifying the facts, police will register an FIR,” he added.

To recall in July 2019, a right-wing group had created a ruckus over suspicion of conversions by a pastor in Kashiram Colony of the city. The pastor was allegedly beaten by the activists over rumours of conversion.

AHMEDABAD: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has asked the Army Cantonment Board to permit Class X and XII students taking the board exam to use the cantonment’s internal roads.

The board’s officials have requested the cantonment to allow students going back home from the exam centres to drive through the cantonment and exit at Ghevar Circle. Mrugen Shah, the city coordinator of the examination and principal of Prakash High School, said that 417 examinees will be affected. The examination is scheduled to begin at 10am.

Shah said six to seven teachers have been given the task of ensuring that —if required — students are moved to the main gates of the cantonment. That will enable the parents to pick up their wards from the other side of the cantonment from Ghevar Circle.

Shah said that usually parents are not permitted inside the premises of the exam centres but as a special case, they will allowed inside the compound. The exam hall will remain out of bounds for parents. Shah said that CBSE chairwoman Anita Karwal has had a telephonic talk with the police commissioner to ensure that students are not stopped on their way to exam centres.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia proposed Goel’s name for the post of speaker

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Ram Niwas Goel was unanimously elected as the speaker of the Delhi assembly for the second consecutive term on Monday.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia proposed Goel’s name for the post of speaker, which was supported by MLAs Kuldeep Kumar, Satyendar Jain, Praveen Kumar, Dinesh Mohaniya, S K Bagga, Vishesh Ravi and Raghav Chadha. The motion was passed by voice vote without any opposition.

Elected from Shahdara, this is Goel’s third term as an MLA of Delhi assembly. He was first elected on a BJP ticket in 1993. In 2015, Goel was elected as an AAP legislator.

Pro tem speaker Shoaib Iqbal presided over the House when the election took place. Goel was escorted to the chair by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri.

Kejriwal appreciated the fact that Goel had been unanimously elected by both ruling and opposition members. “In the past five years, we saw that Ram Niwas Goel-ji was like ‘Bhishma Pitamah’ of the House. He also did not give any opportunity to the opposition to complain against him,” he said.

Congratulating Goel on being elected unopposed, Sisodia said, a “new story of development” would be written under his guidance. “Under your leadership, the government will work towards developing all Delhi constituencies on a faster pace,” he said.

Opposition Leader Bidhuri said he and Goel were members of the first House of the reconstituted assembly in 1993. Bidhuri, who was then a Janata Dal member, said the then speaker, Charhti Lal Goel, had not only allowed him to raise the issue of water crisis but even cajoled the BJP government to support it. “I urge you to give as much time to the opposition as you give to the MLAs of party in government,” Bidhuri said, adding that BJP would offer its full cooperation in running the House.

Thanking the MLAs for his re-election, Goel said he hoped that the opposition would play a good role and promised to give sufficient time to all for constructive debates.

Allahabad: Asking former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav to stop “daydreaming like Mungerilal”, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Sunday said the Samajwadi Party cycle would slow down in the 2022 assembly polls and the party would not be able to win even 51 seats.

Maurya was reacting to the SP president’s recent claim of returning to power in the state by winning 351 seats.

He said the people have seen the all-round development in the state and the BJP would again form the government in the state in 2022.

Speaking at the ‘Pichra Vaishya Mahakumbh’ organised under the banner of Bharatiya Janata Party on KP College ground here, he said the BJP-led central and state governments are working for the welfare of all sections. “Bua, Bhateeje and others have lost their ground on political pitch... The Congress has also drastically lost its vote bank,” he said.

“Gone are the days when Kanwariyas were not allowed to sing bhajans. They are now greeted with rose petals.” he added.

Chief guest and Union railway minister Piyush Goel said: “The Vaishya community has been supporting the party since the days of Jansangh. This Mahakumbh will help spread the message across the country that entire ‘Pichra Vaishya Samaj’ is supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.”

Talking about the welfare policies launched by the Centre like Ayushman Bharat Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, the minister said: “We introduced Vande Bharat Express on February 15, 2019, and after one year of its completion, we have brought Kashi Mahakal Express to serve the people.” He claimed that the Modi government had also brought a pension plan for traders which is benefiting them across the country.

Goel said, “It was BJP which formed the traders’ welfare board... Since the party came to power in the state, traders are doing business without any fear.”

State BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said: “The country is in the safe hands of PM Narendra Modi and the country has emerged as a strong power.”

Besides, the door lock for gunners in three vehicles were defunct was, while six vans did not have functional sirens.

“Security personnel travelling in just five cash transit vans knew the right procedure to lock cash boxes using chains and clamps. However, the locks on the vans’ back doors were in poor state,” Pankaj said.

Police also found that the cash carry boxes in all vans checked during the drive were not as heavy as mandated. They also saw that many vans were still being used to transport cash, despite not being in good condition.

ALLAHABAD: A day after a couple was found dead inside a locked room at Saiyed Sarawan village in Kaushambi, a young couple was found critically injured near Bharwari railway station under Kokhraj police limits in Kaushambi on Sunday.

Satish (20) and Puja (18) — residents of Jalalpur Gorian village — were rushed to Manjhanpur district hospital from where they were referred to SRN hospital in Allahabad. Additional SP ( Kaushambi) Ashok Kumar said Satish works as a labourer in Allahabad and returned to his native village two days back.

He said: “According to an initial investigation, the couple made an abortive bid to end their life by jumping before a moving train.”

On Sunday morning, locals alerted the police when they spotted them in a critical condition.

Police said the couple was in a relationship for the last three years and they used to meet secretly. A month back, when the girl’s family members came to know about her affair, they stopped her from moving out of the house. On Saturday, the girl managed to give a slip to the family members and reached Manoharganj railway station. She then called up her lover, who too reached Manoharganj. After spending night together, they reportedly jumped before a moving train near Bharwari railway station early on Sunday.

Police, however, said that they are still ascertaining whether the couple jumped before a running train or from a moving train. Once the couple are out of danger, they would be grilled to know the exact sequence of events, police said.

The goon, after threatening her with dire consequences, fled the site when she raised an alarm. She then locked herself in her room and attempted to kill herself by hanging”, said another police official.

“The victim was saved as her parents managed to admit her in a hospital in time,” he added.

SP (rural) Pradyuman Singh said that a probe has been ordered in the matter. “I have instructed inspector Ghatampur to conduct a probe and act accordingly in this regard. Raids are underway to arrest the accused”.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

The public works department (PWD) is constructing Delhi’s longest skywalk — 1.5km long — and a 1.2km underpass in this phase.The construction of the entire project started in November 2014 to decongest Outer Ring Road between IIT and National Highway-8, which will offer relief to people travelling to and from Indira Gandhi International Airport.A PWD official said the construction of the second phase got delayed due to several obstacles, such as clearances from the railways and the Army. In case of the underpass, making the way through large rocks without obstructing traffic movement also took time. The last block — a dispute with the railways over clearing of high-voltage power lines — was cleared a few months ago. The digging work is now going on near Satyaniketan, creating trouble for those heading towards Dhaula Kuan and Naraina.Almost 85% of the Phase-II work has been completed, claimed the official. PWD has also increased the workforce to meet the next deadline, he added.While the skywalk, starting at Durgabai Deshmukh metro station, will be on Benito Juarez Marg, the Y-shaped underpass will have two arms, easing traffic movement on Benito Juarez Marg and San Martin Marg.A senior government official said students of Delhi University’s South Campus would benefit the most from the skywalk. “We hear of several accidents on this stretch and there was no foot overbridge or underpass for safe movement,” he said, adding that the underpass had been designed in a way that it would make maximum use of the unutilised space on the stretch.A coffee shop, which was planned on the skywalk earlier, may be considered again depending on the number of people using the facility, said a PWD official.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74297072,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145928,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deadline-for-longest-skywalk-is-pushed-again-now-to-june-end/articleshow/74291939.cms
130,['24/02/2020'],Clashes between anti-CAA protesters and police leave 8 injured in Aligarh,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Police personnel at the violence-hit area in Aligarh

AGRA: Hundreds of anti-CAA protesters fought a pitched battle with security personnel and a youth, 22, was shot at and seriously injured in the mayhem which erupted on the streets of Old city in Aligarh on Sunday evening.

The violent clashes sent the government and the local administration into a tizzy as they were busy giving final touches to the visit of US President Donald Trump to Agra, just 90 km away from Aligarh.

“Five protesters and three policemen were injured in the clash,” said Muniraj G, Aligarh’s senior superintendent of police (SSP). Mobile Internet services were snapped in the city for 24 hours as a precautionary measure, and the situation was brought under control after additional police force was deployed, he added.

Police claimed that the violence started after a vehicle of a police officer, who was travelling with his family, was pelted with stones by women protesters in Upper Kot area around 4:30pm on Sunday.

However, the protesters claimed that some policemen resorted to “unprovoked” baton-charge after they demanded a tent at a ‘dharna’ site in Shahjamal, where they are holding a sit-in for the last one month against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Aligarh district magistrate (DM) CB Singh said, “Some women students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) were behind the clash and they had turned violent to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the city. They all have been identified and their role is being investigated.”

The DM said that protesters had been given a designated spot to protest, but they were not ready to listen and were trying to spread it to other parts of the city. “Police used tear gas to disperse them after the protesters pelted stones on the police vehicle,” he said.

Police claimed that incidents of stone-pelting also took place in Babri Mandi area after “news about police action” in Upper Kot area spread. However, the situation was brought under control soon, they said.

One of the women protesters, Huma Tariq, who is a teacher and who was present at the protest site in Upper Kot area, told TOI that they had been protesting peacefully and demanding permission to erect tents in Shahjamal as many of them had fallen sick due to the cold weather and heavy rains. “The administration had been denying us the permission and resorted to unprovoked ‘lathi-charge’,” she claimed.

Another protester in Shahjamal area, Mohammad Tariq, alleged that police personnel “misbehaved” with the women protesters, and when the men present there protested, they resorted to cane-charge. He admitted that in retaliation, some protesters did pelt stones on the policemen.

131,['24/02/2020'],13-year-old clerical error lands 545 rural hamlets on bumpy roads in Telangana,"This story is from February 24, 2020

HYDERABAD: A clerical error by state officials has been haunting 545 habitations in Telangana for the past 13 years, depriving them of good motorable roads as nearly Rs 800 crore central funds is stuck in bureaucratic maze. Instead of “unconnected” roads, the note from then undivided Andhra Pradesh seeking funds under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY) mentioned it as “connected”, leading to the fund impasse.

The requisition in 2007 from panchayat raj and rural development seeking central funds for developing roads in rural hinterland stated on paper that 676 habitations were “connected” by tar roads when, in effect, 545 habitations had only dirt roads. These 545 hamlets, with a population of 200-500, are located across Telangana (except Hyderabad) and account for 1,469 km of dirt roads which require black top (BT) roads.

The main aim of PMGSY is to provide road connectivity from habitations in rural areas to mandal and district headquarters so that the rural poor and farmers get access to schools, colleges, banks, hospitals and agriculture markets.

“For the past 13 years, every time we have submitted a representation to the Centre about the error, they have said that they would look into it. But not a rupee has been released for road development for these habitations till date,” said Rajasekhar Reddy, panchayat raj and rural development chief engineer in-charge of PMGSY

With the state’s financial position not that good, the Telangana government has now decided to not only pursue the Rs 800 crore for the 545 habitations, but also request the Centre for more funds to develop 4,000 km of rural roads in the state.

Panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao has now taken up the matter with the Centre and also written a letter to director-general of the National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency. State government officials have said that the response from the Centre has been positive and that they were expecting the 13-year-old mistake to be rectified in phase-IV of PMGSY, which starts from April 1 of financial year 2020-21.

Roorkee: The nation-wide call for Bharat Bandh given by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens received lukewarm response in Roorkee.

Heavy security arrangements were put in place in view of the bandh call but no violence was reported as the bandh remained peaceful.

Most shops remained open and the traffic remained normal. However, protesters disrupted vehicular movements for about an hour at the Military Chowk crossing. The agitators gathered there with anti-CAA and anti-NRC placards and raised slogans against the Centre over refusal of reservation in promotion. Later, Mahak Singh, who was leading the protest, handed over a memorandum to joint magistrate Namami Bansal. “The President must curtail wings of the central government as they are dividing the nation for their vested interests,” he said.

KOCHI: In an effort to rehabilitate street vendors in the city, Kochi corporation has mooted a ‘Walk the Street’ project for the old Venduruthy bridge . This will entail kiosks on the bridge.Mayor Soumini Jain has asked the town planning standing committee to explore the feasibility of the project. “As per the Street Vendors Act, we have to rehabilitate street vendors. There are around 2,000 street vendors and a section of them can be given kiosks on old Venduruthy bridge . This would address the issue of rehabilitation to a certain extent. It will also help protect the nearly 84-year-old structure built during the British Raj,” the mayor said. “We should secure the nod from public works department (PWD), which owns the stretch,” she said.TOI had campaigned for protection of the structure by publishing a series of reports. Following this, Aswas Public Amenities Ltd, an independent agency under PWD, had mooted a plan to set up a ‘Walk the Street’ on the 700-metre-long old Venduruthy Road. Though the agency sought the approval from the government for the same, the then secretary of PWD put it on hold and the project was shelved.Old Venduruthy bridge has been lying idle for nearly nine years after traffic was rerouted through the new Venduruthy-Vikrant bridge. According to Sunila Shelvan, chairperson, town planning standing committee of Kochi corporation, the committee would soon explore the possibilities of setting up the ‘Walk the Street’.“We will hold discussions with various stakeholders and take a decision accordingly. We will also consider similar project for the Alexander Parambithara Bridge near Thevara as well,” Shelvan said.The Street Vendors Act, introduced by the Union government, came into force on May 1, 2014. Its objective is to regulate street vending as well as protection of livelihoods. As per the Act, local bodies should identify street vending zones within their limits and shift street vendors.

SECUNDERABAD: The shutting down of the Nizam-era railway printing press at Secunderabad and four others across the country has been postponed from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020.

“The decision of closure of five printing presses in Secunderabad, Mumbai, Howrah, Delhi, Chennai has been deferred for a three-month period by the board,” read a letter addressed to general managers of railway divisions, by C Ravindran, director, railway board.

As much as the decision has brought a sigh of relief for employees and railway unions, the printing press are expected employees to print extra tickets to create a buffer while hiring more people on temporary basis.

“Our printing press has been printing cardboard tickets, forms and documents related to railway operations since the 1880s. The closure of the press means the material printed by us will now be outsourced from private printers, which is not good for railway employees,” a source told TOI.

A tourist boat collided with a Ro-Ro vessel near Fort Kochi boat jetty on Friday

KOCHI: The incident in which a tourist boat collided with a Ro-Ro vessel near Fort Kochi boat jetty on Friday has turned out to be an eye-opener for authorities. The Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) has called for a meeting at Alappuzha on Tuesday to discuss regularizing operations of tourist boats.

Currently, there are no stringent rules regarding the areas of operations of small and large tourist boats in the backwaters and the shipping channel. Officials stressed the need to have proper rules as there is an increase in tourist boat traffic in Kochi backwaters. When services of Kochi Water Metro begin, there will be increased movement of passengers boats too. The boats operated by the state water transport department and Water Metro will focus on passenger services. “These boats operate at a fixed timing along fixed routes. But private tourist boats, particularly those operating from Marine Drive, do not follow a fixed time or route. The movement of these boats has to be regularized without affecting tourism,” said Kerala Inland Vessel (KIV) Rules chief surveyor Renjith M J.

It is pointed out that tourists prefer boat rides to see places like Mattancherry, Willingdon Island, Fort Kochi and Vypeen. This enables them to get a view of Cochin Port, Vallarpadam Terminal and Cochin Shipyard.

Meanwhile, the fisheries department has hinted at the need for regulating movement of fishing boats in the shipping channel. There were instances of fishing boats colliding with passenger boats in the shipping channel.

Ernakulam fisheries deputy director Maja Jose said that their department is keen about creating an awareness among fishing boat operators and owners.

“Those operating fishing boats are unaware of the routes, which they should take while traversing the busy shipping channel. Though buoys have been placed to show direction, they often do not understand its significance. The general practice is to move away when they see a boat or a large vessel,” she said, adding that if experts from KMB are willing to create awareness on the paths that fishing boats should take in the busy backwaters of Kochi, the fisheries department is more than willing to associate with them. The department has funds for conducting such awareness programmes.

Jaipur: A man accused of killing his three children in Nagaur in November last year was arrested from Fatehpur on Saturday.

The accused had been on the run for nearly three months before finally being arrested after police received information through a source. The motive for the murders remain unclear.

Nathuram Banjara hanged his three children to death who were identified as identified as Seema (7), Manisha (5) and Vishal (3).

Ladnun SHO Mukut Bihari said, “His wife had lodged a case against him claiming that he killed the children when she and her mother-in-law were out for work. When they returned home, they found the children dead and the father missing. We lodged a search for him and through a source found out about his location following which he was arrested by our team.”

Cops, however, are yet to find out the motive behind the murders. The SHO added, “We are interrogating Nathuram, but till now he has been unable to give a reason why he killed his children. He was a drunkard and it is highly likely that he was under the influence of alcohol when he killed his children. We questioned his family members, but they have also been unable to give any concrete reason.”

According to the initial investigation, Nathuram was essentially unemployed and his wife and mother ran the house by working as labourers in the village. The accused spent most of his time drinking alcohol and stayed at home to take of the children.

He is currently in police remand till he is produced in court. A case under IPC Section 302 ( murder ) has been registered against him.

137,['24/02/2020'],Collegiums main culprits for rising vacancies in HCs: Government,"This story is from February 24, 2020

NEW DELHI: Blamed for not filling up vacancies in high courts , the Centre has told the Supreme Court that HC collegiums were the main culprits as there was inordinate delay on their part, in some cases going back to more than five years, in recommending names for judgeship after the vacancy arose.

Placing a detailed analysis of the vacancies in HCs and the reasons for delay in filling up the posts, the Centre told a bench of Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph that no names were forwarded by HCs for 199 out of 396 vacancies, some of which occurred way back in 2014. The sanctioned strength of judges in 25 HCs is 1,079 but the working strength, as on February 1, was 683. Some HCs like Patna and Rajasthan have more than 50% vacancies.

Attorney general K K Venugopal told the court, which is examining reasons for delay in appointment of judges, that the Centre was waiting for recommendations from HC collegiums which were yet to forward names for 199 vacancies —134 from the bar and 65 from the judicial service.

Agreeing with the AG’s submission, the bench said, “There is an important aspect which the attorney general emphasises by referring to a chart submitted before us showing the inordinate delay in making recommendations to fill vacancies by high courts. The situation in some high courts is more alarming than the others but it is no better than the others, including the court in the capital of the country.

“Needless to emphasise that chief justices of HCs must endeavour to recommend names against the vacancies as early as possible, even if they are not made at one go. We may also note that there appears to be some hesitation in some courts to recommend names without the earlier list being cleared. We understand that there is no such impediment and it should be a continuing process of recommending names without waiting for the result of the earlier recommendations. Otherwise, the time period to process names is such that by the time appointments take place, another set of vacancies arise which brings the problem of vacancies to square one.”

Blaming HC collegiums for the delay, Venugopal urged the court to issue notice and seek explanation from HCs. But the bench refrained from issuing notice and said, “We desist from doing so at present but call upon registrars of different high courts to send us the vacancy position as on date, when did they arise and number of vacancies likely to arise in the next six months, explaining as to what is the time period within which one can expect recommendations to be made.”

Times News Network

Jaipur: The proposed visit of the Pakistani delegation to Ajmer Dargah is under a cloud. . Two days before the formal start of Urs , the local administration is not clear about the arrival of delegates from the neighbouring country. In Pakistan , however, the selected 240-280 devotees are busy making last-minute preparations.

Officials remained tightlipped on the status of the visit, but have started making preparations to handle the guests.

The local administration, which had red flagged the visit in its internal report submitted to the central agencies on February 15, was taken by surprise to receive directions from Delhi to make the preparations. The officials approached the Dargah committee office on Saturday asking them to begin preparations for the Pakistani guests.

The internal report prepared by the officials, including police said the visit might invite protests from the locals. “Since tension has heightened due to abrogation of Article 370, the chances of pilgrims engaged in arguments or at loggerheads can happen and can create law and order situation,” said an official.

Meanwhile, the delegates in Pakistan have started travelling to Lahore to begin their journey on February 27. Mohammed Hussain, a resident of Pak Pattan, told TOI over the phone that he has been asked by the authorities to be in Lahore on February 26 to collect his stamped visa.

“Our government has told us to assemble in Lahore to complete formalities on or before February 26. We submitted our passports three weeks ago and hoping to travel on time. Since trains from Pakistan from Wagah and Khokrapar are not operating since August, we were told to cross over Wagah by foot and to board buses for Ajmer from Amritsar,” said Hussain.

The delegation did not turn up in the last two years due to tension between the two countries while chances of the visit this year in the wake of abrogation of Article 370 has remained dismal.

Ajmer/Jaipur: RSS national executive member Indresh Kumar on Sunday asked Muslims to support the controversial CAA and hinted discussions on NRC while delivering his keynote address at a national-level Sufi Conference organized by Rastriya Muslim Manch (RMM) in Ajmer on the eve of Urs.

Kumar was initially named in the chargesheet of the 2007 Ajmer Dargah bomb blast. Later, his name was dropped. He is the founder member of the RMM. During the conference, the participants were taken aback when the organiser asked them to raise their hands if anyone would like to settle in Pakistan while making a point that the neighboring country was unpopular among Muslims in India.

“The entire country is gradually accepting CAA and discussions should start on NRC so that peace and tranquility remains in the country,” said Kumar, whose statement is seen as a scope on a possible deliberation on NRC.

Kumar minced no words in support of CAA stated that the Act was in support in Insaniyat (Humanity) while its virodh (against) is shaitaniyat (devil’s act).

“Those against the citizenship law are supporting the persecution of minorities in neighbouring countries,” said Kumar. The conference, which was held on the eve of the largest Muslim gathering in India, is seen as a step by RMM to build consensus over the CAA.

Taking on Shaheen Bagh protesters, he said blocking the passage of anyone or protesting against the rule for Muslims is anti-Islamic acts. “BJP, which is part of the central government, is showing great patience that they have not used any force on places where women and children protestors are present,” said Kumar. He handed over a chadar to be offered at the Dargah.

The conference was attended by participants from 10 states. “Indian Muslims should spread the message of Antim Rasool (Last prophet) of getting cool breeze from India which means peace, universal brotherhood and security. India is the only country which has assimilated all faiths and given them equal respect which should also be propagated by Indian Muslims,” said Kumar.

KOCHI: The fire brigade is having a busy season. It’s only February and some units in the district are attending to over half a dozen calls a day, mostly regarding minor fires.Fire-force personnel say that it is time to stay alert as dry-weather conditions prevail and parched vegetation is waiting for a spark that could ignite a major blaze.“The scorching heat that we are experiencing now can engender two types of fires. There is heavy use of electrical devices such as coolers, fans etc, and short circuit-related incidents can happen at homes. The other category involves fires that break out in the open. These happen more often and can become major fires that can cause heavy losses and even causalities, if not handled carefully,” said district fire officer Gogy J S.According to the fire department, the Eloor (60 cases), Aluva (50), Thrikkakara (55) and Gandhinagar (50) fire stations in the city have received the most number of calls.Most of the blazes are man-made and being careful, itself, can prevent most of them. “It is common for residents to pile up garbage and set it on fire. These fires may not be dangerous, by themselves, but a flare can easily travel in the wind and land on some shrubbery, causing a major fire,” said Gogy.Fire officers say that careless handling of objects like cigarette butts, matchsticks, and other substances that can cause a fire is another reason for fires. Burning of garbage near groves and shrubs, transformers, parked vehicles and other inflammable substances can increase the gravity of the fire, they said.Gandhinagar station officer, A Unnikrishnan, said that many try to clear out plots covered by vegetation during the summer.He said fire personal have taken note of water sources that can be relied on in case of emergencies. “On Saturday, we cleaned the well on the premises and did some basic dredging,” said Unnikrishnan.Two major fires was reported at North Paravur on Sunday evening.

“The fraudster asked the complainant to download AnyDesk app in his phone to update KYC details. After making the complainant install AnyDesk, the accused remotely accessed his cell phone by obtaining the access code from him. Subsequently, the fraudster obtained Paytm account details of the complainant, including UPI PIN and siphoned off Rs 1.03 lakh from his bank account,” cybercrime inspector D Prashant said.

On January 7, T Anand, 59, a private employee from Ameerpet, lodged a complaint with cybercrime sleuths alleging that he received an SMS on January 6 stating that his Paytm account had expired.

“In the message, the fraudsters mentioned a fake contact number of Paytm customer care. When Anand called the fake number, the fraudster made him install TeamViewer QuickSupport remote desktop access app. After the installation of the app, the fraudster gained access to the mobile phone of the victim by obtaining the required code from him. As per the instructions of the fraudster, the accused also made the victim recharge his Paytm wallet with the linked ICICI bank account and made him link his credit card to the wallet, all the while looking at the cell phone details remotely. With the information obtained, they siphoned off Rs 1.88 lakh from his bank account and his credit card,” the inspector said.

Similarly, on January 21, a case was registered based on the complaint of Md Saqib Jawab, an Imam of a mosque in Tolichowki, regarding fraudsters siphoning off Rs 40,000 off him by posing as representatives of Bank of Baroda and making him install AnyDesk app.

According to the cybercrime police, fraudsters also siphoned off Rs Rs 1.96 lakh from the bank account of businessman P Narsing Rao Aravind Kumar of Narayanguda and Rs 99,000 from businessman Dheeraj Agarwal of Bahadurpura, posing as customer care executives of banks or e-wallet services and making them install theQuickSupport app.

143,['24/02/2020'],4 arrested with elephant tusks in Sikar,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Jaipur: Sikar police on Sunday arrested four accused for smuggling elephant tusks weighing approximately 3.5kg. The accused were trying to sell it when they were caught red-handed.

Police are trying to ascertain the means by which the accused got the tusks. The accused are Shivchand, Pratap Jat, Sandeep Jat and Omprakash Jat. While the latter three are in their 30s, Shivchand is in his 50s.

Uma Shankar, SHO, Ramgarh police station, said, “We received information that the accused had on them elephant tusks which they were trying to sell in the area. We formed teams and nabbed them with the animal parts. The consignment comprised elephant tusks and jaw. Each of them was carrying the tusks in certain quantity.”

The tusks were between 5-7 inches long and 1 to 1.75 inches thick. The cops are still trying to find from where the accused procured the banned item. The jaw was approximately 5 to 7 inches in thickness and 1.45 inches in length.

“The investigation is currently under way and we are questioning the accused to find the source from where they got the tusks. There is a nexus which is supplying these tusks, which means there is demand for it in Rajasthan as well. We are interrogating the accused to find out their other gang members as well,” said the official. The accused were booked under Wildlife Protection Act 1972. Cops are also checking the past criminal records of the four arrested to find if they have dealt in some other animal parts.

Elephant is protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. It lists it as ‘most endangered animal’. Poaching it or having any ivory item calls for a minimum three years in jail and Rs 50,000 fine.

Veterinary hospital and animal birth control unit at Brahmapuram

KOCHI: Kickstarting a row, revenue authorities are planning to take over the land where a veterinary hospital and animal birth control (ABC) unit of Kochi corporation is functioning at Brahmapuram for setting up a biomedical waste treatment plant. This is when the ABC unit is proposed to be elevated to the status of training centre for ABC.

A few days ago, revenue officials conducted a survey for allotting three acres to Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly (IMAGE) for setting up the plant. IMAGE was allotted the land from the 115 acres owned by Kochi corporation at Brahmapuram. Still, the land ownership will continue to rest with Kochi corporation. The veterinary hospital and ABC unit is in the said three acres. “So, the ABC unit will have to be closed. This situation should be avoided,” said Gracy Joseph, chairperson, standing committee for development, Kochi corporation. According to ABC officials, they have sterilized around 6,000 street dogs. “We are planning to impart training to vets on animals’ birth control. The current move will affect our firm adversely,” an official said. The ABC unit is located in 35 cents.

Office-bearers of IMAGE said they wouldn’t cause any damage to ABC unit. “The officials conducted survey for allotting three acres to us. The land where the ABC unit is located falls within this. So, the district administration has identified another 25 cents where the ABC unit can be relocated,” said Dr K P Sharaffudeen, IMAGE secretary. “We are ready to set up our office and facilities like road access in the 25 cents. We will set up our facility only after ensuring that the ABC unit is there, it may have to relocated though,” he said.

Cops said the vault contained Rs1.1 crore cash, but the robbers did not touch Rs21.16 lakh

VADODARA/ANAND: In a daring bank robbery, three armed persons looted nearly Rs 90 lakh cash from the Bandhan Bank in ‘Milk City’ Anand on Sunday. The robbers barged into the branch of Kolkata-headquartered private bank located on 100-feet road when two customer relation officers – Anuj Patel and Shabnam Pathan – and two cashiers – Rajvi Shah and Shahnawaz Bhatiyara – were present.

Police said two robbers, who had covered their faces with handkerchiefs, entered the branch and brought down the shutter. They asked the four employees in Hindi to not raise an alarm and demanded the vault’s keys. When the bank staffers did not respond, one of them took out a knife and another pulled out a country-made gun. Shah handed over one bunch of keys to them when threatened and then the third robber also entered.

The four staffers were asked to sit together on a sofa and not move. When the vault did not open, one of them came back asking for second bunch of keys. Shah, who had hidden the keys in the dustbin, had to bring them out as the robbers threatened to kill them. As the vault opened, Shah and Pathan were tied with a cloth in storage room and Patel and Bhatiyara in the pantry.

The robbers then entered the vault and came out after a while with cash. They then locked the four staffers inside the vault and switched off the lights. The robbery came to light only when Pathan called up her husband who rushed to the bank and informed manager of Vidyanagar branch.

Cops said the vault contained Rs1.1 crore cash, but the robbers did not touch Rs21.16 lakh. They also fled with digital video recorder of CCTV cameras installed in the branch manager’s cabin.

Bank officials told police that the branch remains open on Saturday and Sunday as well and that no security guard has been hired by the bank.

“We have alerted police in neighbouring districts and started combing rural areas besides checking in the town. The robbers are believed to be aged in their 30s,” said DySP B D Jadeja.

KOLKATA: The government plans to introduce electric vessels on the Hooghly, aiming to cut down on pollution by replacing the current fleet of old and rickety ferries, which West Bengal Pollution Control Board said, added to the air and water toxicity and noise level.Track the pollution level in your cityWith a massive rise in passenger count using the ferry services across 28 ghats dotting the city and surroundings, the transport department wants to augment the facility, make it safe and at the same time, control pollution so that it turns into a viable means of commute that can ease the pressure on the road network, already creaking under the burden. “We are thinking of introducing at least two electric vessels to understand its viability in our ferry system,” said an official, adding the government was in the process of acquiring 20 modern vessels, complete with improved emission system.The vessels used currently are reportedly big guzzlers of fuel and wreak havoc on the city’s ambient air because they also emit toxic fumes. “Though the pollutants from a ferry disperse fast because it’s all open on a river, the long-term harm being caused to the city’s ambient air is significant,” said a pollution control board official. So, the push for a shift to clean-fuel vessels; the 20 ferries that are being brought in will reportedly make little or no noise whatsoever.This will be part of a government initiative to optimize underutilized river transport and tourism with a $151-million (Rs1,021-crore) assistance from World Bank. While the Centre’s Rs 5,369-crore Ganga Jal Marg project aims at seamless cargo movement along National Waterway-I from Varanasi to Haldia, the state is primarily exploring the potential of cargo and passenger movement on river.Bengal shares 560km of the 1,380km NW-I, which has only 12 bridges over it, including three in Kolkata. The World Bank-aided project aims to fill the gap by adding 10 roll-on-roll-over or Ro-Ro services, which offer seamless solution to ferry vehicles, with passengers on board, and cargo. According to state sources, each of the new Ro-Ro facilities will cost around Rs 25 crore, and the cost will include setting up of specialised jetties as well.The state will also build 56 modern jetties at Rs 4 crore each and renovate 24 existing jetties along the 156-km stretch from Haldia to Triveni under World Bank assistance. To supplement operations, nearly 320 new vessels will be pressed into service. A separate plan is underway to modernise jetties from Triveni in Hooghly to Farakka in Murshidabad, using state resources. “There are roughly 500 ferry services along the river in Bengal. Some of them are wooden jetties. With time, we will modernise them all,” said a transport department official.With modernisation, the state aims at better regulation of ferry operations. Now, the service is unorganised, with different departments and civic bodies owning jetties. Most jetties are poorly maintained, leading to accidents. The plan is to bring the entire facility under an organisation under the transport department to ensure better and safer services.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74276548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-768745,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-launch-e-vessels-to-improve-kols-air-water-quality/articleshow/74274292.cms

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: The vigilance and enforcement department will take up investigation into allegations of misappropriation of funds from the welfare board of building and other construction workers in the last five years.

Trade union leaders had alleged that the misappropriation of funds could be bigger than the ESI drug purchase scandal.

Trade unions sent representations to the chief minister’s office seeking probe into the misuse of workers’ welfare fund.

“We have information that about Rs 400-Rs 500 crore was siphoned off from the welfare fund during the TDP regime. A thorough investigation will bring more facts to the light,” said P Gautham Reddy, YSR Trade Union Congress leader.

The Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board was set up in 2007 when Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was the chief minister. The government started levying 1% cess on all constructions raised in and above 200 sq yard of land while granting building plans. The cess collected from the builders and individuals was routed to the workers’ welfare fund to take up different welfare activities for those engaged as daily wagers in the unorganized sector including masons, carpenters, painters, rod bending workers, plumbers and electricians. The board had a reserve fund of nearly Rs 1,200 crore at the time of bifurcation of the state.

The TDP government, which shifted a majority of state level offices and corporations to Amaravati in 2015, had allowed the workers’ board to remain in Hyderabad till January 2019.

The government had decided to distribute tool kits such as trowels, iron crowbars, chisels, rods, shoes and others in 2017 by spending funds from the welfare board.

Allegations are rife that the tools were purchased without calling tenders at very high prices. The officials also raised bogus bills without even purchasing kits in some instances as there was no audit for the distribution of the tool kits. Workers alleged that massive amounts were withdrawn for the purchase of tool kits between 2015-2019.

Sources said the welfare fund was also spent for outdoor publicity of Chandranna Bima, which is against the rules of the board.

“This is yet another attempt to damage our reputation. They are free to go ahead with the inquiry. We are not worried as we have not committed any wrong,” said former labour minister K Atchnnaidu. He said that the TDP government had allowed the board to remain in Hyderabad due to legal complications in the division of the board between the two states.

Nagpur: Some 2,200 employees of the three red bus operators and two ticketing agencies of Aapli Bus will be getting bonus and other benefits from March 2020. This had been a long pending demand of these staffers. Their protests, the latest of which was launched from Monday morning, ended after some workers sat for a hunger strike and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) conceded their demands.

Out of the 2,200 employees, 1,100 are bus drivers and the other half are conductors. The operators include Hansa City Bus Services, RK Travels, Travel Time, Unity Infrastructure and SIS. The workers’ long standing demand was that no employee should be made to work for more than 48 hours in a week, employees should be given a weekly off, overtime pay for any employee working for more than eight hours, and Diwali bonus of Rs5,500.

They also demanded 15 days of paid leave for any employee who has worked for 240 or more days, along with basic improvements.

NMC’s transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar convened a meeting with all Aapli Bus operators and discussed the issue. “The operators also agreed to the demands made by the union,” said Borkar. He said the employees of three red bus and two ticketing agencies of Aapli Bus will get the benefits from March 2020.

Vijayawada: Stringent action initiated by Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) seem to have had little effect on owners of stray cattle, which continue to stall traffic in the city.

Hundreds of stray cows and bulls are seen roaming some of the arterial city roads in One town, Kothapeta, Gandhi Nagar, Governorpet, and Gunadala. Moreover, besides being a major source of problem for fruit and vegetable vendors, the VMC horticulture wing is having a hard time keeping them off their road dividers, where plants have been potted.

The VMC has constructed a cattle shed at Rajarajeswari Peta for the stray cattle. The veterinary wing of VMC have shifted around 80 cows to the shelter since December.

“We have intensified efforts to control stray cattle. Even the animals are suffering after consuming plastic and other garbage. We have identified that owners are allowing their cattle to graze save expences on the feed and shelter. Around 40 stray cattle have been left in our shelter for more than 20 days and no one has come forward to claim them,” said Ravi Chand, chief of the veterinary wing at VMC.

“We have recently conducted a meeting with around 25 stray-cow owners and warned them that we will permanently take them away,” he said.

Animal rights activists have demanded action against owners of cattle that allow them to graze in the streets. “VMC authorities should file criminal cases against the cattle owners and take stringent action,” said A Tejovanth, functionary at Help for Animal Society.

The women cooking the food were dressed in white aprons, which declared that they were on their period

NEW DELHI: A dozen menstruating women got together to prepare a feast early on Sunday. Their kitchen was a tent at Central Park in Mayur Vihar, their menu undecided and the guest list eccentric. But the purpose of the feast was singular: to dispel myths around menstruation .

The ‘ mahabhoj ’ was organised by Sachhi Saheli, an NGO that works to create awareness around menstrual hygiene. The women cooked food while dressed in white aprons, which declared that they were on their period . The feast was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who said there should be no taboo attached to menstruation.

“In today’s scientific day and age, there is nothing pure or impure about menstruation, it is a natural biological process that should be taken as it is,” Sisodia said.

The feast was attended by over 500 people, including activists Kamala Bhasin and Benwada Wilson and theatre personality Arvind Gaur, who got together to “reclaim” women’s dignity and voice their opinion against gender-based discrimination. “We were extremely disturbed when we got to know that women in Bhuj were forced to remove their undergarments to prove they weren’t menstruation,” said Dr. Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist-turned-activist, who is the founder of the NGO.

“A baba recently said that we will be born as dogs if we prepared food while we are on our period. This feast is an answer to such people. We want to tell them that there is no place for such superstitions in our society,” said Preeti, a school student who had volunteered to cook for the event.

Preeti was referring to the comment by Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji, who runs the college in Bhuj where 68 girls were forced to remove their underwear in a menstruation check. Renu, another woman who volunteered to cook, said the only way forward was to engage with superstition in a logical way.

VADODARA: In a new twist to a teenager’s murder in 2016, his father, a core committee member of Shiv Sena’s Gujarat unit, and the latter’s two accomplices were arrested by Bharuch police on Sunday. The trio had planned to kill a shopkeeper to avenge the teenage boy’s death.

Satish Patil, former vice-president of Shiv Sena Gujarat , had hired Mohammed Zakir Siddiqui and Mohsin Siddiqui to kill the shopkeeper named Chaturvedi as he suspected him to be involved in his son’s murder. Patil’s teenage son Vivek was allegedly killed by his second wife Rohini and a security guard Sudhakar Simpi. Some days later, Rohini died in jail and Simpi was released on bail. As the murder was conspired at Chaturvedi’s shop, he was made a witness in the case by police. However, Patil suspected that he was equally involved in the murder, so wanted to kill Chaturvedi.

The murder plan was blown up when cops from Bharuch local crime branch (LCB) found Mohammed Zakir and Mohsin moving around Chaturvedi’s shop on a bike on February 21. “Since their bike’s number plate was broken, we asked them to show its documents. They said the papers were with the bike’s owner and so were asked to come to LCB office on Saturday with them,” said a police official.

Meanwhile, the cops received information that the duo had been hired by Patil to kill Chaturvedi. The duo was brought for questioning during which they admitted to looking for an opportunity to kill Chaturvedi as they were hired for the job by Patil. “Patil had paid them Rs50,000 and also prepared a pesticide injection to kill Chaturvedi,” said LCB inspector J N Zala. Based on their statements, Patil was questioned and he confessed to his crime and thus was arrested.

Vijayawada: Midday meal workers across the state are on the warpath demanding additional charges for the revised menu. The Andhra Pradesh Midday Meals Workers’ Association (APMMWA) conducted a state-level conference at MBVK Bhavan in the city on Sunday and demanded the state government to revise the tariff.

The new government after taking office decided to improve the quality of midday meals supplied in government and aided schools across the state and renamed the existing scheme as ‘Jagan Anna Gorumudda’. It revised the old menu and introduced egg, peanut chikki, and other nutritious foods.

But following the development, midday meal workers have alleged that the state government, which revised the menu, did not revise the meal charges. The APMMWA president Varalakshmi, while addressing the conference, said the state government is still paying Rs 6.57 rupees per meal for primary class students and Rs 8.80 per meal for secondary school students that is adding a huge burden on the workers. On an average workers of secondary schools are spending around Rs 9,666 from their pocket to feed the kids, she said.

K Swaroopa Rani general secretary of APMMWA alleged demanded that at least Rs 12 should be paid for primary class meals and Rs 15 per meal for secondary classes.

On completion of the renovation, the beach is expected to attract more exercise-conscious citizens. The facility will help many to jog and exercise safely and at a calm area.

A skating track is planned to provide opportunity to children to practice skating, said an official. It is the first skating track planned in a public place in the city. At present children depend on Sarovaram Road and other roads and the pavement at the beach for practicing skating.

The DTPC is also planning to introduce cultural programmes on the road. The beach has a stage which can host music programmes and other cultural programmes planned by DTPC and other private groups to conduct musical nights and other programmes. The district administration is also working to promote Butt Road Beach as a cultural zone. Music programmes are organized on Sundays with singers and musicians from different parts of the district participating.

A cycle track is also coming up at Butt Road Beach as part of the renovation project, said Beena Madhusoodanan, DTPC secretary. The cycle track is planned in the front part of the beautified stretch of the beach, she said. The cycle track will be constructed modelled on the track at Kothi-Pallikandi stretch. The cycle track will help bicycle users, especially children, to ride their bicycles safely. The installation of a fountain in the pond on the beach is also part of the renovation work.

156,['24/02/2020'],Hyderabad: 27-year-old marketing executive who died in car accident was family's sole breadwinner,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Mangled remains of the car at Saroonagar police station on Sunday

HYDERABAD: It was a double whammy for the family of Pabba Sainath , 27, a marketing executive with a private firm, as they not only lost a youngster in a car accident at Karmanghat in the early hours of Sunday , but also the sole bread winner.

Sainath had been shouldering the responsibility of his family since he was 21 after his father’s demise.

“He was just 21 when he started working, soon after his father died, almost seven years ago. My sister is a housewife and he started working at a young age because he wanted to contribute financially for the family. He started his career at a low position, but became achieved success with hard work,” said Sainath's maternal uncle KV Srinivas told TOI.

Sainath, a resident of Saraswathi Nagar in Saidabad, was meeting college friends after a long time and decided to go out partying on Saturday night. “When he told us he was going out for a party, we asked him to go in a car instead of taking his bike, fearing for his safety. We presumed it will be a safer option for him to go in a car. However, we found that all of them (four) were drunk when the accident occurred. We had on several occasions warned and explained to him not to drive under the influence of alcohol or encourage other to do so,” Srinivas added.

According to the family, they found out about the incident late at night through his friends. “I saw the body, and I don't think my sister and niece can see that. That's why I am here in the mortuary, with other relatives. The family, especially my sister, has been in a state of shock after losing her husband, now she lost her son too,” he added.

158,['24/02/2020'],"A year to go for polls: AIADMK, DMK may begin poaching allies","This story is from February 24, 2020

Chennai: With about a year to go for the announcement of the schedule for the Tamil Nadu assembly elections, political parties have to take stock of the ground realities. An analysis of the voting trends in the 22 assembly bypolls a few months ago and the final voting figures for the first phase of the local body polls , (counting in January 2020), now made available by the Tamil Nadu Election Commission, shows the ruling AIADMK cannot bask in the glory of its victories in the two assembly bypolls in October last year, but be concerned about the lead established by the DMK-led front of average 7% in the past one year.

The crucial question before the parties is whether the AIADMK has managed to turn the tide since the defeat in the Lok Sabha polls and the assembly byelections held in April-May 2019 or not. On the face of it, things appear rosy for the AIADMK after it won the Vikravandi and Nanguneri assembly byelections. But, one should factor in the reality that micro-management in two bypolls with more than 30 ministers camping there is one thing, but a mini-general election across the state, is quite another.

In the 22 assembly byelections, the DMK-led front managed a lead of 6.89% (DMK+ 45.07% vs AIADMK+ 38.18%). The AIADMK thought it could turn the tables on the DMK in rural local body polls since the AIADMK was considered stronger in the villages, given the popularity of MGR and the two-leaves symbol. In 2011, the AIADMK dominated the local body polls, decimating the DMK even in the urban areas of 10 municipal corporations (where the DMK stood a better chance of besting the AIADMK). The AIADMK then bagged all 10 corporations, besides a large number of rural bodies.

This time, the AIADMK, to its consternation, found that the DMK, which seemed more intent on pitching legal roadblocks to the election process, had fared far better than expected.

Voting figures of the rural local body elections reveal the DMK-led front polled nearly 8.4% more than the AIADMK-led combine in elections for the posts of district panchayat ward members and about 5.24% in elections to the posts of panchayat union councilors. The average lead for the DMK-led front is about 7% which is more or less the same lead as in the 22 assembly byelections (6.89%) held just a few month ago. And that should worry the managers of the AIADMK campaign. This means the opposition parties have been able to hold on to lead of the assembly bypolls, though it was on a weaker wicket than the AIADMK, which had the might of the ruling establishment.

Though the DMK could not maintain the huge lead of the LS polls (more than 22 %), it has been able to stave off a strong AIADMK challenge, which is aided by a resilient PMK, and continue the momentum of an anti-BJP platform, where the AIADMK is targeted for its ‘soft approach’ towards the BJP and its Hindutva ideology. The AIADMK tried to shed the image of being a pro-BJP party (asking the BJP leaders to keep away from the AIADMK campaign in the bypolls), it continues to defend the BJP-led government at the Centre at the risk of alienating the minorities and indirectly consolidating the minority votes in favour of the DMK-led combine.

The anti-CAA protests too have come as a boost and unifying factor for the constituents of the DMK-led front. The DMK hopes to consolidate this movement and build an anti-BJP, anti-AIADMK mood to catapult the opposition party to victory in the assembly polls next year The AIADMK has another source of worry — the Rajinikanth factor. Political circles are agog with rumours that Rajinikanth may wean away a section of the AIADMK leadership to his new outfit.

The DMK too has to read the writing on the wall. It can ill-afford to make the PMK its main enemy, when tactically it would be better off training its guns at the AIADMK and the BJP. Stung by the harsh DMK campaign against its leaders, the PMK has vowed to hit back. PMK founder S Ramadoss has warned the DMK that the forthcoming elections to some of the corporations, especially Villupuram, Vellore and Kancheepuram would go against the DMK. The DMK leadership has also failed to take note of adverse signals especially in the northern TN and not been able to cash in on differences between the PMK and the AIADMK over seat-sharing and post-sharing.

Lessons have to be learned and changes made accordingly on the drawing boards in the war rooms, since there is enough time for equations and alliances to change. Will the parties of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan upset the apple-cart of the major parties?

If the BJP chooses to quit the AIADMK-led alliance and launch its own front, the AIADMK doors may open for prospective allies. The DMK too has to do a fine balancing act in taking its allies along. The DMK also may try to wean away some allies of the AIADMK. T T V Dinakaran could play spoiler for the AIADMK. A realignment of forces is possible given the fragile nature of the alliances, enough to cause a tightening of the race.

Kolkata: The death of an 81-year-old widower, whose decomposed body was recovered from his Golf Green second-floor flat on Saturday after neighbours alerted the police, has highlighted the plight and helplessness of elderly and ailing citizens living alone in the quiet, residential neighbourhood.

Golf Green Central Coordination Committee, the residents’ welfare body, has launched a door-to-door survey to reach out to such elderly people living alone. Committee president Sandip Nandi Majumdar said, “This is an unfortunate incident. We are trying to reach out to every home and prepare a database of all the 60-70 elderly people living alone,” he said. “We will collect their details, contact numbers of their families and will form teams, who will reach out to them periodically.” Majumdar said Kolkata Police was also looking to extend Pronam, the force’s programme for the safety of senior citizens, in Golf Green.

TOI on Sunday reported on the death of Balasubramanium Srinivasan (81), who used to work in a Dalhousie accountancy firm and started living in the WIBM 3/6 apartment several decades ago. . His wife, who died a few years ago, locals said, worked at IOCL. Srinivasan’s son lives on Rashbehari Avenue and his daughter abroad. The neighbours claimed Srinivasan was ailing and that Manoj Paswan, who works in the building, recounted meeting him a week ago, when he had seen that his legs were swollen.

Thespian Bivas Chakraborty, who lives on the floor above Srinivasan, said, “I had known him for several years. His daughter and my daughter were classmates. His daughter was married nearly a decade ago and lived in the US and Chennai. His son lives in south Kolkata. A widower, Srinivasan was an affable person. I last saw him 10-12 days ago. He wasn’t well but I thought it was due to his advanced age. These days, he kept mostly to himself.”

Most of the population in Golf Green, who set up home in the green neighbourhood in the 70s, have aged. A majority of them live alone as their children live either in another part of the country or abroad. Chakraborty said, “This is not the first time that such an incident happened in our building. There was another similar mishap in an apartment right below Srinivasan’s flat. In that case, we could luckily inform the son who stayed abroad. He flew in immediately.” Majumdar, the resident body’s president, said, “This is precisely the problem we are trying best to address. In cases of emergency, the children are more often than not unable to reach immediately. We will try to get them admitted to a government facility, till their children can arrive and handle the crisis.”

Santana Sarkar, an elderly resident herself, said, “With age-related ailments, many people here are now confined to their homes. With interactions reducing, no way we can know whether someone needs any help or not.” Gautam Biswas, another resident, said, “Many people here live alone and during emergencies, they can’t even call their relatives or neighbours. This is a very helpless situation for many.”

JAISALMER: The preliminary medical report received by Barmer police on Sunday revealed that the Barmer youth was not sodomised with an iron rod.

Though the sonography report was yet to be received, prima facie no inhuman act with the victim has come to light. However, the medical test was done more than 20 days after the incident happened.

Revenue minister Harish Chaudhary and Barmer MLA Mewaram Jain on Sunday spoke to the victim and his brother at Barmer rural police station. The victim reiterated what had been mentioned in the FIR and demanded justice.

Victim’s brother had told police that his sibling kept quiet about the attack on him on January 29 until someone shared a video clip purportedly showing two men attacking him repeatedly and later using a rod to sodomise him.

However, revenue minister Harish Chaudhary assured the victim that the state government will ensure impartial probe in the matter. Chaudhary also met Jodhpur IG Navjyoti Gogoi and IG human rights Vipin Kumar Pandey.

Chaudhary said the incidents in Barmer and Nagaur are very disappointing. He said he met the Dalit family at Nagaur and took information of the entire incident. The victim was satisfied with the kind of action the government and police were taking, he added.

MAKING SPACE: The 21-storey building would provide parking space for around 2,000 cars and 2,600 two-wheelers

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is working on a project to develop Broadway bus terminus as a hub that connects public transport by road, metro rail and suburban rail. The civic body has submitted a detailed proposal to the Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Development Board (TNIDB) for a ₹900-crore project to transform the terminus with demarcated space for bus bays, a multi-storey parking complex, commercial space and rail connectivity.

Broadway is close to Chennai Beach suburban station, High Court metro station as well as Fort suburban station, which is likely to emerge as a terminal for MRTS once it is handed over to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). The proposal includes a skywalk to link the railway stations to the bus terminus.

At the centre of the planned terminal is a 21-storey building that would provide parking space for around 2,000 cars and 2,600 two-wheelers. “Now, many cars and two-wheelers are parked on roads in and around Parrys and the high court, causing traffic chaos. The parking area in the basement will help avoid haphazard parking on roads,” said a senior official.

Bus bays will be on the lower and upper ground floor, sources said. GCC has proposed 80 to 100 bus bays in the remodelled terminus. The parking plan will be part of the off-street parking project, which is being planned also in other areas like MG Road in Nungambakkam. Parking rates would be ₹50 per hour for four-wheelers and ₹20 per hour for two-wheelers. The complex will offer on lease commercial space across 50,000sqm to 90,000sqm.

GCC officials have lobbed the ball into the court of the state government, which now has to take a call on how this project can be financed. Sources said the current model being discussed is a public-private partnership, which may not work out due to the poor shape of the economy. If the state government finds the internal rate of return sustainable, it may allocate funds.

Representative image

CHENNAI: A 27-year-old engineering graduate who had a voice that sounded like a woman’s used it to lure some 350 men into sex chats and then extorted money from them since 2017 landed in police custody on Sunday after one of his victims finally mustered the courage to register a complaint.

Police identified the man as Vallal Rajkumar Reegan of Panakudi in Tirunelveli district and said he targeted men who downloaded the app Locanto looking for jobs.

Police got on his trail when P Udhayaraj of Maduravoyal approached the Mylapore police station alleging that a woman named Priya was making threatening calls to his mobile phone demanding money.

Udhayaraj told police he was browsing on the net on February 16 and downloaded Locanto looking for job opportunities, when a chat popped up offering sexual services.

A couple of minutes after he began to chat, he received a call from a woman who introduced herself as Priya. She spoke to him in a suggestive manner and offered to provide sexual favours. Udhayaraj said he then received a SMS on his mobile number to pay Rs 100 on a digital wallet platform. Soon after he sent the money, he received a nude picture of a woman. Later ‘Priya’ asked him to pay Rs 1,500 to send a video. He refused to pay and blocked the number, Udhayaraj told the police.

A while later he received a complaint copy on his mobile phone which showed a woman had filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. Later he began to receive calls from different numbers, all of which he blocked.

Police began their investigations with ‘Priya’s’ mobile number, which Udhayaraj shared with them. They found it belonged to a man and initially they thought he was trying to mimic a woman. Police said that when they interrogated Reegan, he told them he had been running the scam since 2017 and that he had cheated more than 350 men.

Reegan used to lodge fake complaints against all the victims giving fake mobile numbers. This was possible since the online complaint system does not ask for an OTP number. He has lodged 150 such complaints in Mylapore police district and a similar number in Kilpauk police districts in the past two years.

“While investigating the each complaint, police ended up dialing the complainant’s number which proved to be mostly fake,” said joint commissioner of police, East, R Sudhakar.

“He had been doing this only to extort money. None of the victims approached the police as they feared their names would get exposed,” Sudhakar added.

Police have registered cases against Reegan under IPC section 384 (punishment for extortion), 506 (i) (criminal intimidation) and the IT Act.

Kolkata: KMC mayor Firhad Hakim on Sunday morning visited some places in Tollygunge and Mudiali , where waste and garbage have been dumped by the road. Hakim also inspected a railway land near Tollygunge tram depot and urged the authorities to ensure that the place is kept clean.

On his visit, Hakim was accompanied by MMiC (solid waste management) Debabrata Majumder and other senior conservancy department officials. He was visibly displeased to see a damaged bus abandoned next to the Tollygunge police station and a huge pile of garbage dumped across the road. “In some places, waste and garbage have piled up over a long period, due to negligence of our own staff. The DG conservancy have been apprised on this matter. Besides, there is a plot belonging to the rail authorities, where garbage has piled up. Water has accumulated inside some coconut shell, where mosquito larvae have already started breeding,” Hakim said.

Shortly, the bus was towed away and the waste cleared. The conservancy department officials have been instructed to keep these places clean.

The mayor said central agencies, like the railways, must look into the matter. “KMC alone can’t prevent the spread of dengue. Central agencies will also have to join in the drive. It can’t happen that the railways won’t take care of the plots they operate out of,” Hakim said after the inspection.

Haldia: Using social media and analysing call records, East Midnapore police on Sunday claimed a breakthrough in a February 18 incident in which charred remains of bodies of two women were found in Haldia’s Jhikurkhali. Police said victims Riya Dey (22) and her 40-year-old mother Rama were from New Barrackpore . Two persons arrested — Haldia contractor Saddam Hussain and his aide Sk Manjur — had allegedly set them on fire. A Haldia court remanded the duo in police custody for a fortnight.

Eight missing diaries were tracked state-wide in which two persons were reported missing but this lead hit a dead wall. Police then banked on social media appeals. One person responded saying that his relative and her daughter had left their New Barrackpore home and were unreachable. Police then did a call record analysis of the numbers.

Prima facie, police said, Saddam had an affair with Riya who was pressuring him to marry her. tnn

The protesters said their stand hadn’t changed and they were not willing to clear the area

NEW DELHI: On the last day of mediation, senior advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran, the interlocutors appointed by Supreme Court, gave Shaheen Bagh a miss leaving thousands of protesters disappointed.

A brief disruption took place on Sunday when a crowd gathered on the other side of the barricades to protest against the blockage of the road since 71 days now.

The protesters said their stand hadn’t changed much since the first day and they were not willing to clear the area.

Many speakers from across the country gathered at Shaheen Bagh and heaped praises on the protesters for their perseverance, expressing hope that Supreme Court would listen to them on Monday. A few protesters, however, were apprehensive of the government’s intention, saying such protests should come up in each corner of the country.

The crowd cheered every time something interesting was spoken by those on the dais. Jamal Khan, a speaker, said, “Hum desh bachane nikle hain, aao hamare saath chalo (We’ve come out to save our country, come with us).” The women there replied with cheers of “Inquilab Zindabad”.

Another speaker, Urza, said, “We have spent 71 days here. Now they want us to vacate the area for a few people who find it inconvenient to cross the stretch. This is a movement all of us have created for all those alive and for all those who’ll ever live. If the commuters, who are saying what we are doing is wrong, are educated about why exactly we are here, they will stand by us.”

Meanwhile, the troubled residents of Sarita Vihar and Jasola also began a protest demanding opening of the roads. Raising slogans like “Save the Constitution”, “Respect the Constitution”, “Empty Our Roads”, and Vande Mataram, they said they were not opposed to the cause of the Shaheen Bagh protesters, but demanded immediate opening of the roads for restoring normalcy in their daily commute.

176,['24/02/2020'],Video goes viral: Man held for assault on migrant worker,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: For six years, Kerala was like a home to Goutam Mondal, a 25-year-old construction labourer hailing from Malda in West Bengal. The state gave him an opportunity to earn a decent living and support his family. But on Saturday, one incident changed his perception at least for a night with him on the verge of packing his bags to return home. He was publicly harassed, both physically and verbally, by a man at Vizhinjam who even went on to question his identity and citizenship.

However, by next day morning, Mondal got to see the righteous side of the citizens of the state with many of them expressing solidarity with him, both in person and through the social media. As the night passed, a video of the incident went viral on social media prompting police to register a case. By Sunday afternoon, police tracked down and arrested the accused –– a 47-year-old autorickshaw driver named Suresh Kumar alias Kadala Suresh of Mukkola.

The incident happened at Mukkola near Vizhinjam around 9.30pm on Saturday. According to witnesses, Kumar’s rickshaw hit Mondal while the former was trying to park his vehicle, driving in reverse gear. Mondal was stepping into a mobile phone recharge shop beside the road when he was hit by the rickshaw.

“When Mondal questioned his rash and negligent driving style, the accused slapped him on his face and started verbally abusing him,” said Vizhinjam SHO S B Praveen.

However, an onlooker recorded the episode on his mobile phone and shared it on WhatsApp groups. The video that went viral within half-an-hour, reached the police too. Soon, a probe was launched. Though Kumar tried to flee, police tracked him down and arrested him by Sunday afternoon.

In the video, Kumar can be seen demanding Mondal’s ID proof documents. He even snatched them when Mondal took them out. However, he returned them before leaving the scene.

He was charged with relevant sections of attempt to murder, criminal intimidation, using obscene language, causing hurt and wrongful restraint. He was produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody.

Police said that Kumar had another case pending in the station. It pertained to a similar assault on a 22-year-old youth who worked in a mobile phone shop at Mukkola. The incident happened inside the shop. Though a complaint was filed on the same day, police had failed to take any action.

Residents in the area said that the accused was a substance addict and had even undergone a rehabilitation programme.

Meanwhile, Mondal was overwhelmed by the support he received. He admitted that he planned on booking a rail ticket back to Bengal in the morning itself, after he faced the harassment.

“Everywhere there will be at least one person like him (the accused), who are trouble makers,” said Goutam in broken Malayalam, adding that he does not hold any ill-will towards the people here for the actions of one man. Mondal currently resides in a labourers’ camp at Mukkola.

177,['24/02/2020'],Piduguralla market yard gets its first woman chair from minority community,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Piduguralla: In a first, a woman from the minority community has been named as agriculture market yard chairperson in Piduguralla in Gurazala constituency. The state government appointed Shaik Chand Bi as agriculture market committee chairperson.

Interestingly, Chand Bi’s husband and local YSRC activist Gafar was made vice-chairman of the market committee. They are the first couple to head a governing board of an agriculture market committee in the state. Piduguralla market committee is one of the largest market places in the district after Guntur and Duggirala market yards.

Local legislator Kasu Mahesh Reddy took the bold decision to appoint the couple as market yard chairperson and vice-chairman as he promised to give the minority community a prominent share in the nominated posts before the elections. The move is likely to help YSRC consolidate its footprint among the locally-dominant minority community. Interestingly, Mahesh Reddy played a key role even when his father Krishna Reddy appointed a minority leader Jilani as Narasaraopet market committee in the past.

Sources said Piduguralla market committee, set up about four decades ago, had been in the hands of upper-caste dominant groups in the constituency. “

It is our promise to give minorities a respectful position in all the government nominated posts as they are the backbone of our government,” said Mahesh Reddy.

He, however, explained that all the communities would get their due under the YSRC rule. He said they would take everyone along with them as support of all sections is crucial for the development of the constituency.

Responding to the appointment, market yard vice-chairman Gafar said that the minorities would unitedly work for the party’s victory in the coming local bodies’ elections. “We are happy to know that we are the first couple to head the market committee,” said Gafar. He said that TDP had humiliated them after getting their votes polled in several elections in the past.

The pro-capital city activists threw chilli powder on gunmen and aides of the MP after forcing the driver to stop the vehicle. The incident took place when Suresh was on his way to Guntur after attending Rathotsavam at Amaralingeswara Swamy temple in Amaravati.

The activists surrounded the MP’s vehicle and raised slogans in favour of Amaravati as the capital and asked the MP to support their cause.

Sensing trouble, the gunman and other aides came down from the vehicle and tried to protect the MP. Women activists pushed the MP’s aides away and attempted to attack the MP.

Soon, police reached the spot and rescued the MP. Suresh said that it was the handiwork of TDP. “TDP has been hatching a conspiracy against our government by creating law and order trouble. They should feel ashamed of using women as cover,” said Suresh.

He said TDP was trying to vitiate the atmosphere. He said the farmers should be aware of TDP’s dirty politics. Fisheries minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana condemned the attack on Suresh.

AMARAVATI: The Andhra Pradesh high court is likely to take a call on the fate of Group I main examinations to be conducted by Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission ( APPSC ) on Monday.

The young graduates, who had qualified to appear for the main examination, are undergoing training for the last 18 months but PSC’s technical mistakes have led to postponement of the examinations.

The candidates cleared the preliminary examination but it has taken so long for APPSC to hold the second phase-mains. The candidates are blaming the PSC of not being serious enough in handling the examinations for top state government jobs.

The situation has reached such a stage that the candidates are becoming victims of the delay and repeated postponements due to non-serious litigants. The aspirants are blaming the service commission for giving scope for frivolous litigations by not taking adequate care in the conduct of the examination.

“I have not heard that Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts examinations to recruit candidates for the elite civil services having postponed even one examination in its long history. However, APPSC is playing with our lives as we have sacrificed jobs in private sector to get into public service and preparing for the examination for the past two years. Yet, we don’t know when the examination will get completed,” said K Divya (name changed).

She said APPSC should take care to prevent non-serious players from repeatedly dragging it to the courts.

“There might be some errors in the setting of the prelims question paper and technical faults in the notification. But those who cleared the prelims hurdle haven’t gained any additional marks or advantage from such issues. In fact, they are victims of trauma caused by APPSC. How could those who failed the exam stall the process?” asked another candidate.

KWA sources said that the 75mld treatment plant was the only solution to the water crisis. “It was expected to be completed in March. Now, the crucial works including purchase of machines are stuck due to delay in release of around Rs 15 crore. Commissioning of the plant is likely to happen only by July,” sources said.

The AMRUT fund is shared by Centre, state government and local bodies on 50:30:20 basis. Sources said that while Central funds are already released, the delay happened from the part of the city corporation. When contacted, a senior official of city corporation said that the delay happened as they were waiting for corporation council to give permission to release the fund. “Since it was a huge amount of around Rs 18 crore for various AMRUT works, the consent of council has to be taken. Considering the urgency of work, now we have asked for sanction of mayor. Funds could be released in a couple of days,” a corporation official said.

Due to delay in release of funds, other AMRUT works, including construction a 5mld sewage treatment plant, too have slowed down. Most works will miss the March deadline.

“The construction of the 75mld treatment plant is likely to be completed only by July. Earlier, the KWA used to release 10% funds as advance amount for AMRUT projects. However, now there is no such measures from the part of KWA,” sources said.

With the commissioning of the 75mld treatment plant at Aruvikkara, KWA will be able to tackle the water crisis. Currently, the water authority is releasing around 280mld water per day, which is insufficient. Elevated areas in the city often experience water shortage.

Watch: Tilted building at Delhi's Munirka demolished #MunirkaBuildingDemolition #MunirkaTowerDemolition https://t.co/54T7i6IQ9y — TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1582439261000

NEW DELHI: After four days of efforts, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), along with police and Delhi Disaster Management Authority, on Sunday finally managed to raze a tilted six-storey building in south Delhi’s Munirka . The building, located on Baba Gangnath Marg, had started tilting last Thursday.“It was impossible to bring down the 10-feet-wide structure manually as it had tilted a lot towards other buildings. We were afraid of sending labourers inside as the building could have collapsed any time. We even tried to make it fall on the main road,” said a senior official overseeing the operation. He added that a beam on the ground floor was attached to an adjoining house. The beam had to be cut before razing the structure.The ground floor of the building was about 25 feet higher than the road, making it equivalent to an eight-storey structure. “The building was in a rocky area with narrow lanes. We used three hydraulic excavators, one 100-foot crane with pneumatic hammer and gas cutters in the 72-hour operation,” said the official.The people living in the tilted building had been shifted to an anganwadi centre and a temple. Though their relatives and local residents were helping to feed them, the biggest worry for the building’s residents was starting life from scratch as most of their household items were damaged in the demolition.Neetu Devi, a resident of the building, said, “We were asked to leave the building all of a sudden. We did not even get the opportunity to collect our cash and valuable items. Despite repeated requests, the officials didn’t allow me to go back to my house. We have been in the same clothes for the past four days. The studies of my children is getting affected adversely.”When the demolition began, the upper floors (fifth and sixth) crumbled on two adjoining buildings, a double-storey and a six-storey, damaging their top floors. Locals were concerned about the manner in which the corporation had carried out the operation.The civic official said, “We don’t know the extent of damage caused to the other buildings. We later sent labourers to remove the debris.” He added that the portion of the building that collapsed on the adjoining structures will be removed in two days. People will then be allowed to move into their homes.“Removal of debris is likely to take a week after which the neighbouring buildings will be surveyed. No compensation has been demanded by the owners of the other buildings for the damages caused during the operation,” the civic official added.Tears welled up in the eyes of 17-year-old Rohit Kumar when the building was demolished as he couldn’t get a chance to collect his books and admit card for the Board exams beginning February 27. “The officials said they will take a week to remove the debris. How will I study for my English paper that is due on Thursday?” he asked.A senior SDMC official said they were helpless as they couldn’t risk anybody’s life by allowing them to go inside to collect their belongings and household items.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74276127,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-351984,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tilted-building-in-munirka-finally-razed/articleshow/74274416.cms

PANAJI: Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar had set the tone of the Carnival parade this year by taking a strong stand on various issues related to the annual revelry. From changing the parade route to coming out with strict guidelines regarding tableaux themes, the deputy chief minister even stressed that drinking on roads would not be tolerated. However, a float put up by his son’s night club has courted controversy.

Rules this year stated that products of a sponsoring company should not form the main part of the float, and that the tableau must have a cultural theme. Brands were not allowed to liberally promote their products at this year’s float parade in Panaji .

Going against these rules, the float by Ajgaonkar’s son’s night club featured posters promoting the commercial venture pasted in front of and around the vehicle inviting people to attend the club’s Carnival dance party, complete with promotions and timings.

Tourism minister maintained that if there was any violation of the rules, it was the duty of the screening committee of the Panaji Carnival Committee to take action.

“It is true that the night club belongs to my son Privesh which he runs along with a partner. As he was out of station, the manager of the club arranged the float. I am not aware if there was any violation or not but my stand is clear – whoever violated the rules, action should have been taken by the screening committee,” Ajgaonkar told TOI.

Participants that had pre-registered were briefed prior to the Carnival. On Saturday, the Panaji Carnival Committee’s screening team started scrutinising the floats from 1pm onwards to ensure that spot registrations abide by rules as well. But this tableau made its way into the parade.

CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues had said, “Branding can be done, but direct cutouts of products should not be projected in front of, back, or on top of the float. This is not a product display festival,” Rodrigues said, “Brands can only feature their logo or banner on the sides of the floats.” However, the float in question had a large owl mounted on the top of the float. The owl is the mascot of the night club.

However, mayor Uday Madkaikar softened his stand on the CCP rules. He said, “We never said commercial floats were not permitted. From what I know, there was no problem with any of the floats.”

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has finally removed encroachments near Don Bosco , off College Road, after an order from the Bombay High court on Thursday.

“Encroachments have been removed from the Don Bosco road , which has five educational institutes, including a hostel, along it,” a senior official from the municipal corporation said.

The official said several food vendors used to set up stalls along the stretch, especially during the evening hours.

Residents had complained about the nuisance being caused by the vendors. The NMC action followed directions of the high court, which asked municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game to remove all encroachments from the area within a week.

The bench comprising Justice S Kathawala and Justice Milind Jadhav directed Game to clear the stalls. Game was also ordered to be present in front of the bench because of delays in action.

The NMC commissioner — in an affidavit before the court — had said the NMC had finalized hawking zones based on norms set by the civic administration’s general body. He said Don Bosco road was not part of the resolution. But vendors continued to park food vans in the area.

During a hearing on February 17, the NMC had sought more time to remove encroachments from the road. But the court asked the commissioner to be present in person for the hearing. Authorities added they would ensure food vendors do not return to the road.

Representative image

AMARAVATI: The Andhra Pradesh high court is likely to take a call on the fate of Group I main examinations to be conducted by Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission ( APPSC ) on Monday.

The young graduates, who had qualified to appear for the main examination, are undergoing training for the last 18 months but PSC’s technical mistakes have led to postponement of the examinations.

The candidates cleared the preliminary examination but it has taken so long for APPSC to hold the second phase-mains. The candidates are blaming the PSC of not being serious enough in handling the examinations for top state government jobs.

The situation has reached such a stage that the candidates are becoming victims of the delay and repeated postponements due to non-serious litigants. The aspirants are blaming the service commission for giving scope for frivolous litigations by not taking adequate care in the conduct of the examination.

“I have not heard that Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts examinations to recruit candidates for the elite civil services having postponed even one examination in its long history. However, APPSC is playing with our lives as we have sacrificed jobs in private sector to get into public service and preparing for the examination for the past two years. Yet, we don’t know when the examination will get completed,” said K Divya (name changed).

She said APPSC should take care to prevent non-serious players from repeatedly dragging it to the courts.

“There might be some errors in the setting of the prelims question paper and technical faults in the notification. But those who cleared the prelims hurdle haven’t gained any additional marks or advantage from such issues. In fact, they are victims of trauma caused by APPSC. How could those who failed the exam stall the process?” asked another candidate.

189,['24/02/2020'],Metro’s Mahacard getting poor response from riders,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Nagpur: Mahacard, the common mobility card of MahaMetro and SBI, has received poor response from Nagpurians as only 610 cards have been sold so far. The card was launched on August 31, 2019 and since then 5,161 tickets have been purchased using them.

On the other hand, mobile application of MahaMetro has been downloaded by 5,000 persons, but only 832 tickets have been purchased through it.

While the Mahacard can be used for paying fare of Metro’s feeder vehicles, it still can’t be used for buying tickets of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s city buses. A meeting of NMC and SBI officials in this regard was scheduled on January 27 but got postponed indefinitely.

A Metro official said SBI is reluctant to invest on installation of automatic fare collection (AFC) machines in city buses. “It is not getting much revenue from Metro at present due to low ridership. The bank gets 4% of the revenue collected through the AFCs installed by it at Metro stations. This is in the range of Rs1,000 whereas SBI had estimated a far higher figure. However, as far higher number of people use city buses, SBI can fetch more revenue there,” he added.

Metro’s ridership is low as two stretches — Sitabuldi to Automotive Square and Sitabuldi to Prajapati Nagar — are still under construction. Moreover, many stations in Sitabuldi to Khapri and Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretches are yet to open for public. Metro has only recently started feeder services other than NMC city buses.

Feeder services have been launched at Khapri station. E-rickshaws, e-scooters, LPG rickshaws etc will be available at the station in a phased manner. Later, these vehicles will be available at other stations too.

Metro officials admit that unless people are able to reach areas near stations using feeder vehicles, the ridership will not increase much even after new stations become functional.

190,['24/02/2020'],Committee to decide fate of discom employees in a week,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Vijayawada: Justice Dharmadhikari committee to resolve the dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana over the allotment of electricity employees concluded its hearing on Sunday.

The energy departments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana presented their arguments in New Delhi. Justice Dharmadhikari said it would issue supplementary orders to the original allotment within a week.

Earlier, the committee had allotted 655 employees to Andhra Pradesh from the 1,157 employees relieved by the Telanagana power utilities.

Andhra Pradesh power utilities challenged the allotment in the Supreme Court contending that they already have allocable staff as on the state bifurcation day.

The Supreme Court while disposing the interlocutory petitions moved by the Andhra Pradesh power utilities directed the committee to revisit the employee allotments.

Andhra Pradesh argued that the state is at the receiving end with the present allotment as the committee did not take allocable staff into consideration. Absorption of additional employees would be over and above the allocable staff according to population ratios, the basis for division of employees. This would put additional financial burden on Andhra Pradesh power utilities, they said adding that the committee has not allotted any employee to Telangana power utilities.

On the other hand, Telangana power utilities argued that as many as 505 employees were allocated to Telangana by the committee which they have accepted to absorb into service. They said the employees who have been self-relieved from Andhra Pradesh were also taken into service because of their Telangana nativity.

Senior advocate Arun Kumar Sanghi who represented the 655 employees who were relieved by Telangana argued that their service should be continued and salaries should be paid by Telangana government till the issue is resolved. He argued that Telangana can only relieve them only after posting orders given by Andhra Pradesh.

191,['24/02/2020'],CJI: Single system of laws needed to save environment,"This story is from February 24, 2020

NEW DELHI: With the world grappling with climate change and other environment problems, Chief Justice of India S A Bobde on Sunday suggested a single law for all countries to effectively deal with the issue and said it was a major challenge which is not confined to a national boundary.

“Environmental issues cannot be hindered by national and international borders. Water and wind flow seamlessly across the earth and even under it. The growth of vegetation affects animals and man. Perhaps, there is the greatest need for a single system of laws in this regard. It is said that human beings are seeds as well as parasites to the earth. We take much more than we give back to the earth. As Richard Rogers said, the only way forward to improve the quality of environment is to get everybody involved,” Justice Bobde said.

Addressing an international judicial conference organised by the Supreme Court in which judges and jurists from 24 countries are participating, the CJI said judiciary was the guardian of constitutional values and served to counter-balance populist forces in commitment to rule of law.

He said justice delivery had not been untouched by the forces of globalisation with the vast majority of lawyers and judges educated in more than one country and emphasised the need to have broader international dialogue among members of the judiciary from various countries.

“This globalisation of the bar has been accompanied by globalisation of the bench. Increasingly confronted with transnational challenges, judges regularly reach beyond their borders to inspect the jurisprudence of other countries to discern valuable principles. Recently, judgments and opinions of the Indian Supreme Court were cited by over four jurisdictions across the world. Our own judgments look to the wisdom of our international colleagues. Yet, a judge never loses sight of the need to tailor judicial decisions to the social realities of their own country,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, President Ram Nath Kovind praised the SC for being “proactive and progressive” in ensuring gender justice and protecting the environment. He said the apex court had always played a pivotal role in protecting the rights of women, whether by passing the Vishakha verdict in 1997 to lay down guidelines against sexual harassment in the workplace and recently by allowing permanent commission and command postings to women in the Army. He said gender justice must remain high on the global agenda.

He said the apex court deserved praise for providing judgments in nine vernacular languages and also appreciated steps taken by the judiciary towards a paperless court.

“The SC also deserves admiration for carrying out many radical reforms that made justice more accessible to common people. Landmark judgments passed by this court have strengthened the legal and constitutional framework of our country,” Kovind said.

The CJI emphasised the need to use artificial intelligence to automate simple tasks associated with administration of justice.

Nagpur: ‘Keepers are a class apart’ is what the former Indian wicketkeeper Anju Jain had made 24-year-old Saloni Allot believe, while the latter trained under her in the last two years. The promising Vidarbha wicketkeeper-batswoman seems to have had made it her mantra ever since, be it in cricket or elsewhere in life.

Having taken a study leave from the game after a commendable 37 dismissals in 26 matches in the 2018-19 season, Saloni may be away from her gloves; but her killer instinct has remained intact as she pinned down a suspected burglar outside her residence at Swami Colony Phase-I, in the early hours of Sunday.

Saloni, a qualified chemical engineer, wrestled with the burglar for around 10 minutes on a heap of collected debris, until help arrived from the neighbourhood. The family had just arrived and she was parking their car outside the house, when a fleeing burglar caught their attention.

In a flash, this biker-cum-guitarist-cum-cricketer seems to have turned into an amateur grappler with this impromptu fight, which has now made her a real-life hero in the locality. The burglar, identified as Dhanraj Pancheshwar, was later handed over to the Gittikhadan police by the mob, where an offence was registered against him.

Senior PI Sunil Gangurde, who reached Saloni’s place to congratulate her and inspect the spot, praised her efforts. “It is not a joke to fight a burglar bare-handed for that long,” he said. Many senior citizens in the locality too approached Gangurde, suggesting that Saloni’s name be recommended for bravery awards.

In the process of overpowering the burglar and keep him away from the cloth bag in which he had two long blades, screwdriver and some other sharp tools, Saloni’s both hands got bruised on the debris and tarred road in the scuffle.

Despite the injury in both hands which could risk her future prospects in the game, Saloni did not ease her hold on the burglar, allowing no room to flee or attack her before others joined, after hearing her alarms.

Saloni, who has been playing cricket since the age of 11, said that she was not at all prepared for any fight or action, as it was not known what was going on inside the house when her mother Anju Sahare screamed out for her father Vinay, upon seeing the stranger trying to hide amid the flower pots.

“Seeing my parents, the burglar scaled the boundary wall and jumped out. I had just stepped out of the car after parking it, when he landed in front of me. There was hardly any moment to think before I acted,’ said Saloni, whose earliest memory of playing cricket is with her father late Bhojraj Allot — a former Ranji player for Vidarbha — at the old Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) ground.

“I pounced upon him, but he managed to roll over to get on top. It was tough, but I was able to grasp him with my legs criss-crossed over him, until others reached and grabbed him too,” she said.

Police said that Pancheshwar was from Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh. The cops are trying to ascertain whether he has any past records in the city.

Thiruvananthapuram: The fire and rescue services authorities in the district are toying with the idea of utilising the service of the new Civil Defense Force to educate and sensitize the people about how to prevent ground fires that are common in summer season. TOI had reported that the rising summer heat has made way for an alarming increase in the number ground fires in the district recently.

Regional Fire Officer Arun Alphonse said that Civil Defense Force (CDF) volunteers were ideal medium to reach out to the masses in an effective way to spread awareness on ground fires. “More than 90% of ground fires occur owing to careless handling of combustible materials by people,’’ he said. The CDF volunteers can play an important role in sensitising people in their neighbourhoods, he said adding that new batches of trainees would be given lessons to prevent ground fires and even domestic fire that are common during summer season.

The Civil Defense Force is a project under which the state would establish a force of trained volunteers in a bid to enhance disaster management system of the state. The volunteers, who enrol under the project will be given training to carry out basic relief and rescue tasks in emergency situations such as floods, flash floods and urban flooding. The project was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in December last year.

Till now, more than 1,000 volunteers have completed training under CDF project . TNN

HYDERABAD: An 18-month-old girl died after she accidentally came under the wheels of a car driven by her father on Sunday. The father had not noticed that the girl had come in front of the car.

Chandrayangutta police said that at 3.45 am, 28-year-old Khaleed Saari, a driver, was taking out his car. Suddenly, his 18-month-old daughter came in front of his car. Khaleed, who did not notice his daughter in front of the vehicle, began to drive.

On realising what had happened, Khaleed and his family members rushed the girl to a private hospital, where she was declared brought dead at 5am. Police registered a case under Section 304 A (negligence causing death) of Indian Penal Code.

Meanwhile, a local patrolling party received information from locals about the mishap. The police, soon, reached the spot to enquire about the child’s death.

“Khaleed did not see the baby standing in front of the car. He drove the car, causing Huda to come under the front tyres of the car. She sustained severe head injuries,’’ the Chandrayangutta police said.

PANAJI: With the summer less than a week away, the mercury has started rising noticeably during the last couple of days, as India meteorological department ( IMD ), Panaji recorded a maximum temperature of 36.6C on Sunday – 4.4 degrees above normal.

The heat was prickly during the forenoon and afternoon hours, as the mercury rose even further by .5 degrees on the weekend. On Saturday, the meteorological office at Altinho recorded a maximum temperature of 36.1C – more than four degrees above normal.

During February, the mercury had risen above 35 degrees on a few occasions and a few days back, IMD, Panaji had recorded a maximum temperature of 36.5 C – just 0.1 degree less than on Sunday.

“This phenomenon is taking place due to predominantly easterly or southeasterly winds blowing during day, which raises the maximum temperature,” Krishnamurty Padgalwar, director, IMD, Panaji said.

After the mercury soared to 36.5 degrees about a week ago, the wind direction had changed and day temperatures were within normal range. After the hottest day of the season so far on Sunday, meteorologists expect the mercury to come down by a degree on Monday.

“It may drop by a degree on Monday,” Padgalwar said. In comparison, the night hours have been pleasant. The mercury goes down to normal levels and has been hovering around 21C to 23C for a few days.

HYDERABAD: Not just high school students, even parents of primary class students across the state have been forced to sign an undertaking saying they would apply for transfer certificate (TC) if their ward fails to perform well in the annual examinations.Schools are said to be implementing it for kids as young as six or seven years (Class I or II) to ensure that they only have academically bright students on their campus, especially in the higher classes.The father of a child studying in a well-known school in the Jubilee Hills, said: “My son is a Class II student. After the pre-final examination, I was called by the school management and was asked to sign an undertaking saying that I will not object even if they retain him in the same class or issue a TC.” He said that the school, which is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), is implementing the rule right from Class I.“When I declined to sign the undertaking, the management said that this exercise was taken up just to ensure parents know about their ward’s performance. However, the undertaking form clearly says I am willing to take TC,” he said. Another parent, whose sons are studying in Class IV and VI at one of the oldest schools in Secunderabad, said that he too was asked to sign a similar undertaking.“As soon as my elder son failed in his first assessment test, the school management asked me to sign an undertaking saying that I would take a TC if he fails to improve his performance,” said KV Sainath, a parent. He said that it is surprising to see how schools are completely ignoring their role when it comes to a student’s performance. Teachers, meanwhile, said that schools are following this procedure not just to ‘filter’ students, but also to ensure that they get more income through admission fee.“All the top schools, which see high demand for admissions, follow this procedure. Once a seat is vacated, they fill it with a new candidate, who again has to pay admission fee along with the enhanced fee. As they cannot increase the number of seats, this is the procedure they are following to ensure they get more income,” said president of Telangana Private Teachers Forum, Shabir Ali. He said that the majority schools have more than 4,000 to 5,000 students in their schools.Members of the Telangana Recognised School Managements Association also seconded the teachers, and said that ‘elite’ and corporate schools are known to follow this procedure. “No matter whether the student is in primary class or higher classes, these schools issue TCs if they don’t perform well,” said S Srinivas Reddy, president of Telangana Recognised School Management Association.The education department, however, said that no school, irrespective of which board they are affiliated to, can take such an undertaking, as it is against the rules. “If any parent approaches us with a complaint, we will initiate action against erring schools,” said Hyderabad district education officer, Venkata Narasamma.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74282725,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-115117,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bad-grades-sign-up-for-a-tc-schools-telling-parents/articleshow/74273914.cms
198,['24/02/2020'],Kidney transplants at NIMS may stop with retirement of senior doc,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Hyderabad: Kidney transplants at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences ( NIMS ) are likely to get affected with retirement of one of two senior professors. In the next two to three months, urology head of department Dr Ch Rami Reddy will hang his gloves.

Dr Reddy, who heads a five-member team, along with professor of urology Dr Rahul Devraj carry out simultaneous surgery on the donor and recipient for live transplants. The two are assisted by other associate or assistant professors, according to insiders.

Without one of the experts, the yearly average of 120 transplants is likely to decline. Live transplants account for 70% of all transplants and are done by surgically removing the organ from a donor and transplanting it into the recipient.

“Both surgeries have to be done simultaneously and are high-risk surgeries which require the highest level of precision. The two professors (Dr Rami Reddy and Dr Devraj) take care of one part of the surgery each. The team assists the pair but without one of them, live donor transplants cannot be done,” said a doctor who has been part of the transplant team. “Moreover, in case of any complications or doubts, we all consult the HoD,” he added.

NIMS carries out the highest number of kidney transplants in the state and is the only one, apart from Osmania General Hospital (OGH) to extend kidney transplant service in government and semi-autonomous institutes across the state. OGH carries out between five to six kidney transplants a year. Earlier, liver transplant services at OGH has stopped due to a lack of infrastructure at the hospital.

A halt in services at NIMS will come as a blow to many patients, especially those from economically weaker sections. Apart from carrying out the surgery free of cost under the Aarogyasri scheme, the institute also provides a year’s supply of immuno-suprresants to transplant patients free of cost. With a large number of complicated cases and re-transplant cases redirected to the state-run institute, the situation looks bleak.

“Had the government order for extending retirement age been implemented at NIMS, we would have not been staring at this situation. We have been demanding this for long and all other institutes have implemented it but NIMS has not,” said Resident Doctors Association (RDA) president, Dr G Srinivas.

Nashik: Divisional railway manager Vivek Kumar Gupta has ordered the Nashik Road railway station officials to carry out a survey and submit the report about redevelopment of the station on grounds of Habibganj and other stations through which the railways will explore possibilities of earning non-fare revenue.

“From Central Railway we have proposed Nashik Road railway station for the modernization programme under which not only the station will get an airport-like look, but it will also have commercial establishments placed in the vertical layers of the station,” Gupta said.

After submission, the plan of railway station’s development will be forwarded to the Indian Railways Station Development Corporation (IRSDC) that will consider the project.

“The current building is very old and apart from the railway building there is nothing there. Since we have a chance for vertical growth and also lot of space that can be explored, we are looking for a public private partnership here,” Gupta said.

Another senior official said a large section of the railway officials will be move to the eastern side of the station from the current western and city-side. Only direct public access establishments will remain where they are currently located.

“The parcel office along with the parking can be moved towards Nashik East/Sinnar-side. The parcel are has two dedicated tracks for movement of goods and these will also be shifted to the east-side, along with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) office and others. While the ticket booking offices will remain here, the entire structure could be re-developed,” the official said.

200,['24/02/2020'],"1 murder, 2 suicides: Lover of wife-killer dentist found dead in Bengaluru","This story is from February 24, 2020

Harshitha, Revanth and Kavitha

BENGALURU: A 32-year-old Bengaluru homemaker, suspected to be aware of her lover-dentist’s plot to murder his wife and later kill himself after police began closing in on him, allegedly committed suicide. The woman alleged harassment by her husband.

Harshitha Sudarshan, a native of Tumakuru and wife of Sudarshan, a KSRTC bus driver-cum-conductor, hanged herself from the ceiling of her house in Javaregowda Nagar, Rajarajeshwarinagar late Saturday night.

RR Nagar police confirmed the dentist from Kadur in Chikkamagaluru district had called Harshitha before jumping in front of a moving train earlier on Saturday afternoon. He had told her about police suspecting his role in his wife’s murder.

According to police, Harshitha’s suicide came to light around 12.30am on Sunday, when Sudarshan woke up and noticed her hanging from the ceiling. Police found a suicide note in which Harshitha alleged that harassment by Sudarshan pushed her to death.

Sudarshan, who was detained by police, admitted that there were differences between him and his wife over her extramarital affair with Dr Revanth of Kadur. He told police Revanth’s wife was found murdered at her residence in Kadur on February 17 and Revanth committed suicide after Kadur police detected his hand in the murder.

RR Nagar police contacted their counterparts in Chikkamagaluru district, who confirmed Sudarshan’s version.

“We came to know Revanth committed suicide by jumping before a moving train in Kadur on Saturday and his last call was to Harshitha,” a police officer said.

Harshitha married Sudarshan seven years ago and the couple has a six-year-old daughter. Harshitha would visit her brother-in-law’s residence, which was near Revanth’s house in Kadur and the two started an affair. Sudarshan had come to know about his wife’s extramarital affair and started objecting to it. “We have registered a case of abetment to suicide against Sudarshan,” said police.

Revanth and his wife Kavitha have two children. Revanth allegedly killed his wife on February 17 afternoon, but projected it as a murder for gain. He injected her with a sedative and later slit her throat.

Chikkamagaluru police, however, found Kavitha hadn’t put up any resistance. While there were no fingerprints at the crime scene, it turned out that Kavitha usually received her elder son from school. But on the fateful day, it was Revanth who turned up to receive his son att 4.30pm. The father immediately left the house with the son. The boy later told police he hadn’t seen his mother at home when he left with his father. The couple’s six-month-old daughter was found near Kavitha’s body.

Revanth is suspected to have got wind of a possible arrest, following which he took the extreme step.

According to police, Revanth made 200 calls to Harshitha on January 31 alone.

201,['24/02/2020'],"Karnataka: Scrutinise visa details before taking in foreigners, says circular","This story is from February 24, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: The directorate of collegiate education mandated that all government and aided colleges check travel and visa details of foreigners before offering them admission or face action. The aim is to streamline enrolment of foreign students and prevent them from overstaying,

In a circular issued by the commissioner, the directorate said it has come to the notice of the department that colleges have been indiscriminate in admitting foreign students and that several of them without valid visas — expiry and other issues — have been enrolled in the past.

“...Many foreign students without valid documents have been found to be indulging in anti-social activities,” the directorate said, adding that it would initiate action against institutions enrolling foreigners without checking all details pertaining to their travel and visa.

The directorate further said principals of colleges admitting foreigners without verifying their details would be directly held accountable.

While authorities do not maintain a separate ‘student categorisation’ of overstaying foreigners, anecdotal evidence suggests a lot of overstaying foreigners enter India on student visas.

In fact, in March 2019, the Karnataka high court, while observing that overstaying foreign students can pose a threat to national security, had directed the state government to avail necessary details from the FRRO (Foreigners Regional Registration Office) and submit a report on steps taken to deport such people.

Although no official numbers on the number of overstaying foreign students were available immediately, data from the ministry of human resource development (MHRD), show Karnataka is home to 10,023 of the 47,427 foreign students studying in India as of 2019.

Justice Arvind Kumar, while giving directions to the state last year, had observed that several students from countries like Tanzania, Congo and Cambodia are associated with narcotics and other crimes.

BHUBANESWAR: Man-elephant conflict reared its ugly head in Puri district as a marauding elephant trampled four persons to death in Pipili on Sunday. Elephant attack is rare in the district.

As the incident triggered panic in the locality, district administration asked people to remain indoors and refrain from teasing the animal. Those, who died in the elephant attack, were identified as Jugalkishore Bhatt, 59, of Gopinathpur village, Chaitanya Sahoo, 41, of Rajatai village, Makar Palei, 62, of Chandradeipur Matisahi village and Ajay Kumar Nayak, 45, of Jamalpur village. The villages, where the elephant went on the rampage, are within 5-km radius of Pipili.

Police said the elephant attacked Bhatt, Sahoo and Palei in the early hours of Sunday when they were relieving themselves on paddy fields. “We received information that the three persons could not run as the elephant chased and trampled them to death. Nayak died in the evening. He came close to the jumbo and it attacked him,” said an officer in Pipili police station.

Forest officials from Puri and Khurda districts were engaged to chase away the elephant. Forest officials suspect the elephant sneaked into Pipili Delanga area from Barunei forest in Khurda district . The officials also suspect that the elephant turned violent after being teased by a mob.

When contacted, divisional forest officer, Khurda, Sudeep Nayak said efforts are being made to drive the elephant away from Pipili. “We are trying to drive the elephant towards Barunei forest. People in the locality have been requested to take precautions and not irritate the pachyderm,” Nayak said.

Pipili MLA (BJD) and former minister Pradeep Maharathy said the government would provide compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the next of the kin of the deceased. “We sensitised people through public address system to stay home. People were also urged not to pelt the elephant with stones or burst crackers that would annoy the elephant,” Maharathy said.

A forest department source said 369 persons died in elephant attacks in the state between January 2015 and June 2019. At least 100 persons were killed by elephants in the state in 2019-20 (till January 2020), an all-time high.

Hyderabad: Revealing that he failed quite a few times and had to write several supplementary exams, ace shooter and Olympic medallist Gagan Narang said that exams were not everything and that it would be ideal to grade students on life lessons and skills.

Sharing his experience in college and school, the London Olympic bronze medallist, said that the primary reason why he failed was not because he did not study but that he had missed a lot of classes due to various tournaments. “I could not put in the required number of hours,” he said and added that he would put in night and day to study and pass all of them in supplementary examinations. “I used to even forget about shooting for a few months,” he added.

Narang said that he was a busy student—both with academics and sports. “That meant a lot of juggling, finding time to do both. At times, one took precedence over the other. But my mum was very insistent that I always did my homework first and then go out to play,” he said. Terming himself an average student, the 36-year-old said that he was, however, consistent with his effort. “Beyond a certain time, I only had few hours to study, sport became a priority to me,” he added.

The shooter said that it was important to have good marks to lay the foundation for a good future but reminded students to not worry if they don’t achieve the desired result as they can always work towards improving in the future. Narang advised students not to allow stress to pile on. “Distribute work in a way that helps you to achieve desired goals on time. That’s how I did it,” he shared.

Narang asked parents not to “over-expect” and burden their kids and advised them to teach their children responsibility and make them accountable for their own actions. “Results will follow,” he added.

The gram sabha was attended by a large number of villagers and the budget for the year 2020-21 was presented, with Rs 7.6 crore set aside for expenditure.

Information on the biodiversity register was presented, but villagers demanded to know why the biodiversity registrar was not taken up, which the sarpanch said was not listed on the agenda. Villagers also raised the issue of the builders’ lobby dominating the village.

Villagers also questioned how a congratulatory motion over the panchayat being awarded the cleanest village tag was taken up when the poll code was in force. A strong police force at the meeting prevented villagers from holding any more discussions.

NEW DELHI: Airport Express Line of Delhi Metro, which already has smartphone-enabled QR code-based ticketing facility for single journeys, is extending the facility for trip-based journeys from Monday.With the introduction of this facility, commuters, especially those using trip passes (a type of smart card valid only on Airport Line), will be able to use the QR code generated on their phones, instead of the usual practice of purchasing or recharging their trip passes from metro stations.“The move will do away with the need for a passenger desirous of availing QR code facility to have a physical trip pass separately and subsequent queuing up at stations to recharge them from time to time,” a DMRC spokesperson said.Data from Delhi Metro shows that the Airport Line is used by over 60,000 passengers daily, of which around 65% use trip passes for their travel, which offers discount of up to 40% for every journey in comparison to single journey tokens/QR tickets.The system of trip-based ticketing through QR code using smartphones is expected to enable passengers to purchase trip-based tickets using ‘Ridlr or Paytm application’ — the agencies that have tied up with DMRC for this facility.Explaining the process to generate QR code for trip-based journey, the spokesperson said: “Users can download either the Ridlr or Paytm app and register with their valid credentials and mobile number. They can then proceed to buy a QR code-based trip ticket by selecting the origin station and destination station. They can then select number of trips, with options like 10 trips, 15 day validity, 30 trips or 45 trips.

PONDA: The Kavlem-Ponda sewage treatment plant ( STP ) is likely to be delayed till the beginning of next year. While 80% of the civil works and 90% of the network (pipeline laying) work has been completed, work on a major part of creating the mechanical infrastructure and electrification is yet to be taken up.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant had recently announced that the project could be commissioned by mid-2020, but the progress of the work shows that it could be commissioned only after January 2021.

The plant is expected to free the Ponda nullah from pollutants poured by dwellings on its banks. The nullah, once the lifeline of Ponda, Kavlem , and Bandora is presently in danger as the drainage of domestic effluents has contaminated it to a dangerous level.

To free the nullah from pollutants, the Sewage Infrastructure Corporation of Goa planned a 15MLD sewage treatment plant.

Padmakar Sheldarkar, managing director of the corporation said that over 90% work of laying the pipeline has been completed. “At Daag Ponda, a hard basaltic rock has been found while laying the pipeline which needs micro tunnelling. This has delayed the process as it needs separate machinery to drill,” he said.

Principal general manager of the corporation Dilip Dhavalikar said the corporation has acquired 7,500sqm for the project. “The project will treat toilet sewage and domestic effluents of entire Ponda municipal area and parts of Kavlem,” Dhavalikar said.

NASHIK: All the dams in the district are currently releasing water for agriculture and drinking purposes. The water resources department (WRD) said the rotation is likely to conclude by the first week of March.

“There is enough water in the dams this year. There are no restrictions on supply, except on those who are yet to clear water dues,” a WRD official said.

The dams releasing water are: Gautami-Godavari, Bhavli, Mukne, Darna, Gangapur, Kadva and others along the Gangarpur Left Bank Canal (LBC), the Godavari Right Bank Canal (RBC) and LBC, the Alandi RBC, the Palkhed RBC, Bhojapur LBC and one in the Kadva command area.

Water gushing through the canals will be picked up by the region’s farmers for drinking as well as agricultural purposes. The canal advisory committee of the district and the state has decided to release the rotation of the water from the dams.

Last year went on record as a drought year because of a dip in rainfall in 2018. The government, at the time, had enforced restrictions on water use, especially for agriculture as it had to preserve enough for drinking requirements.

“But rains in 2019 were more than sufficient. That is why water is currently being released without restrictions. This rotation of water will continue until the first week of March. Farmers can also apply for more water until February 28. The water will be released after the necessary payments are made,” a source from the WRD said.

In all 225 million cubic feet (mcft) of water is being released through the Gangapur LBC, of the Gangapur dam. Similarly, 2,400 mcft of water is being released through the Godavari LBC for Vailapur (Aurangabad district) and RBC (Shirdi, Rahata in Ahmednagar district) from Mukne and Darna dams.

Last year, the release of water was cut to 1,500 mcft. The next rotation of water in the district will be released towards the middle of April, an official said.

PUNE: The Corinthians Resort and Club in Undri hosted the Happy Streets once again but at a different time during the day.

Saturday evening thus witnessed a large crowd on the sprawling lawns at the Corinthians Resort and Club.

The large courtyard setting at the venue, with its manicured lawns and flat concrete surfaces, was a boon for children and adults alike. People with skateboards and roller skates thronged the lawns. Cycling enthusiasts also came with their bicycles for a traffic-free and uninterrupted ride.

The main-stage area, however, was a hive of activity, with dancers from Core Zumba and Bollybeats. Rahil Chowhan lead the crowd on for the duration of the event, to quirky and pulsating music.

Several in the crowd had even come prepared, wearing sports shoes and tracksuits, for a gruelling yet fun session of exercise and dance. Age was no bar for this activity as children, their parents and even a few grandparents joined in on the fun.

Near the main stage, Art Addict set up an art and creativity corner, where children learnt and applied the basics of art and craft to crate something. Making pinwheels at the corner seemed to be the highlight..

For the ones seeking a quieter experience, there was also a book corner, set up by the Undri-based Kitabi Chai library café, where many sat down on bean bags to scroll through multiple titles across genres, including comics and novels.

""I absolutely love this setting. The space is small and intimate, within the main Happy Streets venue while still eluding the hustle and bustle. My brother is part of the group which is participating in the Zumba session, while I am here contentedly reading books,"" said Aditya Shroff , a resident of Undri.

Happy Streets is an initiative of The Times of India in association with the Pune police, Pune traffic police, Pune Municipal Corporation and is powered by Nyati.

213,['24/02/2020'],Nashik: Satana town to receive piped drinking water by March 2020,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Representative image

NASHIK: The Satana town in Baglan taluka of the district is set to receive drinking water this summer through the 48-km-long pipeline being drawn from Chankapur Dam in Kalwan taluka to the Satana Municipal Council.

The work of laying the pipeline has gathered momentum after intervention of the Bombay high court.

The pipeline work was being carried out at the cost of Rs 51 crore, but at snail’s pace. A petition was then filed at the high court demanding speedy completion of the work.

The high court had asked the district administration to expedite the process so as to complete the work at the earliest. The work of laying pipeline has now garnered pace after the high court’s order, petitioners from the town said.

The work of laying pipeline began in June 2019 and was expected to be completed by December 2019. When the work of laying pipeline had started, farmers from the town had strongly opposed the move. They instead demanded that the water be supplied from the Girna River as was the earlier practice.

The plan to construct the pipeline was being objected to by the villagers in Kalwan taluka who were insisting that the water should be released through the open channel – the Girna River from the sources and that the same would be picked up by Satana civic body from Thengoda village (about 10 km away) which is the traditional manner.

Due to the strong opposition, locals of the town had to approach the HC and file the petition, after which the work on the pipeline began in June.

The water to be supplied through the pipeline would result in prevention of losses in the form of evaporation, seepage and wastage.

214,['24/02/2020'],NTCA eyes inter-state coordination to swell Similipal tiger population,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Bhubaneswar: To maintain a sustained tiger population in Similipal Tiger Reserve, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has decided to hold an inter-state coordination meeting involving Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

This, NTCA hopes, will help develop the landscape in the border areas of the three states adjoining Similipal and establish connectivity with the ‘source’ (native) population. NTCA said this has been experimented in tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh such as Pench, Kanha and Bandhavgarh.

NTCA member secretary Anup Nayak said they want Similipal to be connected to central India. “Tigers travel far and wide across connecting landscape and look for newer territories. In case of Similipal, if we are able to connect it with the neighbouring forest by developing the landscape with effective management strategies, then we will have a sustained and viable tiger population,” Nayak said.

The Odisha government in 2016 had pegged the population of Royal Bengal Tigers in the state at 40 with 26 of them being in Similipal alone. The state government had separately conducted the tiger survey again that year, ostensibly to dispute the NTCA data which had put the tiger count at 28, four less than that of 2010 census.

NTCA said recently it sighted a tiger with its cub close to Similipal reserve but on the Jharkhand side. “This is an indication that tiger movement is there in the adjoining forest areas in the neighbouring state. The landscape management thus is necessary to sustain tiger population in Similipal,” Nayak added.

According to NTCA’s plans, the villagers, officials of wildlife wing, NGOs and others will be involved in a capacity building workshop either in Odisha or Jharkhand to discuss how to develop the landscape so as to establish a connection with Similipal.

The state government’s census had also revealed that camera traps captured three melanistic (black stripe) tigers in Similipal, which is claimed to be the only reserve in the world having such tigers.

The NTCA said besides Similipal, the Sunabeda wildlife sanctuary in Nuapada district has also scope for development of tiger habitat.

215,['24/02/2020'],"NMC fire dept declares 1,482 buildings unsafe in fresh survey","This story is from February 24, 2020

Nagpur: The number of unsafe buildings has significantly gone up in the last two years, shows the latest survey by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) fire and emergency services department. As on January 20, 2020, the department has declared 1,482 city structures unsafe under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006 city.

They include all types, from residential properties to educational institutions, hospitals, industrial structures, bar and restaurant, mercantile centres, and mixed occupancies. The department has collated data of errant structures following inspections under two drives. In one, the department assessed 4,433 structures having first fire NOC while in the second it inspected 994 which were governed by old norms, prior to 2006. The latter group also includes 64 places where tuition classes are run. The department has served notices to disconnect power and water supplies at 812 places. Another 180 government buildings have been audited by the department under the same action plan, officials said.

NMC is likely to publish a list with the names of these violators on its website in a couple of days.

Officials said in many cases the electrical and water supply departments have been reluctant to cut off connections as they include essential services. For example, 141 hospitals have been declared ‘unsafe’ but the civic body can’t disconnect power and water supply unless they are vacated. In 120 cases, FIR has been recommended for violations but the cops too are reluctant to go ahead.

On August 3, 2018, TOI had highlighted that 782 structures out of 1,759 were tagged ‘unsafe’ between April 2017 and March 2018. On September 12, 2018, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had taken sou motu cognisance of the TOI report and initiated proceedings. NMC officials may move the court over police inaction in these cases.

At the same time, among the 4,433, compliance has been completed by 367 property owners. Of the 994, just 97 fixed the deviations and adopted fire safety measures. The department brought the old structures too under its crackdown as large number of people visit these places.

Against the backdrop of the 367 compliances, the jump in unsafe number to 1,482 indicates violations are rampant, while detection too gained pace following a rap from the HC.

Officials said the data gives status of contraventions and fire and safety audit of around 3,300 structures.

The figures are as on January 20, 2020, while the department’s inspection is going on. Officials said each month around 100 structures are being added to the list of violators.

Also, the department has identified 1,414 structures where inspection is yet to be conducted. The inspections are going on for the last five years.

Representative image

NASHIK: The cybercrime police in the city have registered an offence against an unidentified person for setting up a fake website — purportedly of the Tribal Development Commissionerate in Nashik — and placing recruitment advertisement on the same to cheat people.

On a complaint of a senior official from the Tribal Development Commissionerate, the cybercrime police have booked the unidentified person under sections 468 (forgery), 471 (using a forged document or electronic record as genuine) and other sections of the IPC and the Information Technology Act.

Devraj Borse, the senior PI of the cybercrime police station, said some unidentified person had set up the fake website online. The aim was to place advertisements on the website and make people pay money as examination fee for the posts. The police said the officials of the tribal commissionerate only came across the fake website on February 18. He said the site could have been online from even before that.

On the website — https://mahatribal.webs.com — the fraudster had advertised for filling the posts of junior engineer, civil engineer assistant, supervisor, lab assistant, peon etc. in places like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Jalgaon. The complainant also found that the examination fee mentioned on the website was Rs 500 for the general category and Rs 350 for the reserved categories.

The police said the website had a link for filling up the application form and a separate link for exam fee payment.

The complainant said on the website, the name and logo of the department were fake. He clarified that the commissionerate had not advertised for any post.

Borse said they are investigating the case. The website would also be removed from the internet. So far, no one has approached the police or the cybercrime police station to register a complaint saying that they have been cheated through the website.

Police officials said it is possible that since the amount of the examination fee is less, people have come forward to lodge complaints. However, the fraudster could have collected a huge amount of money if many people have fallen for the scam.

217,['24/02/2020'],Six new gecko species found in Western Ghats,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Research shows that the geckos are very habitat specific

PUNE: Scientists have found six new species of the endemic genus of Dravidogecko in the Western Ghats .

The six new species have been named Dravidogecko septentrionalis, D janakiae (in honour of Janaki Ammal, a botanist from Kerala), D tholpalli, D meghamalaiensis, D douglasadamsi (in honour of British author and satirist, Douglas Noel Adams) and D smithi (in honour of British herpetologist Malcolm Arthur Smith).

These geckos are nocturnal, exceptionally good climbers and prefer setting up their homes in tree trunks and abandoned structures. The findings were recently published in the international taxonomic journal Zootaxa.

Speaking to TOI, Pune-based Varad Giri, one of the team members, said the discovery was significant. “It is one of the oldest geckos that evolved in India. Around 58 million years ago, this gecko evolved and diversified into various parts of India. Until recently, only one species was known and the genus is endemic to the Western Ghats. This was the Dravidogecko anamallensis.”

Lead researcher R Chaitanya’s investigative expeditions in the Western Ghats led to the discovery that these geckos were very habitat specific and confined to a particular habitat. He collected them and made a close examination of their DNA, looked at their taxonomy and identification characteristics. After thorough investigations, he realised that it is more than one species. Altogether six new species have been described.

Chaitanya, a Bengaluru-based IT engineer turned independent researcher, said, “We started examining this genus in 2015. In 1875, Albert Günther, a British-German herpetologist first described the species in this group, naming it Dravidogecko anamallensis as it was found in the Anaimalai hills.”

After Chaitanya and his team conducted fieldwork in the Western Ghats, they came across the different species. “We’ve been encountering these geckos in various places, not just Anaimalai, for long. So, we realised that this cannot be just one species, because they’re found in so many places in the Western Ghats,” he added. Their study led them to collect geckos from other places in the Western Ghats.

The other team members were Deepak Veerappan, Natural History Museum, London, Aniruddha Datta-Roy, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, BHCK Murthy, Zoological Survey of India, Kozhikode and Praveen Karanth from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.

Dr AK Singh, Deputy Director General (Horticulture Science) ICAR, New Delhi and Director of National Research ... Read More

TRICHY: The wilt disease surfaced in Cavendish group of bananas poses a great threat to the banana production in the country. With no proper interstate quarantine protocols, spread to various places is not very far, Dr A K Singh, deputy director-general (Horticulture Science) ICAR , New Delhi, has said.

“The emergence of wilt disease in Cavendish bananas poses a great threat to the production especially in Bihar, UP and adjoining regions. Being soil-borne, Fusarium wilt TR-4 can spread easily through soil, air and humans. With no proper interstate quarantine protocols, spread to other states is not very far. This is expected to shake the Indian banana industry,” Singh told reporters here on Sunday. He was in the city to attend the second-day event of the four-day international conference on banana – 2020.

The disease has thrown a huge challenge to researchers working on bananas and also the quarantine officials to thwart the spread. TR-4 has not only affected Grand Nain but has the capacity to eradicate the entire banana industry in our country as it can infect the entire cultivated banana except for a few indigenous varieties, he cautioned.

National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB), Trichy and Queensland University of Technology, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) have joined hands to produce bio-fortified bananas, which are rich in beta-carotene and iron through transgenic approach, he said.

He also stressed the need to produce 40 million tonnes of bananas by 2030 to cater to 130 crore people in the country against the present production of 29.3 million tonnes.

“Banana is being cultivated in a very smaller area, but played a big role, and in future, it will play a bigger role. The germplasm of banana, which is being maintained in the field gene bank of NRCB, is Asia’s largest collection. Most of these wild banana varieties possess resistance to many biotic stresses. The centre coming out with a few novel banana varieties suitable to grow in different states is a milestone in banana R and D. Though we lead in the production of bananas, the crop is more prone to the vagaries of abiotic stresses and faces threats from many biotic factors such as pest and diseases. We hope the ongoing conference will bring out valuable suggestions for the improvement of the bananas,” he said.

Export of banana from India is very meagre, that is 0.3% and there is an ample scope to increase the export to the Middle East countries and also European markets. The technologies developed by the NRCB, especially the shipping protocol, which has witnessed a quantum jump in the export of Nendran to Middle East countries, a value worth several crores, he said. NRCB, Trichy director S Uma and senior scientists were also present.

PANAJI: As the celebrations of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will culminate in October 2020, schools will be holding a number of programmes during the new academic year from June to October, including lessons on ‘values of tolerance and democracy’.

Students will carry out programmes for taking care of trees and animals in the neighbourhood as part of a kindness initiative and will also participate in shramdaan to learn dignity of labour.

The celebrations were to take place over two years from October 2018 to October 2020. Schools have now been given month-wise themes, based on which the programmes are to be held.

Director of education Vandana Rao has asked schools to hold a Gandhi Olympiad and have suggested activities like writing 150 quotes of Mahatma Gandhi, 150 days of community service over one year by schools, planting 150 trees, cycling for 150kms, doing 150 acts of kindness, saving 150 litres of water, mass jogging with 150 schools in the district, among others.

When the schools reopen after the summer vacations, they have been told to carry out activities through the month of June based on ‘love and kindness to animals, plants and birds’. It has been suggested that students can maintain the school garden and provide food to animals and birds in their neighbourhood and homes.

In July, students will learn the ‘ value of tolerance and democracy’, where teachers will deliver lectures on fundamental rights and duties of citizens. It has been recommended that a bal sansaad (kids’ parliament) be organised.

While August will be the month to learn dignity of labour through shramdaan, September will see focus on nature conservation. Tree plantation, water conservation, waste disposal and sensitisation on climate change are the suggested activities.

SALIGAO: The issue of illegal filling up of field belonging to the Guirim comunidade was hotly debated at the Guirim gram sabha held on Sunday. Deputy sarpanch Sunny Nanodkar chaired the meeting.

At the start, the panchayat secretary read out the minutes of the previous gram sabha and the budget allocation for 2020-21 under which the panchayat has been allocated nearly Rs 14.9 lakh under the 14th Finance Commission.

Later, an argument broke out between deputy sarpanch Sunny Nanodkar and Guirim comunidade attorney Victor Zuzarte over the illegal filling up of fields in the village. Zuzarte accused the panchayat of issuing NOCs for dumping. Refuting the charges, Nanodkar said it was the comunidade itself which was permitting this. After much deliberation, a resolution was adopted that no illegal filling will be permitted in the fields.

The issue of rising cases of accident due to movement of heavy vehicles on internal roads, loaded with construction material for highway expansion work, also came up for discussion. Pointing to a recent incident where one such truck had collided with an oncoming vehicle, locals demanded that action be taken. A resolution was adopted not to allow these trucks to pass through the village. Nanodkar said the panchayat would send these resolutions to the transport department and to the RTO.

One villager, Phondu Naik , demanded that the panchayat preserve the water bodies of the village. Nanodkar agreed to this and a resolution was passed.

222,['24/02/2020'],No smart cities plans talk about sports,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Trichy: Trichy City Corporation is yet to realize the importance of developing sports infrastructure in the city, the population of which has cruised past 10 lakh as on 2020. While the civic body spends more than Rs 900 crore through the smart cities mission under various developmental heads, it has spent nothing exclusively for establishing new stadiums and sports complexes or developing the existing playgrounds.

The 25 smart cities mission proposals suggested by the corporation mostly focus on beautification of the city neighbourhoods, developing green spaces, and solid waste management. Sports infrastructure development was completely ignored by the civic body in the proposals. The civic body in its 25 years of existance has failed to establish a dedicated sports complex for sports enthusiasts in the city. The only exception is the Anna Sports stadium at Khajamalai.

A playground to train students in outdoor games at an affordable price is still a dream for many parents. In the absence of stadiums, sports associations depend on the grounds and courts on city college campuses to host state and national level sports tournaments.

""An integrated sports complex with space for various sports activities will nurture local talents. Such a facility will prevent players from migrating to other cities for achieving their goals,"" said C Rengaraju, secretary, Tiruchirappalli District Football Association (TDFA). Recently, a national tennis tournament was conducted at a couple of private clubs here as the existing tennis courts at Anna Stadium were inadequate.

However, the smart city projects never had plans to set up playgrounds to train talents from economically backward families. ""Like the cricket ground inaugurated in Salem recently, Trichy can also have one. To encourage young talents and train them, Trichy desperately needs a new sports complex,"" Scorer R Kannan, a sports enthusiast, said. Even as the corporation and the district administration have lands on the Madurai Road and Pudukkottai Road, they do nothing on setting up any kind of sports infrastructure.

""Drainage and water supply projects are our priorities in utilizing the smart cities mission fund. There are no immediate plans to focus on sports infrastructure development,"" a senior official with Trichy City Corporation said. A plan to establish a swimming pool near Thennur is also uncertain.

Bhubaneswar: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is set to be re-elected as the BJD president for the record eighth time. He filed his nomination papers at the party headquarters here on Sunday.

Given that he is the only leader to have filed his papers for the post, Naveen’s re-election as the BJD chief is a foregone conclusion.

Accompanied by senior party leaders, Naveen filed the nomination papers before the party’s state returning officer Pratap Keshari Deb. Altogether 10 leaders, including two general secretaries of the headquarters and the organization, leaders from different regions and SC/ST communities signed as proposers on Naveen’s nomination form.

Eighty other leaders also filed their nominations for election to the state executive committee, which is the apex decision-making body of BJD.

“We are in the last phase of the organizational polls. The nomination papers for the post of party president and for the state executive committee will be scrutinized on Monday. The leaders can also withdraw their nomination papers on Tuesday. The results will be announced in the meeting of the newly-formed state council on February 26,” Deb told reporters after the nomination process.

After his re-election as the party president for the eighth time, Naveen is also scheduled to address the party workers at the BJD headquarters on February 26. With the election to the post of BJD president, the party’s organizational poll process, which had started in December will be concluded.

“Our party president has always emphasized on maintaining democracy within the party. Accordingly, the organizational election was held from the level of ward to the state president in a democratic manner,” BJD Rajya Sabha member Amar Patnaik said.

Endorsing Naveen’s leadership, senior BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab said, “Under Naveen babu’s leadership, our party has won five assembly elections. People of Odisha have high hopes from his leadership. We all support his re-election.”

Naveen has been leading the party since its inception on December 26, 1997. He has also led the party to a record five-term victory in the recent assembly election.

After his re-election, the ruling party will restructure its organization with the induction of new leaders as vice presidents, general secretaries, secretary and treasurer. Party insiders said the students, youth, women and other frontal organizations will also be restructured soon.

Saligao: The Reis Magos panchayat on Sunday resolved to stop issuing construction licences to new projects.

At the gram sabha held on Sunday, the villagers said the town and country planning department has been putting conditions on the panchayat’s technical clearance orders, stating that the panchayat has to verify the water and electricity requirements of the village before granting construction licences.

The villagers further said the panchayat has been violating the condition since 2009.

The locals said that the influx of migrants and their increasing population is the reason for the inadequate water supply and interrupted electricity in the village.

The meeting, which was held at Reis Magos government school, was chaired by panch member Kedar Naik in the absence of sarpanch Virendra Shirodkar.

The budget allocation for the next financial year could not be placed before the gram sabha owing to various issues raised by the villagers.

AHMEDABAD: With US President Donald Trump’s visit to Sabarmati Ashram confirmed late on Saturday night, the bandobust figures have gone up. Ahmedabad police commissioner, Ashish Bhatia, said that Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has been roped in to check for drones and no one should fly such objects near the route of Trump’s convoy and the Motera stadium. Bhatia added that police have had meetings with residents in areas near the airport and Motera stadium and made them aware of the importance of security for the US president’s visit.

This is the first time in Gujarat that the IAF and the DRDO is being deployed for the security of a state guest, sources said. US secret service agents will also be present for the security of the US president. Police said IAF will man the skies and keep fighter planes ready for any emergency.

The number of police officials and security personnel deployed for the security of US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for their visit to Sabarmati Ashram and the Namaste Trump event has gone up to 12,000 said Bhatia. Police sources added that 600 walkie-talkie sets will be used at the bandobust.

Bhatia said that the stadium can hold 1.08 lakh spectators and appropriate security arrangements, water and parking facilities have been made. A PSI will be present at each parking slot.

Top police officials said that on Sunday an advance security liaison (ASL) was held. Agencies such as the city police, US secret service, DRDO, IAF, SPG and NSG participated in the meeting and discussed the security plans.

226,['24/02/2020'],ARI experts: No threat to ‘endangered’ grass species,"This story is from February 24, 2020

The grass is used for thatching of roofs by locals before monsoon

PUNE: Scientists from city-based Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) have found a grass species that was declared 'endangered' by the Botanical Survey of India may not be so threatened after all.

Dichanthium jainii, colloquially known as 'kolim' was tagged “Endangered (EN)” in 2001 after a critical threat status assessment was carried out as per IUCN Red List Categories. But upon critical field investigations by ARI researchers, it was found to be utilized by local communities of northern Western Ghats for various purposes like roof thatching. The presence of the species in the region is extensive and thus, it may not be threatened, the researchers said. The study was published in the journal National Academy of Science Letters.

Mandar N Datar, a scientist in ARI, who led the study, said, “The grass is used for roof thatching before the advent of monsoon. It was placed under threatened plant category due to its under-representation in herbarium collections. The categorization of the grass as threatened stems from the fact that there are just a handful number of specimens of Dichanthium jainii, endemic to Sahyadri, northern Western Ghats, deposited in various herbaria of the region.”

He said there are very few specimens of the species in literatures like (apart from its types in western India herbaria) Agharkar Research Institute herbarium (AHMA), Botanical Survey of India, Western Regional Centre (BSI), Shivaji University Herbarium, Kolhapur (SUK) and Blatter herbarium, Mumbai (BLAT), which reinforce its rarity in the wild. “But upon critical investigations, we found that the practice of using and growing Kolim is prevalent in local communities around Mahabaleshwar and it is grown in abundance in northern Western Ghats,” he added.

Ketaki Ghate, founders and managing partner, Oikos for Ecological Services, who was part of the research, said, “This grass is not only conserved by local inhabitants in situ but also planted for domestic use by every household. The paradoxical situation of its threat status, based on herbarium studies, and its extensive extent of occurrence, is a result of overlooking traditional knowledge in taxonomic surveys.”

Pune Municipal Corporation

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has completed about 75% survey pertaining to the existing land use (ELU) patterns in 11 villages merged in the city limits in 2018.

The ELU survey is a key element in drafting the development plan (DP) for these merged areas, which the PMC started since last year. The draft DP is expected to be ready by next year and sent to the state government for approval.

Civic officials said the ELU survey was a detailed study of how the land has been utilised in the merged villages. “Preliminary observations have pointed to mixed land use since residential and commercial activities have gone up in the merged areas in the last few years. There have been changes in land tiles and the ownership has been fragmented in many areas because of additions in the family over the years,” an official said.

The areas that have been merged in the city are located on the periphery. The residents here have been demanding better civic amenities and planned development.

A population of 3.5 lakh has been added to the city because of the merger.

A senior PMC official said that the ELU survey will continue for another six months. “We are expecting to complete the remaining 25% work by mid-2020,” he added.

The administration has also started demographic, socio-economic and house survey conducted by the city-based Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. The survey will help in understanding the housing patterns, population density and social background of the existing population residing in the merged areas.

The official said the civic administration plans to start the proposed land use study after completion of ELU and demographics survey.

“There is a plan to complete all the studies in the next one year. The draft of the DP will be ready by next year,” the official said.

228,['24/02/2020'],MSU study finds out what makes Gujaratis obese and diabetic!,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Vadodara: If the moment you step on a weighing scale and the meter acts crazy, don’t take the weight on your head. Blame your genes.

A genetic study has found a combination of nucleotide, identified as ‘GGTG’, responsible for obesity amongst Gujaratis. And it may also be responsible for type-2 diabetes, said a team of researchers from M S University’s Department of Biochemistry.

The researchers have detected the presence of this unique set of nucleotides (haplotype) in the adiponectin gene among obese and type-2 diabetic patients in Gujarat.

Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA of a human body, explained Prof Rasheedunnisa Begum, who, along with professor A V Ramachandran from Zoology department, has been working on population genetics for more than 10 years now.

“My students had done genotyping of adiponectin gene in 1,000 Gujarati individuals. Of them, 500 were suffering from type-2 diabetes and the other 500 were healthy individuals,” said Begum.

The genotyping revealed that this combination of nucleotide was found to very predominantly prevalent among type-2 diabetes patients who were also obese.

Adiponectin gene synthesizes adiponectin hormone. This hormone is less in people suffering from obesity and type-2 diabetes, the professor said, adding that less hormone levels develop insulin resistance among these individuals which eventually leads to type-2 diabetes.

Research scholars involved in this work with Begum include Sayantani Pramanik Palit, Roma Patel, Shahnawaz Jadeja, Nirali Rathwa and Dr Ankit Mahajan.

The research findings have been published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed reputed scientific journal.

While type-2 diabetes and obesity are a global phenomenon, its prevalence is also based on ethnicity owing primarily to food habits and lifestyle besides the genetic makeup of the ethnic groups to a certain extent.

“Adiponectin gene and its hormone on the DNA within the gene depends on ethnic variation among different populations,” said Begum, who earlier conducted a similar study among Kashmiri individuals and didn’t find any such genetic association.

“This means that GGTG is one of the genetic factors that make Gujaratis prone or at risk of becoming obese and developing type-2 diabetes,” Begum added.

Begum’s earlier collaborative study in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) was done along with Dr Swarkar Sharma and Prof Manoj K Dhar affiliated to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra and Jammu University.

Representative image

NASHIK: Highways passing through the city are dangerous, but the city’s interior roads are more accident-prone. Going by the figures available with the city police, more people die on the interior roads than on the state and national highways.

Last year, there were 553 road accidents in the city. Of them, 135 accidents took place on the highways — mainly on Mumbai-Agra and Nashik-Pune highways or other state highways — as many as 418 took place on the city’s internal roads. The accidents on the internal roads also claimed the lives of 119 people as against 58 on the national and state highways.

ACP Mangalsingh Suryawanshi of the city traffic branch attributed the accidents to the driving habits of motorists. “Motorists are usually more careful while driving on the highways than they are while driving on city roads or internal roads. Most of the two-wheeler riders have helmets, but they do not wear them. We often find women keeping their helmets in the dickey of their scooters and men hanging them to their bike handles.”

A week ago, two youngsters were killed in a road accident on an internal road in the Nashik Road area when they were knocked down by a truck.

Many residents said that there is no discipline among motorists or even the general public about the way to drive or park their vehicles on the road.

Mahesh Kasar, an engineer who lives in the Nashik Road area, said, “There are various issues on the internal road. Groups of youngsters stand on the road without any consideration for the heavy movement of vehicles. There are also haphazardly parked cars that occupy half of the road. Then there are pedestrians walking on the carriageway unmindful of the vehicles. Many internal roads also have shops and vegetable markets.”

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Garbage burning has affected the quality of life for residents of Nigdi and Talawade villages in Pimpri Chinchwad city, with locals unable to even open a window or breathe in fresh air.

As many as lakh of residents of Nigdi and Talawade villages in Pimpri Chinchwad city are affected by the smoke and foul odour emanating from rampant garbage burning in the Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DCB) limits, MNS corporator Sachin Chikhale said.

“Around a lakh residents living along the border with cantonment are affected by this garbage burning. Senior citizens, children and asthma patients are worst hit. PCMC and DCB must find a permanent solution to the problem otherwise we would conduct agitations at the PCMC office in Pimpri and DCB office in Dehu Road,” he said.

DCB dumps its dry garbage on defence land bordering Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. The villages of Nigdi and Talawade are located along the border that is affected by the smoke emanating from the burning garbage.

“Fires occur regularly at the cantonment garbage dumping site. We have to close the windows after 6pm due to the heavy smoke,” Vijay Salve , a resident of Sector 22 in Nigdi, said.

A civic health department official said the garbage dumping and burning occurs outside the municipal limits so the civic body cannot take any action.

“Dry garbage is only dumped on defence land near Nigdi. We do not burn garbage. Fires occur naturally as methane produced by the garbage catches fire. There was a major fire a fortnight ago which was immediately doused. We have stationed water tankers to douse the fires,” a cantonment official said.

PCMC municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.

Nagpur: The two regional transport offices — Nagpur city and deputy east — are registering two-wheelers only if the dealers are providing two helmets to the buyers following high court orders. Apart from bills, the RTOs are also taking an undertaking from two-wheeler buyers that they have received two helmets with the purchase of the vehicle.

Deputy RTO Atul Adey said, “City RTO Dinkar Manwar has issued a notification and directed all 20 automobile dealers in the city to supply two protective headgears to the buyers at the time of delivery of two-wheelers.”

Apart from high court orders, the city RTO has also cited the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 138 (4)(f), which says, “At the time of the purchase of two-wheeler, the manufacturer shall supply a protective headgear confirming specifications prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards under the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986 (63), provided that these conditions shall not apply to category to person exempted in terms of Section 129 and the rules made there under by the concern state governments.”

Nikhil Kusumgar, one of the two-wheeler dealers, said that following high court’s directives, all the dealers in the city are mandatorily providing two BSI headgears to the buyers. He admitted that many buyers were trying to confront the decision by saying that they already have helmets. “But we reject such an argument,” he said.

The deputy RTO said, “Our motor vehicle inspectors (MVIs) and assistant motor vehicle inspectors (AMVIs) too are cross checking the bills of every buyer that they got two protective headgears apart from asking them to provide an undertaking about receiving two helmets with the purchase of the vehicle.” Manwar has issued instructions to all AMVIs and MVIs registering new vehicles to strictly follow the rule.

“This new order is unrealistic and problematic for all those consumers who might be purchasing their second two-wheeler or already have a helmet,” said Gajanan Pande, organizing secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat, Vidarbha chapter.

He said, “The order is a welcome move but at the same time, the high court must ask enforcement agencies like RTO and traffic police to ensure even pillion riders wear helmets. The order has also added to the bill of newly purchased two-wheelers to cover the costs of new helmets.”

Shubhankar Darbari (in a white T-shirt) at a donor’s residence

PUNE: A 17-year-old student, Shubhankar Darbari, has created a medicine bank by collecting surplus drugs from relatives and families living around his school for the people in need.

Shubhankar, who started this “bank” as a part of a community project in school about four years ago, has now turned it into a non-profit organisation, “Aid2Needy”, and created a stock of medicines he sends to charitable hospitals for distribution.

The medicines the Victorious Kidss Educares (VKE) student collects are usually donated by people who have a surplus of them. The teenager has also developed a cellphone-based application for people to raise donation requests. Once there’s a donation request alert on the app, the volunteers appointed by Shubhankar can collect the drugs from their doorstep.

“It’s a unique ‘bank’ for the well-offs to donate their surplus medicines. People from the economically challenged section, who cannot afford to buy medicines, can get them free of cost from the ‘bank’ through the charitable hospitals,” said Shubhankar, who aspires to set up similar units across the country.

The idea of ‘Aid2Needy’ came to him when he, in 2015, met Omkar Nath Sharma , popularly known as “medicine baba” conducting a similar activity in New Delhi. “After meeting him, I realized that the cause should be carried out in other cities by using technology as a leveraging tool. Keeping this in mind, I created a prototype portal by online training programmes.”

VKE president Robbin Ghosh said, “Shubhankar is inspired by the philosophy that our life is meant to serve people. He is working meticulously for the past four years to give something back to the community. He is also studying seriously to set a mark in academics. Such thoughts and efforts at an early age are extraordinary.”

Sambalpur: The Central Action Committee (CAC) of all western Odisha bar associations on Sunday announced that the lawyers would participate in regular case hearings in courts across the region from Monday.

The lawyers, under the aegis of the CAC, have been agitating since September 5, 2018 to step up the demand for the establishment of a high court bench in western Odisha. Though they had been participating in all court works, they were abstaining from regular case hearings since March last year.

The CAC decision to restore normalcy in courts followed after after a meeting held on the premises of the Sambalpur Bar Association here on Sunday.

Addressing the media after the meeting, senior CAC member Sureswar Mishra said, “The CAC appeared in Supreme Court on February 17. Its secretary filed an affidavit giving details regarding the genesis of the movement for the establishment of a high court bench in western Odisha before the Supreme Court. The SC has accepted the affidavit and enlisted it for hearing. The next hearing over the issue has been scheduled on March 23.”

He further said in accordance with the direction of the Supreme Court, the CAC decided that lawyers across the region would participate in the regular hearing of cases in the courts.

The CAC has also issued an ultimatum to the state government. “If the state government does send a comprehensive proposal to the Centre regarding the establishment of an HC bench in western Odisha by March 31, the lawyers will intensify the agitation,” CAC convener Ashok Dash said.

The agitation for the establishment of a high court bench dates back to more than five decades. The lawyers had started the ‘no court, no hearing agitation’ on September 5, 2018. The state bar council had also recommended to the Bar Council of India (BCI) to take disciplinary action against the agitating bar associations of western Odisha.

India’s first woman professional footballer got 80 minutes on the field, and even though she didn’t add her name to the scoresheet, she did enough to impress.

“She had a good game for 80 minutes and was the last to be substituted. This is a good beginning for her. She can only get better,” said her representative Anuj Kichlu.

The match was initially scheduled to kick off at the natural turf ground but inclement weather with fears of snow meant the match had to be pushed indoors. Bala – handed the No. 10 jersey -- knew she would be handed a start and did well not to get overawed.

Rangers, who are among the two professional teams in the SWPL, led 1-0 at the change of ends and controlled proceedings from start to finish. Megan Bell (12th minute, 61st) scored a brace, while Kirsten Reilly hammered the final nail as the title aspirants kicked off their campaign on a winning note.

VADODARA: Four pilgrims from Ahmednagar of Maharashtra died after their car collided head-on with a truck in Narmada district on Sunday.

Nand Kishor Sampat, Kishor Kolhe, Gorakh Ghorpade and Pravin Sirsaath had visited Kuber Bhandari temple in Chanod on Saturday. Police said after offering prayers on Saturday, the four persons decided to leave for Ahmednagar in the early hours of Sunday as it was a 10-hour drive.

Around 5.30am when they were passing through the ghats near Vishalkhadi village, Sampat, who was driving the vehicle, overtook a truck but did not notice another truck coming from the opposite direction. Police said the truck from the opposite direction was slow as it was loaded with cotton bales, but Sampat’s car, which was in speed, collided with it with a loud bang. The car’s bonnet got completely mangled and the four pilgrims died on the spot. The driver and helper of the truck were unhurt.

Villagers rushed to spot on hearing the loud sound. Many tried to call ambulance and police but as the region is hilly, there was no mobile network. Police sources said the villagers went to a higher terrain and could connect to Rajpipla police station. An ambulance reached the spot and paramedical staff declared the four car passengers namely Nand Kishor Sampat, Kishor Kolhe, Gorakh Ghorpade and Pravin Sirsaath dead.

Salem: A 32-year-old bull tamer, who was injured critically in the jallikattu that was held at Nagiyampatti village near Thamampatti here on Saturday, has died in the government hospital without responding to treatment.

Police identified the deceased as Prabhakaran alias Kanagaraj, of Pudukottai. He was knocked down by a bull in the arena. A police officer said the identity card possessed by Prabhakaran did not have his name and instead bore the name of Mahendran. He said they were inquiring whether Prabhakaran had impersonated as Mahendran and entered the arena.

“We are inquiring if it is a case of impersonation. We have approached the organizers for details of all the bull tamers, who had registered with them,’’ the officer said.

The event, which featured more than 550 bulls from Salem and neighbouring districts and about 350 tamers, commenced on Saturday morning in the presence of district collector S A Raman, superintendent of police Deepa Kanikar and other senior officials and went on till 5pm.

Those who suffered minor injuries were treated near the jallikattu arena by a team of doctors and those with major injuries were sent to the government hospital.

“Along with 20 other injured bull tamers, Prabhakaran was undergoing treatment at the government hospital, where he succumbed to the injuries the same night. Five other injured are still being treated at the hospital, while the rest have been discharged,” the officer said.

More than 30 shops and houses were set ablaze in Akbarpura area

VADODARA/ ANAND: Communally sensitive Akbarpura area of coastal town of Khambhat in Anand district turned violent again on Sunday afternoon with at least 13 persons injured in incidents of stone pelting. More than 30 houses and shops were also set ablaze by the rioters in the late afternoon flare up that soon escalated beyond control.

According to sources, the rioters vandalised dozen-odd vehicles including auto rickshaws, two-wheelers and cycles.

Local police had to lob around 30 tear gas shells to bring the situation under control.

Absence of enough police presence in the town is said to be why the rioters couldn’t be brought under control immediately. Most of the cops have been deployed to Ahmedabad for US President Donald Trump’s visit.

The riots initially broke out in Akbarpura area when groups belonging to different communities resorted to heavy stone pelting.

Later, it spread to other areas of the town including Lal Darwaja, Bhoi wadi, Teen Bati, bus stand and Bhavsarwad. The skirmishes continued for nearly two hours.

Almost all the shops in the town remained closed during the day as tension gripped almost all the major markets that wore a deserted look.

“The situation is under control now,” said Kheda district superintendent of police Divya Mishra, who is currently in-charge of neighbouring Anand district, while talking to TOI. He confirmed that one of those injured is serious.

“One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) has arrived and has been deployed. Once the situation normalises, a formal offence will be registered,” he said.This is the second communal flare-up within 30 days in Akbarpura. Earlier on January 24, similar clashed between members of Muslim and Chunara community had led to wide spread riots in the town that had left 15 cops injured and an elderly man dead in the firing. Cops had arrested over 50 accused in connection to the riots in which 10 houses and shops were set ablaze while several vehicles were vandalized.

GORAKHPUR: Dr Kafeel Khan ’s maternal uncle was allegedly shot dead in front of his house in Rajghat area over a land dispute on Saturday night. Two persons have been booked for murder , on the basis of the family’s complaint.

Khan, a paediatrician suspended from Gorakhpur BRD Medical College in 2017, was arrested last month for allegedly making inflammatory statements during anti-CAA protests in Aligarh Muslim University . He was also charged with the National Security Act .

Police said Dr Nusratullah Warsi (55), a property dealer, was returning from his neighbour’s house, where he had gone to play carom, when he was shot. Hearing gunfire, his family rushed out only to see him lying in a pool of blood.

In their police complaint, the family has named Imamuddin of Kotwali and Anil Sonkar of Gorakhnath as murder suspects. A hunt has been launched to nab them. Cops added that the attackers may have been acquainted with Warsi as they knew his routine.

Police said the motive for murder seemed to be a property dispute, as per preliminary investigation. “In November last year, Warsi had won a case related to 4.5-acre land from Imamuddin and Nikhat Ara after they had illegally registered the land in their name. Warsi also had a dispute with Imamuddin for 12-acre land in Siddharthnagar . Sonkar had invested Rs 1.9 crore in Warsi’s construction company and was trying to get his money back,” Kotwali CO V P Singh said.

An FIR has been registered against two persons under sections 302 (murder) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.

Nagpur: A group of city principals will be visiting Delhi government schools to study the turnaround witnessed by these institutions under Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Admi Party (AAP). School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA) office bearers said the visit is likely to happen in second or third week of March.

Zafar Khan, founder-president of SHCA, said, “The Delhi school model is something which needs to be studied in great detail. It is amazing how Kejriwal and education minister Manish Sisodiya have transformed schools there. SHCA will be visiting some of these schools and interacting with education department officials at Delhi to understand how the change was achieved.” Khan, who is currently in Delhi, is completing the preliminary formalities for the visit which will happen next month.

SHCA, which represents aided school principals from Nagpur district, says this visit will not just be for photo-ops. Khan said, “The Delhi visit and meet with education officials will be precursor to a serious introspection among us all. Once back in Nagpur, we will hold intensive meets with members and see how we can do the same with Maharashtra schools.”

After these meets within the principals’ fraternity, SHCA plans to take feedback from other stakeholders like parents, students, social workers, counsellors etc and prepare a comprehensive report. Khan said, “Our report will contain all aspects about Delhi schools and how they achieved this turnaround. Then, we will discuss ground realities about Maharashtra and what needs to be done to repeat the Delhi school success model.”

SHCA won’t be the first group from Nagpur to head out to Delhi to learn from their schooling success. Last year, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had also sent a team comprising corporators and some officials to Delhi to survey how schools are working there.

Even MLC Nago Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, has been a vocal supporter of the Delhi model. Ganar said all governments must increase expenditure on school education drastically to achieve desired results.

AURANGABAD: Pundaliknagar police , probing the inter-state cheque cloning racket, has recovered Rs 16 lakh that was withdrawn by one of the suspects.

It is the first recovery made by the police after an FIR was registered in the cases that reportedly has connections in different parts of the state and in Bihar.

According to police , they are looking for three more suspects in the case — a local politician, an educationist and a banker. “All three are from different districts of the state, and only after their arrest, other members of the racket would come on record and procedure to arrest them would be initiated,” a police officer said.

Investigation officer and assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said, “We have recovered Rs 16 lakh from an accused identified as Bhagwan Muley of Karmad.”

Currently, Muley and Shivaji Thombre of Gadhejalgaon are in the judicial custody. An accomplice of Thombre has gone underground.

Investigation team has found that an amount of Rs 97,000 was withdrawn from a nationalized bank on February 4 and this was followed by transfer of Rs 16 lakh on February 5. Later, on February 7, an attempt was made by the suspects to withdraw Rs 78 lakh. All the transaction was done by using cloned cheques.

“Initial probe has revealed role of a suspect hailing from Vasmat, but we are finding it difficult to trace him. Thombre along with his close-aide from Vasmat bought material worth Rs 10 lakh from Muley, who apart from being an influential sarpanch, has several businesses in Karmad and surrounding areas,” the officer said.

“The duo handed over cloned cheque of Rs 16 lakh belonging to Bablu Laxman Hari of Bhagalpur in Bihar to Muley and asked him to get the amount transferred to his account. The suspects then asked Muley to deduct the outstanding amount and give back Rs 6 lakh to them,” he added.

Thombre along with the suspect from Vasmat have been working closely with a Vidarbha man, who through his contact in banks got details of accounts that do not have mobile phone numbers linked to them and misused the information for carrying out the fraud transactions.

NEW DELHI: In tune with the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy 2019, the discoms in the capital are eyeing a network of more than 280 charging stations for e-vehicles (EVs) by the end of this year.While Tata Power, which has 12 charging stations, is planning 50 new ones, the two BSES discoms are trying to add 179 to their existing infrastructure. BSES, which now has 45 stations, expects to get nine more by March 31, taking the count to 54.BSES has gone into partnerships with several organisations to set up smart EV charging stations across its licensed areas, said an official. A Tata Power official pointed out that as Delhi government had been focusing on scaling up the use of electric vehicles in the next five years, the vehicles running on clean fuel would need these additional charging stations for smooth operation.The e-vehicle policy aims at curbing vehicular pollution by adding five lakh EVs in five years and focuses on its key contributors — two-wheelers, shared transport vehicles and goods carriers or freight vehicles. To improve Delhi’s air quality by bringing down emissions from the transport sector, the policy wants to drive rapid adoption of battery electric vehicles in such a way that they constitute 25% of the new vehicle registrations by 2024.Delhi government itself has been targeting induction of 35,000 electric two-, three- and four-wheelers, 1,000 electric vehicles for last-mile connectivities and 250 public charging and battery-swapping stations.The BSES official said the company had signed a memorandum of understanding with Ola Electric for setting up battery-swapping and charging stations at mutually identified spots. “While BSES Rajdhani Power Limited will set up the stations in south and west Delhi, BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) will do so in east and central Delhi to hasten the adoption of EVs in the city. Two- and three-wheelers will be able to avail both services at these stations. Electric cars can also be charged at some of these stations,” he added.Battery-swapping stations will virtually eliminate the wait time for charging, thus removing a major impediment in the adoption of EVs. Such measures will provide the much-needed trigger to increase the penetration of EVs in Delhi and go a long way in reducing pollution, the official claimed.Space constraints, however, may prove to be a hurdle in setting up more charging stations. “It may pose a slight challenge in certain pockets when the number of electric vehicles increases significantly.

TRICHY: Even after ten days, the higher education department is yet to conduct an inquiry into the alleged physical assault by regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE) Trichy S Usha on her subordinate staff.

She has been asked to go on compulsory leave soon after the incident, but no action has been taken on the incident. This is not the first such case. Last April, she was accused of abusing her subordinate staff using filthy language. Then also she was asked to go on compulsory leave. However, she returned to the seat within 15 days without facing any inquiry. Her ‘high-level’ contacts is said to have helped her return without facing any action, said a sources at the RJDCE office.

Meanwhile, the complainants have moved their third memorandum to the chief minister’s cell, director of collegiate education, higher education minister and the secretary.

Speaking to TOI, higher education secretary Apoorva said that Usha has been asked to go on compulsory leave and an inquiry will be initiated in the next few days.

Asked on the delay in initiating the inquiry, she said that the issue could not be discussed because of the busy assembly sessions. The complaints will be considered and necessary action will be initiated.

Members of the Association of University Teachers have also written to the higher education department seeking inquiry into the issue. “Earlier also Usha was reinstated within two weeks after complaints of abuse by staff. This has encouraged her to do physical assault on her staff,” said members of the AUT.

Namakkal girl gets Rs 2 lakh

NAMAKKAL: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has announced a financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to a Class IX girl from Nallipalayam in the district for her visit to the American space agency Nasa .

The girl, V Abinaya, daughter of T Venkatachalam, had cleared an online contest that was conducted by a private agency to participate in a space conference scheduled for May this year at Nasa. “To appreciate Abinaya and to encourage the younger generation, I have ordered a sum of Rs 2 lakh for her,” the chief minister said in a statement on Sunday.

Congratulating her, Palaniswami said he was happy to hear about Abinaya’s success in the online contest and her visit to the USA.

A Class IX student of M S Udhayamurthy School of Excellence in Namakkal, Abinaya had appeared for the online contest in September last year. While the results were declared in October, the family was in a fix as they did not have the wherewithal to send her to the USA.

Her father Venkatachalam, a plumber, said, “We were told that the visa, flight fare and other charges alone would come to the tune of Rs 1.8 lakh. So, we had approached the district administration.”

When electricity minister P Thangamani came to know about the girl’s plight, he had given her Rs 2 lakh in December to meet the travel expenses. However, the family required more money to meet other expenses for the seven-day visit and the information was passed on to the chief minister, who has now sanctioned the amount.

The family is now overjoyed. “Abinaya has been told to take a test at Nasa. If she clears that, we were told that she could pursue under graduation in the USA,” her father said.

The zebra crossing prevented buses from speeding through the bus stand

PANAJI: Two years after two passengers were killed while alighting from a bus at the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) bus stand in Panaji, the corporation is yet to ensure the safety of passengers by restoring the zebra crossing that has faded.

A speeding bus hit five passengers inside the KTC bus stand on the morning of February 17, 2018, killing two and injuring three.

The issue was discussed at a round table meet on youth and road safety organised by the Goa consumer action network (Goacan) last week, on the second anniversary of the accident.

After the accident, a site inspection was held by representatives from transport department, traffic police, health services, PWD and the inspection report, which gave recommendations for KTC to follow up on, stated “the central zebra crossing required to be restored URGENTLY”. The main bus stand in Panaji had a zebra crossing that ran from the point where the Dona Paula buses park, and across the bus bays, down to the other end. This would not only force buses to stop at the zebra crossing but also prevented them from parking haphazardly, assuring the public of safe passage right through it.

“The problem arises when one alights or enters from the bus bay where Dona Paula buses are parked and has to walk through the bays to take a Mapusa bus or Margao shuttle bus. The accident took place right in the middle of the bays,” Goacan coordinator Roland Martins said.

KTC chairman Carlos Almeida told TOI, “If it is necessary, we will definitely reinstate it(the zebra crossing)”.

During the survey, conditions of roads leading to important destinations especially those related to commerce,... Read More

AURANGABAD: The public works department ( PWD ) is all set to carry out widening and strengthening of key state highways, district roads for improving connectivity and cutting down the travelling time on roads passing through eight districts of Marathwada .

PWD minister Ashok Chavan on Sunday issued directives for carrying out a detailed survey of key roads from across the region that has often remained neglected in terms of quality roads.

It is for the first time that such a survey is being taken up by the PWD department that focusses only on the key roads, including those passing from rural pockets of Marathwada.

During the survey, conditions of roads leading to important destinations especially those related to commerce, industries, education, religious places would be studied on priority and a detailed proposal for the same will be tabled before the minister.

The minister will then ensure that these roads are developed, widened and strengthened accordingly. As per plan, the roads would be developed on the lines of western Maharashtra which has one of the finest inter-district connectivity in the state.

“Through the survey, condition of the roads connecting to the tehsils would also be studied for preparation and execution of the development plan,” Chavan told TOI.

“The inter-district roads connecting Aurangabad, Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli, Latur, Beed and Osmanabad need to be strengthened as the region has remained deprived of road strengthening. Many important roads are in bad shape and there have been demands to upgrade these roads to four and six lanes,” he added.

The minister, citing considerable inter-district commuting of vehicles, said the widening of roads in Marathwada region has become essential.

Sources maintained that the minister intends to revamp all important state highways and district roads of the eight districts so that trade and commerce in the region receives a boost.

A PWD official said the development of roads would help farmers in exploring the nearby urban markets, and bag high returns for their farm produce.

PANAJI: Streetlights in the state will soon be powered on and off without any manual intervention, thanks to a home-grown invention by an engineer from Carmona . The ‘Solar Switch’, developed by Samson Da Costa, has light-detecting sensors to activate streetlights in the absence of sunlight, and will help save on power bills. Da Costa has bagged a contract to deliver the energy-saving switches, power minister Nilesh Cabral said.

“Invented by a Goan youth, they (Solar Switches) were installed at many places across the state and have given encouraging results. They will now be installed to man streetlights across the state,” said the power minister.

Pilot installations have already been carried out at Porvorim , Curchorem, Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, Konkan Railway quarters, Margao, and Davorlim, and have been successful.

The Solar Switch operates on light intensity, by which it controls the on/ off feature of the unit. “The Solar Switch also comes with an in-built high voltage surge protector,” Da Costa said. Sudden power surges are partly responsible for the malfunctioning of timers on streetlights.

The unit requires no changes to the existing streetlight control panel, and can be fitted onto it. One solar switch connected to the grid box can control up to 200 light poles, Da Costa said.

“The Solar Switch is designed in such a way that the light from a full moon or light from oncoming vehicles will not turn streetlighting off. At the same time, it is configured to stay off during the monsoons when dark clouds cover the sky. It doesn’t come on until it is really dark and falls below two lux light intensity,” he says. “Some installations have been operational for around three years and have been tested in all seasons,” Da Costa said.

The device is also expected to help the government correctly calculate the energy consumption of streetlights, and will be delivered to the government by the end of the month, Da Costa told TOI.

256,['24/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Tricksters use remote access softwares for UPI app fraud,"Representative image

PUNE: Investigations by the Cybercrime police have revealed that the suspects, who duped 210 people in UPI app fraud since February 15, have misused services of three software — Anydesk, Team Viewer and Quick Support — for creating a mirror image of the electronic devices held by their victims to pull off the fraud.“The mirror image enabled the cheats to access the targeted devices, such as a cellphone or a laptop — from a remote location,” senior inspector Jayram Paygude of the Cybercrime police told TOI.“The suspects would use text messages for randomly sending links of one of the three softwares to people. Many people downloaded these links and shared credentials of their bank accounts or debit cards on the system, which was in control of the suspects,” he said.After obtaining the credentials, the suspects siphoned off the money from the UPI applications of the victims.Paygude said since February 15, many software engineers, elderly persons, house wives and others have lodged complaints stating that money had been siphoned off via their UPI applications after they clicked on the link in the text message they had received.A preliminary probe by the cybercrime police had revealed that the suspects behind the latest online fraud misusing UPI app on cellphones were operating their racket from Kolkata and its adjoining areas in West Bengal. A cybercrime officer said the UPI app company had not sent these messages to the customers. The officer added that people had thought that the link was shared in the text message to update the KYC (Know Your Customer) formalities and clicked on it.Cybercrime expert Sandip Gadiya, who is assisting the cybercrime police in the probe, told TOI, “These are the applications used by the software companies and other firms at large scale to gain access to the remotely located computer, smart television sets or other electronic devices with internet connectivity to upgrade the software and other programmes on the devices.”He said, “It has, however, been increasingly noticed that these software are being used by the cybercrime fraudsters to cheat the people under the pretext of various urgent needs, especially related to the banking facilities. The fraudsters came up with the KYC trick and they have been successful so far,” he said.Gadiya said, “On the receipt of the text message, having link of the software in it, the cell phone owner downloads it and shares the ID number of the downloaded app with the fraudsters. Once the ID number is shared, entire access of the device is gain by the fraudsters. They keep watching device owner’s activities and once the UPI app’s PIN is entered by the suspect, they used it repeatedly to siphon off the money.” He said that despite receiving messages of money being deducted from the account of the UPI app, the device owner hardly can do anything.Lawyer Gaurav Jachak, who specializes in cybercrime cases, told TOI “Majority of the UPI apps do have an in-built system to update KYC of the customers. Instead of looking for the alternative sources, people should study the UPI apps in details and upload their KYC details on the apps on their cellphones. KYC is just a bait to the UPI app users. The location in such cases does not matter. People can manage devices from any part of the world.”He said, “Once the software is downloaded on a device and its ID number is shared, control of the device is automatically handed over to a stranger i.e. the fraudster. It is always better not to download any suspicious link from the messages which the cell phone users receive in the text messages.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74278844,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-386945,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tricksters-use-remote-access-softwares-for-upi-app-fraud/articleshow/74274523.cms
257,['24/02/2020'],Residents seek SMS alert for notice on property tax dues,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Trichy: The residents of Trichy have sought for the Trichy Corporation to consider sending SMS (short message service) alerts about the property tax dues to the registered mobile numbers of the property owners.

With a section of property owners residing outside the city or even the country by renting out their properties for residential and commercial purposes, the notices sent by the civic body seeking water charge, property tax and underground drainage (UGD) charge reaches their tenant.

While some of the tenants fail to convey the arrival of property tax notices to the owners, residents said that they fail to pay the taxes within the half-yearly fiscal of a financial year.

“Instead of sending the notices through a letter to property owners, why not send SMS text or messages on other platforms to convey the property tax dues? It will also help the civic body to complete the tax collection target easily,” S Muthukrishnan, a resident of Thillai Nagar said.

In case of property owners forgetting to pay the taxes for the half-yearly fiscals, the arrear amount adds on to the next half-yearly fiscal, which makes the property owners feel like they are shelling out a huge sum on property tax.

As the mobile numbers of the property owners are already available with the corporation, sources said that linking the mobile numbers with property tax assessment is easy for sending the tax due notices. “There was such a plan to send text messages for intimating the tax dues. The decision has to be taken by state-level officials, we will convey the demand,” an official with the corporation said.

PANAJI: Thounsands attended the Margao carnival float parade that proceeded on the new route in Fatorda on Sunday evening. Earlier in the day, the Margao Carnival Committee, which had sought to revert it to the old route through Margao town, did not get any relief from the court.

The high court on Sunday morning heard a petition by the committee but refused to grant it relief and refused to stay its own order passed on Friday. The court will hear the application made by the Carnival committee on Monday.

In its application before the court, the committee through its chairperson Arthur D’Silva stated that Resolution 4934 taken on January 15 based on which the high court passed its order on Friday was fabricated and doctored.

The committee submitted to the high court that the resolution was fraudulently drawn where there was no confirmation of the minutes. There was no question of any resolution being passed as 12 councilors were in favour of the parade being held on the old route, a proven majority in the meeting attended by 23 councillors in favour of the route. The question of a decision passed unanimously doesn’t arise, the committee stated in its application.

The committee alleged that the council was aware of this and hence no meeting was called from January 15 to February 22 to confirm the resolution. It added that 12 councillors have filed complaints with the collector about the alleged fabricated and doctored resolution dated January 15 which was tendered before the high court.

The high court on Friday, hearing a petition by Fatorda resident Custodio Dias, had restrained the South Goa collector, director of tourism, superintendent and deputy superintendent of police from entertaining any applications for the finalisation of the Carnival route from the chairperson of the Carnival committee.

The court on Friday noted that the Carnival committee which sought permissions to have the float parade through Margao couldn’t go against the resolution of the Margao Municipal Council which “unanimously resolved to hold the parade along the route from Old Market Colva circle to Lake Plaza at Fatorda” at its ordinary meeting on January 15, 2020.

South Goa collector had cited public safety as a reason for finalising the Fatorda route for the parade.

AURANGABAD: Jalna police will keep a check on malpractices and unethical practices during the Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) examinations.

This decision was taken by the Jalna superintendent of police Siriprolu Chaitanya. This comes after the Hindi question paper of the ongoing HSC exams went viral through Whatsapp on Saturday.

The Hindi question paper was leaked from an examination centre in Partur, Jalna. An offence was registered with the Partur police on Saturday against eight suspects.

The malpractice came to the notice of probationary IPS officer Nilesh Tambe and his team, who went to the photocopy centre and found the suspect with photocopies of the question paper.

According to the police, the photocopy centre belongs to a teacher in Lal Bahadur Shastri College, Partur, and he had leaked the question paper over WhatsApp to his accomplice at the photocopy centre.

This was happening when the Hindi exam was underway at Lal Bahadur Shastri College, Partur.

The matter was brought to the notice of the education department officials, who assisted the police in the panchanama process.

Tambe told TOI, “We have registered offence against the eight suspects under relevant sections of Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractices at Universities, Board and other specified Examinations Act 1982. In addition to this, section 188 of IPC has also been included.”

On February 18, the MIDC Waluj police station of Aurangabad had caught five teachers including centre head while they were writing answers for the English paper.

Sources in the police informed that following the incident, police officials have asked the police personnel deployed at the examination centres to keep a close watch on the activities.

T’puram: Save Education Campaign Committee has urged state governor Arif Mohammed Khan to give directions to universities to follow a uniform recruitment procedure lest the reservation norms are flouted.

Different and contradictory procedures followed by state universities for the recruitment of faculties could torpedo reservation norms and hence the request for intervention into the matter, the committee said in a petition submitted to the governor who is also the chancellor of the universities.

Calicut University issued notifications inviting applications to fill teaching posts in various subjects without showing the reservation turn, in compliance with the judgement of the Kerala high court. In the verdict, the HC directed not to earmark reservation in the notification and to recruit candidates as per the roster following Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules (KS&SSR) and reservation shall be looked at the time appointments.

Contrary to this HC judgement, Kerala University and Cusat issued notifications for the selection of teaching posts specifying communal reservations as done earlier. Statutes of all universities clearly stipulate that in making appointment for all posts as determined by the syndicate in any service, class or category under the university, the university shall mutatis mutandis observe the provisions of clause (a), (b) & (c) of Rule 14 and the provisions of Rule 15, 16, 17 and 17A of KS&SSR - 1958 as amended from time to time. Hence the selection process of teaching faculties of all universities in the state should follow a uniform procedure.

The present selection process is adopting contrasting notifications and selection procedure by individual universities in the state, said the petition, was in violation of the specific clauses of KS&SSR and are aimed at giving appointing authorities a freehand to manipulate communal reservation.

Nagpur: The idea of forest minister Sanjay Rathod to dig deep trenches near farms alongside forest areas in the state has not gone down well with senior officials.

Rathod has called a meeting in Mumbai on Monday in which digging of deep trenches in forests on farm boundaries to save farmers’ crop by wildlife near forest areas is one of the top issues.

Officials are wary of forest minister’s wayward idea. “Such open trenches will not only cause animal and human deaths, it would also be in violation of Forest Conservation Act (FCA) 1980 and Indian Forest Act (IFA) 1927 as the areas that will be dug will be forest. In no case farmers will allow to dig their land,” they said.

“There is no feasibility report called or technicalities examined before taking up such a project which will immensely burden the public exchequer by crores of rupees,” they said.

“Nowhere such a project has been successful. On the contrary digging of deep trenches in forest may lead to flash flood into farmers’ field. The deep trenches act as resting place for wild animals which may add to the agony of the adjoining cultivators. In all probabilities, such structures not only result in loss of forest boundary but also convert into deep gullies causing further erosion of fertile soil. The idea is to use funds under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management & Planning Authority (CAMPA),” said sources.

However, the issues for which CAMPA funds will be sought doesn’t even find place in annual plan of operations (APO) of CAMPA. Officials agreed that such trenches are dug in forest areas but that is done as per approved working plans by the MoEFCC to protect plantations and mark forest boundaries.

Minister Rathod did not respond to TOI calls. Sources close to him said, “This is just an idea and not a proposal. The issue will be discussed in the meeting and final decision will be taken after that.”

With the onset of assembly session from Monday, minister has called not less than 15 senior forest officials to Mumbai for a meeting to discuss various issues which include development of Tipeshwar sanctuary, relocation of villages in Painganga and Dnyanganga sanctuaries, besides appointments of forest patils on the lines of police patils. Of the six issues that will come up for discussions in Monday’s meeting, four pertain to minister’s home district Yavatmal.

Can a cash-strapped government afford to call 15 top officials who will fly to Mumbai to attend the meeting? All the senior officials will fly to Mumbai on Monday to attend the meeting at 2pm.

“When facilities like videoconferencing are available, why waste time and huge money on air fare and other logistics?” asked a section of officials.

Chandrapur: Former minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who played a key role in clamping liquor prohibition in Chandrapur, is playing the wait and watch game after guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar instituted a committee to review the previous government’s decision. The committee’s report is expected in the first week of March.

“If the government revokes the liquor ban in Chandrapur then the same should be done in the other dry districts —Wardha and Gadchiroli. It they say that there’s loss of revenue or sale of illegal liquor is rampant in Chandrapur then it is same for Wardha and Gadchiroli as well,”said Mungantiwar.

Amid rising difference between Congress-NCP and Shiv Sena over implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Population Register (NPR), Mungantiwar added fuel to the fire by saying that the BJP’s doors are always open for the party headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to form a government if the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government collapses.

Mungantiwar claimed that the Shiv Sena is a natural ally on the contentious issue. “If the Shiv Sena is feeling suffocated, it can return to the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra. We are ready to join hands with them,” said Mungantiwar during his interaction with the media.

On the issue of chief ministership, Mungantiwar said it’s a non-issue and can be sorted out through a mature dialogue between leaders of both the saffron parties.

PUNE: The Deccan Gymkhana police are on the trail of a tour operator evading arrest for almost three months after a group of 28 senior citizens first lodged an FIR against him for cheating them by not delivering on the promised services during a trip to Kullu Manali in Himachal Pradesh in August 2018.

The senior citizens found themselves in the lurch when they realized on reaching Himachal Pradesh that the operator did not make any hotel booking. Later, he kept promising them about returning money for the undelivered service, but to no avail. He has since changed office from the JM Road to a shopping complex on FC road.

On February 13, another group of 23 senior citizens lodged a second FIR accusing him of cheating them of Rs5.28 lakh over a tour of Andaman and Nicobar islands which was promised in January 2018, but never materialized.

Now, another group of 20 people has approached the police with a complaint against the elusive operator for cheating them of Rs5 lakh over a tour of seven northeastern states.

Most of the victims in all the three instances are from Pune, Satara, Ratnagiri and adjoining districts, the police said.

Senior police inspector Deepak Lagad told TOI, “The operator has changed his residence on multiple occasions over the past three months and has gone incommunicado. He has not opened his office either.”

The TOI on Sunday tried to contact the tour operator by making calls on his cell phonenumber, but it was on a switched off mode. A text message sent on his cellphone evoked no response. A visit to the last-known location of his office at Sagar Arcade on FC road revealed that he had vacated the premises six months ago and a cybersecurity firm now operates from the premises. At the Bhosale-Shinde Arcade on the JM road, where his earlier office was located, the shopkeepers said he had left the premises long time ago.

Lagad said, “The tour operator would give small advertisements in newspapers attracting people for tours to various destinations. He would quote minimum cost of tour for drawing people to his office and accept money from them. But he would not book either their tickets or hotel rooms.”

Referring to the first FIR lodged on December 3, 2019, Lagad said, “The tour operator had taken Rs40,000 from each of the 28 members, mostly senior citizens, for the Kullu-Manali trip. He booked their train tickets, but did not the hotel rooms and the bus for the local commute. When the irate tourists on their return went to his office and demanded a refund, he handed over amounts in the range of Rs5,000 to Rs8000 to each one of them.”

The second FIR was lodged on February 13 by a 71-year-old victim, who said the tour operator collected Rs32,000 from each of the 23 people who were to go for the Andaman and Nicobar trip in January 2018. The amount included charges for air tickets, hotel rooms and local commute, but the tour never took off. “When people demanded a refund, the tour operator returned Rs8,000 to each of them. Despite repeated requests by the people, he did not return the remaining Rs24,000 to each of them,” the FIR stated.

Lagad said, “We are verifying details of the latest complaint application by the group of 20 persons before taking a call on registration of a FIR.”

LUCKNOW: There is a need to coin easy Hindi words for English scientific terms to strengthen science writings in Hindi, said experts at Bharatiya Bhasha Mahotsav held at Lucknow University on Sunday. “Universities should find out simple Hindi words for tough scientific terms or should coin new words for them to strengthen scientific writing in the language. These Hindi words should be then popularized among masses,” said Prof Bhumitra Dev, an academician.

Quoting the example of Hans Selye, who coined the word ‘stress’ in 1936 for a medical condition of the General Adaptation Syndrome, Prof Dev said, “As ‘stress’ was as an easy word, it was quickly adopted and widely accepted. There is a similar need for coining such easy to understand words to promote science writing in Hindi,” he added. V P Sharma, a scientist from Indian Institute of Toxicology Research , said for writing science in simple language, its necessary to understand the same in the simplest form.

For explaining scientific concepts easily in Hindi, stress should be on giving examples from everyday life Like for teaching fermentation process, one should be given example of how ‘jalebi’ (sweet) is cooked, he added.

Digambar Kamat

PANAJI: Leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat has criticised the decision to undertake renovation of the Inox multiplex building, demanding chief minister Pramod Sawant’s intervention. “After demolishing the Goan film industry since 2012, ESG is now on a demolition drive of the multiplex at Campal to create a new structure. The government should first release a white-paper on the actual benefits of Iffi for Goa and performance of ESG vis-a-vis its actual contribution to promote the Goan film fraternity,” Kamat said.

He said that the government is yet to fulfill the promise of building the Iffi convention center, and suddenly this new idea is floated; surely with some ulterior motives.

Reacting to this, vice-chairman of Entertainment society of Goa (ESG), Subhash Phal Desai said, “The existing Inox multiplex building will not be demolished. The same architecture will be retained; the renovation would be of the interiors.”

Kamat also said that local film producers have been deprived of benefits under the film finance scheme. “The scheme which was launched by Congress was kept dormant almost for three years by the BJP government,” he said.

AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ( MPCB ) has strictly asked its sub-divisional offices to not allow private transportation of biomedical waste generated from health establishments.

The assertion has come from MPCB in the wake of regional offices forwarding the biomedical waste application to private transporters.

Only the common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities should be roped in for the job, the board clarified.

“It was noticed that sub-regional offices are forwarding the biomedical waste transportation application to private transporter from the health care establishments. As per the revised guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the grant of authorisation for collection and transportation of biomedical waste by transporter other than the common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities is prohibited. The board has taken a policy decision to not authorise any private biomedical water transporter,” MPCB member secretary E Ravindran has said.

Ravindran has also asked the divisional authorities to instruct the local body and the district collector to initiate suitable legal action against the hospitals and illegal private transporter in case of any violations.

Health officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, Nita Padalkar said no violation of the MPCB norm came to her notice in Aurangabad. “We have appointed a common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities. All the city hospitals are registered with the facility and no private transportation of the biomedical waste collection has come to our notice,” she said.

Satyanarayan Somani, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Aurangabad chapter, said no private transportation of biomedical waste was taking place in the city. “Even if small hospitals have certain complaints with the service of the common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities, no private player is still in place in the city. The private contractor appointed as a part of the common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facility does not pay regular visits to small hospitals,” he said.

BENGALURU/KODAGU: Three days after the sloganeering by 19-year-old college student Amulya Leona Norohna at an anti-CAA rally and her subsequent arrest on charges of sedition kicked up a storm, Karnataka minister BC Patil on Sunday advocated central legislation that enables authorities “to shoot at sight” those chanting pro-Pakistan slogans .

Responding to reporters’ queries on the ongoing fracas over the chants, Patil said he would appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring in a law so that anti-national elements are “killed on the spot”.

“The Centre must promulgate a law that enables authorities to shoot those who do anything that is seen as anti-national and chant pro-Pakistan slogans,” Patil said. “These elements must be killed on the spot. I am appealing to the PM, through the media now, to bring in such a law. I will also write to the PM.”

In Kodagu, Union minister for chemicals and fertilizer, DV Sadananda Gowda, echoed state home minister home minister Basavaraj Bommai’s line that stringent action will be taken against those indulging in anti-national activity, saying there will be “no mercy” for those taking a pro-Pakistan stance.

“The Union government will assist in the police investigation in Amulya,” he said. Gowda went on to claim that many anti-national organizations have been using CAA protests for political gain.

“We will curb such incidents forever. We will not allow such incidents to happen in future. Organisers of such rallies should be thoroughly questioned,” Gowda said.

Bommai on Saturday had also claimed the government will initiate action against educational institutions and hostels it they fail to act against students indulging in such activity.

“The government will discuss ways to prevent such incidents in colleges and hostels. We will instruct heads of educational institutions and hostel wardens to initiate action against such students. If they fail, the government will take action against them,” Bommai said, without defining what constitutes anti-national activity.

However, despite Congress saying there is no room for anti-national activity and stringent action must be taken against those indulging in such activity, former minister and senior functionary DK Shivakumar suggested he found nothing in Amulya’s background to suggest she is anti-national.

“Let me make it absolutely clear that the Congress party will not support any person or persons who hail another country and bring shame to India,” Shivakumar said. “However, I have seen the girl’s [Amulya’s] previous posts on social media and read her statements on various forums. She has been making statements on an ideological ground. Let us not jump the gun, but investigate exactly what she meant to say.”

MADURAI: A man from Thanjavur had a harrowing experience as he got his right hand got stuck inside an Indian commode while attempting to recover his car keys in the early hours of Sunday.

The man had to spend more than an hour and a half inside the toilet at a petrol bunk with his hand stuck before he was freed with the help of the fire and rescue department from Thideer Nagar station. Although he had been screaming for 30 minutes, the incident came to light only when a petrol bunk employee went to use the toilet.

The man was identified as K Manimaran, 29, from Thanjavur, who had came to Madurai to drop a passenger in his cab.

Officials from fire and rescue department said that during the one-and-half hours of struggle, he maintained calm and composure. The only thing at the back of his mind was to get his hand back without any fracture. “He wants to join the police department and had appeared for the written test for recruitment of sub-inspector of police held recently and is waiting to take part in the physical test to enter into uniformed service,” a fire official said.

Thideer Nagar fire station officer R Venkatesan said they got an alert at around 5.30am and reached the spot in no time. They had to break the lavatory and tile floor using a mini driller to widen the PVC pipe in which his hand got entangled . They poured some oil on his hand to loosen a bit, which helped withdraw his hand out slowly.

“When he inserted his hand, he first found a mobile phone which was lost by someone else. He though the keys would be next to it and inserted his hand further. When the hand got entangled he could not move a bit and stayed there till help arrived,” he said.

Manimaran got treated to minor injuries at a nearby hospital.

PUNE: The city is expected to experience summer-like weather condition towards the end of February as the daytime temperature may hover between 36-37 degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.There are three main reasons behind this weather phenomenon.“First, the flow of Northerly wind would recede in the coming days. Secondly, Southerly and South Easterly will bring hot air from the Southern Peninsular region. And thirdly, the season is advancing towards the summer. Because of these factors, the daytime temperature will rise to 37 degrees Celsius on the last few days of this month,” a senior Met department official told TOI on Sunday.On Sunday, the day temperature in Shivajinagar and Lohegaon touched 34.7 degrees Celsius and 35.3 degrees Celsius, respectively, maintaining the above normal trend by 2.4 degrees Celsius and 2.3 degrees Celsius, respectively.“On February 25 and 26, the maximum and minimum temperatures may fall by 1-2 degrees. On February 27, 28 and 29, the city may experience partly cloudy condition in the early morning and evening,” another IMD official said.“There is a chance of formation of trough over Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra region. Because of this, the moisture incursion is likely to occur in these regions, resulting in cloudy condition. This would have an impact on the day and night temperatures for a couple of days. But this condition will not remain for long period,” the official added.For the last two weeks, the city’s temperature had hovered between 33 degrees Celsius to 34 degrees Celsius.

GORAKHPUR: A property dealer was shot over a land dispute in front of his house in Rajghat area here on Saturday night. An FIR was registered against two people on a written complaint of his family members.

The deceased, identified as Dr Nusratullah Warsi (55), is the maternal uncle of Dr Kafeel Khan, the suspended doctor of BRD Medical College here.

Police have launched a hunt for the accused. According to reports, Warsi went to play carom at the house of his neighbour, an advocate Siraj Tariq’s house. On return, he was attacked by man near his house. Hearing the gunshots, the family members came out and found Warsi lying in a pool of blood. On being informed, senior police officials including SSP Sunil Kumar Gupta, SP city Dr Kaustubh and circle officer (Kotwali) V P Singh reached the spot and sent the body for autopsy.

“On a written complaint of family members, a case of murder was registered against one Imamuddin of Kotwali police station area and Anil Sonkar of Gorakhnath police station area. Police are searching for both the accused,” said CO Kotwali V P Singh said.

He said: “Prima facie, it’s a property dispute case. In November last year, the deceased had won a court case related to a 4.5-acre land from Imamuddin and one Nikhat Ara. The duo had illegally registered the land in their name. Warsi also had a dispute with Imamuddin for a 10-12 acre land at Itwa in Siddharthnagar. Sonkar had invested Rs 1.9 crore in Warsi’s construction company and was trying to get his money back.”

“The attacker seems to be an acquaintance as he knew about Warsi’s daily routine. However, things will become clear after a detailed investigation,” Singh added.

Gorakhpur SSP Sunil Kumar Gupta said: “It appears be a case of a property dispute. A case under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) has been registered against two people. Three teams have been constituted to investigate case and the culprits will be caught soon.”

The DP for Aurangabad was created in 2001. An exercise was attempted over four years ago for zones that experienced an increase in population, but that was soon mired in controversy. The matter is currently in the Supreme Court.

In the latest directive, issued early this month, the state town planning authority has asked AMC to prepare DPs for both old and newer areas within city limits.

Aurangabad deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal said the process of DP formulation could require considerable time because of the upcoming civic elections .

Janjal said: “The AMC has been asked to prepare separate DPs for the old city limits and the outskirts, which includes 18 villages. These DPs will be merged to form a consolidated DP for the whole of Aurangabad. The entire process requires crucial components, which includes existing land use surveys and public suggestions or objections. This DP may take some more time because the upcoming civic elections are now a priority for many stakeholders.”

While the AMC must revise the Development Plan as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966, the draft plan created in October 2015 has been caught in a legal tangle. The old plan was sanctioned in 1991.

A DP spells out proposed land-use patterns and public amenities as per future population estimates. These plans are approved by the urban development department of the government and incorporate proposals of zoning for various purposes, including transport and water treatment amenities.

Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said the formulation of DP should be given priority instead of the upcoming civic polls. “Aurangabad is perhaps the only metro city in the country that hasn’t had an updated DP in such a long while. The absence of a DP often proves to be a major problem during the allocation of funds. Moreover, unplanned development continues to impact the city and this is because of the lack of an updated DP,” Datey-Patil said.

After a week of uncertainty over US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania’s visit to Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram , protocol officials of the state government and Union ministry for external affairs finally heaved a sigh of relief when they were told on Saturday night to stick to the ‘original plan’.PM Narendra Modi will arrive 10 minutes ahead of the President Trump’s arrival and will be received by the trustees of the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (SAPMT). Sources said that the US president will spend about 15 minutes at the Ashram.The protocol details were being worked out when TOI called late on Sunday night, but state government officials said that President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife and Trump’s daughter and advisor Ivanka may not visit the Ashram. Gujarat government officials said that the PM will receive the US president near Hriday Kunj around 12:15pm and then accompany the guests to the cottage. The trio will remove their footwear before entering the cottage, sources said. After a small tour, president Trump and Melania will witness a demonstration of the spinning wheel.""President Trump and the first lady will be gifted a copy of the Mahatma’s autobiography, a small charkha, and if time permits, a khadi cloth with Bapu’s talisman and a framed pencil drawing of Mahatma Gandhi,"" said a state government official. He said the Centre will be gifting the guests a nine-inch tall marble memento of the three wise monkeys.The US president and first lady will then be led to a table outside Hriday Kunj where they will both pen down their experiences at the Ashram and their message.

ALAPPUZHA: Kanjikuzhy in Alappuzha is famous for organic vegetables. It bagged the state’s maiden Swaraj Trophy for best local body. Now, a group of youngsters from the village are making it big in flower cultivation.

Ministers and floriculture enthusiasts are visiting the local body to get a glimpse of the successful business.

Fields of Jamanthi or chrysanthemum flower spread over two acres are helping these young farmers to harvest a good profit.

Eleven youngsters from Ambalakkara self-help group (SHG) of Puthanambalam, Kanjikuzhy, are behind this.

The SHG was set up around 10 years ago and consists of government employees and daily wage workers. The group is led by Sujith Swaminikarthil, who received the state government’s award for best young farmer in Kerala .

The group successfully conducted cultivation of organic vegetables, water melon and fish farming. Ministers and MLAs are regular visitors. “After harvesting organic vegetables, we got a gap. So, we have decided to start flower cultivation. We never thought this would become a big success.

Our soil is not friendly for flower cultivation. We have planted 5,000 saplings of Jamanthi collected from Suresh Perumbalam, a nursery owner. Two months ago, we started it and the lifespan of this plant is three months. Now, we are daily selling 50kg to 60kg of flowers. For one kg of flowers, Rs 60 is the price. After hearing our cultivation story, people visit our flower farm. Minister T M Thomas Isaac, politicians and people from districts like Thiruvananthapuram visited our farm. People can visit our farm for free,” said Sujith.

“We started this on an experimental basis and it bore fruit. So, we will also do floriculture along with organic vegetable cultivation,” said the Ambalakkara members.

285,['24/02/2020'],Only 34% groundwater drawn out in Goa: WRD,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: Goa utilises only 34% of its groundwater and continues to be in the safe zone where groundwater usage is concerned, according to the latest analysis by the central groundwater board.

The state’s groundwater drawal is low compared to neighbouring states like Karnataka , where utilisation is upto 200%, water resource department chief engineer Shrikant Patil told TOI.

As the density of population and built structures is increasing in the state, there are concerns that the state could be under threat of overexploitation of groundwater. But Patil said that as per the 2017 findings of the central groundwater board, Goa only extracts 60,000 hectare meter annually.

“The central groundwater board monitors 85 wells in the state,” said Patil.

He said that new wells are not allowed to be dug up within 100m of existing wells. Patil said that before allotting permission for commercial use of well water, a technical study is carried out to determine the yield of the well and then, the limit of water extraction is set accordingly.

A committee headed by the chief engineer meets every month to scrutinise requests for such extraction of groundwater by industries for new construction and by individuals for sale by tankers etc.

There are 6,502 wells and 1,025 borewells currently registered with the WRD.

The central groundwater board’s report states that the overall groundwater availability scenario in Goa remains safe, but a ‘negligible to moderate’ fall in water level was recorded during the premonsoon season.

It shows that groundwater consumption has gone up in Goa. Of the stations (observation wells) analysed, 54% showed a fall in water level, while 46% showed a rise in water level.

Rise in water levels of 0 to 2m was observed in parts of Sanguem , Quepem, Canacona, Salcete, Sattari, Bicholim and Pernem taluka .

Fall in water level of 0 to 2m was observed in almost all talukas. The fall in general is negligible to moderate.

“It indicates that groundwater consumption has picked up over the years in almost the entire state,” states the report ‘Groundwater Resources of Goa - March 2017’.

BENGALURU: The state government is reportedly mulling reducing the quantity of rice being distributed through the public distribution system (PDS) under the populist Anna Bhagya scheme . The move is certain to create a political furore with the opposition Congress, as the scheme was launched by the Siddaramaiah regime

The government at present provides 7kg rice under Anna Bhagya and a source said chief minister BS Yediyurappa is considering cutting it to 5kg. The chief minister is likely to announce the decision in his budget to be presented on March 5.

""The idea is to curb irregularities and save funds. If we reduce the quantity of rice, we can provide more of other commodities like pulses and sugar. However, nothing has been finalised,"" said K Gopalaiah, minister for food and civil supplies.

A similar proposal was mooted by the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government, but was dropped owing to vehement opposition from the Siddaramaiah camp.

TRICHY: The forest department booked 40 people on Sunday under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 for trespassing into a reserve forest in Trichy for hunting wild animals.

The incident happened in the late hours on Saturday when 48 people, including minors along with 18 dogs and traps entered Thatchankurichi reserve forest for poaching.

Following a tip off, a 15-member team detained the group along with their belongings. Four vehicles were also seized from them.

None of them was found to be a habitual offender. They have come from Somarasampettai for Parivettai – a traditional practice of hunting animals in the wild once in a year.

“They were brought to the forest department office in Trichy. Their belongings were seized, and 40 people except the minors were booked and imposed fine,” said district forest officer D Sujatha.

They were released after collecting the fine. Such incidents are not happening for the first time. These many people were not detained by the forest department in the recent past for poaching activities, said the officials.

In September last year, the forest department detained 21 people near Siraganur in Trichy after they hunted a wild boar. They were let off on bail after collecting a meagre fine.

The forest department had thwarted another poaching activity in Manapparai on Saturday when a section of people approached Manapparai tahsildar with permission for poaching as part of the Mahashivrathri celebrations.

More than 50 village heads laid siege to the tahsildar officer on Saturday evening. Tahsildar B Tamilkani and the forest department officials held talks with them.

The villagers dispersed from the spot only after the forest department officials warned of action under Wildlife Protection Act 1972 against any poaching activity.

The busy morning hours saw seven goats slaughtered and their meat sold to a long line of mutton lovers.

MADURAI: Less than a month since a mutton stall was launched at the Madurai central prison involving the inmates, the outlet seems to be drawing an impressive number of customers, selling more than 70 kg of meat in three hours on Sunday morning. The busy morning hours saw seven goats slaughtered and their meat sold to a long line of mutton lovers.

Reared in the Open Air Jail at Kalayarkovil in Sivaganga district, the goats will be sold to the central prison after obtaining clearance from government veterinarians. While the stall has functioned in the past couple of Sundays, it became fully-fledged stall only this Sunday.

Around 15 inmates from the prison are involved in various process involving like skinning, chopping meat, seasoning of head and limbs using fire and sales. “The overwhelming support of customers is down to the fact that many hardly get to buy pure goat meat. Most stalls sell sheep meat, under the guise a mutton,” officials said.

Compared to muttons stalls in the city, where a kg of boneless meat is sold at up to Rs 820, the prison bazaar sells meat only at Rs 700. A pair of limbs used for preparing soup are sold for Rs 100 and head for Rs 200. Despite a competitive price, the inmates make a decent money with 20% of the profit going to them.

“The meat became popular by word of mouth. Many who bought meat her suggest the shop to others. We sold a good quantity of meat without making any publicity to the stall,” said the official.

Prison authorities have been introducing various manufacturing and trade activities to empower inmates under the prison bazaar scheme. They can learn new skills, which can be used to support their family members, once they walk out of the prison. Mutton stall is one of them. Recently, they began manufacturing nursery pots and are selling them directly on the cheap.

In all, 105 inmates are involved in various farming and farm related activities in the Open Air Jail spread over a 84 acres of land. Raising cattle and poultry are some of them, officials said.

Panaji: For the next International Film Festival of India (Iffi), 2020, the four-screen government multiplex operated by Inox Leisure ltd will be of world class standard as it is set to undergo major renovation soon, said the vice-chairman of Entertainment society of Goa (ESG), Subhash Phal Desai.

He said that a tender was floated by ESG in October 2019, and the work has been awarded to Inox for refurbishment and renovation of the multiplex.

“They were selected as their bid was higher than the other bidders – PVR,” he said. ESG was set up in 2004 as a nodal agency to help organise Iffi, and ESG has the mandate to help turn Goa into a world-class international entertainment centre.

Inox will undertake the renovation project and will run the multiplex for another 12 years, while paying a monthly rental of Rs 54 lakh to the government. The agreement also carries an annual increment of 5% in the rental amount.

Inox had been paying Rs 20 lakh per month as per the earlier agreement signed with the Manohar Parrikar government.

Unlike elsewhere in the country, where multiplexes are built by private players, in Goa, it was constructed by the state government to host the debut Iffi in Goa in 2004. Delhi-based PVR had recently moved the high court against the latest decision to allot the tender to Inox Leisure ltd.

“PVR has lost the case in the High court”, said Phal Desai, adding that the renovation work will begin by April 1.

“We have asked them to complete the work within six months, by September-end. For Iffi 2020, we will have a world class multiplex”, Phal Desai said.

PANAJI: In yet another crash for the Indian Navy in just over three months, a naval fighter jet which took off from the INS Vikramaditya crashed into the Arabian Sea about 35 nautical miles from Goa’s coast on Sunday.

The MiG-29K aircraft, part of the 303 Black Panther squadron, was on a routine training sortie when it suffered a serious technical glitch, said naval officials. Sources said that after the pilot realised that the aircraft was unrecoverable, he ejected around 10.30am.

“The pilot ejected safely and has been recovered,” chief public relations officer Commander Mehul Karnik said.

Karnik said further details were awaited as the Navy was trying to ascertain the depth where the MiG-29K crashed.

The Russian-made MiG 29K is the naval version of the MiG 29 which is in service with the Indian Air Force. It forms the lethal wing of the Navy’s air assets.

The Navy has reported that the MiG 29k has suffered several engine malfunctions and Sunday’s crash is the latest in a string of losses that the Navy has had to deal with.

In November 2019, a trainer version of the MiG 29K crashed about 30km from Goa’s capital after it encountered a flock of birds after take-off from INS Hansa air base at Dabolim, Goa.

The MiG 29KUB had crashed at the Verna plateau and the pilots, who had ejected, were rescued by locals.

As is the process, the Navy has launched a formal investigation into the circumstances that led to the fighter being ditched into the sea. “A board of enquiry has been instituted by the Indian Navy,” said Karnik.

Even as the Indian Navy navigates the long drawn process to procure 57 fighter jets, it’s fleet of fighter jets continues to decline.

Cauvery (kaveri)river trichy

TRICHY: Tamil Nadu Rivers Retrieve Movement urged the state government to launch an integrated river water management scheme, during a meeting organized with the theme-- ‘Strategies to revive and rejuvenate river basin resources and water bodies’-- here on Sunday.

Among various resolutions, the movement stressed the government for an integrated river water management scheme that should be launched comprising of four major basins including Cauvery, Vaigai, Thamirabarani, Paalar and Pennaru. Tamil Nadu government should take effort to launch the scheme keeping the model of Kaleshwaram lift irrigation scheme in the Godavari river as an example.

They also insisted that a peninsular river water grid should be formed by using the annual flow index to share water equitably between the riparian states of rivers such as Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery, Pennar and Paalar.

Another resolution sought for from the government was to establish a water literacy centre as a resource centre to promote water literacy education, training and research taking the model of states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra with financial assistance from central government.

Meanwhile, the federation has decided to form water parliament for each river basin with the participants of river bank-based villages. This parliament, at each panchayat level, would be involved in restoration and rejuvenation of river courses – both inlets and outlets, including the attached water bodies.

A state-level committee will also be formed for efficient functioning of Tamil Nadu Rivers Retrieval Movement, to form a network of water volunteers and action groups at panchayat level, including farmers and other stakeholders in the state. It also decided to organize ‘Cauvery River Rejuvenation Walk’ to create awareness on the rejuvenation of water bodies among the general public.

Indian water conservationist and environmentalist Rajendra Singh spoke at the meeting. Functionaries of Tamil Nadu Rivers Retrieve Movement Gandhipithan, T Gurusami, Puliyur N Nagarajan, Vayalur Rajendran were also participated.

Department officials say permitting casinos would require a special law. ""When we speak about gambling, the first thing that comes to mind is the Bangalore Turf Club. But the turf club is governed by laws pertaining to horse racing. Similarly, in Goa, casinos are off-shore and along the coastline. We need to look at existing laws and also bring in a special law if Karnataka is to allow casinos,"" an official said.

Meanwhile, in Bidar, opposition leader Siddaramaiah decried the idea. ""If casinos are allowed, then it means BJP supports gambling,"" said Siddaramaiah, who labelled the idea ""foolish"".

LUCKNOW: An internal probe by the police department has indicted Mathura police of blatant corruption and criminal conduct in the abduction and release of a doctor.

After the safe release of the doctor, Mathura police nabbed a kidnapper and recovered Rs 15 lakh from him but let him off after handing over the money to the victim.

After allegations came to light, IG (Agra range) was asked to conduct a probe who submitted his report to ADG (personnel). The report was scrutinised by senior officials and sent to government for further action. According to cops, orthopaedic surgeon Dr Nirvikalp Agarwal was kidnapped on December 10 last year and later released after he paid a ransom of Rs 52 lakh to abductors. The doctor did not inform the matter to police.

However, when the doctor received another call from the same criminals on January 19, asking for another Rs 50 lakh, he informed the police. A senior police said, “Highway police nabbed one of the kidnappers from Meerut and recovered Rs 15 lakh out of Rs 52 lakh from him. There was no trace of the remaining amount. Though Rs 15 lakh was handed over to the doctor, the criminal was released and no case was registered.” It was found during investigation that the kidnapper was set free after three days of detention. No FIR was lodged on the basis of complaint made by Dr Agarwal.

SHO highway police Jagdamba Singh and CO Refinery Jagveer Singh were removed on charges of dereliction of duty. The case was transferred from Highway police station to crime branch for further probe.

PALAKKAD: The soft drink unit of PepsiCo at Kanjikode , which remained closed since February 8 due to strike by workers of a labour supply contracting company, will reopen on Monday after the high court directed police to provide necessary protection to the factory.

The company management said that they moved out 39 loads of the cool drinks stored in the company with police protection on Saturday and Sunday. They said that only 10% of the stock was removed during the last two days. It will take another 10-15 days to move the entire stock.

The HC order was on a petition filed by the company management alleging that the police did not implement its interim order to provide protection for the smooth functioning of the company.

The petitioner sought protection for ingress and egress to their employees and removal of finished goods.

The court had also appointed Palakkad taluk legal services authority “to depute a competent officer to observe and report before this court in regard to the compliance of the direction of this court.”

LUCKNOW: After its emphatic return in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party has now turned focus on UP. AAP MP Sanjay Singh said the party will contest the next district panchayat elections in the state.

Singh, who took out a ‘victory roadshow’ from Charbagh till Gandhi Bhavan here on Sunday, said AAP will set foot in UP by visiting 1.07 lakh villages in the next three months and after doing a survey of people’s problems across the state, give feedback to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

There is no law and order in UP, nobody pays heed to farmer issues and youth is wary. Communal and caste politics is not what people here want and we will be focusing on farmers issues as priority,” Singh said.

Kolhapur: State cabinet minister and NCP leader Jayant Patil said that everyone is being trapped in caste and religious issues and no attention is being paid to the dwindling state of the economy.

“Attempts are made to divert the attention. The poor from every community are adversely affected by the state of economy,” said Patil, during a two-day convention called by the Brahmin community.

When asked by the media, Patil said that the statement by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s general secretary Bhaiyaji Joshi reveals that the Devendra Fadnavis will soon be made minister in the central government. Joshi, while speaking at Nagpur, had said that Fadnavis’ status as former chief minister and leader of opposition will not stay for long.

“I think what he meant was that Devendra Fadnavis is going to be made a minister in the Union government. I will be happy and wish that he will do good work,” said Patil.

About the visit of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to Delhi and meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Patil said that they are working under Thackeray’s leadership. “He has spoken on the CAA and NRC issues. I will only say that we are running the state government effectively. My party’s position on the CAA and NRC is public and I have nothing much to say about it,” added Patil.

Patil was attending the two-day convention of the Brahmin community at Dasara Chowk. Representatives of the community had gathered to discuss various issues. “Every community strives to make the last man standing happy. Every community has poor people. These days, the trend is to call out people from other castes. This may make such people leaders. It shows we are getting trapped in caste and religious issues. Attempts are made to divert attention from core issues,” Patil said.

A sample study of Nagpur’s rainfall says it is the same - 1000mm - for last 20 years

Nagpur: Of the entire water on Earth, only 3% is fresh and fit for consumption. Of this, 68.7% is in the form of glaciers, 30% is groundwater and only a mere 0.3% is surface water in the form of lakes and rivers which is readily available, said Sandeep Shirkhedkar, an alumnus of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology and consultant to the state government, on Saturday.

Delivering a lecture on ‘Rainwater harvesting: Urban and rural water conservation systems’, organized by The Eco Club of Chitnavis Centre, he said everyone should act with a sense of responsibility and use water judiciously, .

He said, “According to a NASA satellite report, groundwater resources of northern India are depleted. This is a serious crisis. According to WHO, by the year 2040, one in every four children will go thirsty. Today, we have reached a situation where we are extracting 300-year-old water from the confined aquifer of groundwater table. Do we have a right to do that,” he asked.

Talking about Nagpur, he said, “A sample study of the city’s rainfall has revealed that it is the same since the last 20 years (1000mm). The amount of rain falling is the same, however the intensity is increasing.” According to him, at this rate, Nagpur’s entire monsoon water will fall in just 10 days.”

Shirkhedkar pointed out that the next war in the world will probably be for water. “There are so many water disputes between countries, states, villages and even families. There needs to be optimization of water usage.”

He inferred that solution to the water crisis lies in construction of big reservoirs. “Apart from big reservoirs, river linking, construction of small reservoirs, river diversion, watershed management, water use optimization, community and individual initiative will go a long way.”

Shirkhedkar has designed a wide variety of large and small conservation projects. He spoke about rainwater harvesting, watershed management, structures for conservation, treatment of water, do’s and don’ts, people’s participation and various case studies.

NEW DELHI: Hours after getting confirmation that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia will not be part of an event at a government school on February 25, in which the first lady Melania Trump is a guest, Sisodia said he “respected” the concerns expressed by the US embassy.

In a statement issued late on Sunday, Sisodia said it was a great appreciation that AAP government’s work in the education sector was being recognised in the world and he and CM Kejriwal would have “loved” to explain the concept of happiness classes to the first lady of the United States .

“However, certain concerns were expressed by the US embassy regarding the CM and deputy CM accompanying her during the school visit. We respect the same. We welcome the first lady wholeheartedly and will do our best to facilitate the tour,” Sisodia said in a statement.

“It is a matter of great pride for Delhi government , the teachers and students that first lady Melania Trump is visiting a government school… We would have loved to personally receive her in the school and brief her about the concept of happiness classes and the positive impact it has had on students during her visit to the classrooms,” the statement read.

The US embassy in India had earlier said on Sunday: “While the US embassy has no objection to the presence of CM and deputy CM, we appreciate their recognition that this isn’t a political event and that it’s best to ensure focus on education, school and students.”

Aam Aadmi Party had reportedly alleged on Saturday that both Kejriwal and Sisodia were scheduled to welcome Melania Trump at the south Delhi government school, but their names were dropped by the Centre. The name of the school where Trump will go has not been disclosed, but some Delhi government schools are being decorated.

AAP functionary Preeti Sharma Menon had tweeted about this issue. “There is no match for the pettiness of Narendra Modi. You may not invite Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia but their work speaks for them,” she had tweeted.

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra responded to it and said, “There shouldn’t be low-level politics on some issues. India comes under disrepute if we start pulling each other’s legs.”

305,['24/02/2020'],Water board’s voluntary scheme fails to deter illegal water connections,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Hyderabad: The Voluntary Disclosure Scheme ( VDS ), which Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) had launched to regularise illegal water connections, has failed to deter the city’s water thieves.

A 90-day long campaign, with the deployment of more than 300 water board officials’ has resulted in only 11,000 requisitions. The water board has fetched Rs 1.5 crore revenue through this scheme.

The VDS scheme was stopped on February 21.

Multiple tasks given to the officials other than this scheme could be a reason for the campaign not doing well in their respective O&M Divisions, water board officials claimed.

In O&M Division-II (part of Old City), areas covering include Malakpet, Moosarambagh, Asmangadh, Yakutpura, Chanchalguda, Bandlaguda and adjoining areas came out on top in implementation of VDS. Here, nearly 3,000 requisitions have been received from the property owners.

“Apart from a massive campaign, we have explained about the registration of criminal cases and imposition of heavy penalties against people having illegal water connections. People scared about criminal cases have come forward to regularise their illegal water connections,” general manager of O&M Division-II, HMWS&SB, P Nagender Kumar told TOI.

Though officials conducted a massive campaign in posh areas like Banjara Hills, they failed to counter water thieves.

Though the VDS scheme has been stopped, the requisitions to regularise the illegal water connections are being accepted. The applicants have to pay double the connection charges, three years-worth of water bills and Rs 300 as service charge, placing an additional burden on the applicants.

306,['24/02/2020'],Financial crisis: Karnataka government looks to rationalise engineer posts,"This story is from February 24, 2020

CM BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: Faced with a financial crisis , the government is looking at ways to cut down on expenditure and has trained its focus on ""rationalising"" manpower, to correct what it believes is largescale ""mismanagement"" of its workforce.

It is estimated the government spends a staggering 63% of its budget outlay on salaries to its employees — which translates to a total Rs 180 crore a month. A majority of this goes to engineers, some 18,000 of whom are on its rolls, including those attached to civic agencies and boards and corporations.

However, on the other hand, the administration believes there is a shortage of personnel in most departments and continues to hire engineers, each of whom commands a salary anywhere between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1 lakh a month. For example, the PWD department last week put out notice seeking 600 assistant engineers and 300 junior engineers earlier last week.

Mindful of the situation, the state cabinet headed by chief minister BS Yediyurappa , held an informal discussion on the issue last week and proposed a ""merger"" of posts. The government could bring engineers together under a single department to utilise their services more efficiently.

""While the discussion centred on engineers, it also included a debate on other posts like joint directors in agriculture department and the necessity of regional commissioners in the administrative setup,"" a senior minister said.

""What is the role of JDs and RCs? It is a total waste of taxpayers’ money and a burden on the exchequer.""

The government believes a clean-up is necessary also because ministers and MLAs claim it has become tedious to get work done at constituency level.

""With four or five engineering branches — drinking water, PWD, major irrigation, minor irrigation besides others — at the taluk level, it is hard to get work done. In Bengaluru also, people are confused as to whom to approach since there is the BBMP, BWSSB, BDA etc. A merger may prove fruitful,"" said another minister, who insisted there is no intention to remove existing engineers.

On a pilot basis, the government is planning to merge engineering divisions of drinking water schemes at the taluk panchayat level and the rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) department.

However, engineers say such a decision will be detrimental to development.

""Like specialised doctors, we engineers also specialise in irrigation, civil and mechanical works. Any merger will be detrimental,"" said M Nagaraj, president of Ahimsa, an association of retired and serving government employees from other communities.

Nagaraj also said it will create chaos in promotions as an engineer with five years of service could be ranked above a junior engineer with 20 years of experience waiting for promotion in BBMP.

Nagpur: Pediatricians in India have drafted and issued Indian guidelines about unhealthy food in October 2019 after following the international standards and studying local food habits for more than a decade. Now, these recommendations need to be implemented nationwide. Parents, schools and government should come together for this task, said veteran paediatrician Dr Piyush Gupta, president-elect of Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP) on Sunday.

“Consumption of junk foods, ultra-processed foods, nutritionally inappropriate foods, caffeinated/coloured/carbonated foods and sugar-sweetened food/beverages are rampant in Indian kids. IAP has coined new acronym ‘JUNCS’ for all such foods,” said Dr Gupta, who headed the research team of IAP that issued these recommendations.

“Initially, we recommended a ban on sale of JUNCS foods in school canteens and in near vicinity. We also suggested to ensure availability and affordability of healthy snacks and foods. Support of schools and government authorities is must to do take this further,” he said.

Dr Gupta was delivering the late Dr DG Gan oration organized by Academy of Pediatricians (AOP) Nagpur chapter. He spoke about latest IAP guidelines on junk food, fruit juice and energy drinks. Dr Shubhada Khirwadkar was installed as president while Dr Mustafa Ali as secretary of the AOP Nagpur chapter during this function.

“Not only parents and schools but many paediatricians were unaware about the IAP recommendations issued last year. These guidelines are ideal and most important for good lifestyle of our kids,” said Dr Khirwadkar.

Earlier, Padmashri Dr Rani Bang spoke about responsible parenting in modern era. She appealed the parents to avoid their kids to be a part of rat race. “Winners of rat race will only remain rats and will never become tigers or lions in their lives,” she said.

AOP Patron Dr Uday Bodhankar, president (2019) Dr Ravindra Bhelonde, secretary Mahesh Turale, Maharashtra medical council (MMC) Vice-President Dr Vinky Rughwani, and paediatricians from across Vidarbha attended the event.

The reason is the ensuing GHMC polls. Though there are six months left to announce GHMC polls, the vigilance wing is predicting increasing pressure on them by the local corporators to not conduct raids.

“So far, we have not received such pressure, but according to IPC, criminal cases are being registered against water thieves when we have identified illegal water connections during our raids,” sources in Vigilance wing told TOI.

Video grab of clash on the Husainabad Road on Sunday

LUCKNOW: Tension ran high on Husainabad Road — a stone’s throw from Clock Tower where women are staging anti-CAA protests — when a man fired in the air during a clash between two groups on Sunday evening.

Police have detained two persons, including an advocate, for questioning and sent the licensed pistol of the latter for forensic examination to determine if the shot was fired from the same firearm.

ACP (Chowk) Durga Prasad Tiwari said the two rival groups, each comprising 7-8 youths, engaged in stone-pelting at a park near Clock Tower.

“One group was led by Kamil and the other by Eraz. The advocate, who was at the protest site, reportedly tried to pacify the warring groups, but nobody paid heed. So, he took out his licensed pistol and reportedly fired a shot in the air,” Tiwari said.

The ACP said that Kamil’s brother Imran and the advocate were being questioned at Thakurganj police station. “We are trying to verify the claim of the advocate that he did not belong to any group. We will initiate legal action after completing the probe,” the officer added.

Police commissioner Sujeet Pandey said the clash and firing had no connection with the ongoing protest at Clock Tower.

An empty shell has been recovered from the spot and the advocate’s pistol sent for examination, he said, adding that there was no need to panic. The firing nevertheless triggered panic among protesters who were reminded of the February 1 incident at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. “We heaved a sigh of relief later,” said a woman.

As police quizzed the two detainees, a crowd of supporters assembled outside Thakurganj police station. Security was beefed up to avert a law and order situation. Police are also scanning video clips of the clash circulating on social media to identify the troublemakers.

While police said the clash had nothing to do with the Clock Tower agitation, some women protesters claimed the dispute started on Saturday when a few youths stalking some female participants were stopped by another group.

Panaji: Yash Fadte continued to make the best of his last year in the junior circuit as he won the prestigious French Junior Open 2020 in Lille on Sunday.

Exhausted after a gruelling five-setter in the semifinal that lasted for 75 minutes, Yash gathered strength for another epic squash battle as he defeated second seed Marek Panacek of Czech Republic 10-12, 11-5, 11-4, 11-5.

“I was nervous, exhausted as well after difficult games earlier in the championship. But having travelled so far, I didn’t want to let go of this opportunity,” Yash told TOI after his triumph.

The French Junior Open is among the three most prestigious junior tournaments in the world behind British Open and the US Open. While Yash has won the US Open (U-17 category) in the past and missed his flight for this year’s event, he made a quarterfinal exit at the British Open this year.

Yash, 18, is among the world’s top-six best-ranked player. He recently travelled to England for a training stint and has been growing in confidence.

“My ultimate aim is to win the Junior World Championship and I am determined to overcome all the obstacles that might come my way. There is no looking back now,” said Yash, whose father Dilip has been his pillar of strength.

In Goa, the Vasco-based player has received absolutely no support from the government. Despite an assurance from chief minister Pramod Sawant in the state legislative assembly that the Asian junior finalist would be considered for financial support, the government has stayed mum since then.

Earlier in the quarterfinals, Yash accounted for France No. 2 Baptiste Bouin 11-5, 11-7, 12-10 but his biggest challenge was in the last-four clash against the number one Toufik Mekhalfi. Yash dropped the first set against the crowd favourite but eventually had the last laugh as he won 9-11, 11-6, 8-11, 11-7, 11-9 in a match that lasted for more than an hour.

In the final, Yash surrendered the first set again but had enough in the tank to outgun his Czech Republic opponents in the next three sets.

THRISSUR: The sample fireworks display arranged by the Enkakkad wing as part of the famous Uthralikavu Pooram festival was held on Sunday evening amidst tight security.

The fireworks started at 8.46pm and according to district collector S Shanavas it lasted for only five to seven minutes. He said as per the information received by him no excess quantity of explosives were used during the display.

The collector said the Kunnamkulam ACP T S Sinoj and tahasildar P U Rafeeq, who were supervising the fireworks display from the government’s side, had directed the organizers to remove some of the excess quantities of fireworks stocked at the display site. Pollution control board officials, who were monitoring the event, said noise levels were also within the permitted level of 125 decibels. City police commissioner Aadhithya R said nearly 300 police officers were specially deployed to maintain law and order during the event, in addition to the regular deployment.

He said that the police had been directed to provide full support to the revenue officials to ensure that only the stipulated quantities of fireworks were used.

The event was preceded by intense arguments between the organizers and the officials when directives were issued to remove excess quantities. This led to delay in the start of the firework display.

The collector had earlier made it clear that only 20,000 palm-leaf crackers 300 Mathappu, 300 Chinese crackers, 300 Poothiri, and 150 Mazhathiri can be used by each wing during their display. ADM Reji P Joseph warned that potentially hazardous items like Amittu or Kuzhiminni should not be used.

ACP Sinoj said there were no reports of any untoward incident during the fireworks display. The event was held after several days on uncertainty following strict instructions of the collector that it can be held as per the Kerala high court order.

A scintillating Melam was held prior to the fireworks display and was led by Sukapuram Dileep.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau ( VACB ) carried out raids in two private ‘PSC ( Public Service Commission ) coaching centres’ in the state capital on Sunday.

An inquiry was ordered into complaints against a couple of government Secretariat employees for their suspected ownership of the centres and possible influence they might have in the Kerala PSC to leak question papers, including those of the Kerala Administrative Services (KAS) preliminary exams, which was held on Saturday.

Though VACB’s special unit 2 team led by DSP Prasad could not catch any Secretariat employee red-handed during the raids, a fire and rescue department personnel was found giving lectures in one of the centres. The vigilance team, in the coming days, would be conducting a comprehensive inquiry against these government employees and will keep the coaching centres and other branches across the state on its radar, the officials said.

The vigilance inquiry against two Secretariat employees was ordered by general administration department (GAD) principal secretary K R Jyothilal following a request received from the PSC secretary. The PSC’s request for the vigilance probe against the duo employed in the GAD came after a group of candidates lodged a complaint in this regard raising the allegations. The vigilance team carried out the raids at two PSC coaching centres in Thampanoor - Lakshya and Veto – and the fire force personnel was caught from Veto. The VACB will recommend for necessary action against him, a VACB official said.

As per the preliminary evidence collected, one of the centres is owned by a secretariat employee while the other by a close relative of another employee. “There is no clear evidence to show that government employees are giving lectures at these centres, as they are keeping vouchers without names, but with just signatures,” the official said. The VACB, in the coming days, will also examine the assets of the employees against whom the allegations have been raised.

Meanwhile, PSC chairman M K Sakeer told reporters that the Commision will conduct their own inquiry into the functioning of these private ‘PSC coaching centres’ and into the allegations of involvement of government employees. “The PSC stands with candidates and will initiate action against coaching centres which are under the cloud. There will be more investigations in accordance with the complaints we receive,” he said, adding that government officials are not allowed to take coaching classes while in service.

The trail of investigation showed smuggling of more than 100kg of heroin worth Rs 400 crore with similar modus operandi.Rajesh Nandan Srivastava, deputy director general (operations), said that two women from Mozambique were arrested along with the receiver, a native of Ivory Coast based in Greater Noida. “The probe is at an initial stage. Efforts are being made to identify other members of this cartel,” he added.NCB sleuths had received an input about drug cartels exploring new routes to push heroin into the country and zeroed in on the Mozambique route. A few days ago, a trap was laid at IGI airport and two flights from Johannesburg in South Africa were scrutinised.“The two women from Mozambique were intercepted and after a search of their luggage 3.92kg and 5.65kg of heroin, respectively, was seized.

COIMBATORE: The city corporation is planning to sign a new agreement with the private company that is treating a portion of the solid wastes generated in the city after coming to know that a part of the land at Vellalore it had leased to the company has been taken up for constructing the integrated bus stand.

“We are working to identify the exact portion of the leased area that falls under the area chosen to construct the bus stand. Once the land is identified, we plan to rewrite the agreement signed with the Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Private Limited,” said a corporation official. “The overlapping area would not be more than five cents and has no civil structure, apart from the special school run for the children of those working in the dump yard. It can be shifted as there is sufficient space available adjacent to it.”

The agreement with the company ends in 2026, the official said. “The corporation does not want to make changes in the bus stand design only because of the agreement, which ends in a few years.”

The issue came to light recently after the company was asked to vacate the portion of land to begin construction work. The firm filed a complaint with the corporation office and with the collector’s office. The corporation, in 2008, had leased out 181 acres of land to the company for carrying out the waste management project.

COIMBATORE: What started as a grand celebration ended on a tragic note with one bull tamer being killed in the jallikattu that was held at Chettipalayam here on Sunday. While another one tamer is battling for life in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), 15 others are undergoing treatment at various hospitals.

Police identified the deceased as Subash Chandra Bose, 26, of Viralimalai in Pudukottai district. He was knocked down by a bull.

Chettipalayam has been known for motorsports events, thanks to Kari Motor Speedway. But on Sunday, the place in suburban Coimbatore came alive with large crowd flocking to the area to witness a ‘sport’ of different kind – jallikattu.

More than 800 bulls from across the state and as many bull tamers had landed at Chettipalayam for the third consecutive annual jallikattu.

The event was flagged off by local administration minister S P Velumani in the presence of Isha Yoga Foundation founder Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev and district collector K Rajamani. “The pride of TamilNadu , Jallikattu is a fantastic expression of the natural valour and spirit of adventure of the Tamil Youth. This iconic event should be developed as a wonderful sport with proper rules and attention to safety of all including the animals,” Jaggi Vasudev tweeted after watching the event.

As the bulls were released from the vadivasal one after the other, the adrenaline rush among the bull tamers was palpable as they attempted to cling to the hump of the majestic bulls. Some of the tamers managed to cling to the hump for a while in a symbolic victory over the beast, while several bulls outdid the tamers and went untouched.

But around afternoon, several tamers started suffering injuries. Subash was knocked down by a bull and he was rushed to CMCH, where he died. Sixteen others, who suffered injuries, were sent to a private hospital from where six were referred to CMCH. “The condition of one of them is critical,” police said.

HYDERABAD: The state government’s ambitious plan of selling 3,700 flats constructed under Rajiv Swagruha scheme at Bandlaguda and Pocharam to raise revenue may not be successful unless repairs are carried out, civic amenities and other facilities are provided and an attractive package is offered.Earlier, the government had tried to sell the flats to earn over Rs 500 crore but the plan evoked nil response with only one applicant coming forward to purchase a flat. Later, the government decided to sell the flats to government employees at reasonable rates but this too failed to get the employees interested in occupying the houses. Those who had purchased the flats and are staying in the township say that the infrastructure needs to be improved.When this correspondent visited the project site in Bandlaguda near Nagole, security personnel were manning the entrance gates, however, a peep inside the vacant flats revealed their poor condition.Some of the flats which have been vacant for almost 10 years now have become nesting grounds for birds. In some of the flats, the viscera of dead pigeons has dried up and is yet to be cleared. The drinking water supply connection has been disconnected to one of the blocks in Rajiv Swagruha Sahabhavana township in Bandlaguda for non-payment of bills, while kitchen platforms are missing in some of the flats.C Rajender Kumar, manager of Sahabhavana Diamond Classic Flat Owners Welfare Association, said the situation was even worse in C block with the washrooms in the flats having no drainage connection. “Thanks to Rajiv Swagruha Corporation officials, works were taken up and connections have been provided. There is lot of work to be done and the corporation, of late, has taken up several works. But a lot more infrastructure needs to be put in place before the flats are put up for sale,” he said.Mayank Mishra, one of the flat owners, said the houses were good to stay in. “The township, which was once considered to be away from the city, is now in the midst of residential and commercial markets, however, any auction will fetch good rates only if the product is packaged properly,” he said.Telangana Non-Gazetted Officers’ association president Ravinder Reddy said that though the flats were offered to government employees, there were no takers as it was an unfinished product. “Bandlaguda and Pocharam Rajiv Swagruha townships are located between 20 km and 24 km away from Secretariat and most of the government offices in the city. Even the prices offered by the government then were considered too high for flats located far away from the core city.

COIMBATORE: With more and more customers queuing up in front of the water vending machine run by a self-help group (SHG) at Ukkadam , the district administration is planning to rope in more SHGs.

The city corporation was planning to install 130 vending machines throughout the city. “We were not sure if the women SHG members would survive in the business, considering the huge competition in the water business. That’s why we wanted to implement the project on a pilot basis. Now that the members are doing good business, we are confident that their business would increase further. We are planning to introduce more SHGs in the project,” said a senior official with the Tamil Nadu corporation for development of women.

They are planning to invite five SHGs to manage vending machines in each of the zones, the official said. “Some have shown interest after we conducted talks with them.”

The corporation had inaugurated its first vending machine at the Ukkadam bus stand a month ago. Since then, SHG Thendral Sikana Nanaya Sangam has managed to sell 4,500 litres of drinking water per day.

“We plan to sell potable water to commercial establishments and for weddings and temple festivals, where bulk quantity is required. As of now, we are selling about 200 water cans per day apart from selling about 400 litres – a litre for Rs 1 – at the vending machine. We are hopeful that the business would expand in the coming months,” said S Krishnaveni, leader of the group.

The SHG members are also advertising the project, Krishnaveni said. “We are distributing pamphlets that explains that the project is a government initiative, at commercial spaces and apartments in the city. As a result, we have got some customers from RS Puram. Those who were not ready to buy water from us have started contacting us.”

But the SHG is facing huge opposition from private water vendors. “If we can find some sort of solution to tackle the opposition, we would definitely succeed in our business,” Krishnaveni said.

A litre of water is sold for Rs 1 and 20 litres for Rs 7 at the plant. Those customers, who want a 20-litre bottle delivered at their doorstep, need to pay only Rs 20.

The SHG gets Rs 3 for selling 20 litres at the plant and Rs 12 when delivered at the doorstep. The corporation gets Rs 1 when 20 litres are sold.

Bareilly: A 23-year-old woman, who was apparently born blind and had no hope of seeing in her life, got her eyesight, miraculously, thanks to a team of doctors and medical staff in Bareilly. It was a second life for her as the doctor said that “normally, the success rate in such delayed treatment is not 100 percent”.

Born in a poor family in Azamgarh district and married to a cane farmer Kallu Singh of Chandanpur village, Kanchan had lost all hope of “seeing the world” as her parents and husband had tried to cure her blindness, but without any success. Kanchan, who was blind in both her eyes, spent much of her childhood in solitude. She hardly had any friends. Added to her misery, she has a seven-month-old who is undernourished and requires urgent medical attention. So, the woman admitted her child to a nutrition rehabilitation centre at district hospital in Bareilly. Here, she met staff nurses and dietician who gave her some hope. She came to know for the first time that her “blindness could be cured and she would be able to see after an eye surgery”. On Thursday, she underwent a successful eye surgery, which wasn’t easy, and now she can see for the first time.

Kanchan profusely thanked the doctors and members of the medical team on Sunday. She told TOI, “I am so happy that I can see my son and take better care of him now. I had stopped having any expectations. Also, importantly, I didn’t have to spend money for my surgery. I am grateful to the doctors and nurses who cared for me and my child. My son is also healthy now and we will be discharged from the hospital soon.”

After giving birth to a boy, she was always depressed as she could hardly take care of her child. In fact, she blamed her child’s undernourished condition on her blindness. So, when the couple took their child to the district hospital, they were advised to admit him at the rehab centre. The baby was under weight and malnourished. At the rehab centre, mothers are usually allowed to stay with their child and Kanchan soon developed a good rapport with the staff. Dr Rosy Zaidi, a dietician, checked Kanchan’s eyes and took her to DN Singh, a government doctor. Dr Singh after examining her eyes suggested her to undergo an eye surgery. Following the successful surgery it was a delightful sight to see when her bandage was gradually removed from her eyes.

Eye surgeon Dr DN Singh told TOI, “The woman was blind because of cataract and her treatment could have been done earlier. We have performed cataract surgery with lens implantation which was successful. Normally the success in such delayed treatment is not 100 percent. However, the woman got her eyesight. We may provide advance lens at a later stage to improve her vision.”

A CCTV footage of Sunil Kanaujia allegedly carrying his wife Bharti Pandey’s body parts in a bag

LUCKNOW: The March 2019 murder of a woman, whose dismembered body was recovered from different parts of the city, has taken a curious turn with the decomposed body of the prime suspect, her estranged husband, being found floating in the Gomti in January this year.

While a close relative has been able to identify the rotting corpse as that of 32-year-old Sunil Kanaujia from a metal bracelet, police have sought DNA analysis for a confirmed match.

The chopped body of Sunil’s wife, Bharti Pandey (30), was found in two bags 7km apart in Krishnanagar and Para on March 23 and 24, respectively.

Sunil went missing since then. “Last month, we fished out a decomposed body from the Gomti river . Sunil’s brother Anil came to Para police station recently and positive ID’d the body from a metal bracelet on the right hand. We have taken Anil’s blood and samples from the body for DNA analysis,” said Para SHO Triloki Singh.

After Bharti’s body parts were found in a red bag in Krishnanagar, police scanned CCTV camera footage procured from nearby houses and caught a man in the act. His physical features seemed to match with the description of Sunil, an aluminium factory worker in Alambagh.

Inquiries gave a motive to the case. Bharti, who worked at a noodles unit, was allegedly having an extramarital affair with colleague Ashish. Police also found a bloodstained bed linen and sharp-edged tools at Sunil’s house in Para, where the couple lived on rent for a year. Cops concluded that Sunil was the prime suspect, but had no way of confirming it because both he and Ashish went missing.

“Sunil was a native of Malda, Bengal, and married Bharti against the wishes of his parents in 2018. Bharti, originally from Asansol in Bengal, had married twice before. In fact, she came to Lucknow in 2016 with her second husband, but left him to marry Sunil,” SHO Singh said.

The officer maintained that autopsy of the body found in Gomti could not ascertain the exact cause of death because of its decomposed state. “The body has now been sent to a forensic lab for analysis. It will help us determine if the man was killed or he committed suicide,” the SHO added.

While each team conducted separate probes, the Military Intelligence team led by Major Mukesh examined the cartridges kept at the Kulathupuzha police station and confirmed that they were made in Pakistan. The cartridges, they said, were brought here and abandoned recently.

The primary assumption of the investigators is that the cartridges are made in Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) as suggested from the markings on it. Police said the cartridges were made in 1981-82 period and could be used in modern long-range weapons. The investigators also doubt that these cartridges are used by Pakistan armed forces.

Earlier, state police chief Loknath Behera had discussions with police chiefs of other states. “The ATS has been entrusted with the task of probing the matter. Anoop Kuruvila John will be heading the probe,” said Behera. We have informed the central agencies about the incident, he added.

SY Quraishi

NEW DELHI: Former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi , who was recently accused by the Election Commission of “selective amnesia” after he questioned the poll body for not filing an FIR for hate speech in the Delhi assembly polls, has hit back alleging that the EC may have joined the issue with him due to “political backing”.

“It is possible that it is due to political backing. Let me recall that for the past two years, there have been numerous editorials published in newspapers where the EC has been subjected to abuses and criticism. Why doesn’t the EC respond to that first? If attacking their own man clears their conscience, it is fine,” Quraishi said.

The ex-CEC said if the EC had directed filing of FIR in the first set of hate speech cases against BJP’s Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, the latter would not have dared to repeat the same offence. Verma was barred twice from campaign on account of hate speech.

EC officials were quick to rebut Quraishi’s charge of “political backing”, saying the “insinuation was absurd besides being factually incorrect”.

“EC respects its former functionaries. It was the present commission that started the Sukumar Sen Lecture in memory of the first CEC. It also started a T N Seshan chair at India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management, mentored by ex-CEC N Gopalaswami. EC is willing to take all advice including gratuitous one being doled day in and day out by self-appointed EC spokespersons, that too through the media,” said an official who did not want to be identified.

In the past one year, ever since BSP chief Mayawati unilaterally broke the walked out of the alliance with SP forged during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the SP has been organising functions in memory of Dalit ideologues like Jyotiba Phule and Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, apart from party icons like Ram Manohar Lohia, Janeshwar Mishra and Karpoori Thakur. On December 6, the party observed the death anniversary of BR Ambedkar. Akhilesh has also instructed the cadre to display portrait of the architect of the Indian Constitution in their offices. Besides, he has also got statues of Ambedkar installed inside the party headquarters in Lucknow.

The effort to win over the Dalit constituency has gone beyond symbolism. Akhilesh has also changed his stance to support the ‘reservation in promotion’ policy of the BSP. He had opposed it during his regime. Besides, he has also been raising issues and concerns of the ‘bahujan samaj’ which was missing in his earlier speeches.

Moreover, despite Mayawati attacking Akhilesh and his party for the failure of the alliance in 2019 general elections, the SP chief has strictly avoided any direct attack on her. “ Akhilesh Yadav has been assiduously befriending Dalits since 2018, even before the general elections by burying the past animosity with the arch-rival BSP. He went the extra mile to forge the alliance and his wife Dimple touched Mayawati’s feet at an election rally,” says LU’s political scientist Ashutosh Mishra.

“It might have cost Akhilesh the 2019 elections, but his subsequent strategy in the past one year through symbolism and ideological compromises could help him in 2022 assembly elections and the traditional hostility of Dalits towards the powerful backward castes, like Yadavs, could be diluted,” he adds.

On the other hand appointing Brahmins to two key positions — leader of the party in Lok Sabha, Ritesh Pandey and Satish Chand Mishra in Rajya Sabha — by the BSP has not gone down well. A number of former MPs and ministers have left the party. Loyalists like Kunwar Fateh Bahadur Singh have questioned Mayawati’s ‘wisdom’ behind ‘Brahminisation of the Dalit party’.

“Akhilesh Yadav is trying to achieve a support base which even his father and SP founder, Mulayam Singh Yadav, couldn’t manage and limiting its appeal among Muslims and Yadavs. It will have to be seen how far successful he is in the next two years before state polls,” says an observer.

SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary told TOI: “Akhilesh wants to fulfill the dream of two great leaders — Ram Manohar Lohia and Baba Saheb Ambedkar — to bring the poor and the vulnerable classes under one umbrella.”

COIMBATORE: Three people were arrested for attempting to circulate counterfeit currency notes here on Saturday night. Police have seized from them fake notes with a face value of Rs 3.24 lakh.

A source with the Saravanampatti police station said S Kidhar Mohammed, 66, of Vadvalli and D Mahendran, 39, of Kavundampalayam were spotted near a petrol pump near Maniyakaranpalayam on Saturday night by a team led by sub-inspector P Suresh. “When we inquired with them, they gave contradictory statements. We then checked their bags and found counterfeit currency notes.”

The team took them to the police station, where they interrogated the duo .“They told us that the fake notes were printed by E Suryakumar, 32, of Thiruvalluvar Nagar on Thadagam Road, and that they were attempting to circulate them in shops. The two were carrying 300 fake notes of Rs 200 denomination each in two bags,” the source said.

Police subsequently conducted raid at Suryakumar’s house at Thiruvalluvar Nagar and seized counterfeit currency with a face value of Rs 2.64 lakh, printers, computers and scanners.

Preliminary inquiry revealed that Suryakumar was running an e-service centre at Kanuvai area. “As the business ran into huge losses, he approached Kidhar Mohammed, who was arrested for circulating counterfeit currency notes. Suryakumar learned from him the art of making fake notes and struck a deal with him and Mahendran to circulate them.”

Hyderabad: Aiming to sustain Indian fish export to the US, the European Union (EU), China, and Japan, the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) and National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), Hyderabad are taking up initiatives to spread awareness among aquaculture farmers.

The move comes in the wake of zero tolerance policies towards antibiotic residues in cultured shrimps by US and EU.

“In an attempt to improve fish exports, as part of the Blue Revolution, we are working on strict implementation of the norms to stop overdose of antibiotics,” said a senior executive at NFDB. “Meanwhile, we are also making sure that the stakeholders understand the risk of being blacklisted for a shipment with high residue of antibiotic substances.”

Agencies in the fisheries sector have decided to launch massive awareness campaign among aquaculture farmers.

NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may offer a breather to Bandhan Bank to dilute its promoter holding after allowing another private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank time to reduce the holding of its promoters, while capping their voting rights.“RBI is looking to address the issue in a comprehensive manner in the coming days,” a source familiar with the discussions told TOI. The move is seen to be crucial to bring regulatory parity.The RBI’s bank licence rules mandate that promoters of private banks need to reduce their shareholding to 40% within three years, 20% in 10 years and pare it to 15% in 15 years.Currently, Bandhan Bank promoters hold 61% stake in the lender. Last September, RBI had disallowed the lender from opening new branches as it was not able to bring down the shareholding of non-operative financial holding company to 40%, which was prescribed in the licensing conditions. In addition, the regulator had ordered a freeze on the salary of the bank’s managing director and CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh. As a result, the new private sector player is stuck with a franchise of 1,094 branches across the country after a fast pace expansion in the initial five years of its operation.At the time of regulatory action, the promoter’s holding was estimated at over 82%, which subsequently came down following the merger of Gruh Finance, HDFC’s affordable housing finance arm.RBI special dispensation for Kotak Mahindra Bank, which got a licence in 2003 and was to reduce promoter holding several years ago, came after the lender dragged RBI to court in what was a rare move in the Indian banking sector where the banking regulator’s decisions are usually not challenged by entities that come under its purview. At the heart of the dispute was the bank’s plan of August 2018, when it had proposed to issue perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter holding to 19.7%, but it failed to convince RBI.The new stake dilution plan for Kotak Mahindra Bank promoters comes with a cap on voting rights. The “deal”, finalised by RBI last week, requires MD & CEO Uday Kotak to sell his 4% stake by August.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74275087,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24191,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/relief-for-bandhan-bank-promoters/articleshow/74275088.cms

Codissia Defence Innovation

COIMBATORE: With the Union government approving the detailed project report for the Codissia Defence Innovation and Atal Incubation Centre last week, the construction work of the centre will begin in May-June, said representatives of the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia).

President of Codissia R Ramamurthy, at a session on defence indigenisation recently, informed about the development. He also said Codissia had transferred Rs 2.34 crore to the escrow account meant for the project last week.

In January 2018, the defence ministry granted Codissia Rs 20 crore for setting up a defence innovation centre. Of this, Rs 15 crore was for the innovation centre and Rs 5 crore was a soft working capital for innovating products. Later, after interactions, Ramamurthy said, the project was clubbed with the Atal Incubation Centre, through the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDex) scheme.

The projected cost of the centre is Rs 45 crore. Codissia and the Atal Incubation Mission will invest Rs 10 crore each in the centre, which will come up at the Codissia Industrial Park near the city. Codissia will also invest another Rs 5 crore for land and building.

“In a week’s time, we expect the Centre to transfer Rs 2.34 crore. Another Rs 5 crore will likely be available with Codissia when the project work begins,” he said.

Ramamurthy said, in a recent meeting with officials from the defence ministry in New Delhi, the officials assured to discuss the project in a board meeting with defence production wing in two weeks. “We expect the ministry to sanction Rs 15 crore granted for the the innovation centre. With a nod from the Centre, we will start ordering machines using the grant,” he said, adding that a building plan for the centre was getting ready for an approval and mostly in May or June the construction work would begin

Besides, Codissia is in contact with defence forces on different works that they could pursue once the centre start functioning, he said.

348,['24/02/2020'],Secunderabad: GHMC to take up road widening work around Moulali Kaman,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Development work around Moula Ali arch will be taken up at Rs 4 crore budget

SECUNDERABAD: In order to facilitate better flow of traffic between Kushaiguda and Tarnaka via the Moula Ali kaman (arch), the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) has decided to widen the abutting road.

Over the years, travelling through the archway became inconvenient as the narrow thoroughfare turned to be a bottleneck for larger vehicles such as buses, ambulances and trucks. Owing to this, motorists plying from Kushaiguda have to travel an additional four kilometres to reach Tarnaka via Housing Board Colony, ZTC and Lalapet flyover instead of directly coming through the archway.

“The road passing through the arch is so narrow that at a time, only one car or couple of two-wheelers can pass. The bottleneck leads to heavy traffic in the area. No ambulance, RTC or school buses, trucks can use the Moula Ali kaman road,” said Mohammed Imtiaz Raheem, owner of a hardware shop in the area.

To improve the traffic conditions in that area, the GHMC has decided to develop a 30 feet two lane-slip road on both sides of the arch. This will enable authorities to lay roads without demolishing the structure and simultaneously restoration works could also be taken up.

“We recently issued notices to 33 properties for land acquisition to take up the road widening works around the arch. Of the 33 properties, 17 have consented to accept the compensation. Once all the land is acquired, we will widen the road around the arch,” said Srinivas Reddy, GHMC zonal commissioner, Secunderabad .

The GHMC will take up the road widening work at a cost of ₹4 crore of which ₹2 crore is likely to be disbursed as compensation to property owners and the rest will be used for development work.

The 250-year-old Moula Ali kaman was built as a pathway to Moula Ali Dargah during the reign of the Qutb Shahi. The Nizams of Hyderabad are known to have taken out processions through the archway while visiting the shrine.

The federation is also planning to provide leadership training to managers and supervisors.

COIMBATORE: The Indian Texpreneurs Federation (ITF), which has 450 members in the state from across the textile value chain, has zeroed in on four core areas — integration, sustainability, financial restructuring and leadership skills — based on a research. It would apply these to improve overall business performance of textile industry in the state in the financial year 2020-21, ITF convener Prabhu Dhamodharan said.

The core areas were decided based on a research ITF did along with research firm Crisil Limited. While the association members are practising concepts such as sustainability and leadership training, they seek to increase participation in the next fiscal.

Value-addition is the way forward for the textile industry, Dhamodharan said. “The pressure on standalone spinning mills is higher than that on integrated or semi-integrated textile units. Of the 87 lakh spindles units represented in the federation, only 20% are integrated. It’s the right time for standalone spinning companies to move up the value chain to make value-added finished products. For this, ITF would set up an advisory cell with industry and external experts to guide members to step into integration and make high value-added products to improve their financial performance.”

Speaking of sustainability, the official said the State is leading in areas such as zero liquid discharge and the use of green energy. “Power accounts for 10% of the yarn cost. We are planning to bring down energy consumption. Ten ITF members have GreenCo certification and seven have Higg Index. We plan to triple these numbers,” he said.

However, many textile firms couldn’t afford the measures due to working capital crunch, said Damodharan. “We have requested the ministry of textiles for a one-time financial restructuring. This includes converting of working capital loans as long-term loans in account of non-availability of working capital, a moratorium of two years and infusion of new working capital.”

The federation is also planning to provide leadership training to managers and supervisors. “We had trained 400 managers and supervisors at the ITF Leadership Academy last year in areas such as communication skills, emotional intelligence, innovation and creativity. As a result, teamwork has become better. We plan to train 1,000 more managers and supervisors from textile firms in the coming financial year.”

Pilibhit: More than six months after two wild tuskers from Nepal strayed from their usual path, trampling crops and killing five people in Rohilkhand region, some wild elephants have again crossed the Indo-Nepal border into Pilibhit district and are currently foraging for food at Gorakhdibbi village.

According to villagers, one adult jumbo from Nepal was spotted at Gorakhdibbi village six days ago. Later, it was joined by two more elephants. These pachyderms have so far smashed as many as nine thatched houses and destroyed over seven acres of standing wheat crop.

This is the third time that the village has faced destruction by wild elephants in less than one year. Besides, the wild jumbos from Nepal usuallly cross the border in September-October, during the kharif season.

Villagers claimed they were yet to receive any help from either the forest department or district administration and all they have is a small quantity of crackers. By bursting crackers, they can keep the elephants away only for a short time. At the same time, they fear that the sound may infuriate the elephants and they may attack the villagers.

Gorakhdibbi, a hamlet of Nagari Khurd Kalan village panchayat under Kalinagar tehsil is situated on the edge of Lagga Bagga forest region of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve and Royal Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in Nepal. The Lagga Bagga area is an elephant corridor that has been used by the pachyderms since time immemorial, said experts.

Deputy director of PTR Naveen Khandelwal said a major part of the land of Gorakhdibbi and neighbouring villages actually belongs to the forest department. This land was illegally allotted on lease to a number of villagers by the revenue department way back in 1955 and 1960. They were displaced from their original villages in what is Uttarakhand today in lieu of their land acquired for construction of the Nanak Sagar dam on river Devha in Udhamsingh Nagar district.

“In the real sense, the jumbos retreat to their own corridor which has now been transformed into agricultural fields. The department is fighting a legal battle in the high court to get the forest property concerned back into its possession,” he said.

Meanwhile, Paritosh Chandra Rai, husband of pradhan Champa Devi Rai of Nagaria Khurd Kalan, said the elephants had devoured and ruined over seven acres of standing wheat crop. “The elephants take rest on the banks of river Sharda and in the jungles of Lagga Bagga during daytime and barge into the village at night. They have smashed nine houses, leaving the inmates homeless,” Rai added.

“The residents here are spending sleepless nights as the jumbos silently infiltrate the village area at night. We are worried about our safety,” said Rai.

Two residents, Khargai Lal and Dineshwar Bairagi, told TOI that a team of forest department had visited the village on Saturday but left after spot inspection without making any efforts to push the elephants back into the jungle.

Bareilly: A woman and her son were among four arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder of a bus driver, 46, whose body was found abandoned in a roadside ditch under Asmauli police station limits in Sambhal on February 18.

Police claimed that victim Rakesh Kumar Ruhela’s wife, 43, had hatched a conspiracy, along with her paramour and son, 22, to kill her husband.

According to police, Ruhela, a resident of Double Fatak area in Moradabad, was an alcoholic and used to beat up his wife and son after getting drunk. Around seven months ago, he had rented a portion of his house to Shane Alam, who allegedly developed illicit relationship with his wife, said police, adding that the accused would be produced in a court on Monday.

Additional superintendent of police Alok Kumar Jaiswal said the autopsy report revealed that the driver was strangled. “Based on suspicion, we detained Alam, who confessed his crime during interrogation,” said the ASP.

“According to Alam, the driver’s wife and son were frustrated with his behaviour, and after he developed an intimate relationship with the victim’s wife, they decided to eliminate her husband. On February 17, Alam took Ruhela for booze where Alam’s friend Sonu Massy was already present. Both the friends strangled Ruhela and dumped his body,” said the ASP.

The ASP added that an FIR under sections 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was lodged against the four accused, who had been arrested.

ON TRACK: Metro rail believes the new contracts will help it meet deadlines

CHENNAI: After terminating contracts with four companies involved in the construction of phase-1 and phase-1 extension lines of metro rail, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is tweaking its contracts with firms to ensure faster construction of the 118.9km phase-2 lines. The changes made in the contracts will help avoid additional cost of both the contractors and CMRL.

Wiser after building the 45km phase-1 over 10 years, CMRL thinks the new clauses would allow it to offload work from companies that are likely to not meet deadlines and, also keep a tab on contractors to avoid diverting metro rail funds for other projects they may be involved in. Revising clauses in construction contracts come at the time when CMRL has started floating tenders for building tunnels for a portion of the phase-2 lines. Amending the guidelines is crucial as it will be awarding contracts to several companies. It plans to split the lines into portions and float tenders, unlike in phase-1 where big stretches were given to a single firm for construction.

So far, tenders to build twin-tunnels between Kellys and Taramani Road covering 12km and a 9km line from Venugopal Nagar to Kellys have been floated. Awarding work on small stretches in phase-2 to firms also means that construction would not be affected on the entire corridor if work on a portion gets delayed.

A CMRL official said the option to offload work from one contractor, who may have a poor pace of construction or have other deficiencies, to another company involved in the same project at an already fixed rate, was introduced in phase-1 extension. This prevented loss of time on calling for new tenders to find a contractor.

“The clause made us work comfortably without the fear of time overrun. With a notice to the contractor, we can offload a particular work,” an official said. “We mostly offloaded those crucial areas of work that need to be finished on priority and hand it over to other contractors for further work such as installation of signals, communication systems and electrical work.”

The tweaks made to the contracts worked in favour of CMRL when it had to terminate the contract with IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (ITNL) due to delay in construction of two underground stations at Sir Theagaraya College and Korukkupet. “We offloaded cut-and-cover work and gave it to one of our other contractors a year ago. Three months ago, we gave some portions of Theagaraya College station to another contractor. When we saw they were struggling with severe cash crunch for months and that work was slow, we didn’t have an option but to end their contract,” said another official.

CMRL officials said they ended contracts with four major companies involved in the construction of 45km phase-1 and 9km phase-1 extension, which included ITML KMB JV, Gammon MMS Devi, CCCL and Lanco. “Termination of contracts also meant we won’t be doing business with them anymore,” the official said.

Construction of a major portion of the underground line on Anna Salai was stalled for nearly a year after a Russian contractor abandoned work citing financial crisis. CMRL floated new tenders and awarded contract to companies to get the line ready for operations. Floating a fresh tender and awarding contract for an incomplete work takes time and new contractor may need time to procure equipment and materials. A metro rail official said they have brought in other changes like opening a common bank account to monitor use of funds by contractors and releasing of mobilisation funds in instalments to ensure contractors complete work on time.

“Earlier we released 10% of the funds at one go. We realised 10% is not required at the same time, so we decided to transfer it in three instalments. After the first instalment, they have to show us the progress before we release the rest of the money. If they don’t perform, we have a clause to encash their bank guarantee. The contractor cannot use the surplus money without completing the work,” the official said. “We also conduct checks every four months to ensure the company is not diverting funds.”

Bharatanatyam dancer by Manoj chopade

NAGPUR: Children learn how to make best out of waste in schools. But city-based artists and painters took the concept to a high level with creative minds making some of the finest pieces of art at a workshop organized by South Central Zone Cultural Centre (SCZCC).

The centre has come up with an innovative idea where scrap and unnecessary items in various organizations and offices are collected to make the best out of waste. The workshop titled ‘Scrap workshop’ is being conducted at SCZCC from February 22 to 28. Students and artists are showcasing the best of their ability to make beautiful items.

Milind Limbekar, a painter and artists, has taken the challenge of making a huge selfie point with the help of scrap wood. “I am working on making a big selfie point which will reflect Nagpur oranges, horses at Zero Mile and many more. It was a bit difficult to do wooden work, but the process was enjoyable,” he said.

Manoj Chopade, another artist participating in the workshop, has made a feminine figure of a Bharatanatyam dancer. “I have used complete metal scrap to piece the figure together. I have added details of pleats of the dress and posture of the dancer,” he said.

Raw and scrap material such as halogen lights, metal sheets and spotlights are provided to the artists who are making the best of it. “I have made a kinetic sculpture for which I used medium metal scrap material. It’s a great opportunity for local artists to show talent through the art,” said Shekhar Tandekar.

Students of the department of fine arts are helping these artists and also learning the skills of making such humongous objects with precision. “It’s been a very productive workshop as we are helping the artists. We are learning new things each day,” said Nilesh Varbhe, a student of fine arts.

Shashank Dande, programme officer at SCZCC, is coordinating the event with Muktadevi Mohite, head of the department of fine arts. Scarp material is provided to the artists.

Dande said, “It is a great opportunity for the students of the department of fine arts as they are spending quality time learning and understanding the art. Artists have teams of students and helpers who are looking after welding and arranging,” he said.

“The workshop aims to educate citizens about the beauty of transforming waste material into eye-catchy creative art objects. Scrap material was collected and provided to the artists whose creative minds instantly began the process of making the best out of it,” said Mohite.

PUNE: The PMPML is planning a series of jingles and advertisements on the television and radio to improve its ridership, which has more or less remained stagnant for almost a decade now.Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) CMD Nayana Gunde said the transport utility currently had many new buses in its fleet and its efforts to make things better were yielding better.“We feel that it is high time that the PMPML did something out of the box to properly market its services and encourage commuters to use the buses. The initiative — jingles and advertisements — is a part of it,” Gunde told TOI.Te advertisements would be on various television and radio channels. “The advertisements will be both entertaining and informative in nature. We will inform people about the PMPML and the number of buses in the past and the present operating daily. A strong point of the PMPML is its electric buses, which are doing a fairly good job. These e-buses will be highlighted in the advertisements too. The results, we hope, will be good,” she said.“The advertisements and jingles will also talk about the city’s pollution levels and encourage people to use buses more to reduce the load of private vehicles on the road. We recently had the ‘bus day’ and more than 1,800 of our vehicles were on the road that day. The ‘bus day’ will now be a regular feature every month. Work is on to ensure that the number of buses gradually increases on the road,” Gunde said.A PMPML official said the transport utility has around 125 e-buses and the vehicles have not yet suffered from any kind of breakdowns. “This year is crucial, as more buses will be added to the PMPML fleet and the Pune Metro services are also likely to start. The PMPML needs to have a proper marketing plan in place under such circumstances,” the official said.Experts and commuters have been raising concerns over the breakdowns of the PMPML buses . “The number of breakdowns has been less compared to what was in earlier years.

PM Narendra Modi

PATNA: It was a proud moment for the women’s self-help group (SHG) in Purnia district of the state as PM Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed their skills and efforts of producing silk saris for the high-end market. Defying the past, they are weaving saris with yarn produced from cocoons of silk worms grown on mulberry trees that they cultivated with eyes set on making high income.

The PM, in his 62nd edition of Mann Ki Baat delivered on Sunday, described their venture as an example of “new India” that has been unfolding in the country, when skilled women have been coming forward for not only their empowerment, but also for highly imaginative economic activities. The PM described it as “kamaal” (very exceptional). Women members of the SHGs formed under the rural livelihood project under implementation in the state are called ‘didis’ (sisters).

“The ‘didis’ of Adarsh Jeevika Mahila Mulberry Production Group (in Purnia) have achieved something that can be called ‘kamaal’. Its impact is being felt in other villages, too,” Modi said, adding: “Several farmers and ‘didis’ are now not only getting silk saris woven, but are selling them from stalls in big fairs.”

PM Modi also recounted his experience at Delhi Hunar Haat last week, where he went around the stalls from various states, but the stall of the Adarsh Jeevika Mahila Group from Purnia and the “exceptional” story of its women members drew his attention.

At Delhi Hoonar Haat, he also relished Bihar’s famed ‘litti-chokha’ delicacy that has also begun to get popular even with the high-end restaurants, including in Mumbai. However, he selected the SHG from Purnia for the special mention, a district that he had also visited during the 2016 floods.

“This is the same region that has faced the calamity of flood for centuries. In such a situation, mustering resources for income by way of farming and other avenues has been a very difficult proposition. But, some women from Purnia charted out a different path,” the PM said.

He noted that they formed an SHG, started cultivating mulberry trees, grew silk worms on them, prepared silk yarn from their cocoons, and finally started weaving silk saris for the high-end market. “Earlier, women from this locality used to grow silk worms on their mulberry trees from cocoons for which they used to get a very nominal price, when purchasers of the same cocoons used to earn very high profits by making silk yarn from them,” the PM said.

“But today, women of Purnia have made a new beginning and have changed the picture completely. You will be surprised to know that the same women … are now getting thousands of rupees on the ‘saris’ that they weave,” he said.

Taxis operated by a cooperative from the airport are expensive

CHENNAI: Hiring a cab has become a hassle for passengers who arrive at Chennai airport yet again.

After Ola’s contract got over by the end of January, passengers who arrive have to book cabs using apps as counters run by the aggregator are no longer available. Domestic passengers who have apps on their phones hail cabs, but those who do not, have to depend on the black-and-yellow taxis operated by drivers’ cooperative. But these taxis are expensive. International passengers who have heavy luggage have no option but to depend on touts.

Airport Authorities of India’s (AAI) attempt to rope in more cab aggregators is getting delayed. This has led to chaos in front of the international and domestic arrival terminals. The black-and-yellow taxis are not able to handle the crowd because the drivers cooperative, which has a counter outside the terminals, has only around 100 cabs at its disposal.

Since the only licensed app-cab operator has exited, there is no restriction for any cab company from entering the lane infront of the terminals to pick up passengers. Still, passengers have to walk to the parking lot to board the cabs.

Sources said AAI should try to rope in more cab operators by charging a fee rather than going for a tender which makes the operator to pay a licence fee in crores to bring their cabs to pick up passengers.

“The airport does not have its own transport policy for passengers who want to hire cabs from the arrival terminals. Only a premium operator with limited number of cabs has a counter at the terminal. Private airports have a fee system by which they allow multiple cab operators to pick passengers from terminals,” said an official.

The tender system might not be a good option because the operators might try to fix their terms and the licence fee proposed by AAI would not be viable for them, he said.

AAI held a meeting of cab operators in New Delhi to get feedback so that a tender can be floated to attract app-cabs at Chennai airport and other smaller airports. But the tender is yet to take off. All major airports in the country including AAI-run Kolkata airport has multiple cab operators. But in Chennai, it is a free for all and passengers are left to fend for themselves.

Thiruvananthapuram: Welcoming the Union government’s notification amending the commutation clauses with regard to employees’ provident fund ( EPF ) pension scheme , MP N K Premachandran said that the notification would be beneficial to cashew workers in the state.

The MP from Kollam had been raising his voice in the Parliament against ‘inhumane attitude’ of the EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation), which had been effecting a monthly cut on the pension in the name of commutation, ‘never restoring the reduced pension and continuing it for life’.

“Payment of full pension to pensioners after realization of full amount of commuted pension was a major demand in the private members’ resolution I presented in the 16th Lok Sabha,” Premachandran said in a statement. The workers had not been receiving even the minimum monthly pension of Rs 1,000 due to EPFO’s anti-workers’ policy, wherein it had been deducting from pension even after recovering manifold the amount the PF pensioners and subscribers received under commutation, he said.

As per government’s assurance (on the resolution) in December 2015, a high-level empowered monitoring committee was formed to review and revamp the employees’ pension scheme of 1995 and to consider other issues including pension enhancement. However, the MP had to raise the issue in the Parliament as there was delay in issuing notification.

Another major issue is the earlier amendment of 10 years of continuous service as 10 years of continuous contributory service, ‘which had ousted 90% of the cashew workers from the pension scheme, as they needed attendance of 3,650 days to be entitled to pension’, the MP said.

Now, with the amendment (reverting to 10 years of continuous service), pension of thousands of cashew workers has been restored, he said.

Speaking to TOI, scientists from ARIES said that annular solar eclipses are rare occurrences — which happen when the moon covers the sun's centre, leading to the formation of a “ring of fire” or annulus around the moon. “An eclipse of this magnitude will be witnessed in India for the first time after 1933. The eclipse can be witnessed for only about 30 seconds. However, this time, many parts of the country will be able to see almost 100% of the eclipse. In Nainital for instance, one will be able to see almost 99% of the eclipse,” SB Pandey, scientist at ARIES, told TOI.

He added that the institute is preparing to have a national-level outreach programme in the run-up to the eclipse. “Several scientists from across the country as well as neighbouring countries are expected to visit the institute on the day. We will release the details of the programme soon.”

The scientist further said that many places in the state like Dehradun and Tehri will also witness almost 100% of the eclipse.

As violence escalated and shops and homes were set ablaze just hundreds of metres away, young women formed a chain around the elderly. But that was not the only line of defence. Three human chains of mostly men, two string of police barricades and thick ropes tied around pillars were also put up as additional safeguards.

The air was still thick with black smoke and the smell of burned tyres, but the women did not mention the signs of violence. They, instead, dedicated the afternoon to “remembrance” of a time when they lived peacefully with their neighbours. Around 5pm, the crowd swelled up to thousands as more and more women left their houses to join the sit-in.

“This is not a time to allow communal sentiments to overwhelm our peaceful protest. All our children have grown up together in the same neighbourhood. We are sitting here to preserve that brotherhood,” said Ghuma, a woman in her early 20s.

The sit-in against CAA/NRC/NPR has, since Sunday, occupied a stretch under Jafrabad metro station. The signs of dissent are abundantly spread through the neighbourhood. Almost every shop’s shutters in the area have been spray-painted with slogans condemning the new citizenship law. There are banners on the dividers — maa aur mulk badal nahin sakte (you can’t change your mother and country) — reads one of them.

The women also had several complaints against the city administration and feared for their safety. “Police are supposed to make us feel safe, but they are instead supporting those who burn down our houses. We have no representation and nobody speaks for us. Why is the chief minister not here,” asked Nasreen.

About a kilometre away on the same main road, another group sat on sheets hurriedly spread out on the road. They occupied a stretch on Maujpur Chowk. A mic was arranged and a local made announcements to crowdsource a tent and food for the women. “We will not move unless Jafrabad is emptied out,” said a woman.

Occasionally, the group shouted provocative slogans, calling for the “traitors” to be shot. “Desh ke gaddaro ko,” echoed through the roads. “Kisko chahiye azadi. Hum de denge azadi (who wants freedom. We will give them freedom),” was another popular chant, so was “Humara yahi nara hai, Bharat desh humara hai.”

Although a string of barricades were put up between the two groups, distance was not the only factor separating them. The distrust for the other ran deeper than physical barriers. Rumours, fear mongering and misinformation was rampant. As a Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporter said, “We cannot live with those people anymore... But we have awakened now and we will teach them a lesson.”

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At a time when the state is heading for local body polls this year and assembly polls next year, the Congress in the state is facing severe infighting . If group wars used to be the issue till date, now the party is facing a new fight with the KPCC president on the one side and the group leaders on the other.

Now both the KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran and the group leaders have approached the party high command against each other.

The KPCC president has approached the high command for the leaders targeting him at the PAC meet, and the group managers have complained against the style of functioning of the party state president.

This infighting had come to the fore in the last political affairs committee (PAC) when the leaders targeted the KPCC president for his style of functioning. Irked over the criticisms, Ramachandran had approached the AICC leadership and emphasized that he would not convene the PAC anymore if the situation continues.

Ramachandran is adamant that the political affairs committee should not be a platform for character assassination. He was also irked over the way the leaders leaked the discussions of the PAC to the media.

Ramachandran informed the AICC leadership that he was being targeted since he was against MPs and MLAs being given party posts. However, the group managers are up in arms against the president over his lack of coordination with the senior leaders. “The KPCC president, the opposition leader and Oommen Chandy are the senior leaders heading the party in the state. There is a lack of coordination among the three. Then how will the party have an unanimous opinion on any issue,” said a senior party leader.

The PAC is the crucial body which decides on the policy of KPCC on all issues. If the KPCC president is unwilling to convene this, then how will the party function in the state, particularly when the elections are round the corner, asked a former KPCC president.

372,['24/02/2020'],"For radiographers, going to work is like courting cancer","This story is from February 24, 2020

Indore: Lack of safety measures against radiation kills — around two and a half dozen radiographers either retired or working at government health facilities across state had suffered from different types of cancer in last two decades.

Of the 29 cancer affected radiographers, 10 worked or are working at health facilities in Indore. The information was compiled by president of MP Radiographer’s Association Shivakant Vajpai. In last two decades five out of those 29 radiographers have died.

‘Radiation kills’, ‘safety first’ are just tagline that have been pasted on hospital corridors while the ground reality remained highly vulnerable for both lab technicians and patients. Experts alleged that directorate of radiation safety — the body that oversees safety measures in X-ray, CT Scan, radiation and sonography units of government health facilities — works only on paper.

Vajpai said, “Radiographers working at health facilities in state are at risk because the norms are not followed properly.” Radiographers suffered from various types of cancer including blood, liver, food pipe, lung, lymphoma, testes cancer, rectum cancer among others.

The number could be more than 29 because many radiographers couldn’t disclose about their disease to association members, said Vajpai. There was one radiographer named KC Jain, who was diagnosed with radiation dermatitis and he died a few years back, said Vajpai. His fingers were removed initially to prevent infection but later his left hand had to be cut off, said Vajpai.

For a radiographer, it has become a death trap — like a labourer in a mine — who knows that his job might kill him someday. Only here, proper safety measures can shield the radiation and reduce chances of cancer exponentially. But, there’s way only if there is will. And government clearly lacks the will to change the grim reality.

The radiographers, who were diagnosed with cancer mostly didn’t even get monetary support from government. However, in state like Kerala, government pays radiation allowance in their salary and one month leave is granted every year to radiographers for improvement in health. Government cancer hospital superintendent Dr Ramesh Arya said that excess and repeated exposure to radiation can cause cancer. Proper precautions should be taken during exposure to patient in X-ray, CT Scan, Cobalt machine and sonography machine, said Arya.

Children are more prone to get affected by such exposure. In MY Hospital, radiographers were provided TDL badges and other precautionary measures are followed, said Arya.

Even though there is no patient-based study on cause of cancer amongst these radiographers in state but various articles in journals across world put radiation as a major cause of cancer.

It is tough to establish direct cause of cancer among patient because it requires patient specific studies, said Vajpai. But major reason behind such high number of radiographers suffering from cancer in state is lack of precautionary measures.

There is lack of regular and strict monitoring in state as directorate of radiation safety had been working only on paper, said Vajpai.

CMHO Praveen Jadia said, “There should be regular monitoring of X-ray, CT Scan and Sonography machines installed at health facilities. TDL badges, which are provided to radiographers, are regularly monitored to avoid over-exposure.”

Whenever a new machine is installed, a team of AERB visits the facility and also in between for checking preventive measures taken at facility, added Jadia.

Hyderabad: Denizens identified more than 220 species of birds, at the 11th edition of the Hyderabad bird race where bird lovers from around the twin cities came together to spot and record avian species on Sunday.

""It is important for the younger generation to participate in activities like this, and indulge in nature and it is good to see novices experiencing bird watching on their own"" said P Raghuveer, vice chairman and managing director, Telangana State Forest Development Corporation (TSFDC).

""But it is also integral to the cause of bird conservation in our state that people constantly work towards improving the bird habitats for the birds residing here,” he added.

Around 18 teams comprising of 75 members with a huge number of first time birdwatchers participated in the dawn to dusk event organised by Deccan Birders in collaboration with Great Hyderabad Adventure Club (GHAC), and took to the landcapes across the city with their cameras and binoculars.

""I have been identifying and recording birds for quite some time now and even though more than 200 species were identified during the course of the event, the habitat destruction in our city is prevalent,” said Raghav S, who was participating in the event for the third time. “ With urbanisation of the city, habitats of the fauna is heavily disturbed. Throughout the day, along with looking for birds, we spent an ample amount of time coming up with ways to to preserve nature while making sure these beautiful avian creatures return to Hyderabad,” he added.

Most popular areas for bird watching were Ananthagiri Hills, Gandipet lake, Hussain Sagar, Manjeera Reservoir, Narsapur Forest Range and Himayat Sagar. Among the rare species which were spotted during the event were Indian Blue Robin, Ultramarine flycatcher, Eurasian Wryneck and Booted eagle. Experts said that the city lakes used to be a home for a lot of waders or shore birds, now the number has decreased drastically.

“Activities like these are important to inculcate in the people a sense of responsibility towards maintaining the environment in a good state and the protection of the other inhabitants of this earth and particularly the avifauna,” said Surekha Aitabathula, secretary, Deccan Birders.

Indore: Giving a shot in the arm to growing local plastic industry, Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology (CIPET) will soon start a centre in Indore to extend assistance to manufacturers with innovative research and technical support.

Central department of chemicals and petrochemicals secretary P Raghavendra Rao and CIPET director general Dr SK Nayak gave in-principle sanction to start the centre in Indore during a meeting with representatives of plastic product manufacturers on the sidelines of CIPET governing body meeting. Rao said that sanctions for starting the centre will be issued soon. He asked the representatives to contact MSME department for suitable land for the institute and necessary sanctions.

CIPET, a premier national institution under central ministry of chemicals & fertilizers, helps industries in skill development, technology support services, academics and research (STAR) in all domains of plastics, including design, tooling, mould manufacturing, plastics processing, testing and quality assurance.

As of now, CIPET operates from 37 locations spread across the country catering to the needs of polymer and allied industries, said Indian Plast Pack forum president Sachin Bansal.

“Indore has been the leading centre of plastic manufacturing in Madhya Pradesh. CIPET has a centre in Bhopal. The manufacturers had to approach Bhopal for assistance,” he said adding the new centre will also help growing plastic manufacturing industry in Pithampur.

Bansal, who was part of the delegation that met senior officials, said apart from the in-principle sanction, chemicals and petrochemicals department joint secretary Kashi Nath Jha has also promised sanction for necessary equipment and machines for start of the institute in Indore.

The civic body is implementing the Rs320 crore Smart City project across Pimple Gurav & Pimpri Saudagar

PUNE: Shifting utilities like water and drainage lines are proving to be the biggest challenge for the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( PCMC ), which is implementing the Rs 320 crore Smart City project across the twin suburbs of Pimple Gurav and Pimple Saudagar.

The two suburbs, earmarked for the city’s maiden Smart City project, have a cumulative spread of 5.08sqkm.

“We have to be extremely careful because there is only alternate day water supply in the city,” said Vijay Bhojane, the joint city engineer.

“These are old lines and they need to be relaid along the proposed cycle tracks and footpaths,” Bhojane added.

He said that parallel lines are being laid and when they are complete, the old lines will be either discontinued or networked, where necessary.

Both the suburbs have daily water supply ranging from 70 litres to 200 litres per person, depending on the geographical parameters like elevation, distance etc, thanks to the old lines that were laid a couple of decades ago. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation hopes that relaying of lines and connecting them to the smart network (the SCADA system) will ensure more equitable distribution in future.

The area-based development involves resurfacing of tar roads to concrete, paving cycle tracks and footpaths.

Bhojane, who is also the in-charge of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s Smart City project, said that all the elements of the road will be possible where the width is sanctioned at 18 metres. In 12-metre zone, it will only be concrete road.

The corporation has also planned a yoga park and butterfly park spread across an acre in Pimple Saudagar and Pimple Gurav, respectively.

The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will relay 44 road sectors – 18 in Pimple Gurav and 26 in Pimple Saudagar. The tender date for completion of the project is November 2021 (including monsoons).

The Army, which shares its boundaries with both the suburbs, has started barricading its area for the development work to commence even in sectors, where there are no roads.

Consulting firm, KPMG and Singapore-based industrial and infrastructure consulting firm Surbana Jurong is providing project management and design services for the Pimpri Chinchwad Smart City.

New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has issued a “stop-work” notice to the company constructing the parking-cum-commercial centre at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk for non-payment of the last two instalments, each amounting to Rs 150 crore.

Standing committee chairman Jai Prakash said, “According to the contract, the concessionaire was supposed to pay the amount in instalments to the civic body. However, despite our reminders, the last two instalments were not paid even after six months of the due date. We then decided to issue the stop-work order.”

The parking-cum-commercial centre is being constructed on 18,524 square metres at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore on a public-private partnership model. Of this, Rs 450 crore was to be given to the north corporation. The deadline to complete the structure is September 2020. It is estimated to have parking capacity for 2,400 cars and 81 tourist buses.

Jai Prakash said the civic agency is facing financial crisis, so a decision was taken to give its land for developing parking facilities on PPP model. “We want to improve civic services through the interest earned by our fixed deposits in banks. We have allocated various projects on the same concept in the past. However, if the purpose is not fulfilled, then there is no use leasing out our land,” he added.

One of the long-pending projects of the north corporation, it was conceived in 2013. However, construction started in March 2019 only after an order by Delhi high court.

The facility, an eight-storey building with three basements, will benefit traders in markets such as Chawri Bazaar, Kinari Bazaar, Khari Baoli, Nai Sadak and Dariba Kalan. Shoppers and tourists visiting the Walled City will also find space to park their vehicles in a neighbourhood where parking is a huge task. The basements will have parking facilities and public conveniences. The ground and upper floors will be used for parking and commercial purposes.

379,['24/02/2020'],"In 2 months, 73% applicants in Doon fail automated driving tests","This story is from February 24, 2020

Dehradun: Around 73% of those applying for driving licences (DLs) in Doon for four-wheelers, failed to pass the driving test on the new sensor-equipped automated test track set up in the city, reveals official data for the months of December 2019 and January 2020.

According to the data provided by the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Dehradun, 3,318 people failed the four-wheeler driving test among the 4,530 applicants of DLs who appeared for the test in the past two months. During this period, 1,755 people applied for two-wheeler DLs and among these, 851 (almost 45%) people failed the test.

Those seeking a new driving licence or renewal of the existing one, are required to reverse their car on an S-shaped bend and back their cars in one go as per the new test protocol. The two-wheeler drivers have to go around an 8-shaped loop without putting their legs down. The new pattern of tests gauges applicants on over 20 parameters that includes readings from sensors and camera-check on tracks to ensure and record the correct movement of the driver. The RTO has around five patterns to check the drivers of four-wheelers while three patterns are there for two-wheelers.

The new pattern of tests had started in the Jhajhra driving training and testing centre on July 15 last year.

Speaking on why so many people were not able to clear the driving tests, Arvind Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), told TOI that the automatic driving tests are designed in a way to ensure that only good drivers get DLs. “Those who fail the driving test can re-appear for it after a week of failing the test. Those who fail the test for the third time may re-appear after 60 days,” added Pandey.

The RTO official added that “automated driving tests are the need of the hour as fatal accidents are increasing in the hill state.” “The rate of failures was low in the earlier test because it was far too simple,” he said.

380,['24/02/2020'],Laxman says Cong should accept CAA,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Indore: Congress MLA Laxman Singh – Digvijaya Singh’s brother -- on Sunday said that his party should accept CAA as it was passed in Parliament by majority vote and states are bound by the parliamentary system to implement it. Congress called it his personal opinion.

Laxman, who was a BJP MP from 2004-2009 and rejoined Congress in 2013, said: “Adequate discussions have taken place on CAA. Adequate protests have been held. CAA has become a law. Majority in Parliament is required to change this law.”

Pointing out that Congress doesn’t have the numbers to change it, he told reporters in Indore that “it is fair to accept it”.

The Congress MLA from Chachoda seat in Guna district feels states will have to implement it. Asked about Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath’s announcement not to implement CAA in the state, Laxman said, “He (Nath) is saying that. But many are saying that it should be implemented. They will hold discussions.”

“I personally feel that when a law is framed for the country, you have to accept it. We (Congress) have framed several laws by making amendments when our government was in power. How would we have felt if the law cleared by us wasn’t implemented by states? Parliament is not owned by a party. Everybody has to agree to majority decision,” he said.

Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja said it was Laxman's ""personal statement"". ""Everybody has a right to freedom of speech. The party high command takes a decision on such issues. The party has decided that it is against CAA. Every party worker is following the decision across the country,"" he told TOI. Laxman was critical of state government’s plan to host IIFA 2020 awards at Daly College, his alma mater. “It is good that IIFA is being held. It will give opportunities of employment. But to hold it in a school is not justified,” he said. “It is examination time. For 10-15 days loud sound will be played; rooms will be converted to make-up rooms. Thus I have requested to change the venue.”

He also said that state government is planning to make gaushalas economically independent during a meeting held at Residency Kothi in Indore. TNN

KOZHIKODE: Indian Union Women’s League , the women’s wing of IUML , has filed a petition in the Supreme Court , challenging the constitutional validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 , which criminalizes triple talaq .

The petition filed by Noorbeena Rasheed, national general secretary of Indian Union Women’s League, states that the Act violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.

The petition, filed through advocate Zulfiker Ali P S, argued that the Act has introduced penal legislation, specific to a class of persons based on religious identity which can cause grave public mischief, which, if unchecked, may lead to polarization and disharmony in society. The petition said that by virtue of the SC order in the Shayara Bano case, the utterance of triple talaq is without legal sanction or effect.

“If the motive was to protect a Muslim wife in an unhappy marriage, no reasonable person can believe that the means to ensure it is by putting an errant husband in jail for three years and create a non-bailable offence for merely saying ‘TalaqTalaqTalaq’. The marriage survives, regardless of such utterance. It is difficult to imagine why the mere utterance of meaningless words should attract a three-year sentence for the husband,” the petition said.

It added that the intent behind the Act is not abolition of triple talaq but punishment of Muslim husbands. The petition said that that there was no benevolence or welfare apparent in the Act and added that protection of wives cannot be achieved by incarceration of husbands.tnn

Indore: Health minister Tulsiram Silawat on Sunday caught hold of a spade and jumped into a dirty nullah to clean it during his tour to Sanwer.

Clad in spic and span white kurta-pajama, the minister dug out dirt from the nullah and sewer lines to spread the message of cleanliness among people of his constituency.

He held a broom and cleaned the streets as people around cheered and later joined him in his efforts.

“I want citizens of Sanwer to take a pledge to keep city healthy, educated and clean,” Silawat said from a small podium erected on roadside.

Claiming that efforts were being made to make Sanwer an ideal city, the MLA said he had announced in 1980s that water from Narmada will be brought to Sanwer. The idea seemed farfetched at that time. But now, it is being realized.

“Soon people of Sanwer will get clean drinking water of Narmada,” he said.

He said funds have been sanctioned to construct internal roads of Sanwer and hospitals are being renovated.

He asked people of Sanwer to shun plastic and said that door-to-door campaign will be launched to distribute cloth bags to replace plastic bags.

SDM Ravish Shrivastava said 19 wards have been identified for the cleanliness campaign. Staff of different government departments was roped in to clean the city.

Nagpur: The BJP will stage an agitation at all tehsil offices against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Tuesday to protest its failure to provide relief to farmers, attacks on women and stoppage of development works.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that the government had promised a relief of Rs25,000 per hectare to farms and Rs50,000 per hectare to orchards for crop damage. “However, farmers are not even getting the relief sanctioned by the governor. Earlier, MVA leaders said that they would give a complete loan waiver to farmers but later put a cap of Rs2 lakh. The government has fooled the farmers and BJP will take it to task for that,” he added.

Bawankule claimed that crime had increased by 60% in the tenure of MVA as compared to the BJP government. “A young woman was torched in Hinganghat and a Prahar activist was shot dead in Akola. Such alarming incidents are taking place every day across the state,” he said.

Bawankule, who was energy minister for five years, lauded his successor Nitin Raut for proposing to provide free power to domestic consumers using less than 100 units. “It is unfortunate that finance minister Ajit Pawar is against this. We fully support Raut and this government should allocate the required funds from the budget so that he can fulfil his promise,” he said.

The ex-MLA praised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Population Register (NPR) but said that he should also pay attention to development of the state.

NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old man has been arrested for smashing a rock on the head of a woman. The woman was found unconscious in Bonta Park in north Delhi on Saturday. The man had also slashed a razor across his wrist after going back home.

Police said that the accused, Bilal, had attacked the woman as he was jealous that she was friendly with another man. Bilal had befriended the woman on Facebook. On one occasion he introduced her to another friend of his, Imran.

“Bilal started getting jealous as she started talking to Imran more than him. The two met at Bonta Park and Bilal saw Imran’s messages to her on her phone, which angered him,” said a police officer. When the woman snatched her phone back, the accused tried to strangle her, failing which he picked up a stone and hit her on her head multiple times. A passerby informed the cops about a woman lying unconscious in a park. Police said that she has gained consciousness now.

Bilal, a resident of Loni, returned to his house and slit his wrist. He was taken to a hospital by his family. He also suffers from polio. Police later arrested him from his house.

Kozhikode: Shaheen Bagh model agitations being staged by IUML leader M K Muneer is an insult to the original Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi, said CPM leader Elamaram Kareem , MP.

Inaugurating the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) organized by the SFI and the DYFI here on Sunday, he said the IUML platform is used only to heap slurs on chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The anti-CAA protests are the movement of all sections of the people in the country, especially the youth and students. By joining hands, the ruling party and opposition in Kerala showed the way to the whole country on staging protests against the CAA, Kareem said.

“But later, KPCC president said his party is not for joint agitation. Some political parties are threatening social organizations that have come forward for joint protests and certain communal organizations are trying to conduct separate agitations,” he added.

Such divisive moves will weaken the struggle that is based on secularism, Kareem said. “This will be beneficial for the RSS,” he said.

In her address, Aishe Ghosh, student of Jawaharlal Nehru University and the leader of the agitations in Delhi, said Kerala is an inspiration for the protests in other parts of the country.

“The government is unleashing a war against the students who are staging protests,” she said.

Nationalist Youth Congress met vice-chancellor SP Kane recently to apprise him of the problem

NAGPUR: Students, especially those coming from outside the city, have demanded toilet facility at Nagpur University exam section , where they have to spend several hours for their work during their visits.

The students and other visitors have been suffering at the section since July 31, 2017, when NU started a new facilitation centre at the entrance of the exam section. The centre has blocked the way to the existing toilets inside the exam section.

The entry was restricted even at the facilitation centre, with officials making it mandatory for all to give a ‘plausible reason’ for the visit before allowing them inside. Even those having work at the centre are not allowed in, unless they are carrying supporting documents for their work. The centre is run by private agency Promarc, and the space has been provided by NU to it at no cost, said students.

The restricted entry to the section has left students and even other visitors badly inconvenienced. As NU has affiliated colleges from as far as Wardha, Gondia and Bhandara, the exam section is a hotspot for daylong activity of visitors.

The section is located on LIT campus with plenty of open spaces on all its sides. While men have been relieving themselves in the open, women have no choice but to go out, said Nationalist Youth Congress ’s (NYC) Rahul Kamble, who led the students delegation to vice chancellor SP Kane last week.

Kamble said Kane assured to start construction of a new toilet on the open land in front of the exam section. “They have asked for one month. We will wait and then intensify our protest if the demand is not met,” he said.

Kamble said earlier people were allowed to use the toilets inside but that is no longer available.

NAGPUR: A study conducted by a Pune NGO that had many controversial conclusions about behaviour of doctors and pharma companies had created waves in December 2019. Indian Medical Association (IMA) had termed it defamatory.

Now, IMA Maharashtra president Dr Avinash Bhondwe, who hails from Pune, has claimed that the Maharashtra branch of IMA investigated this survey along with Maharashtra medical council (MMC) and found that the survey was not only unscientific but also fake.

“As the survey came from Maharashtra, the IMA state body decided to investigate it. We approached NGO ‘Sathi’ and asked them details about their research methodology and claims. Earlier, they were reluctant to share information. Later, they admitted they didn’t have enough details to support their claims,” said Dr Bhondwe while speaking to TOI on his maiden visit to Nagpur after becoming president of Maharashtra IMA.

“In a meeting with IMA officials, NGO representatives issued unconditional apology to us. Later, we demanded it in written form and they also issued a ‘clarification’ and not apology. We have that letter in our possession,” Dr Bhondwe claimed.

IMA Maharashtra’s internal publication, which is going to be released in March, will have all details of this case for the reference of doctors across the country, he added.

Dr Bhondwe was in the city to attend a state-level workshop on PC & PNDT Act at IMA Hall. He said that people level serious allegations on doctors these days. “It has become easy to level allegations and get away these days. We have strategically decided to deal with such allegations seriously now,” he said, adding that at least two political leaders have issued public apologies after IMA approached them regarding and proved that their allegations were false.

Dr Arun Gadre from NGO Sathi accepted that he has given a clarification to IMA. “I issued clarification to IMA that since study was qualitative, no names were asked and not any name was given. Trends were asked for and report contains categories of trend in the field,” he said.

Nagpur: One of the senior most medical practitioners of the region and a dedicated philanthropist, Dr Fazal , passed away on Monday morning after a brief illness. He was 95. He was a resident of Mahdi Bagh colony.

A former civil surgeon in Madhya Pradesh, Dr Fazal had been practicing in the city for around 50 years. He was the grandfather of international cricketer and Vidarbha captain Faiz Fazal. He is survived behind his wife, two sons, a daughter, grandchildren, great grandchildren and innumerable friends and admirers.

He was a senior vice president of Indian Medical Association and was closely associated with several leading medical bodies. During his 72 years of practice, Dr Fazal served five generations of people across India. He was a dedicated philanthropist and known as the ‘people’s doctor’ in local circles for not only waiving his fees but also providing free medicines to hundreds of needy patients.

In his 22-year stint in villages of India, he performed unusual medical feats such as removing a 70-pound ovarian tumour, a record number of hysterectomies, resection of intestine and anastomosis, including peptic ulcer surgeries without regular anaesthetist, and removing 18 fibroids from the uterus of a 27-year-old woman who later conceived because hysterectomy was avoided. He performed surgeries of all sorts even at the age of 95.

A man of many skills and uncommon grit, Dr Fazal played cricket and golf even at the age of 90. A deeply spiritual person, he spent his free time translating and typing religious texts from Arabic and Urdu for the sake of the younger generation in his Mahdi Bagh colony. At the age of 92, he braved the odds and undertook pilgrimages to remote and strife-torn areas. He was conferred with very high spiritual honours by three successive generations of spiritual masters who had great admiration and respect for his services.

A lover of poetry, music and literature, he was a regular at poetry sessions and qawaalis in and around Nagpur. He had also acquired remarkable IT skills in his nineties.

The medical, literary and social circles of Nagpur expressed deep sorrow on his passing away.

NAGPUR: Reality in Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370 that ended the special status it enjoyed was effectively portrayed in Hindi play titled ‘Kisht Bahar’, staged by Tanmayee Bahuddeshiya Shikshan Sanstha at Scientific Society Hall, on Friday.

The story revolves around the family of Bhatt, living in Kishtwar region, with wife Sandhya, daughter Aashu and son Sanjeet.

Written by Salim Sheikh, the story highlights the incidents of terrorist groups circulating fake news on social media of how people of the country were talking rubbish about girls and women in Kashmir and making them believe that what they saw was real. These anti-national elements provoked youngsters and forced them to join terror activities.

The play mentioned Article 370, troops deployed by the government, and terrorists talking of freeing Kashmir for which they incite people in the valley.

Aashu (Ayesha Sheikh) gets injured in stone pelting by divisive forces, but soldiers of the Indian Army ensure she get timely medical treatment. Her brother Sanjeet (Aadesh Jamnik) was one of the stone pelters indulging in unlawful activities.

Sanjeet later comes in contact with Gilani (Parikshit Harsole), a respected politician in the region. Sanjeet did not know that he was the mastermind behind many terror attacks. Gilani provokes youngsters to take part in the fight for freedom to Kashmir.

One day, a soldier comes to the residence of Bhatt (Salim Sheikh) to enquire about the health of Aashu where he finds Sanjeet’s actions suspicious. Investigations reveal the stone pelters were hiding at a place. When Army officials go there, they find a known political leader Gilani and return without carrying out search operations.

The soldier again goes to the residence of Bhatt, looking for Sanjeet. But his mother Sandhya (Sanyukta Thorat) lies that he is studying in his room though she knew that he was roaming around.

As curfew is imposed to rein in ultras, people have to stay indoors for days together. It was during this time Sandhya realizes that her son was involved in terrorist activities. She cries and tells her husband that Sanjeet had made a terrible mistake.

After some days, Aashu and Sandhya go to a hospital though curfew was in place. On their return, Bhatt finds that his daughter’s vision is lost forever. He is shattered to know Anshu has become blind.

Sanjeet then finds that it was the handiwork of the terror group he was associated with that made his sister blind. He realizes his mistake of indulging in nefarious acts and returns to the family.

Director and actors did justice to the theme of the play.

One of the women claimed that since no one from the government had bothered to come forward for a dialogue on the issue, they had chosen to go the Shaheen Bagh way and blocked the road. “Har jagah Shaheen Bagh banaenge,” she said.

Around 11pm, some 500 women gathered under Jafrabad Metro station Gate No. 1 and squatted on the road. Police arrived soon and asked them to disperse, but in less than an hour, more people, including men and children, joined in.

Even as paramilitary forces were deployed, the numbers kept swelling and, by Sunday morning, nearly a thousand people, according to some estimates, had gathered.

The scene was similar to Shaheen Bagh in more ways than one: as dadis of the crowd mobilised opinion against CAA, some locals took upon themselves to distribute tea, fruits and other eatables for free. The protesters set up tables and tied them together to make a stage, but it was eventually removed by police.

Farheen Firoz, an MA student, told TOI: “For over two months now, people have been sitting at Shaheen Bagh and even Seelampur. We are here to show solidarity with them. We want the government to hear us out. The home minister and the Prime Minister are saying different things ... how do we know what to believe? This is not a fight for Muslims, it is a fight for secularism.”

Close by, some people raised a banner that read “February 23 Bharat bandh ko safal karein”. Some women offered “namaz” in one corner, while others walked past waving the Tricolor. “We support our Dalit brothers ... We are also against CAA and NRC. For 45 days, we have protested peacefully. But no one listened to us. We need a Shaheen Bagh at every corner, so that the government knows our pain,” Nazia, a resident of Seelampur, said.

Barely a few metres from the metro station, there was another island of protesters. They, too, raised anti-CAA slogans. With the passage of time, though, the crowed thinned out.

Visakhapatnam: In good news for the city’s road safety situation, the incidence of motorists being caught driving without valid licences have come down. Recent data indicate that only five to eight per cent of those caught for violation of traffic rules were not carrying their driving licenses.

This, according to the police, is a major drop from earlier when 15-20% of all traffic violators were caught without their driving licences. Police sources say that most of those caught without driving licences are college students. Police claim that instances of people driving without licences have come down significantly over the last one year.

Over 3,000 motorists get held up for checks in a day in the city. Police either issue challans to them or enquire about their pending challans. During such routine checks, police have found that only 5-8% of violators are driving without licence .

Interestingly, the percentage comes down further among those held for driving under the influence of alcohol. Only 1-2% of those who were held up for driving under the influence were not carrying driving licences, informed ACP (traffic) MRK Raju.

Meanwhile, traffic police inspector T Raju said that driving licenses have also been suspended in some cases where motorists have been found driving under the influence, beyond speed-limits or have not renewed their licences.

Road Transport Authority (RTA) officials have suspended nearly 500 driving licenses in the last month in Visakhapatnam. Most common traffic violations are driving under the influence of alcohol, which comprises nearly 50% of all violations, rash driving, driving while speaking on the phone.

The recent Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act proposes to increase the fine from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 for driving without a valid licence. A senior police officer said, “We are planning to increase drives against people driving without licences. It’s mostly college students on bikes who are doing this.”

Visakhapatnam: Andhra University is in the race to get a Technology Innovation Hub under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems (NM-ICPS). The varsity has sent proposals to the tune of Rs 115 crore for the hub under the theme ‘Technologies for Internet of Things and Everything’, which also involves artificial intelligence and machine learning. The varsity also submitted data and details pertaining to its industry partners, international collaborations, startup ecosystem, research and development infrastructure and etc to the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) as part of the application process for the hub.

According to SERB norms, the host institutes of the hubs should be ranked below 50 in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and be a reputed academic and R&D institution.

While the varsity stood 29th in the overall institutions category in the NIRF 2019 ranking, it bagged 16th rank among all the Indian universities. On the other hand, the varsity has sent research proposals worth crores to the department of science and technology, Indian Council of Social Science Research, naval research board and other bodies overseeing research activities.

According to the AU officials, the varsity’s notification for recruitment of 40 post-doctoral fellows has drawn nearly 350 applications. “Officials from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the varsity will jointly conduct the interviews, which will be video-recorded, in March and April months. The varsity has got Rs 100 crore under the RUSA scheme. Apart from other developmental activities, the varsity has proposed to take 100 post-doctoral fellows and 200-300 PhD students with a focus on improving research. Each post-doctoral fellow will get about Rs 1 lakh monthly stipend,” said a varsity official.

Andhra University has already floated a special purpose vehicle — AU RISE — to utilise the Rs 100 crore RUSA grant. While 85% of the grants will be spent on infrastructure, research and faculty improvement, 15% funds will be earmarked for entrepreneurship, innovation and employability. The other initiatives proposed with the RUSA funds are an international MBA programme, collaborations with premier national institutions like IITs and central universities, minor research projects for faculty members with a cap of Rs 10-20 lakh.

Flame and smoke are seen during Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip. (Reuters)

JERUSALEM: The Israel military said early Monday that it struck Palestinian militants targets in Gaza and Syria in response to rockets fired toward southern Israel on Sunday evening, hours after Israel said it killed a Palestinian militant who tried to place a bomb along the Israel-Gaza barrier fence.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group claimed responsibility for the rocket barrages. Palestinians were furious over the image of the man's lifeless body dangling off the front of an Israeli bulldozer that crossed into Gaza to retrieve it. There was also criticism in Gaza of the territory's Hamas rulers for not responding.

The Israeli military reported air raid sirens throughout southern Israel and said at least 20 rockets had been fired. There were no reports of damage or injuries on the Israeli side, but it was the heaviest barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip in several months. Air raid sirens continued into the evening, and Israel's Home Front Command ordered the suspension of classes in Israeli schools in southern Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip on Monday and prohibited large gatherings.

In response to the rocket fire, the Israeli military said aircraft struck ``dozens of Islamic Jihad terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip`` and a facility belonging to the militant group outside Damascus .

The Gaza health ministry reported that four Palestinians were treated at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City for wounds caused by the Israeli strikes.

Israel and the Islamic Jihad group engaged in a heavy round of fighting last November after the Israeli military killed a top Islamic Jihad commander.

Since then, Israel and Gaza's more powerful Hamas group have been working through Egyptian mediators to cement an informal cease-fire. But Islamic Jihad has continued to try to carry out attacks.

Islamic Jihad said the man killed along the border was a militant. Israel said the man was planting explosives along the border fence. Amateur video on Palestinian social media showed an Israeli bulldozer crossing into Gaza and then lifting up his body.

Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, accused the Israeli military of abusing the dead body, saying that it ``bears the consequences of the ugly crime.''

The military said it was removing the body in a way that prevented further danger to those around.

But the images generated widespread anger in Gaza, where it was seen as a provocation and violation of Islamic principles that call for respect for the dead.

It also sparked criticism of Hamas on social media, with people accusing the group of appearing weak and allowing Israel to operate with impunity inside Gaza's territory. One image on social media showed a picture of Jesus draped with a Palestinian flag hanging off the front of a bulldozer.

Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett rejected the criticism, noting that Hamas has been holding the bodies of two Israeli soldiers since they were killed in the 2014 Gaza war.

``I back the military, which killed the terrorists and collected the body,'' he said. ``That's what should be done and that is what was done.''

The incident comes amid a relative lull along the security fence separating Israel from Gaza. Last week, Israel announced it would provide hundreds of additional work permits for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in a new step aimed at solidifying an informal cease-fire with the Hamas.

Tens of thousands of Gazans used to work in Israel. But Israel virtually sealed the border when it joined Egypt in imposing a crippling blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power in the strip from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The blockade, along with three wars between Hamas and Israel, has devastated the economy in Gaza, where unemployment is over 50%.

BENGALURU: Public-sector entity Indian Bank has decided to stop loading its ATMs with Rs 2,000 notes, citing customer preferences. According to RBI data, Indian Bank had nearly 4,000 ATMs across India as of December 2019.

Indian Bank said it had a recurring problem with on-site ATMs (those located within a bank's branch).

""Customers would step into the branch as soon as they withdrew cash from the ATM, asking for Rs 2,000 notes to be exchanged for notes of smaller denomination. They were just crowding our branches with long queues. So, we have decided to do away with Rs 2,000 notes,"" said an Indian Bank official.

Of Indian Bank's 3,988 ATMs across India, 3,289 ATMs were on-site and 699 off-site. Going forward, Indian Bank ATMs will have only Rs 100, Rs 200 and Rs 500 notes.

On whether this move would continue after the merger with Allahabad Bank , Indian Bank officials said that it would depend on what the merged entity decides.

Dabbiru Harish feeds stray dogs during his biking expedition from India to Nepal to raise awareness about dogs... Read More

Visakhapatnam: Dabbiru Harish embarked on his first biking expedition across south India last year to spread awareness about road safety. It was then that he came to know that hundreds of animals die in road accidents every year. In course of his ride, he witnessed a baby elephant get hit by a truck. He also saw a number of dogs lying dead on the roads.

That experience gave the 23-year-old Harish to take up his next ride themed around the message of saving animals. Harish and 28-year-old Goppu Chandra Sekhar went on an expedition from Visakhapatnam to Nepal. Titled ‘Asian Glimpse’, the biker-duo covered 4,500km across six states spreading the message that more needs to be done to ensure safety of animals on roads.

In course of their ride, they met people from Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim, West Bengal as wells as Nepal. To them, they conveyed the necessity of saving animals. The entire expedition took 15 days to complete. Harish said that they also stopped to feed stray dogs around the places they were travelling.

“We met people from different cultures, languages. When we reached Chilka Lake, we went for a boat-ride where we spotted different migratory birds. We also spoke to fishermen about the threat plastic poses to marine life,” added Harish.

He further said that he saw more than 30 dogs lying dead on roads during the expedition. Now, the bikers are planning to cover the Golden Quadrilateral.

406,['24/02/2020'],Rly plans to start new Vizag-Araku tourist train,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Visakhapatnam: A dedicated regular train between Visakhapatnam and Araku Valley is likely to be on track soon. This, if it becomes a reality, will be the first tourism project under the aegis of South Coastal Railway (SCoR) which is slated to begin operations from the upcoming financial year.

The possibility of this project depends on two factors. First, if Visakhapatnam becomes the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh and second, if Visakhapatnam becomes the zonal headquarters of SCoR.

Currently, tourists are dependent on the 58501/58502 Visakhapatnam to Kirandul passenger train to go to Araku from the city. During the peak season, the railways run special trains from Visakhapatnam to Araku to meet the rush.

However, railway sources have indicated that authorities have in-principle decided to run a regular train from Visakhapatnam to Araku soon. DVM Reddy, the Visakhapatnam divisional manager of Andhra Pradesh tourism development corporation (APTDC) said that a regular train from Visakhapatnam to Araku will be a welcome step.

“Once the train is operational, we will ask the railways to allocate one or more coaches to APTDC which we will include in our tourism packages. We will pay the passenger fee directly to the railways,” Reddy said, while adding that APTDC has been asking for a regular train along this route since 2002.

A senior railway official told TOI that the announcement of a new train from Visakhapatnam to Araku will come along with the announcement of five Vistadome coaches. Right now, the existing Vistadome coach is connected to the Kirandul passenger train. The new train will have all Vistadome coaches, he added.

Visakhapatnam: With the Indian Railways planning to introduce ‘tourist-special’ trains with Vistadome coaches from Visakhapatnam to Araku Valley, travel agents and environmentalists are now asking the state government to upgrade the tourist infrastructure in the area as well as the entire state.

Speaking to TOI, Sohan Hatangdi, a city-based environmentalist said, “The heart of the (Araku) Valley is located within two to three kilometres from the railway station. This locale is extremely congested and there is no proper recreation for tourists. Decongesting the area should be the prime focus.”

Congestion in the valley’s downtown area, potholes on main roads, lack of displays in the tribal museum, an inadequate solid waste management system and mosquitoes have remained active concerns of tourists for quite some time.

Hatangdi further said that private hotels in the area lack proper waste management systems and dump their waste on the road in front of the hotel. “As a result, the roads don’t remain conducive for tourists wishing to take a stroll at night. Even walking on roads in Araku makes you face the wrath of mosquitoes,” he added.

According to Hatangdi, the area near the tribal museum is another problem. The area, he says, doesn’t have adequate displays. The environmentalist is of the opinion that if the railways are planning to introduce tourist special trains to Araku, then the infrastructure too should get an upgrade.

Travel agents, on the other hand, want Railways to change the train schedule. According to them, tourists visiting Visakhapatnam prefer to travel to Araku first and then visit the city. But the train with the Vistadome coach starts at 06:30am and tourists are compelled to stay a day in Visakhapatnam, a travel agent said.

LONDON: The US government and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will face off on Monday in a London courthouse, a decade after WikiLeaks infuriated US officials by publishing a trove of classified military documents . A judge at Woolwich Crown Court will begin hearing arguments from lawyers for US authorities , who want to try Assange on espionage charges that carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.

The extradition hearing follows years of subterfuge, diplomatic dispute and legal drama that have led the 48-year-old Australian from fame as an international secret-spiller through exile inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London to incarceration in a UK prison.

Assange has been indicted in the US on 18 charges over the publication of classified documents. Prosecutors say he conspired with US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. US authorities say WikiLeaks’ activities put American lives in danger. Assange argues he was acting as a journalist and says the leaked documents exposed US military wrongdoing.

BENGALURU: Sports lifestyle brand Puma has seen its sales grow 22% to Rs 1,413 crore for the 12 months ending December 2019. The growth was aided by increasing sales to women customers and higher demand in tier-2 towns across the country despite a slowing economy.

The German multinational has roped in a slew of brand ambassadors like Virat Kohli and Mary Kom over the last few years. It expects to continue a similar growth momentum of over 20% this year even as it faces increasing competition from relatively newer entrants like Under Armour and Skechers. ""India is a strategic market for Puma. The growing sportswear market, coupled with the country's aspirational youth, poses a huge opportunity for us to tap into,"" Bjorn Gulden, global CEO of Puma, told TOI .

He added that globally it has also been a record year for the brand with revenues of 5.5 billion euros.

""Being the No.1 brand in India is a reflection of how well we understand our consumers and how pleased they are with our products."" Puma wants to double down on India, with plans to open about 20 exclusive stores in an existing network of 373 across the country. Puma was one of the first major brands to actively tap the online retail sales route on Flipkart and Amazon India. This channel accounted for around 29% of sales in 2019, compared to 24% in 2018. Puma's India MD Abhishek Ganguly sees this number stabilising at about 30%.

What has significantly been increasing sales for Puma is its business in tier-2 and -3 towns as it contributes 48% of the total online channel in 2019 from just 15% in 2015. These smaller towns - like Jalandhar, Bhopal and Nashik - also contributed 40% of the total offline sales in 2019 as compared to 22% in 2015. The competition in the segment is set to increase as Under Armour has opened 10 stores in India.

412,['24/02/2020'],"2,000-year-old Pavuralakonda heritage site lies in state of neglect","This story is from February 24, 2020

Visakhapatnam: A group of around 20 trekking enthusiast medical students and doctors were in for a shock on Sunday morning when they climbed the hilltop Buddhist heritage site of Pavuralakonda near Bheemunipatnam only to be greeted by hundreds of broken alcohol bottles and plastic litter around the ruins of the 2,000-year-old Buddhist site .

At a time when the government has been talking about restoration and conservation of heritage sites like Thotlakonda, Bavikonda and Bojjanakonda, the Pavuralakonda site dating back to third and second century BCE seems to be completely forgotten.

Vivek Rathod from the Junior Chamber International (JCI), who organised Sunday’s trek, said the ancient Buddhist monastic complex lacks even a signage explaining its significance. “Forget security staff, there is not even a gate, proper fencing or approach road. The site lies completely neglected and is overgrown with weeds. Anti-social elements and drunkards seem to have made it their home. There are a few 17th century Dutch bungalows atop the hill which have been renovated, but the Buddhist relics like the ruins of stupas, circular chaityas, staircases, foundations of viharas lie in a shambles,” Rathod said.

Heritage narrator Jayshree Hatangadi, who is also a member of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), said neglect of the ancient site is an insult to the state’s heritage.

“We have beach patrol these days and protecting historic sites from hooligans are aspects that the police should take care of. The government seems to be only doing lip service about the proposed Buddhist corridor. There is no board, no signage explaining the significance of the sites nor is there any conservation and renovation work,” Jayshree fumed.

When contacted, additional director of state archaeology department S Venkat Rao said the roads and buildings department plans to construct a 1.5km motorable road from the beach road which will connect the hilltop site.

“Once the road is laid, we can undertake restoration works at the site. Since no security staff has been allocated to my department to guard Pavuralakonda site, we will send a complaint to the Bheemili police and request them to patrol and prevent anti-social elements from using the ancient heritage site for drinking or other illegal activities,” he told TOI.

(With inputs from Mayukh Sengupta)

KOLKATA: A cop initiative to teach pool car owners and drivers to become responsible citizens ended up in the men in uniform being informed about some home truths by pool car owners, who openly admitted that very few drivers stick to safety, security and maintenance norms. The latter added that they would not be able to change the situation until they are allowed to raise the fees per student.The Bidhannagar Commissionerate had invited some 300-odd pool car owners from Salt Lake, Baguiati, Lake Town, New Town and areas surrounding airport for a day-long sensitization programme in the backdrop of the death of a Class-II student, Rishav Singh from Howrah, following a week-long struggle at SSKM Hospital after a pool car with 15 students travelling at a speed of 90kmph fell in a ditch beside Delhi Road on February 14. Rishav and another boy were admitted to the hospital where Rishav died of multi-organ failure on Saturday.However, at the sensitization programme, the pool car owners tried to defend themselves by saying that they carry excess number of students against the rulebook just to stay afloat in the competitive market.The one-and-a-half-hour programme at a banquet hall off VIP Road was attended by senior officers of Bidhannagar Commissonerate along with the officer-in-charge of all traffic guards under the commissionerate. The officers first showed a power point presentation to the pool car owners, highlighting their laxities and the areas they need to work on and then they addressed the issues in details to the drivers and owners. However, right after the meeting, the drivers told TOI as well as to some officers in person that the guidelines are difficult to meet.“The cops are asking us to leave our Maruti Omni cars and shift to a larger and safer vehicle. But we don’t earn enough to invest in another car now. Further, the cops have been constantly stressing on limiting the number of kids in the car. In order to do that, we need to increase the fees per kid, which the guardians will not agree to,” said Asish Ghosh, a pool car owner and driver.Another pool car owner, Manoj Debroy, said: “The cops are asking us to depute experienced drivers are also saying that we cannot club students of multiple schools together. But if we don’t do that, we cannot make enough profit to sustain the business. Further, we will have to shell out more to hire an experienced driver.”The cops, however, said they were following a two-pronged approach in which they would also conduct sensitization sessions at various schools and with guardians’ forums. “First, we are trying to sensitize and persuade the drivers and owners to stick to the norms set by the school education department and by us. The next step will be execution in which we will start prosecuting the owners and drivers who will not stick to guidelines,” said Dhritiman Sarkar, DC (traffic) of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.Sarkar added the commissionerate’ also plans to paste cop helpline numbers on every pool car.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74275120,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-916981,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-pool-car-owners-want-fee-hike-to-make-drivers-toe-the-line/articleshow/74275105.cms
414,['24/02/2020'],Mobile phone services restored as Afghan truce holds,"This story is from February 24, 2020

KABUL: Mobile phone services were restored across swathes of Taliban-contested areas of Afghanistan over the weekend as a partial truce with the militants held for a second day. The Taliban, US and Afghan forces are currently overseeing a week-long “reduction in violence” that kicked off on Saturday.

The commitment has seen fighting drop dramatically and is set to pave the way for an American withdrawal deal to be signed later this week.

There have been reports of small clashes in rural areas, but no major attacks that have long defined the conflict have erupted. “In general we do see a reduction in violence,” acting interior minister Masood Andrabi said.

The lull in violence allowed telecom operators to begin restoring networks across the country that have long been hampered by fighting. “Around 730 cell towers have restarted,” said Naqeebullah Sailab, vice chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Afghanistan. “There are towers which started operating after almost five years.” Two separate officials with knowledge of the country’s telecoms industry in northern Afghanistan also confirmed that mobile networks were being restored in insurgent-hit areas.

The Taliban have long targeted Afghanistan’s private telecom firms, kidnapping engineers, destroying transmission masts and forcing regular coverage blackouts in volatile areas to avoid detection of their fighters. Afghanistan boasts millions of mobile users in a population of 30 million, with the fast-growing industry employing around 200,000 people and earning strong revenue in an otherwise moribund economy. Thousands of telecommunication towers, however, are in insurgency-hit areas and vulnerable to attacks.

The partial truce is expected to set the conditions for Washington and the insurgents to sign a deal in Doha on February 29 that could, ultimately, pull US troops out after more than 18 years and launch war-weary Afghanistan into an uncertain future.

Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg welcomed a nine-year-old boy on stage at a rally in Denver, Colorado, on Saturday night after the young boy asked the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for help coming out as gay. “Would you help me tell the world I’m gay too,” the boy wrote in a pre-submitted question that was read to Buttigieg. “I want to be brave like you.”

Buttigieg, who is the first major openly gay presidential candidate, was momentarily speechless. The crowd, numbering in the thousands, started to cheer “love is love,” as the boy, Zachary , was brought onto the stage. “Well, I don’t think you need a lot of advice from me,” Buttigieg told Zachary. “You seem pretty strong to me. It took me a long time to figure out how to tell even my best friend that I was gay.”

Buttigieg, who was then joined on stage by his husband, Chasten , didn’t come out as gay until his 30s, during his first term as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. “It won’t always be easy, but that’s OK because you know who you are,” Buttigieg told Zachary. “And that’s really important because when you know who you are, you have a centre of gravity that can hold you together when all kinds of chaos is happening around you.”

Buttigieg also lauded young Zachary’s courage, telling him others might decide “they can be a little braver because you have been brave... I want you to know even if I can’t promise it’ll always be easy, I can promise you that I’m going to be rooting for you.” The rally was Buttigieg’s first stop after Nevada ’s caucuses on Saturday in which he finished third.

418,['24/02/2020'],"Sanders wins Nevada caucus, takes lead in Democratic race","This story is from February 24, 2020

LAS VEGAS: Broad-based support across age, racial and ideological groups propelled Bernie Sanders to a dominant victory in Nevada ’s Democratic caucuses, tightening his grip on the front-runner spot in the race to find a challenger to President Donald Trump .

Joe Biden, a former vicepresident, appeared headed to a badly needed second-place finish in Nevada after poor showings earlier this month in the first two nominating contests in the Democratic presidential race ahead of the November 3 election. Sanders’ triumph on Saturday in the first racially diverse state in the campaign suggested he was reaching a broader coalition of Democratic voters with his unapologetic message of social and economic justice, including his signature pledge to provide universal healthcare for all Americans.

For Biden and other moderates who argue Sanders is too liberal to beat Trump and who have been trying to blunt his momentum, however, the Nevada results made the job much harder. “We have put together a multi-generational, multiracial coalition that is going to not only win in Nevada, it’s going to sweep the country,” Sanders, a US senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist, told cheering supporters in Texas .

He then turned his attention to Trump. “We are going to win across the country because the American people are sick and tired of a president who lies all of the time,” he said. Trump speaking to reporters said Nevada was a “great win” for Sanders, adding that he did not care who his opponent would be.

By Sunday morning, with 50% of the precincts reporting, Sanders had 47% of the county convention delegates in Nevada. Biden was a distant second to Sanders with 19%, but ahead of former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg , in third place with 15%. “The press is ready to declare people dead quickly, but we're alive and we're coming back and we're gonna win,” Biden told supporters in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

In a pre-recorded interview set to air on Sunday on CBS, Biden said he was confident he could win the next contest on Saturday in South Carolina with support from African-Americans, according to a transcript. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had been looking to jump-start her campaign after poor finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire , trailed in a disappointing fourth place with 10% in Nevada. Senator Amy Klobuchar and activist billionaire Tom Steyer were well back at 5% and 4%, respectively.

The race now begins to broaden across the country, with the South Carolina primary followed closely by the Super Tuesday contests in 14 states on March 3 that pick more than one-third of the pledged delegates who will help select a Democratic nominee. The Super Tuesday states will be the first nominating contests for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not been competing in the four early voting states but had been rising in opinion polls

That resulted in the large number of offenders being prosecuted during the midnight raid. From now on, we will organise more late-night naka checks, especially against rash driving by two-wheelers and drink driving,” said a senior Kolkata Police officer.Of the 1,495 bikers who were prosecuted, 986 were not wearing helmets and 509 were triple-riding.

The officers even raided hideouts of offenders based on intelligence inputs and set up naka posts across the city.“It is a sustained but impromptu drive which will be taken up often. Nabbing some of the known criminals as preventive arrest is also a part of the drive,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.During the surprise raids, police also raided some hotels, night clubs and illegal liquor dens, arrested 31 trouble-mongers and seized around 305 litres of illegal liquor.

424,['24/02/2020'],"Houses, shops set ablaze as Trinamool man dies","This story is from February 24, 2020

Jalpaiguri: Hours after a Trinamool Congress activist died in hospital on Saturday following an attack, suspected party workers went on the rampage at Churabhandar in Maynaguri in this north Bengal district setting ablaze 10 houses and some shops on Sunday evening.

Around 20 BJP supporters were said to be injured in the attack at Churabhandar, which is said to be a saffron-party stronghold where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a rally on February 8, 2019.

Trinamool activist Bhombal Ghosh (34) was hacked on February 14, allegedly by BJP workers, and he died at North Bengal Medical College Hospital (NBMCH) on Saturday evening. Police said Ghosh had suffered a severe head injury.

A BJP worker, Tapas Roy, was arrested on Sunday, and police have filed an FIR against 15 men, including a Tripura Police personnel.

BJP workers alleged that the attack on the houses of party workers started in the presence of police after Roy’s arrest.

Violence broke out after Ghosh’s body was brought to Churabhandar from NBMCH, and Trinamool functionaries, alleged BJP activists, delivered a virulent speech against BJP blaming its workers for the death.

Later, Trinamool supporters put up a blockade in the area preventing police from reaching the trouble spot.

Trinamool Youth Congress district president Saikat Chatterjee ruled out the involvement of his party workers in any violence. He said it was the result of an internal feud in BJP.

BJP’s Shyam Pradhan, however, said Ghosh was killed due to infighting in Trinamool and saffron-party workers were subsequently implicated in the murder.

Jalpaiguri SP Abhishek Modi said a strong police force has been deployed to control the situation.

The department has, however, stopped elephant safari in the park till Thursday to keep a watch on kunki elephants vaccinated over fears of an anthrax outbreak.

“The department needs to identify the disease and take measures at the earliest,” said environmentalist Shyama Prasad Pandey of Society for Protecting Ophiofauna and Animal Rights.

426,['24/02/2020'],Abbey?! Em Ledu: This comedy-of-errors makes for a fun watch,"This story is from February 24, 2020

Play: Abbey?! Em Ledu

Director: Vinay Varma

Written by: Sankaramanchi Parthasarathy

Cast: V Kiran Kumar, Deepika Mahidara, Hrudai Raghav, Shyam Krishna Govindh, Zaheer Ahmed, Rahul C, Surya G

Duration: 45 minutes

Language: Telugu

Rating: 3/5

Plot: V Kiran Kumar’s Shankar Rao was trying to have a peaceful weekend at home. Having lost a valuable ring, his wife, Deepika (played by Deepika Mahidara) disrupts his relaxed mood. Shankar is quick to suspect their deaf and ill cook, Satti Babu, who his wife treats like a sibling. Shankar sends his wife away to visit a few relatives and promises to find her lost ring. In the meantime, Shankar’s boss drops by and the duo decide to have fun. After the party starts, two thieves break into the house and a sequence of confusion and chaos ensues.

Review: The play opens in Shankar Rao’s living room and most of it takes place there itself. Shankar’s interactions with his wife, Deepika and boss, Gangadharan, fail to entertain at first. But the play soon takes an interesting turn with the entry of the thieves, Ram and Vasu. While V Kiran Kumar, Deepika Mahidara and Rahul C as Vasu are decent enough in their roles, Zaher Ahmed as Ram and Hrudai Raghav as Satti Babu are impressive. However, Shyam Krishna Govindh’s character, Gangadharan, is a letdown. His dialogues are riddled with clichés, like the overused enda guruvayurappa. His dialogue delivery could use some work as well. But the writer Sankraramanchi Parthasarathy has to be commended for making the audience laugh, even in a low comedy play like this. Minimalist lighting and the sounds used during some key scenes added to their effectiveness. The play was executed with minimal errors by the cast and makes for a good watch.

Verdict: This is Sutradhar’s first attempt at a Telugu play and they sure did pack a punch. However, while the play in itself was entertaining, there is still scope for improvement and areas they can work on as a unit. The writing and dialogue delivery, in particular, can be improved. Better lighting could have enhanced the visual appeal of this play as well. But having said that, an excellent cast and some good performances make Abbey?! Em Ledu a fun watch.

CHENNAI: A couple died on Saturday night after a woman allegedly set herself on fire over a domestic dispute. The man was trying to rescue her. Both sustained 90% burn injuries, said police.

Initially, police believed that the fire could have spread from a mosquito coil after the couple's children told them that they saw their parents on fire. But after questioning a neighbour, police found out that the woman had poured kerosene and set herself on fire.

Police said, Shanthi, 32, was married to Ilango, 36, with two children.

On Saturday, hearing the two scream, neighbours rushed to their house. They took them to the hospital where doctors declared them 'brought dead'.

""The neighbours had heard the couple fighting earlier,"" said an investigating officer.(Assistance for those having suicidal thoughts is available on Tamil Nadu's health helpline 104 and Sneha's suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.)

ICMR and Union health ministry appreciated the lab in 2018 by for diagnosing the virus and working on its surveillance. The lab tested 367 persons and found 18 of them positive.

MADURAI: A four-year-old boy from Tirunelveli was murdered by his mother's paramour because he revealed their extramarital affair to his father. A Lokesh, 4, who was beaten up mercilessly by Sorimuthu, the paramour, on Friday, died in hospital on Sunday not responding to treatment.

The Melapalayam police have picked up the boy's mother Deepa, 28, for questioning and are searching for her paramour. The police said they were yet to register an FIR, but they are likely to register a case under IPC section 302 - punishment for murder.

Deepa's husband Antony Prakash, a truck driver, fell in love with Deepa, from Pollachi in Coimbatore district , and married her in 2015. The couple settled in Antony's native village in Vickramansingapuram .

Deepa began an extra-martial relationship with Sorimuthu, 25, from the same village. The two went to a private lodge in Tirunelveli city when Prakash went away on work. When he came to know that she was not at home, he grew suspicious and asked her to make a video call on Whatsapp. But she did not call him, police said.

The two had locked Lokesh outside the room and earlier Sorimuthu had even slapped the boy.

When Antony made a phone call to his wife's number, the boy picked it up and narrated what was going on at the lodge and how he was treated, police said.

When the two came to know about this, Sorimuthu thrashed the boy, which left him unconscious.

They took him to Tirunelveli government medical college hospital and Sorimuthu went into hiding. After the boy died, the police picked up the mother. Police sources said Deepa too will be charged with murder.

Man of the Match Tim Southee

New Zealand needed 10 balls to knock these runs off! This is a thumping win for New Zealand against the number one ranked side in the world. Right from the word go, it was the Kiwis who bossed this game. Yes, they were lucky on Day 1 as they won the toss, opted to bowl in conditions which were the best to bowl in, in this Test match, however, they made excellent use of it and bundled the Indians out for just 165. Jamieson was the star for them as he shone on debut with a four-wicket haul. Southee too took four but Jamieson's scalps included, Kohli, Pujara, Vihari and Sharma.

New Zealand managed to form a lot of handy stands and a couple of big ones. Captain Kane Williamson was their top scorer. There were three batters who got off to starts. However, it was an overall batting effort by them and that effort took their lead to close to 183. For India, they did not have the same conditions to bowl which the Kiwis had but their bowlers did look off color. Bumrah and Shami both were disappointing, Sharma and Ashwin though did a decent job, especially the former who bagged a fifer.

India failed to cross the 200-run mark in their second innings as well. Agarwal was the only one who showed some fight with a 50 but no other batsman managed to cross the 30-run mark. However, they did manage to take a lead and make the Kiwis bat again but it was a slender one which the hosts managed to knock out in no time.

New Zealand bowlers were exceptional second time around as well. Trent Boult did the job on Day 3 and it was Tim Southee who starred on Day 4. The former ended with a four-wicket haul and the latter with a five-wicket haul. Southee finished with 9 wickets in the game. Also, the Kiwis stuck to a plan in this innings which worked out brilliantly for them. In the end, it was a combined effort by the New Zealand side to take an unassailable lead in this series.

BLOGsays it was an outstanding effort, especially against a very strong Indian team. States they were excellent with the ball first up and followed it up with the bat as well. Admits the lower-order contribution was crucial and it was a team effort. Mentions they did not know what to expect from the wicket but it was very windy and they got it to move around which the bowlers made use of brilliantly. Also adds Jamieson was brilliant in this game with both bat and ball. Adds further Southee was hungry to do well and he showed what he is capable of, also, he along with Boult showed how lethal the left-arm, right-arm combination can be.says the toss turned out to be very important but they were poor with the bat. Further adds anything over 220 or 230 would have been different and the way they bowled to the lower-order was also not that great. Admits they were good till the first 7 wickets and they wanted to keep the lead under 100 but the contribution from the lower-order put them out of the game. Mentions it is now about what they have learned from this game and they will be eager to bounce back. Also tells the youngsters will learn, it is not easy to bat here and Shaw will learn, Agarwal though was really good and he and Rahane were the only two who showed some fight with the bat. He hopes the batters can take some responsibility with the bat in the next innings.says it is a great win, to beat a quality Indian side is very pleasing and it was a combined team effort. Further adds today morning was a massive time in the game, they wanted to take a couple of wickets before the second new ball was available and they did so. States there was some swing and they made good use of it. Mentions their bowlers did really well to bag all 20 wickets. On being asked how was the wicket, he says there was more on offer than usual, there was heavy wind blowing which helped them swing the ball and on Day 4, there was some extra bounce.Latham flicks to deep square leg for three runs, New Zealand need 2 more runs to winLatham cover drives for his first boundaryTom Latham and Tom Blundell open the batting for New Zealand, Ishant Sharma starts with the ballPant pulls to the fine leg fence for his fourth boundaryIshant drives it in the air and Southee drops it at short extra coverIshant square drives a Boult delivery for his first boundary.Pant goes down on one knee and slog sweeps it to the mid-wicket fence for his third boundaryPant cuts over the slips to the third man fence for his second boundary.Southee comes round the wicket and bangs it in short and Pant pulls to the mid-wicket fence for his first boundarySouthee tries to bowl a yorker but it is down the leg side and Ashwin flicks to the fine leg fence to bring up India's 150Rahane looks to drive through the covers but the ball goes off the edge through the slips for the first boundary of the day",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74275086,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-176813,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/india-in-new-zealand/india-vs-new-zealand-1st-test-live-score-streaming-updates/articleshow/74274854.cms

NAVI MUMBAI: A 29-year-old French national died after falling into the open duct in the dry area attached to the bathroom of his ninth floor apartment at Greenscape Building in sector 46, Seawoods. The incident came to light on Sunday morning.

Senior inspector, Tanvir Shaikh, of NRI coastal police station said, ""The deceased, Charyl Tastet, resided with his wife Tanya Thakur. The couple had got married a year ago. As Charyl's birthday was on February 21, they had celebrated at a restaurant on Saturday and returned home late. Charyl's friend from France had stayed overnight with them."" Shaikh said Charyl was employed with a Spanish company and worked from home.

It is suspected that early Sunday, he went to the dry area attached to the bathroom and probably slipped and fell into the open duct and landed on the third floor. DCP (zone-1), Pankaj Dahane , said, ""Prima facie foul play has been ruled out and an accidental death case registered.""

453,['24/02/2020'],"Kolkata: After work for 29 months, station structure ready at Mahakaran","Construction work on for Mahakaran station of E-W Metro

KOLKATA: With the last of the fourdeck slab being cast, East-West Metro’s sprawling Mahakaran station in the middle of Dalhousie Square is now structurally complete.The station, starting at 24m (equivalent to eight-storey building) below the green patch next to Laldighi, is expected to witness very high footfall — around 30,000 commuters an hour during peak time. Therefore, it will have the most number of openings — four — and the highest number of escalators — eight. Most East-West stations have two openings and four escalators.It has taken 29 months to put together the structural elements of Mahakaran station. Though physical construction (excavation) started only in September 2017, the plans have been afoot since 2015. In 2016, the design ran into trouble as the state government and the traffic police department objected to its location next to Tea Board. The cops had said the onroad positioning of the station would add to the already chaotic central business district (CBD) of the Dalhousie area. Railways undertaking RITES was asked to conduct a study and it recommended an off-road station to be built below the open grounds next to Laldighi, opposite Writers’ Buildings.An engineer of construction major Afcons, contracted to build Mahakaran station, said, “This Metro station is quite huge, covering 3 lakh sqft area, including the entrance structures.” Afcons has built the 3.8km underground twin tunnels from Howrah Maidan till Esplanade, cutting through the Hooghly. It is also building India’s deepest stations, Howrah station, inside the railway station complex, and the Howrah Maidan terminal stations. The 16km East-West Metro will eventually connect Howrah Maidan with Salt Lake’s Sector V. Railway minister Piyush Goyal on February 13 flagged off the elevated 5km section of the corridor. Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) is the implementing agency.If the area of the terminal Howrah Maidan station is 2 lakh sqft, Mahakaran station is easily 1.5times bigger. But it’s smaller than Howrah station, the country’s deepest Metro station because it has an additional floor and area of 4.5 lakh sqft. Howrah station is 30m deep and has four levels. The second deepest is Esplanade Station — at 29m — also has four levels.Mahakaran station, on the other hand, has three levels — upper and lower concourses and the platform. “The Mahakaran station has four openings,” an Afcons engineer said. One of the proposed openings is opposite Writers’ Buildings (where the Sulabh complex used to be located and is now dismantled), the other in front of St Andrew’s Church and another next to Telephone Bhavan. The one in front of St Andrew’s Church is actually connected with a subway, which bifurcates to the church and to the pavement opposite Currency Building, which is the fourth opening. “Commuters won’t have to cross the busy J L Nehru Road to access Mahakaran station. They can simply use the subway,” the engineer said. Construction of the subway has now started. The main entrance has been proposed next to Telephone Bhavan.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74275273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-641113,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-after-work-for-29-months-station-structure-ready-at-mahakaran/articleshow/74275233.cms

457,['24/02/2020'],Bernie Sanders: Moderates hustle to blunt Sanders' momentum after Nevada win,"This story is from February 24, 2020

WASHINGTON: Bernie Sanders ' commanding Nevada caucus victory made him a top target for his Democratic rivals and a growing source of anxiety for establishment Democrats worried that the nomination of an avowed democratic socialist could cost the party in November.

Sanders' win solidified his front-runner status in the crowded field as the race turned to Saturday's presidential primary in South Carolina, where his moderate opponents scrambled to try to blunt the Vermont senator's momentum. But with so-called Super Tuesday just three days later, when 14 states vote and one-third of the delegates are awarded, time was running short for Sanders' opponents to consolidate support.

That prospect on Sunday amplified concerns among Democrats who believe Sanders' call for a political ``revolution'' would drive moderate and independent voters away from the party, both in the match-up against President Donald Trump and in House and Senate races.

``I think it would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in,`` South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the House minority whip and the top-ranking black Democrat in Congress, said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.``

Clyburn, who said he'll endorse a candidate on Wednesday, specifically pointed to the districts Democrats flipped to take control of the House in 2018. ``In those districts, it's going to be tough to hold on to these jobs if you have to make the case for accepting a self-proclaimed democratic socialist,`` he said.

Sanders' campaign argued he will bring in new and infrequent voters - largely progressives, young people and voters of color - who have been alienated from the process and seek a drastic overhaul of Washington, not merely trying to oust Trump.

He successfully relied on that coalition Saturday to dominate his Democratic rivals in Nevada, pulling far ahead of the second-place finisher, former Vice President Joe Biden , and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who came in third. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren landed in fourth, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer were in a close race for fifth as the Nevada Democratic Party continued to tabulate results.

Sanders celebrated the win in Texas, a top Super Tuesday prize and a state that Democrats see trending their way thanks to a growing Hispanic population and opposition to Trump in the suburbs.

Sounding like a candidate who had already secured the nomination, Sanders told thousands of cheering supporters who filled a basketball arena on the campus of the University of Houston that he would win in the state both next month and next fall.

""If working people and young people of this city, black and white and Latino, gay or straight, if our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in Texas,"" he said.

Sanders was announcing a plan to provide universal, government-funded child care until age 3 and universal pre-kindergarten programs after that. In an interview with ``60 Minutes'' that aired Sunday night, he said he'd pay for it using part of the proceeds from his previously announced wealth tax, which would be levied annually on fortunes worth more than $32 million.

Sanders' new status was clear as most of his rivals sharpened their focus on him.

On Sunday, Buttigieg ripped Sanders' for his massive and often combative online following, saying the nominee's job ``is to call people into our tent, not to call them names online.''

Speaking to a crowd of thousands gathered in a high school football field in Arlington, Virginia, Buttigieg said Democrats should nominate someone who will focus on ``mobilizing, not polarizing the American majority.''

``Politics will be fierce sometimes, but it is not just combat,`` he said.

Biden, meanwhile, swiped indirectly at Sanders, noting Sanders is an independent and not a member of the party he's seeking to represent in November, and at billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg .

``I ain't a socialist. I'm not a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat,`` Biden told supporters Saturday.

But some Democrats were worried that the new focus on Sanders may be too little, too late. For months, as several Democrats jockeyed to become the chief alternative to Sanders, they largely attacked each other on debate stages and in ads while taking relatively few punches at the Vermont senator.

Indeed, even after Sanders' strong finish in Nevada, Warren avoided launching a direct hit at Sanders even when asked directly whether a Sanders nomination would be a risk for the Democratic Party. The Massachusetts senator is aligned with Sanders on a number of key policies and competing with the Vermont senator for many of the same progressive voters.

Speaking to reporters in Denver, Warren instead continued her attacks on Mike Bloomberg, calling him the ``riskiest candidate standing on that stage because of his history of hiding his taxes, his history of harassment of women and his history of defending racist policies.''

And Party leaders have been reluctant to appear to be putting their thumb on the scale, so as not to rile Sanders voters and further divide the party. It was not clear Sunday that there was any new strategy to try to knock Sanders off course or consolidate support behind a single moderate.

``It's just simple math,'' Pfeiffer said, noting that he's not advocating that any candidates drop out to stop Sanders, and that he doesn't ascribe to the belief among some Democrats that Sanders can't win.

``Each of these campaigns have a legitimate rationale for staying in the race,'' he said of Sanders' opponents.

Warren campaigned in Colorado, also a Super Tuesday state. Biden was in South Carolina, the state his campaign hoped would revive his candidacy after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and only modest improvement in Nevada.

Biden resisted predicting victory in South Carolina and said he isn't banking on Clyburn's endorsement, a blessing that could help Biden shore up support with the black voters his campaign has long argued will be the springboard to a nomination. Clyburn said Sunday he had heard from Democrats disappointed in Biden's debate performances.

Democrats will debate on Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina. California billionaire Tom Steyer said Sunday he has qualified for that debate, after missing the mark for the stage in Nevada.

The stakes were high for Nevada Democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in the still-unresolved Iowa caucuses, and it appeared they did not entirely avoid complaints.

458,['24/02/2020'],Bernie Sanders: Moderates hustle to blunt Sanders' momentum after Nevada win,"This story is from February 24, 2020

WASHINGTON: Bernie Sanders ' commanding Nevada caucus victory made him a top target for his Democratic rivals and a growing source of anxiety for establishment Democrats worried that the nomination of an avowed democratic socialist could cost the party in November.

Sanders' win solidified his front-runner status in the crowded field as the race turned to Saturday's presidential primary in South Carolina, where his moderate opponents scrambled to try to blunt the Vermont senator's momentum. But with so-called Super Tuesday just three days later, when 14 states vote and one-third of the delegates are awarded, time was running short for Sanders' opponents to consolidate support.

That prospect on Sunday amplified concerns among Democrats who believe Sanders' call for a political ``revolution'' would drive moderate and independent voters away from the party, both in the match-up against President Donald Trump and in House and Senate races.

``I think it would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in,`` South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the House minority whip and the top-ranking black Democrat in Congress, said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.``

Clyburn, who said he'll endorse a candidate on Wednesday, specifically pointed to the districts Democrats flipped to take control of the House in 2018. ``In those districts, it's going to be tough to hold on to these jobs if you have to make the case for accepting a self-proclaimed democratic socialist,`` he said.

Sanders' campaign argued he will bring in new and infrequent voters - largely progressives, young people and voters of color - who have been alienated from the process and seek a drastic overhaul of Washington, not merely trying to oust Trump.

He successfully relied on that coalition Saturday to dominate his Democratic rivals in Nevada, pulling far ahead of the second-place finisher, former Vice President Joe Biden , and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who came in third. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren landed in fourth, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer were in a close race for fifth as the Nevada Democratic Party continued to tabulate results.

Sanders celebrated the win in Texas, a top Super Tuesday prize and a state that Democrats see trending their way thanks to a growing Hispanic population and opposition to Trump in the suburbs.

Sounding like a candidate who had already secured the nomination, Sanders told thousands of cheering supporters who filled a basketball arena on the campus of the University of Houston that he would win in the state both next month and next fall.

""If working people and young people of this city, black and white and Latino, gay or straight, if our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in Texas,"" he said.

Sanders was announcing a plan to provide universal, government-funded child care until age 3 and universal pre-kindergarten programs after that. In an interview with ``60 Minutes'' that aired Sunday night, he said he'd pay for it using part of the proceeds from his previously announced wealth tax, which would be levied annually on fortunes worth more than $32 million.

Sanders' new status was clear as most of his rivals sharpened their focus on him.

On Sunday, Buttigieg ripped Sanders' for his massive and often combative online following, saying the nominee's job ``is to call people into our tent, not to call them names online.''

Speaking to a crowd of thousands gathered in a high school football field in Arlington, Virginia, Buttigieg said Democrats should nominate someone who will focus on ``mobilizing, not polarizing the American majority.''

``Politics will be fierce sometimes, but it is not just combat,`` he said.

Biden, meanwhile, swiped indirectly at Sanders, noting Sanders is an independent and not a member of the party he's seeking to represent in November, and at billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg .

``I ain't a socialist. I'm not a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat,`` Biden told supporters Saturday.

But some Democrats were worried that the new focus on Sanders may be too little, too late. For months, as several Democrats jockeyed to become the chief alternative to Sanders, they largely attacked each other on debate stages and in ads while taking relatively few punches at the Vermont senator.

Indeed, even after Sanders' strong finish in Nevada, Warren avoided launching a direct hit at Sanders even when asked directly whether a Sanders nomination would be a risk for the Democratic Party. The Massachusetts senator is aligned with Sanders on a number of key policies and competing with the Vermont senator for many of the same progressive voters.

Speaking to reporters in Denver, Warren instead continued her attacks on Mike Bloomberg, calling him the ``riskiest candidate standing on that stage because of his history of hiding his taxes, his history of harassment of women and his history of defending racist policies.''

And Party leaders have been reluctant to appear to be putting their thumb on the scale, so as not to rile Sanders voters and further divide the party. It was not clear Sunday that there was any new strategy to try to knock Sanders off course or consolidate support behind a single moderate.

``We gotta hope that some of these candidates develop political skills quickly,'' said James Carville, a Democratic strategist and one of the noisiest anti-Sanders voices in the party. ``The risk in losing the election is deep and profound. We just gotta pray.''

Dan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to President Barack Obama , said if no candidates drop out before Super Tuesday and the moderates continue to split the delegate, Sanders likely has a lock on the nomination.

``It's just simple math,'' Pfeiffer said, noting that he's not advocating that any candidates drop out to stop Sanders, and that he doesn't ascribe to the belief among some Democrats that Sanders can't win.

The 10-wicket loss was 🇮🇳's first defeat in the ICC World Test Championship 🏆 #NZvIND https://t.co/FletOSBASs — ICC (@ICC) 1582505607000

WELLINGTON: Indian batsmen's inadequacies in adverse conditions were laid bare as they crashed to an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat against a ruthless New Zealand side that wrapped up the opening Test in just over three days here on Monday.Starting the day on 144 for four, India were all out for 191 in 81 overs in their second innings. This was a shade better after their dismal 165 in the first innings, which eventually proved to be decisive.Trent Boult (4/39 in 22 overs) and Tim Southee (5/61 in 21 overs), one of the finest but most under-rated new ball pairs in world cricket, showed that when it boils down to playing incisive seam and swing bowling, this batting line-up is still a work in progress.The required target of nine runs was knocked off by New Zealand without much ado for their 100th Test win.India's last defeat was against Australia at Perth during the 2018-19 series but the loss at the Basin Reserve would hurt them more because the visitors have not surrendered in such fashion of late.There was no resistance from a star-studded line-up and more than intent, the failure was due to poor technique on a track that had something on the third and fourth day as well.This is a team that plays fast bowling much better than their predecessors, the reason for their success on the bouncy Australian tracks.But when it comes to facing conventional seam and swing bowling in testing conditions, they are yet to learn the art of saving a Test match.India had lost the mental battle on the first day itself when they saw the moisture on the wicket.The toss became a factor and not for one session did they look comfortable. Mayank Agarwal was the only batsman, who felt at home at patches, as New Zealand showed what a Test match strategy is all about.If the first innings was about mixing back of length deliveries with fuller length balls, the second innings saw the pacers coming from round the wicket and targeting the rib-cage. The line was disconcerting and it stifled them for good.It affected their mindset and once Ajinkya Rahane and Hanuma Vihari stepped out on the fourth morning, defeat was written all over as both looked ill-equipped to handle such high quality seam bowling.Rahane (29 off 75 balls) and Vihari (15 off 79 balls) are players who only play long-form cricket at the international level and both are known for their patience.But little would have the Indian vice-captain apprehended that he would get a delivery from Boult, which he thought would move away after pitching but it held its line and he had no option but to jab at it, and all he got was an edge.Southee, who bowls lovely classical outswinger then bowled an off-cutter from the other end and before Vihari could comprehend, it came back sharply to peg the stumps back.Within first 20 minutes, the two seasoned practitioners of swing had knocked the stuffing out of India's resistance.Rishabh Pant (25 off 41 balls) batted only in the manner he can and played one breathtaking shot off Southee - a slog sweep off a 130kmph-plus delivery to the deep mid-wicket boundary.But there was too much left to do with too little support from the other end. Bending on one knee, he tried another audacious slog scoop but couldn't clear.Southee, who had a terrific match, deservingly completed his 10th five-wicket haul and all it took was 16 overs to end the innings and the match.New Zealand now have 120 points in the World Test championship and India stayed on top with 360 points.Use your cricket knowledge to play CricPlay, India’s first free fantasy cricket appRead this story in Bengali",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74277118,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-197420,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/india-in-new-zealand/india-vs-new-zealand-1st-test-new-zealand-crush-india-by-10-wickets-to-take-1-0-lead/articleshow/74275316.cms

474,['24/02/2020'],"Transfer of HC judges not justiciable, except for improper consultation by CJI","This story is from February 24, 2020

There are 1,079 judges in 25 high courts in the country. Between January 10, 2019, and February 12, 2020, the collegium headed by the Chief Justice of India recommended transfers of 24 judges and nine chief justices from one HC to another. This means, only three in 100 judges faced transfer in a year.

Most transfers went unnoticed by advocate associations. But in a few instances, advocate associations protested and even took the extreme step of boycotting court work. It is difficult to fathom why lawyers protest against the transfer of some judges but keep quiet for others.

Before the collegium came into force in the 1990s, transfer of judges was a mundane affair. It came under the spotlight during the dark days of Emergency, when 16 judges were transferred from one HC to another. The executive had wreaked vengeance against them for entertaining habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of those detained under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).

One of them, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth, was transferred from Gujarat HC to Andhra HC on May 27, 1976. He challenged the transfer saying he had not consented to it and that it breached law minister A K Sen ’s promise to Lok Sabha in 1963 that “so far as HC judges are concerned, they should not be transferred excepting by consent”.

The Gujarat HC struck down the transfer. The Union government challenged it in the SC. Though the change of government in 1977 saw Justice Sheth being transferred back to Gujarat HC, a five judge SC bench went on to give an authoritative pronouncement on the issue of transfer.

In the Sheth case [1977(4) SCC 193], the SC said sometimes transfer of a judge becomes a compulsion because of close nexus he develops with local interests. It had said, “The factitious local atmosphere sometimes demands the drafting of a judge or a chief justice from another HC and on rarest of rare occasions, which can be counted on the fingers of a hand, it becomes necessary to withdraw a judge from a circle of favourites and non-favourites.

“Though transfers in such cases are pre-eminently in public interest, it will be impossible to achieve that purpose if a judge cannot be transferred without his consent. His personal interest may lie in continuing in a court where his private interest will be served best, whereas, public interest may require that his moorings ought to be served to act as a reminder that ‘the place of justice is a hallowed place’. It is difficult to impose limitations on constitutional provisions as contained in Article 222 by importing the concept of consent which is conspicuously absent therefrom.”

Then came the ‘first judges case’ [S P Gupta; 1981 Supp (1) SCC 87], in which a sevenjudge bench reiterated the ruling in Sheth case and said there was no need of prior consent of a judge before his transfer. It was followed by the ‘second judges case’ in October 1993 and the ‘third judges case’ in October 1998. The second case laid the foundation for the ‘collegium system’, which allowed judges to select judges. It was expanded by the third case. In both cases, the SC had said plurality in decision-making by involving many other judges, while according primacy to the CJI, would rule out arbitrariness in selection of persons for appointment and transfer as high court judges.

It said a judge’s transfer could not be challenged before a court on any ground, including bias, except for the reason that there was improper consultation by the CJI before recommending to the government to transfer a judge. “Any transfer in accordance with the recommendation of the CJI cannot be treated as punitive or an erosion in the independence of judiciary,” it said. However, the SC did ask the CJI to take into account personal difficulties and preference for transfer of the judge concerned.

However, 27 years ago, it did notice the nexus between certain judges and bar associations and the use of public interest litigation to challenge certain transfers and appointments. It had highlighted the “growing tendency of needless intrusion by strangers and busybodies in the functioning of the judiciary under the garb of public interest litigation”.

In S P Gupta case, the SC had said, “It has, however, to be made clear that it cannot be said that lawyers only, because they have a right to practice in a court, have ‘locus standi’ to file petitions in respect of every matter concerning judges, courts and administration of justice.”

And probably not many lawyers know that under Article 222, a judge transferred out of his parent high court to another state gets compensatory allowance.

Last year, Telangana HC advocates association protested the transfer of Justice P V Sanjay Kumar to Punjab and Haryana HC. It was followed by protests against Madras HC CJ V K Tahilramani’s transfer to Meghalaya HC. Lawyers even protested shifting of Justice Zaka Haq from Nagpur bench to Aurangabad bench of Bombay HC. And now, Delhi HC advocates abstained from work against the transfer of Justice S Muralidhar to Punjab and Haryana HC.

Most often, the ground for protest against transfer is that the judge is “upright and honest”. Does that mean other judges, whose transfers do not evoke protest, are not upright or honest? Is there a constitutional provision prohibiting transfer of ‘upright and honest’ judges? Can bar leaders spell out the real reason for protests against transfer of some judges?

475,['24/02/2020'],2015 sacrilege cases: Punjab Police SIT to take over investigation,"This story is from February 24, 2020

One of the FIRs is related to sacrilege in Bargari village

CHANDIGARH: Punjab Police SIT investigating police firing cases of October 2015 at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan would soon take over three FIRs pertaining to sacrilege cases registered at Bajakhana police station in Faridkot district in 2015. The SIT is headed by special DGP Prabodh Kumar (director, bureau of investigation).

These FIRs include the one registered on June 2, 2015 for stealing of bir from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, another dated September 25, 2015 for putting up hand-written posters amounting to sacrilege and the third FIR dated October 12, 2015 related to the finding of torn pages of the Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari village .

The three FIRs had initially been handed over to the CBI by the previous SAD-BJP government in November 2015, but the Supreme Court on February 20 while dismissing CBI’s petition had allowed the Punjab police SIT to carry out probe into sacrilege cases as well. The CBI moved an appeal before the Supreme Court against the Punjab and Haryana high court order of January 25, 2019, wherein the high court had not found anything wrong in the Punjab government’s decision to withdraw probe of 2015-sacrilege cases from the CBI.

Reacting to the Supreme Court judgment, one of the key members of the SIT — IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh — wrote on his Facebook page “Truth always triumphs” and termed the apex court verdict as a “moral victory”. He added, “We are ready, no matter how powerful guilty are. Every challenge will be fought strongly. There can be delay in legal process, but justice will surely be done.”

Interestingly, the CBI, considered as the premier investigating agency, had on July 4 last year submitted a closure report in the special Mohali CBI court in these three FIRs about sacrilege cases as the CBI did not find any evidence against three accused Dera followers — Mohinder Pal Bittu (murdered last year in Nabha jail), Sukhjinder Singh alias Sunny, and Shakti Singh — arrested by the SIT headed by DIG Ranbir Singh Khatra.

However, at the same time, the CBI could also not find as to who was behind these sacrilege cases. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh as well as other political parties had raised various questions on the closure report.

After the Punjab bureau of investigation’s director pointed out some loopholes in the CBI probe , including some unanswered questions about role of foreign agencies, the CBI in September last year told the special Mohali CBI court that it had transferred the investigation to its special investigation team for further probe.
