0,2020/02/16,"In Karnataka, NHAI collects ₹5 lakh every day as 'double fees' from motorists paying cash in FASTag lane","Such motorists are expected to pay double the fee, which often leads to arguments with toll booth employees

The tardiness of motorists in updating their cars so that they are FASTag enabled or not maintaining a minimum balance in their e-wallets has turned out to be lucrative for the authorities. On average, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has been collecting ₹5 lakh every day in ‘double fees’ from motorists across Karnataka who use FASTag lanes but insist on payment in cash.

Toll plaza operators have been told to collect double the fee from such motorists. Officials estimate that 40% of motorists are yet to affix the FASTag on their vehicles.

“But FASTag users are gradually increasing. The number of cash lanes at toll plazas has reduced. On average, 60% of the vehicles passing through toll booths are making payments through FASTag. This increases by 2-3% every day,” said P. Somashekar, general manager and project director, NHAI.

The NHAI has also instructed toll plaza operators to collect double the toll from motorists who enter the FASTag lane without sufficient balance in their e-wallet or account .

At Sadahalli toll gate, on the outskirts of the city, ‘blacklisted’ FASTag vehicles (without sufficient balance) have become a reason for arguments between toll booth employees and motorists.

A toll booth executive said, “As per the instructions, double the fee must be collected from such motorists. So if the toll rate is ₹90, they have to pay ₹180 for a single trip to Kempegowda International Airport,” said the executive.

To further increase the number of FASTag users, a few days ago, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) decided to provide FASTags for free at point of sale near the toll plaza. The offer is valid from February 15 to February 29.

Gaurav G., a car owner, said, “Introduction of FASTag is a big relief for motorists. Cash transactions at toll booths were taking a long time and causing traffic snarls. Now, vehicles are moving much faster at toll plazas.”

Taxi drivers recalcitrant

According to toll booth employees at Sadahalli, which is used by people travelling to Kempegowda International Airport, there have been many instances of taxi drivers refusing to pay double the fee. Often passengers voluntarily pay the fee for fear of missing their flight.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/yv9jah/article30834362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGFASTAGFORTOLLCOLLECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nhai-collects-5-lakh-every-day-in-state-from-motorists-who-enter-fastag-lane-without-the-technology/article30834363.ece
1,2020/02/16,Isha Agro Movement conducts training in organic farming methods,"Farmers learn to make natural agri inputs

A one-day training programme on chemical-free, organic farming was organised by Isha Agro Movement at Desur village in Vandavasi taluk. More than 80 participants from various districts including Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Villupuram, Theni and Coimbatore took part in the event.

The participants were given hands-on training in the preparation of different types of natural agricultural inputs like Jeevamirtham, Ganajeevamirtham, Agni Asthram, growth stimulants and pesticides.

‘Lack of guidance’

Trainer Saravanan said, “It is due to lack of guidance that many interested farmers are unable to pursue organic farming. To bridge this gap, Isha Agro Movement has been organising workshops all over Tamil Nadu under the banner ‘the entry into organic farming’. This form of farming allows the farmer to manufacture their own fertilizers and pesticides in natural methods at low cost. This also helps the farmers grow completely organic produce.”

Isha Agro Movement has organised over 70 training programmes across Tamil Nadu, training more than 8000 farmers, said an office bearer of the movement.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/phbltl/article30837054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Isha-Agro-Movement-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/isha-agro-movement-conducts-training-in-organic-farming-methods/article30837055.ece
2,2020/02/16,Demand to promote tourism in Ranipet,"Youth and devotees throng the Kanchanagiri hills during weekends; bell rock is a main attraction

Residents of Lalapet, Ammur and Mukundharayapuram in the newly created Ranipet district are demanding that tourism be promoted in the district.

Stories galore

The famous ‘bell rock’ in Lalapet is a sensation among the youth of Vellore and Ranipet, who throng the spot during weekends to testify the hearsay stories. The rock is believed to be the place where sages performed penance to attain Lord Shiva’s grace. One particular rock — the bell rock — among the many rocks in the area, is said to sound like a bronze bell when struck.

V. Vignesh from Ammur said, “My grandfather would tell me that the hills had a reverential influence on his life. He said that worshipping the ‘bell rock’ and the Shiva lingas atop the Kanchanagiri hills extended many benefits to one’s life.”

Mr. Vignesh, along with his friends, has visited the place a number of times now and “worshipped the big sized Shiva linga with nandi (bull) statue, the temple pond and Sri Subramaniya Swami Temple on the hills.”

According to villagers in Mukundharayapuram, the legend goes that the nandi of Thiruvalam temple had destroyed the demon, Kanchan, of these hills. Pieces of his flesh were strewn around this hill and they had become swayambu lingas (self-manifesting) after holy water was sprinkled on them.

L.C. Mani, president, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, Vellore, said that demand for a tourism park in the region was a long pending one. “

‘No arrangements’

The hill temple and the ‘bell rock’ are visited by a number of youth and devotees.” “Despite the difficult climb, thousands of devotees make a beeline for Girivalam on pournami (full moon) days. The crowd swells during chitra pournami. And yet, there are hardly any tourist-friendly arrangements made,” he said.

There has been an increase in deer population along the hilly terrains, and if developed, it could attract more visitors to the hills on a regular basis, he suggested.

Issues flagged

Re-laying of roads from Lalapet to Kanchanagiri Hills, power and water connections, additional bus services from Walajah and Ranipet — these were some issues highlighted at the Public Grievances Day meeting with the District Collector at Ranipet.

“Based on a petition submitted by us, Assembly Petition Committee had sent a team of officials from the Tourism Department and Block Development Office from Walajah. But the outcome is yet to be known,” Mr. Mani said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sp617r/article30837042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KANCHANAGIRIHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/demand-to-promote-tourism-in-ranipet/article30837043.ece

4,2020/02/16,VCK demands action against police personnel,"The State Government should initiate disciplinary action against those police personnel who were responsible for unleashing violence against protesters who protested peacefully at Washermanpet in Chennai on Friday against CAA, NPR and NRC, Vidutalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said here on Saturday.

“An elderly person died and over 100 were injured after the police used brute force against the peaceful protesters. This has not happened anywhere in the State, though Muslims have been protesting against the CAA, NPR and NRC for over a month,” he said while addressing reporters on the side lines of a meeting held for his workers from the western districts.

He said the VCK would organise a rally, Desam Kapom, in Tiruchi on February 22 against the implementation of the CAA and the move to bring NPR and NRC and wanted all democratic forces to join hands, as the Government of India’s move was “aimed at dividing people on religious line.”

The Chief Minister had announced that the State government would declare the Cauvery Delta region a Protected Special Agricultural Zone, the just-presented Budget was without a formal announcement in this regard.

All the Budget said was the Government would strive to establish the Zone and had expressed its intent to do so. This had caused confusion in the minds of people,

The VCK leader also said that his party would hold a protest against the lynching of a Dalit youth in Chenji, Villupuram district, a few days ago.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vck-demands-action-against-police-personnel/article30834323.ece
5,2020/02/16,TNTJ condemns attack on anti-CAA protesters,"‘The use of force by the police, was an attack against the rule of law itself’

Around 2,000 members of the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) staged a protest on Saturday condemning the use of force by the police against anti-CAA protesters in Chennai.

The protesters led by TNTJ State secretary T.A. Abbas raised slogans against Edappadi K. Palaniswami Government for the police action on protesters in Chennai on Friday.

Addressing the protesters, Mr. Abbas said that the police attempted to suppress a peaceful protest by using force which was against democratic principles. He said that the use of force by the police, who are supposed to protect the lives of people, was an attack against the rule of law itself.

“We respect law. Ours was a peaceful protest abiding the law. But the government used the police to oppress a peaceful gathering which is highly condemnable. If the government attempts to oppress protesters by use of force, the protests will further intensify,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dma0gx/article30834317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB16CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tntj-condemns-attack-on-anti-caa-protesters/article30834318.ece
6,2020/02/16,Heritage series comes to an end after 18 years,"240 lectures on topics pertaining to South Indian heritage presented

For many in the city, the last Sunday of the month usually meant an excellent talk and a breakfast at the TAG centre in Alwarpet. They would attend the Magnificent Heritage of South India programme that has been scrupulously curated by TAG Corporation’s managing director R.T. Chari for 18 years now.

A total of 240 lectures on topics pertaining to South Indian heritage and 90 performances have been presented at the venue.

On the appointed day, Mr. Chari would be at the hall receiving all guests.

“I found that in many families, our heritage and culture are not imparted to children. All that they aim for is to study well and get a job. I wanted to invite parents so that they can pass it on to their children. But I got people belonging to an older age group. Nevertheless, I continued with my efforts and I am happy that many have carried back a lot of information about our heritage,” said Mr. Chari, as he prepares to wind down.

During the series, he introduced several speakers including historian V. Sriram, Pradeep Chakravarthi and Chitra Madhavan. The series also had dance and music programmes.

His interest in music, which he developed midway in life, led him to create an archive at The Music Academy.

“Though my father R. Ramabadhran loved Carnatic music, I deliberately had to close my ears for other reasons. However, my wife Ranganayaki’s brothers-in-law challenged me to listen to 500 hours of concerts, which I did. Then I started conducting chamber concerts at my home, during which I became friends with vocalists including Maharajapuram Santhanam, Neyveli Santhanagopalan and Sudha Raghunathan. I would record their songs and that became my archive,” he said. Mr. Chari started archives in about 14 places, including in Liverpool, Singapore and Sri Lanka, of which some seven still function.

The series, however, will come to a close in February. “I am 80 now and am withdrawing from several of my associations. I will, however, continue to meet my extended family of friends at a different time and day. Our TAG Corporation and our family Trust Ramu Endowment will continue to support similar activities initiated by my children,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fnn4bm/article30832771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THTAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/heritage-series-comes-to-an-end-after-18-years/article30832772.ece
7,2020/02/16,Airports Authority of India asks municipalities to clear garbage to avoid bird strikes,"In a recently held aerodrome environment management committee meeting, there was an elaborate discussion on the maintenance of open sewerage and stormwater drains near the airport and the need for immediate disposal of garbage in and around the facility.

At least on ten occasions last year, birds got on the flight path at the Chennai airport, posing danger to the aircraft and affecting flight movements on several occasions.

After a recent air-field survey, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has asked neighbouring municipalities to step up action to clear garbage at the earliest, since it attracts birds.

In a recently held aerodrome environment management committee meeting that saw stakeholders from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Pollution Control Board, Chennai Corporation and authorities from municipalities and town panchayats participate, there was an elaborate discussion on the maintenance of open sewerage and stormwater drains near the airport and the need for immediate disposal of garbage in and around the airport.

Market waste

Waste piled up in some localities, including Pallikaranai and Perungudi, attracts kites. However, in Anakaputhur, while nearly 80% of old accumulated garbage has been disposed of, waste from a fish market in the area has been attracting birds to the approach area of one of the runways, said sources.

“The municipalities and the town panchayats concerned have been receptive and have promised to take appropriate action at the earliest. We are also planning to organise an awareness programme so that people know why this is important and the dangerous effects this may have on flight operations,” an official said.

This apart, the AAI has initiated a study by a consultant on the pattern of bird hits at the airport. He will soon submit the study with a series of recommendations on what steps need to be taken to mitigate the issue.

“We are pruning the grass on the airside and bursting crackers to scare the birds away. The issue cannot be resolved completely, but we have been trying to control it as much as possible,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/80sx9g/article30832703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/airports-authority-of-india-asks-municipalities-to-clear-garbage-to-avoid-bird-strikes/article30832705.ece

9,2020/02/16,"Doctors, patients discuss life after IBD diagnosis","At an interactive session, gastroenterologists and persons diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) discussed life after being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, the growing incidence of IBD, dietary habits, importance of being stress-free and the way ahead to create awareness.

To create awareness, Tamil Nadu Gastroenterologist Trust, which organised the interaction, will create a core group comprising doctors and patients to take awareness on IBD to a larger population and stress on early diagnosis, said K. R. Palaniswamy, president of the trust. They plan to include a psychologist in the core group.

Ashok Chacko, gastroenterologist, Madras Medical Mission, said no special diet or eating plan has proven effective for treating IBD. “Some may have problems with certain food and must try and avoid it. Some may have lactose intolerance, and those with intestinal obstruction should avoid foods high in fibre such as nuts, raw fruits and vegetables. It is important to eat smaller and more frequent meals. Aim to eat meals that give you all nutrients,” he said. He said that there was no cure for IBD but it could be controlled. “If left untreated, the condition can progress and cause complications,” he said.

A patient, who was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease 23 years ago, highlighted the need to follow medication and doctor’s advice.

Doctors said the incidence was increasing due to changing lifestyles and dietary habits. Colonel S. Krishnan, gastroenterologist, said that several decades ago, Crohn’s disease was not even discussed. “Now, awareness about Crohn’s disease has increased among medical professionals. We are diagnosing Crohn’s disease earlier than what our predecessors did because of awareness and facilities. There is a crying need for the standard of medical profession to improve by leaps and bounds, not just in mofussil areas, but also in metropolitan cities,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/doctors-patients-discuss-life-after-ibd-diagnosis/article30832641.ece

11,2020/02/16,Stalin slams police action,"Congress, CPI(M) urge AIADMK govt. to adopt resolution against CAA in House

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday demanded action against the police officials, who he charged with launching a lathicharge on the anti-CAA protesters and withdrawal of cases against the protesters.

In a statement, he said what had happened in Old Washermanpet was a failure of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to save democracy and was an indication of his government’s high-handed attitude against the protesters.

“By using force against those who organised protest in democratic manner, the AIADMK government used police to please its bosses in Delhi. The police action triggered protests across the state,” he said.

Urging the government to release the protesters, Mr. Stalin said the government should learn to respect protests conducted in democratic manner.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the AIADMK government used police force because it was afraid of facing the wrath of the BJP government at the Centre. “People have the right to protest in a democratic manner. If the government continues to use force, democratic forces will unite against the government,” he warned.

CPI(M) state secretary K. Balakrishnan said people launched the protest because the government failed to adopt a resolution in the Assembly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He said already 13 States had announced that they would not implement National Population Register (NPR) and a few States had adopted resolutions against the CAA. “Tamil Nadu also should pass a resolution in the Budget session of the Assembly,” he said.

12,2020/02/16,"Inspired by Shaheen Bagh, women in Chennai lead protests against Citizenship Amendment Act","3,000 protesters occupy two streets of Lala Gunda locality in Old Washermanpet.

The violence in Washermanpet late on February 14 might just have created a Shaheen Bagh-like situation in Chennai where hundreds of women began an indefinite protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) on Saturday.

The Lala Gunda locality in Old Washermanpet is famous for its butter biscuit manufacturing units. Two of its narrow alleys — Sajja Munusamy Street and Aziz Mohamed Street — have been packed with more than 3,000 women and children, wearing anti-CAA and NRC bandanas and chanting anti-CAA and azadi slogans.

Black flags atop buildings indicate the protest site. On February 14 night, there was commotion in the locality after a scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police. More than 140 people were detained. Condemning police high-handedness, protests by Islamic outfits erupted across the State.

Women take the lead

However, a group of women and men in Lala Gunda area continued their protests. “If women think, they can bring about any change. The CAA and NRC have triggered the sentiments of women as the future of our children is at stake. Hence we all stepped out on to the streets,” said Kathija Beevi of National Women’s Front, an NGO working for the education and uplift of Muslim women.

Claiming that the women were not backed by any political party, the protesters said they were inspired by the protests at Shaheen Bagh which had been going on despite attempts to forcibly stop it. Nida Sabreen, a student who is part of the protest, said that women were not allowed to come out of their homes for decades.

“Now the women, from all religions, have come forward and we have taken charge to fight for our justice. Our men are protecting us. Our voice is in the forefront over here. This is just a beginning for women to raise their voice for their rights,” she said.

Parveen, 48, said that till now women in the locality had not been involved themselves in any protests. “We are not even supposed to speak to men directly. Now, we have stepped out for the future of our children. This is a beginning and we will fight for all social issues,” she said.

Ms. Beevi said once the schools reopen on Monday, the women would finish their household work and return to the protest. “Our aim is to ensure that the draconian CAA, which discriminates, should not be forced upon us,” she said.

Ashimina Banu, another protester, said the protest would continue until the State government assured them that it would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR.

Political support

To show solidarity, many political leaders, including TNCC president K.S. Alagiri, CPI veteran Tha. Pandian, and CPI(M) MP T.K. Rangarajan came to the venue.

B. Abdul Samadhu, general secretary, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, said: “Whatever repression unleashed on us, we will not budge and will continue our agitation until our goal is achieved. The State government should pass a resolution in this session of Assembly itself against the CAA.”

The protesters also brought the body of Fasiluz Haq, 70, who reportedly died due to shock during the protests. Police refuted that, saying he had been ailing for a while. They performed prayers and took away the body for burial.

In the Humpy-Gunina game, the Indian opted for Semi-Slav and outplayed her rival in 35 moves to record her fourth win of the tournament.

In the Yip-Ju encounter, the young American attacked on both flanks to surprise the Chinese star. Yip had started with four straight defeats and has now bounced back in style with three wins.

Russia’s Alexandra Kosteniuk, a former world champion, is hot on the heels of Humpy, with five points, after posting a win over Nana Dzagnidze.

In the day’s other game, local star Irina Krush played out a draw against Lagno.

19,2020/02/16,Hard work the only formula: Deepak,"Tokyo-bound shooters felicitated by JSW

The packed arena at the J-Max theatre reverberated with thunderous applause as the shooters preparing for the Tokyo Olympics were felicitated by the JSW family.

In an interactive session, parents and children posed a variety of questions to the shooters after a five-day training stint at the Inspire Institute of Sports here.

Asian Games silver medallist Deepak Kumar stole everyone’s hearts. “It is an individual journey. Always remember ‘the more you push me down, the stronger I will come up’,” said Deepak, when a young judoka asked how she should deal with a non-supportive family and demotivating remarks.

“My father doesn’t know about shooting. But I have worked hard to make sure that he is known by my identity. I worked hard to reach this far,” said Deepak.

A retired armyman admired the accuracy of the shooters and wondered how they were able to achieve such perfect ‘grouping’ on the target, when he struggled to do so all his life.

National pistol coach Ved Prakash Pilaniya assuaged his hurt saying the weapon and ammunition used for competition were of much superior quality, and the ones used in the army were meant for a different purpose and thus lacked matching accuracy.

Rahi Sarnobat thanked the “boys in the team”. “There is no difference between boys and girls. We are one team. There is no difference in weapon specifications and ammunition. Special thanks to the boys,” said Rahi, when queried about the possible difficulties of being a sportswoman, and training with men. On handling pressure, Abhishek Verma, who won two World Cup air pistol golds last year, said confidence and responsibility came together.

When asked how much time was devoted for preparation, World championship silver medallist Anjum Moudgil said, “24 hours a day, 365 days a year.”

Divyansh Singh Panwar said: “I have been shooting from the age of 12. With good coaching and good support, I have been able to attain high standards.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/liga6e/article30836819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17SHOOT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hard-work-the-only-formula-deepak/article30836820.ece
20,2020/02/16,NBA-All-Star MVP Award named in honor of Kobe Bryant,"Bryant, an 18-time All-Star who won a record-tying four All-Star Game MVP awards, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles on Jan. 26. He was 41.

The National Basketball Association All-Star Game MVP Award has been permanently named for the late Kobe Bryant, league Commissioner Adam Silver said on Saturday.

Bryant, an 18-time All-Star who won a record-tying four All-Star Game MVP awards, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles on Jan. 26. He was 41.

“His loss, together with his daughter and those other seven people on the helicopter, is unspeakable,” Silver said at a news conference before the All-Star Saturday Night event at the United Center in Chicago. “As the father of a child ... that's the unimaginable.”

The Kobe Bryant MVP Award will be presented on Sunday to the most valuable player at the end of the 2020 NBA All-Star Game.

Kobe Bryant is synonymous with NBA All-Star and embodies the spirit of this global celebration of our game, Mr. Silver said in a statement. He always relished the opportunity to compete with the best of the best and perform at the highest level for millions of fans around the world.

Bryant made his NBA All-Star Game debut in 1998 at age 19 the youngest player to ever play in an All-Star Game. His 18 All-Star selections are the second most in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, at 19.

Mr. Silver said the decision to name the MVP award in honor of Bryant was made collectively by league officials and some players.

“To all of us, it seemed like the appropriate way to bring honor to him,” Mr. Silver said.

Mr. Silver also spoke about the loss of former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who oversaw explosive growth in the popularity of the game during his 30-year tenure. Mr. Silver said that Stern, who died in January, and Bryant had a lot in common.

“They were both determined to win,” he said. “They could be difficult at times because they prioritized winning, and often, they didn't have time for some of the niceties around personal relationships because it was about winning.”

Moments after Mr. Silver's news conference ended, the packed United Center stood and cheered as the game clock was wound up to 24.2, in honor of Bryant's No. 24 jersey number and the No. 2 that Gianna Bryant wore when she played basketball at her father's Mamba Sports Academy.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wpfr2s/article30807374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28-GEN-KOBEAGMC71JDH54jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nba-all-star-mvp-award-named-in-honor-of-kobe-bryant/article30834258.ece
21,2020/02/16,A dog named Obese,"He lived and left, unknown and unnoticed… but his sudden exit made a difference at least to one person

We first spotted him one balmy afternoon, about four summers back, all coiled up amid a huge heap of loose cotton flakes (discarded from an old pillow, perhaps) on the terrace adjacent to our balcony. He lay so still for so long that we feared he might be dead. We made gentle clucking sounds to make him stir, but to no avail. Later in the evening, from the same balcony, we saw the full-grown dog sauntering on the streets below. We heaved a sigh of relief.

Over the next few days, we saw this brown male dog almost every day around our apartment, either napping in the shade, nibbling away at tidbits strewn outside the neighbourhood bakery, or simply relaxing in his own happy space. I gradually befriended him — not a difficult task at all, considering he was the most gentle and affectionate doggo ever. I carried food and water to him every day and just watching him relish it, made my day! He was definitely old in terms of dog years, walked slowly and cautiously, and was favourably looked upon by all and sundry in the area. In fact, he was often fed bits of egg puffs and samosas by well-intended people, and much to my dismay, he loved them!

Sometimes, he would dash across the road to scoop up these spicy savouries, leaving me red-faced, holding my rejected bowl of health food! But whatever it was, he managed to look well-fed and healthy for his age and situation which prompted us to name him Obese, or Obishu, in true-blue Bengali pet name (daak naam) tradition.

Obishu was not the best looking mutt around — he had a rough coat with tufts of fur missing at places and a laboured, ungainly gait. He did nothing to regale me and was perennially lost in his own languid world. Yet, the look he gave whenever he spotted me, with or without food, filled my heart with a rush of emotions I had never felt towards any of the other 10 mutts I play dog mother to.

Our daily ritual continued for about four years — he never barked, only made a low moaning sound whenever I petted and spoke to him. In between, Obishu had found a new place to park himself, a few blocks from mine and out of my ken. I was initially apprehensive, but later felt happy to see him at peace. I realised that he was getting older and slower by the day, and his hearing faculties were also affected. He now stopped foraging and depended entirely on me and an elderly patron for his daily meals. I started giving him food that was softer and easier to digest. Aware that he could not survive on the streets for long, I spoke to the founder of a trusted dog shelter to take him in for his final years and agreed to be his passive adopter. February 2020 was earmarked for this, keeping in mind the oppressive summer months to follow.

One fine morning in January, Obese was not seen in his usual place. I looked for him in the adjacent lanes, but could not find him. I was definitely surprised, but decided to wait for a day. The next two days were spent searching high and low for him, checking every nook and corner, asking every soul who was willing to listen, but to no avail. Obishu seemed to have just vanished! Finally, the young helper at a nearby fast food joint rather diffidently admitted to seeing him being taken away by the municipal animal squad, apparently at the behest of a resident who resented the sight of this old, clumsy mongrel napping outside his apartment gates. I could not extract any further information about anything or anybody.

My daily routine continues unaltered. My other furry friends greet me with animated jumps, licks and tail wags. I avoid looking at the corner where Obishu used to sit.

Obishu lived and left, unknown and unnoticed… I was the only living creature to whom his sudden exit made any difference. And oh, what a difference it was!

22,2020/02/16,To reply or 2 ‘RPLY’!,"The SMS and WhatsApp lingo can wreck the structure of the language by their mere usage

Of the hundreds of messages I received that day, one text was particularly irksome. It said: “Hi, r u cmng tmrw?”

How was I supposed to decipher it? I burst out in a rage at the sender. Did I look like a code-breaker to her, someone who can understand such other-worldly language? Ignoring the message was the most apt decision I thought I could make. But my intentions were soon gauged by the mouse potato. The next message I received was: “Pls rply asap!”

Here I thought, “Sorry my ‘dear’ friend, I’ll definitely reply when I construe what you said.” And she was brushed off.

Then, thrown upon me like arrows were a series of question marks.

This time, I lost my patience. So, I replied with a simple “Yes!”.

“Okie, ty [with a smiling emoji],” was the response.

I was not confounded by her but rather felt sad for her.

Such abbreviations can become extremely sinister, with the capability of wrecking the structure of the language by their mere usage. Long gone are the days when texts were charged by the number of alphabets they contained. Dawned upon us is the era of free instant messaging. So why not utilise it to achieve maximum benefits. Besides, what harm could one extra letter in a word do!

That texting must never replace human interaction, is something one must always remember. The correct tone or gestures can never be expressed properly via text messages. Thus, the real meaning can be lost through a text conversation. Moreover, the habit of using shorthand could embarrass us in formal situations, where our helpless fingers could end up typing in the same way as they do while casual texting. Besides, not everyone knows all the abbreviations.

So, the next time you “textspeak”, remember that it is not appropriate for every setting (textiquette is what some people call it). The way shorthand is getting incorporated into our daily lives, students (especially young children) could face trouble in basic grammar, which could have a negative effect on their writing abilities because they are too familiar with abbreviations such as ‘u’ for ‘you’, ‘idk’ for ‘I don’t know’, ‘ur’ for ‘your’. Though I am quite sure that these abbreviations are going to make their way into our dictionaries very soon, I still hope for the contrary. Long live the ‘proper’ English Language!

23,2020/02/16,All aboard in ‘housing societies’,"The common corridor is your play area, the next-door neighbours your ‘immediate’ family and those above and below, your ‘extended’ family.

Growing up in middle-class Mumbai in the 1970s and 1980s meant that ‘housing societies’ were the only residential option available to you. Privacy was a luxury that only the super-rich could afford inside the confines of their independent homes. The mass majority lived in housing societies, which was a broad term used to denote a collection of flats whose residents managed affairs of their own and others.

Middle-class ones like mine offered hardly any modicum of privacy. Three or four flats shared a common corridor, which was your play area. Your next-door neighbours were your immediate family and those who lived above and below you were your “extended” family. So much was the concept of “Love thy neighbour” instilled in me that even today when I scout for a house, I first enquire about who lives next door much to the chagrin of my family which cannot understand my “neighbourly” fixation.

Almost all homes tended to have children of all age groups who invariably attended the same neighbourhood school, shopped in the same shops and generally did everything together. It meant that your world was your “housing society”. And what a world it was!

There were no intercom nor lifts. So any message had to be relayed in person and on foot. Climbing up and down the stairs was not a problem for us. And shouting across gave us an opportunity to test our vocal cords.

Every aspect of our life was a team effort, be it going to the market or studies or even watching television. Today, we attend workshops on “team spirit”, but our housing society childhood taught us early that any activity done together was always more fun and productive.

We had no summer camps during the holidays. We devised ingenious means to pass the time. We played “house-house” together. The leader would always be the mother issuing orders to others, the naughtiest one would be the father who would be dispatched to “office” with instructions to stay away and the smaller ones would be the children whose only job was to follow the mother.

And when we played cricket, the smaller ones would be dispatched to a far-off area where the ball would not reach by any chance. Yet they stood there diligently waiting for the ball that would never come.

We kept names for everyone, many of which stand even today, so much so that even their original names are forgotten. We laughed together at someone’s joy, we cried together when sorrow befell a family. And the bonds we formed within the community stand strong even today.

Happy times do not last for ever. We all grew up and moved to different parts of the world. Our beloved housing society went under the developer’s axe. A new multi-storey building complex is set to come up there. Newer residents will move in and yet I wonder if anyone can replace the multitude of human experiences that we left behind.

24,2020/02/16,Humanoids and the erosion of aura,"Humans have an ineffable quality which can never be replicated in a robot

Recently, while reading a magazine, my eyes got stuck on an intimate picture of a woman with a humanoid robot. There was also a brief account of the benefits of having a machine robot as your life partner. It is all about artificial emotional intelligence or Emotion AI, a subset of artificial intelligence, that understands, measures, simulates and reacts to human emotions.

The romantic relationship with a machine takes away the delicate nature of human emotions and leaves you comprehending a simpler version of life within the human ken. Those times are not so far when youngsters opt for tying the knot with a machine!

Technological shift

As a profound technological shift is under way, it is time to think of what comes through the void created by the loss of the “aura” during the production of a humanoid that mimics humans.

The Oxford Dictionary defines aura as a feeling or a particular quality that is very easy to notice and seems to surround a person or a place. As Walter Benjamin puts it, the “aura” differentiates between an original work of art and its reproduction akin to a painting and a photograph. It is like a magical or supernatural force arising from the uniqueness. The aura, according to him, is visceral, a kind of embodied sensation or a spirit that brings soul, eye and hand together to intensify the impression of a painting, which cannot ever be duplicated. His idea of the aura and its relation to authenticity is the reason an original work of art is valued in millions, but not its reproduction.

Another fascinating take on the aura is to believe that unique objects such as human beings have an ineffable quality — that is, being one of a kind. This starts waning and the loss becomes more pronounced while investing an object with human qualities and emotions. Emotions are sophisticated and subtle, the epitome of what makes us human. We tend to think of our emotions and intelligence as two separate entities. But putting them together as emotional intelligence is essentially a different way to be smart and successful.

Human beings are the most brilliant work of art, eternally challenged by creativity. Can it ever be surpassed by a humanoid? Mario Klingemann, a German artist who uses AI in his work, says: “Humans are original, we only reinvent and make connections between things we have seen. While humans can only build on what we have learnt and what others have done for us, machines can create from scratch.”

25,2020/02/16,In praise of praise,"My brother suddenly turned to his wife and asked her, “Why don’t you compliment me anymore? I compliment you, but why have you stopped?” Surprised, she asked him, “We have been married for 15 years, in case you have forgotten.”

“What has years got to do with praising one’s spouse,” he countered her. She replied, “You do have a sense of humour!” All of us burst out laughing.

Praise keeps relationships well-oiled. When mature couples begin to find each other irritating, something invaluable is getting gnawed away, until the day people are shocked to hear of their separation.

A kind word, a sincere compliment, a timely uttered “Thank you” can grow any relationship into a valuable friendship. When grandfather passed on, my dad told my mother, “Thank you for looking after my father.” It made her feel precious.

Women (more than men), not only in India but also in the West, get used to being criticised and saying “sorry” for every small “mistake”. Imagine if husband and wife communicated more to praise than to damn, would it not cement their bonds better?

Great doctors and their medical teams praise their patients, compliment them, show care and compassion to help them recover. Tender loving care (TLC) is an important factor in the healing of patients. Just being made to feel good helps them look at themselves positively and induces optimism in them that they will recover quickly.

The art of good leadership uses praise to keep employees motivated.

Praise triggers a sensation of pleasure and value and ensures repeat positive behaviours. Negative criticism depletes one’s self-esteem, approval enhances it.

Can we commence 2020 with the aim of praising others? Can we, from tomorrow, practise the art of offering genuine praise to those around us?

So praise sincerely for something well done.

26,2020/02/16,Why shy? It’s in the persona,"What people will think of you when you fail becomes your internal demon

Hollywood legend Al Pacino said, “I’m so shy, now I wear sunglasses anywhere I go.” Shyness commonly stems from insecurity or a kind of fear about what one is capable of. Introversion and shyness overlap but are distinct. Both include a fear of social judgment. Shy people want to connect with others but don’t know how and cannot withstand the anxiety that comes with human interaction.

Some see shyness as a character defect, but Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University, a world expert on shyness, describes it as an index of social pathology rather than an individual pathology. While the extremely shy are recommended professional help, the sensitive, the prudent and the careful are often respected and valued in society.

In the genes

Some genes may make it more likely for shyness to develop but often a combination of inherited genes and learned behaviour from life experiences are thought to be the causes. For those with a specific genetic vulnerability, life experiences and seeing how others handle their shyness will shape the outcome. Shyness occurs more as a reaction to certain situations than as a personality trait. And anything learned can be unlearned. But shyness can ruin opportunities without one realising it. When we keep our thoughts and opinions to ourselves, we may be suppressing a thousand loud feelings.

It is a paradoxical truth that while confidence is silent, insecurities are loud. Shyness can also be egoism out of its depth. Believing how we look and perform are important to others is a tinge of narcissism. Shy people worry that others are looking at them and noticing what they do. They dislike being introduced to others, find it hard to go to shops, restaurants and crowded places and are unable to be assertive even when they need to be. They become particularly anxious if they have to get up and talk or perform because they fear making a fool of themselves in public. They try to foresee possible points of embarrassments that could happen before the event and afterwards they mentally analyse to see how they could have done things differently.

Shyness is a common kind of mild social anxiety disorder (previously termed “social phobia”). Typical symptoms include dry mouth, sweating, pounding heart, palpitations, wanting to pass water or open bowels and numbness with pins and needles in fingers and toes. More visible are the blushing, stammering and trembling and the whole thing can culminate in a self-fulfilling prophecy. Shyness (aka diffidence) became officially recognised as a psychiatric disorder in the U.S. in 1980, when the FDA licensed advertisement of a serotonin-elevating drug for shyness. But some experts caution against use of medication.

What people will think of you when you fail becomes your internal demon. Even when hiding deep-seated insecurities, there is nowhere to hide when shyness-induced fear hits. One solution is to remember to ask ourselves if this is the best we can do right now and get help to build an internal compass to guide towards a better self-image.

27,2020/02/16,With heads held high,"Women must take pride in professional success rather than feel guilty about it

A week ago, I was sharing with a friend my experience as a married woman of colour pursuing a doctoral study in the U.S. I remember telling him that I could not have achieved success in my academic journey without my husband’s support.

My friend, who is also married, in turn, shared his experience as an international doctoral student and the challenges he overcame.

As I was walking back home, I was struck by the difference in the personal narratives of my friend and mine. My family was my cheerleader and played a pivotal role in all my achievements. He was his own cheerleader who achieved success primarily by dint of merit.

In her book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg draws attention to how women often tend to ascribe their success to external factors such as luck, family support and hard work, while men speak of internal skills and talent. In an interview to Harper’s Bazaar, actor Deepika Padukone credits her stardom to destiny and luck among others. Her spouse, Ranveer Singh, in an interview to Elle, credits his success to grit and determination. Yet again, the difference in their narratives is hard to ignore.

So, what is it that makes women uncomfortable with taking responsibility for their hard-earned success, a trait which comes so naturally to many men? When I was getting married seven years ago, my parents were ecstatic that my husband’s family was “supportive” of my desire to work and study after marriage. I was continuously reminded of this privilege by friends, family and even colleagues. The more success I achieved at the professional front, the stronger these reminders became. In a much-quoted interview within Indian households, Indra Nooyi talks about her mother’s reaction when she came back home after being named the president of PepsiCo. Her mother first asks her to get milk, reminding her that while she may be the president of PepsiCo, “When you step into this house, you’re a wife and mother first. Nobody can take that place. So leave that crown in the garage.”

Crown in the garage

But why should anyone leave in the garage a crown they worked so hard for? What harm could possibly come out of strutting around with the crown in the living room for a while or even the whole day? And most important, why does the sight of a successful woman often elicit insecurity and discomfort?

A study conducted by Lindeman, Durik and Dooley from Northern Illinois University in 2019 entitled “Women and self-promotion: a test of three theories” revealed that women experience greater discomfort talking about their achievements than men because of the “fear of how other people might perceive and react to them”. Gender stereotypes dictate that women should behave modestly and the problem with internalising such an exaggerated model of humility is that often, women end up carrying this discomfort with self-promotion into their workplace. A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2019 further revealed that women tend to provide less favourable self-assessment of their performance at workplace than men. The research draws attention to the huge gap between male and female respondents when it comes to self-promotion, a skill of immense importance during job interviews and annual reviews. No wonder then that despite sustained efforts towards ensuring gender parity, women continue to be under-represented in positions of leadership across the globe.

Most professional women I know are already racked with enough guilt and do not need constant reminders about maintaining a work-life balance by those around them. And most important, to all those women who have worked tirelessly to win their crowns, you don’t have to leave your crown in the garage.

33,2020/02/16,"Maharashtra government is unnatural, unrealistic: J.P. Nadda","The BJP national president said the party needs to be ready to go solo in future elections.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president J.P. Nadda on Sunday dubbed the Maharashtra government led by Uddhav Thackeray as “unnatural and unrealistic”, saying it has put brakes on the State’s development.

Addressing the State BJP convention at Nerul in the neighbouring Navi Mumbai township, Mr. Nadda said the party needs to be ready to go solo in future elections.

He said despite the BJP getting the mandate after the State Assembly polls in October last year, some persons with “selfish motives” parted ways with it and joined hands with those in the Opposition to come to power.

The BJP chief, however, expressed confidence that his party would win the next Maharashtra Assembly polls on its own.

“The Maharashtra government is unnatural and unrealistic. Some people have parted ways with the BJP for their selfish gains,” Mr. Nadda said without naming any party or individual.

The BJP should be prepared to contest all the forthcoming elections on its own, he said.

“You should be ready for ‘all versus one [BJP]’ kind of political battle in future,” Mr. Nadda said while addressing the party workers.

The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the State after the Assembly polls in October last year. But, it failed to form government after the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena snapped ties with it over the sharing of the chief ministerial post.

The Shiv Sena later forged an alliance with the ideologically different NCP and the Congress to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the State.

Mr. Nadda said despite the State Assembly poll mandate being in favour of the BJP, “selfish motives prevailed” and some went to join hands with the Opposition to form government.

“The BJP is going to win the next Maharashtra Assembly election single-handedly. The State, under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis, was making progress but sadly, the development is now getting halted,” he said.

Mr. Nadda, who took over as BJP’s national president last month, was speaking at the two-day State party convention which began in Navi Mumbai on Saturday.

The BJP has decided to continue with Chandrakant Patil as its Maharashtra unit president.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ewb6tj/article30660255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGNADDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-government-is-unnatural-unrealistic-jp-nadda/article30835019.ece
34,2020/02/16,Crime Branch to probe old case against Lakdawala aides,"Transfer of case may open can of worms for several police officers

An old case against Tariq Parveen and Salim Maharaj, both alleged to be top aides of gangster Ejaz Lakdawala, was transferred to the Mumbai Police Crime Branch late on Friday.

Apart from charges of assault and criminal intimidation, the Crime Branch will also be probing allegations of wilful laxity on part of the police to shield Mr. Maharaj, who is said to have been an informant for some senior officers in the force.

Mr. Lakdawala was arrested in January this year by the Crime Branch’s Anti Extortion Cell (AEC) after spending over 20 years on the run. The AEC went on to arrest Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Parveen for allegedly aiding Mr. Lakdawala by providing information on targets.

Crime Branch officials said the case in question dates back to 2017, when both the gangsters were booked by the Pydhonie police. Interestingly, two hours after the case was registered, it was transferred to the MRA Marg police station, which not only has no jurisdiction over the area but also falls under a different zone headed by a different Deputy Commissioner of Police.

“The duo had been involved in gold smuggling for several years and suspected that one of their couriers, a woman staying in Pydhonie, had kept some of the smuggled gold for herself instead of handing it over to them. Enraged, they barged into her residence and severely assaulted her and her brother, and also held them at gunpoint,” an officer said.

The officer added that three years after the case was transferred, there has been no progress whatsoever, despite both the accused being in the country.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Santosh Rastogi confirmed that the case had been transferred to the Crime Branch for further investigation.

Sources said the case will now be probed by the Unit I under the direct supervision of senior officers. The Unit I will seek custody of Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj for interrogation, and has already sought details about the transfer of the case and the reasons behind it.

Statements will be recorded from concerned officers from both police stations in this regard and action regarding superior officers will be deferred to top policemen, a source said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vg4lu7/article30834183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMLAKDAWALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/crime-branch-to-probe-old-case-against-lakdawala-aides/article30834185.ece
35,2020/02/16,Commuter thrown out of moving train,"A 25-year-old man was allegedly pushed out of a local train by two drunk co-passengers after a brawl on Thursday afternoon.

The incident occurred at 1.40 p.m. when Mit Taak was travelling to his home in Mulund from his workplace in Bhandup. Mr. Taak boarded the luggage compartment of a Dombivli slow local and the accused demanded ₹100 from him. When he refused to give them the money, a heated argument ensued.

“After the train crossed Nahur station, Mr. Taak moved closer to the door to alight at Mulund. The accused then pushed him out of the train,” a police official said. The victim survived the fall, but sustained injuries to his left hand.

Mr. Taak then approached M. Inamdar, senior police inspector, Government Railway Police (GRP), Kurla. Mr. Inamdar said, “The victim and the assailants were not known to each other. We have a description of the duo from the victim’s statement. We are scanning CCTV footage at all stations to spot them.” Mr. Indamdar said the duo was intoxicated while committing the act. The GRP has filed an FIR under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code for attempt to murder.

In December, in a similar incident, a commuter was thrown out of a moving local train after a spat over a seat.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/commuter-thrown-out-of-moving-train/article30832801.ece
36,2020/02/16,Dahisar land grab: four police officers suspended,"State gave sanction to CBI for their prosecution on Thursday

The Mumbai Police on Saturday suspended four of the six officers who were booked in a land grabbing case by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 2017. The police has also sent a request to the government seeking permission to suspend the other two, who are of senior rank.

The development comes close on the heels of the Home department granting sanction to the CBI to prosecute six Mumbai Police officers. While a formal request for the sanction was sent by the CBI during the previous government’s tenure, the sanction was officially granted to the agency on Thursday.

A senior officer with the Mumbai Police said that police inspector Sanjiv Tawde posted with the Special Branch, assistant police inspectors Kakasaheb Shinde and Anant Jadhav posted with Local Arms division and V.P. Road police station respectively. and police sub inspector Rekha Saikar with Local Arms were suspended on Saturday. The other two officers accused in the case are Assistant Commissioners of Police Prashant Marde and Subhash Sawant. Mr. Marde is currently posted with the control room, while Mr. Sawant is posted in the Force One, officers said.

“As officers of ACP rank and above can not be suspended without the State government’s nod, we have sent a request to the Home Department and are awaiting their response,” the officer said.

The CBI had in March 2018 filed an offence against the six officers following orders of the Bombay High Court. The matter went to court after real estate developers Jude and Dominic Rommel were arrested by the Dahisar police for allegedly assaulting and intimidating occupants of a plot of land that they had purchased. After getting bail, the duo approached the HC alleging that the Dahisar police, in collusion with the occupants, had tried to implicate them in a false case so that the 16-acre plot could be grabbed.

The subsequent investigation by the CBI showed indications of corruption as well as high-handedness on part of the police.

Five months back, the CBI sought a prosecution sanction from the State government. Any case of corruption against a government servant needs a sanction from their department heads, as per provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The sanction, however, was only granted after the new government came to power and Home Minister Anil Deshmukh took charge of his current post.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dahisar-land-grab-four-police-officers-suspended/article30832795.ece
37,2020/02/16,Five of Bhiwandi family booked in triple talaq case,"Charge of dowry harassment also levelled against the accused

The Shanti Nagar police have booked five members of a family for allegedly subjecting a 22-year-old woman to physical and mental harassment for dowry over the past one year. The police have also invoked the Triple Talaq Act against her husband in the case.

The Shanti Nagar police said Sharmeek Sheikh, a resident of Bhiwandi, married Shareek Sheikh on February 14 last year.

In her complaint, Ms. Sheikh said her husband and in-laws soon started demanding money and a two-wheeler. When she did not give in to their demands, they threatened to harm her.

Rajkumar Shinde, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone II, Thane police, said, “The complainant said they forced kerosene down her throat on two occasions and did not let her get medical help. They also prevented her from approaching the police. When she went to visit her parents for Eid, Mr. Sheikh called her up and asked if she would be returning home. When she replied in the negative, he divorced her through triple talaq over the phone.”

Mr. Shinde said the couple decided to give their marriage another chance when Mr. Sheikh’s mother intervened. However, the harassment continued and earlier this week Ms. Sheikh decided to leave for good. Mr. Sheikh then allegedly said ‘talaq’ to her thrice. He also allegedly forcibly took away all her jewellery.

Ms. Sheikh approached the Shanti Nagar police on Friday, the first anniversary of their marriage. The police have booked Mr Sheikh, his mother, two brothers and one sister-in-law for harassment for dowry under the Indian Penal Code and under the Triple Talaq Act.

“As the offence occurred in the jurisdiction of the Chitalsar-Manpada police station in Thane, we are transferring the case to them for investigation,” Mr. Shinde said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/five-of-bhiwandi-family-booked-in-triple-talaq-case/article30832768.ece
38,2020/02/16,"Fire breaks out at Thane mall, two hospitalised","At least 22 shops gutted in blaze

A massive blaze broke out at a mall in Thane on Saturday afternoon. A fireman and a civilian had to be hospitalised, and the flames were brought under control after nearly seven hours of sustained firefighting operations.

According to Thane Fire Brigade officers, the blaze broke out on the first floor of Lake City Mall at Kapurwadi in Thane (West) around 1.30 p.m. “The blaze was labelled a brigade call, the highest categorisation in terms of intensity of a fire, after it spread to three upper floors leading,” said Thane Municipal Corporation chief fire officer Shashikant Kale.

Fire Brigade teams and personnel from the Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC) reached the spot within the hour and around 350 people were successfully evacuated. “Fireman Ravindra Shelar, who was leading the operation, suffered from suffocation and was admitted to Jupiter Hospital. A civilian, Namdeo Zore, was also affected by the smoke and was treated at Highland Hospital before being taken home,” a civic official said.

A total of 20 RDMC personnel, four fire tenders, three water tankers, four jumbo water tankers and four rescue vehicles were pressed into service in the operation.

“The fire was caused due to a short circuit in one of the shops in the mall, and at least 22 shops have been gutted in the blaze. We are still working on calculating the financial losses sustained. Mr. Shelar’s condition is stable now,” senior police inspector Anil Deshmukh, Kapurbawdi police station, said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone V) Avinash Ambure said, “Entering the mall was initially impossible due to the dense smoke. The fire was brought under control by 8 p.m., with no fatalities.”

39,2020/02/16,Auto driver held for trying to abduct woman passenger,"The Mulund police on Saturday arrested an autorickshaw driver who allegedly tried to abduct a 21-year-old woman passenger on Thursday night.

An officer with the Mulund police said, “The victim hailed the auto to go home from Mulund Colony. The driver kept staring at her through the rear-view mirror and she told him not to do so.”

The officer said within minutes the accused took a turn in the opposite direction of the woman’s house. When she told him that he had taken a wrong turn, the driver told her to “shut up” and come with him.

The officer said, “The victim shouted for help and when the accused did not slow down, she jumped out of the auto. The driver then sped away. The woman sustained a head injury and called up her family. After receiving treatment, she came to the police station and we registered an FIR against unidentified persons.”

The police scanned CCTV footage at the spot and identified the accused’s vehicle. The officer said, “We obtained the vehicle’s registration details using its licence plate number, which was visible in the footage, from the regional transport office.

40,2020/02/16,MVA allies reject BJP’s Bandra Fort revamp proposal,"BMC’s standing committee shoots down move citing lack of clearances, encroachments around structure

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance partners — the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party — put up a united front in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee meeting on Friday to reject a ₹20-crore proposal mooted by BJP’s Bandra West MLA Ashish Shelar to beautify the 17th century Bandra Fort.

Earlier this month, the standing committee had deferred the proposal to give the fort a makeover. The plan includes revamping the fort’s entrance, using basalt rock in the garden’s sitting area, setting up a cycling track, installing a plaque narrating the fort’s history, carrying out landscaping and beautification work, reconstructing the compound wall, putting up fences, and building toilets and a vermicompost pit.

Though there is no official Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance in the BMC, the allies teamed up in the standing committee meeting. The opposition parties moved an amendment to the original proposal and sought that it be rejected. The amendment was supported by the ruling Shiv Sena and after voting was called on the proposal, a majority of corporators rejected it.

Introducing the amendment, Congress corporator from Bandra Asif Zakaria said, “The spot in question has a lot of encroachment which needs to be cleared first. Any proposal will require the sanction of the Mumbai Maritime Board. The aesthetic lights proposed to be put up will not withstand the sea breeze and become defunct. There are several such problems with this plan, which is why it should be reworked.”

Backing Mr. Zarakia’s claims, Leader of the House and Sena corporator Vishakha Raut said, “There are 300 shanties at the site and people will have to be rehabilitated. Do we have alternative accommodation for them? There are several forts in Mumbai which also need to be revamp. They should all be taken up together.”

However, BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde asked the committee not to politicise the issue. “Yes, there are several forts, but we can start with this one,” he said. Standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav also said the BMC should consider revamping all forts in the city. He directed the administration to address these issues before taking up the proposal again.

Mr. Shelar has been engaged in a verbal spat with the Sena since the fallout of the Sena-BJP alliance. He has also been a strong critic of the State government. When the BMC had deferred his proposal, he had tweeted, “Oppose petty politics of Congress Bandra corporator and Shiv Sena standing committee chairman, stopping funds to a sanctioned project to protect heritage Bandra fort. One can have disagreement and raise questions but to refuse sanctioned funds and stall development- just not done.”

41,2020/02/16,"Fake call centre operating in Nerul mall busted, two held","Racket was running under the guise of Bajaj Finance

Crime Branch Unit I of the Navi Mumbai Police has busted a fake call centre, operating under the name of Bajaj Finance, at Haware Centurion Mall in Nerul and arrested two people.

The accused have been identified as Jishan Waqthiyar Shaikh, a resident of Kalyan, and Arvind Lakshman Jadhav, a resident of Ulwe. According to police, the accused started operating the call centre from a rental space in the mall in December 2019 and had hired four female employees, who would make the calls.

“They would call people and claim they were staff of Bajaj Finance and offer them loans. Those who showed interest in were asked to transfer 5% processing fees, 18% GST and 18% insurance on the loan amount to the bank account of Global Education, which the accused opened in a nationalised bank,” assistant police inspector Rahul Rakh, Crime Branch Unit I, said. The victims would not get any loan after sending the money.

On receiving a tip-off about the fake call centre, a team lead by senior police inspector Subhash Nikam, Mr. Rakh and other staff raided the place and arrested the two, while the four employees have been made witnesses in the case.

The police also recovered a laptop used to prepare the fake letterhead of the company, which was used to send loan offer letters. According to the police, Mr. Shaikh, who had worked in a call centre earlier, was the brain behind the racket.

The police have also recovered the database of 17 people who were cheated of ₹3.49 lakh. “More people would have been cheated across the country. Most of the victims belonged to Ahmednagar, where an FIR against the accused had been registered earlier. They have been handed over to the Ahmednagar cyber police,” Mr. Rakh said.

He said they would demand for the duo’s custody if investigations reveal that other victims of the racket belong to Navi Mumbai.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fake-call-centre-operating-in-nerul-mall-busted-two-held/article30832640.ece

The APMC police on Friday night arrested a 28-year-old man for killing his friend over a minor brawl. The victim, Rakesh Gupta (28), succumbed to his injuries on Thursday, after six days of shuffling between hospitals.

The complainant, Gupta’s mother, Leela said her son would leave home 5 p.m. every day, and return by 10 p.m. On February 6, when Gupta did not return on time, she called him and he said he would be home in five minutes, after which she went to sleep.

When she woke up the next day, she discovered that Gupta had still not returned and called him, but his phone was switched off. Around 10.30 p.m. that day, she received a call from her son’s friend Javed, who said Gupta had a fall after consuming too much alcohol and was admitted to City hospital in Bonkode.

Leela and her elder son, Rajkumar, then rushed to see Gupta. “His friend’s told the duo that Gupta had got extremely drunk the previous night and checked into a lodge. When he woke up the next day and felt numbness in his body, he called Javed,” senior police inspector Satish Nikam, APMC police station, said.

Meanwhile, the accused, Amol Suryawanshi alias Vicky told Gupta’s family not to worry about the expenses as the friends would take care of it and took the lead in shifting him to a better hospital. He spent the next 24 hours shifting Gupta from one hospital to the other, claiming unavailability of beds and doctors.

Late on February 7, they shifted him to NMMC Hospital Vashi, where a specialist was supposedly unavailable. Gupta was then taken to DY Patil Hospital, where Mr. Suryawanshi said no beds were available and took him MGM Hospital in Kamothe where he once again claimed unavailability of a doctor.

Finally, Mr. Suryawanshi insisted on taking Gupta to KEM Hospital around 4.30 a.m. on February 8. However, after all the tests were carried out and the doctors gave an estimated cost, Mr. Suryawanshi realised he could not afford it. He told Leela that Suyash Hospital in Seawoods would be more affordable and Gupta was admitted there the next day. However, Leela was told that the doctor who was supposed to conduct the operation was unavailable till February 12.

On February 11, Leela took Gupta into confidence and asked him to narrate the truth. “Gupta then told her that Mr. Suryawanshi and him had a fight, but one of their friends intervened and asked the latter to go home. After some time, the accused returned and suddenly hit Gupta below his neck with an iron rod, while threatening the others to keep mum, or he would harm their family,” Mr. Nikam said.

The next day, Gupta’s condition worsened before the doctor could arrive, and he had to be put on a ventilator. He was declared dead by 5 p.m. on Thursday.

“Mr. Surywanshi had come to Navi Mumbai six months ago to set up his Hyderabad-based brother’s transport business. Before this, he had a successful business in Kolkata but faced losses after a robbery and hence he joined his brother. He was presented before the court on Saturday and is in police custody till February 20,” Mr. Nikam said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9eu99h/article30832556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMDeceased,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-held-for-killing-friend-over-minor-brawl/article30832557.ece

The Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Bandra recently directed a housing society in Ghatkopar (West) to pay ₹50,000 as compensation to a flat owner for causing mental agony by failing to carry out repairs, and ₹25,000 as litigation cost.

Vinod Natesan, resident of Mahindra Park Cooperative Housing Society Limited, informed the society of leakage in his flat in 2013.

The society appointed Arif Chunawalla to handle the complaint and Mr. Natesan briefed him about it on June 17, 2013, and also sent him an email. Mr. Natesan said the leakage had damaged furniture and created an unhealthy ambience. He paid ₹8.75 lakh for repairs and on October 4, 2014, informed the society that repairs were not carried out as per the contract and requirement of the members.

To avoid further damage, Mr. Natesan carried out waterproofing, which cost him ₹97,500. On June 19, 2015, he emailed the society about the leakage causing damage to the walls. He also sent a notice to the society reminding it about his duties under Section 78 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2013.

Mr. Natesan said the leakage continued till 2016 and he had to shift to a rented accommodation, which cost him ₹3.6 lakh. The society also turned down his request to bear half the cost of the repairs and waterproofing.

He then filed a complaint against the society under Sections 11 (jurisdiction of the district forum) and 12 (manner in which complaint shall be made) of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) for negligence and causing mental agony.

A Bench, comprising president R.G. Wankhade and members S.V. Kalal and Shivcharan Shere, heard the matter. The Bench said, “Though it is true that damage has been caused to furniture and other parts of the flat due to leakage, the complainant would not be entitled to get damages as stated above, under provisions of the CPA, except compensation on the count of mental and physical agony.”

The Bench said Mr. Natesan could have prevented further damage by seeking the society’s permission to carry out repairs. “As stated above, It is clear that there was negligence on the part of the opponent [the society], which clearly shows that there is deficiency in services for which the complainant should be awarded the damages on count of mental and physical agony.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/consumer-forum-directs-housing-society-to-pay-flat-owner-50000/article30832525.ece
45,2020/02/16,Will make people aware of MVA govt.’s fraud: BJP,"Leaders pass resolution at State meet

At a State party meet in Navi Mumbai on Saturday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders accused the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of cheating people by stopping projects started by the previous government.

The meeting was attended by Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, State party chief Chandrakant Patil, and leaders such as Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Eknath Khadse and Raosaheb Danve.

BJP leader Vinod Tawde said the party was determined to be an effective opposition and raise awareness of the “fraud” committed by the government. Mr. Tawde said, “The MVA government cancelled all public decisions of the previous government, including important schemes like Jalyukt Shivar and Marathwada Water Grid. The government even changed loan waiver norms and cheated farmers. While slum dwellers have been promised 500 square feet houses, several promises are still pending.”

The leaders passed a memorandum criticising the rise in atrocities against women in the State since the MVA government came to power. “The BJP will will go public and raise awareness of people’s suffering,” a BJP leader said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1qum8c/article30832434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMVINODTAWDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-make-people-aware-of-mva-govts-fraud-bjp/article30832435.ece
46,2020/02/16,Azad Maidan hosts massive anti-CAA rally,"Activists call upon government to pass resolution against citizenship law in upcoming budget session

Thousands of people, including a large number of women from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai, flocked to Azad Maidan on Saturday to participate in the Maha Morcha against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Organised by the Maharashtra chapter of the National Alliance Against CAA, NRC and NPR, the protest went off peacefully under tight bandobast by the Mumbai Police. Personnel were deployed on the ground and up to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The ground was packed with protesters, forcing people to stand on the adjoining road. Volunteers positioned themselves at CSMT to guide people to the protest venue.

‘Don’t implement NPR’

Student leader Dr. Shahreyar Ansari said, “We raise our voice from the land of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj against these dark laws. We want the government to pass a resolution against the CAA in the Assembly session and not allow NPR to be implemented in the State.”

Conveners of the protest, Justice (retired) Kolse Patil, social activist Teesta Setalvad, actor Sushant Singh, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi and activist Rakesh Rathod, were present at the protest. Mr. Azmi spoke in support of the women protesting at Saheen Bagh in Delhi and Morland Road in Mumbai Central, known as Mumbai Bagh. Mr. Azmi said, “At the time of Partition, we had the choice to go to Pakistan, but we decided to follow Mahatma Gandhi and not Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Now, the Bharatiya Janata Party government wants to give Indian citizenship to the people who stayed back in Pakistan for all these years.”

Mr. Rathod touched upon the injustice faced by the backward classes in the country. He said, “The Modi government takes advantage of the fact that we keep ourselves involved in classism and religious discrimination. But today, leaders from all religions are standing together. When the Constitution preaches equality, how can they discriminate on the basis of religion? You promised ‘Make in India’. When did you start selling India?”

Mr. Singh said when he was shooting for the movie The Legend of Bhagat Singh, he hadn’t thought that he would get to see a real revolution. “You all have fulfilled that dream and I thank you for this,” he said.

Waving the Tricolour and holding banners denouncing the three laws, protesters raised slogans like “Modi, Shah se Azadi”. Fareha Rizvi (48), who came to the protest with her 18-year-old daughter, said, “I grew up in a friendly neighbourhood where people from all religions lived in harmony. I’m worried about the kind of environment I’ll be leaving behind for my daughter. Every community thinks about progress, but we are becoming regressive by the day. It becomes a problem even if women show courage.”

Her daughter Manaal Sadiq emphasised the need for love and unity. She said, “We should spread love and unity, be it in school or any place. Every religion and every family has a distinct set of principles and beliefs and we should respect them. Such laws do not give us the liberty to do so.”

Advocate Farhana Shah spoke about how it was hurtful to see a government elected by the citizens withdrawing their fundamental rights. Ms. Shah said, “The case is pending before the Supreme Court and it is their call now. The people fear that if they don’t take a stand now, then no one else will. The government can’t neglect the betterment of the people after coming to power. They thought Hindus will support them in promoting religious discrimination. Instead, everyone, including students, is opposing them.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/s855ox/article30832311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMAZADMAIDANPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/azad-maidan-hosts-massive-anti-caa-rally/article30832313.ece

48,2020/02/16,The chemistry is working well,"The Purav-Ramkumar partnership now appears to be a full-blooded one

When the Purav Raja-Ramkumar Ramanathan duo signed up to play the Kobe Challenger in Japan last November, it was just testing the waters. But after just four weeks of tennis, the partnership seems a full-blooded one.

In less than a month of being together on court, the two have won three Challenger titles and made a run to the semifinals of an ATP 250 event (Pune). Ramkumar, India’s third best singles player, is now just outside the top-100 in doubles (106).

Credits Qureshi

“Actually we have to give credit to Aisam [Ul-Haq Qureshi],” said Purav. “When we were playing the same tournament in France in October, he was like ‘why don’t you play some weeks with Ram. His game could really complement yours.’

“And Ram sent me a message right after, and we set up to play Kobe and Pune and ended up winning both, and I was like ‘okay!’”

Then we decided to play Pune 250 and Bengaluru. And here we are! The chemistry is good and we’ll see to it that we have a good understanding of each other.”

Purav has thus far travelled predominantly with doubles specialists, but he remains confident of working out a schedule which takes into account Ramkumar’s singles commitments.

“Where there is a will there’s a way,” the 34-year-old said. “I have seen this working in the past and I have seen it be successful with numerous people. I’m sure I am experienced enough to try and get over all of that.”

Singles the priority

For Ramkumar, singles remains the priority, but the sense of camaraderie that comes with doubles is liberating. “You have a partner with you and you have so much support. Singles is just you being alone,” the 25-year-old said.

“Hopefully, once we are both in the top-70 or 80, we can get into the ATP Tour events and I can also play singles qualifying there. That will be perfect for me.”

When such a time comes, setting goals as a team wouldn’t be a problem, Purav felt.

“I now set more targets in terms of the way I have to play. I am more of a senior player now as opposed to two or three years ago and I can lead a team.

“I am not very result-oriented, but more process-oriented. Like getting the first serve percentage up to 80, winning all the second serve points etc. Ultimately, good tennis will prevail.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/xe5525/article30836804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17PURAV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/purav-ramkumar-partnership-now-appears-to-be-a-full-blooded-one/article30836805.ece
49,2020/02/16,Duckworth beats Bonzi to title,"Gritty Aussie set to reach career-high ranking

Just a couple of years ago, James Duckworth was down and out. He had undergone no less than five surgeries in 2017, and his world ranking plummeted to outside 1,000.

After a long and arduous recovery, the Australian returned to the circuit with a bang. Duckworth claimed four Challenger titles in 2019 — the most by any player — to steadily climb up the rankings.

Miraculous

On Sunday, Duckworth added another chapter to his miraculous story by winning the $162,000 Bengaluru Open ATP Challenger. With a 6-4, 6-4 win over France’s Benjamin Bonzi in the final, Duckworth is all set to break into the top-80 and reach his career-high ranking.

Duckworth stuttered in the beginning, losing serve to go down 1-3. The 28-year-old broke back to pull level, but it wasn’t all smooth sailing.

Duckworth made quite a few unforced errors, which frustrated him no end. Once, after hitting one long, an irate Duckworth took a ball from his pocket and smashed it out of the stadium. With the courts playing significantly slower at night, the players were unable to get free points on their serves.

Duckworth did gather himself to keep his temper in check, playing the big points well. The gritty Aussie picked up the winner’s cheque for $21,600 and 125 ATP ranking points.

“Having been through all the injury lay-offs, I have added appreciation in reaching my career-high ranking. I draw from the tough experiences — they spur me on,” Duckworth said.

His fine form has earned him a spot in the Australian Davis Cup squad that takes on Brazil in two weeks’ time at Adelaide. “One of my biggest goals was to play the Davis Cup. I’d rank this as the best achievement of my career. I also hope to take the step up and play more ATP Tour events,” Duckworth said.

Dream campaign

For the unseeded Bonzi, this was no less than a dream campaign.

Bonzi defeated four seeded players on way to the summit clash, and his performance will raise his ranking by more than 100 spots to take him into the 250s.

50,2020/02/16,Why do activists fear that Facebook’s encryption plans will reduce child safety online?,"What is end-to-end encryption? Why is there opposition to it?

The story so far: After Facebook announced end-to-end encryption for Facebook Messenger and Instagram, a coalition of child protection organisations and experts from all over the world, anchored by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, U.K., sent an open letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, expressing “significant concerns” about the company’s proposals. They were worried that this decision would reduce child safety online, because such a move will not allow the due process of monitoring for content that is not safe for children, including online grooming or uploading of child pornographic content. The petition said: “We urge you to recognise and accept that an increased risk of child abuse being facilitated on or by Facebook is not a reasonable trade-off to make.”

What is end-to-end encryption? Why is there opposition to it?

It is a system of locking messages wherein only those who are communicating can view them. Encryption kicks in the minute the message is sent, and only unravels for the intended recipient. No third party can decrypt the message, including platform administrators and law enforcement agencies. It can only be shared through screenshots. The advantage with this kind of encryption is that it ensures online privacy.

Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg revealed his intention to rejig the architecture to integrate three platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. He also announced his intention to write in default end-to-end encryption.

Child safety activists are aghast as they believe that as far as child safety goes, this could well be a misstep. The U.K.-based John Carr, who has anchored the campaign against such encryption, is a leading authority on the use of the Internet by children and young people. He has summed up the primary opposition, on his blog, thus: “We are creating what are, for practical purposes, impregnable or unreachable spaces. These confer impunity on any and all manner of wrongdoing. Paedophiles and persons who wish to exchange child sex abuse material are permanently shielded, as are terrorists and an infinite variety of scam artists.”

“Limiting the ability of companies themselves to detect and prevent behaviour which contravenes their own terms of services is wrong and makes a mockery of the very idea of having terms of service in the first place,” he records.

The evidence on the field, activists claim, makes their case a persuasive one. Mr. Carr outlines data from a series of Freedom of Information requests made to the police in England and Wales involving “online grooming behaviour directed at a child, or the distribution of child sex abuse material on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.” From a total of 9,259 instances, over a year (2017-2018), police reported that 22% were on Instagram, 19% were on Facebook or Facebook Messenger, and 3% from WhatsApp. Since all three belong to one company that wants to encrypt everything, the petition takes on an urgent tone. Mr. Carr also clarifies: “We are not talking about Facebook’s main platform. Nothing will change there. So, yes, if an illegal image goes up, they will find it and delete it in minutes, maybe seconds… But, this is all about their Messaging services. So that’s Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct — where they are proposing to make themselves blind.”

In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), leading to 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children being safeguarded in the U.K alone. As per reports on online child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) collated between 2008 and 2017 by the NCMEC, India tops the list of 10 nations where CSAI originated. A total of 38,80,235 cases were reported from India, the report said, but added that distortions might occur if virtual private networks (VPNs) or proxy servers were used.

The Rajya Sabha ad-hoc committee that went into the issue of pornography on social media and its effect on children has called specifically to permit breaking of end-to-end encryption to trace distributors of child pornography. It has also suggested that Prime Minister Narendra Modi take the lead in building a global alliance to combat child pornography on social media.

What are the key demands?

The signatories, including three Indian organisations (Tulir, Arpan and Equations), have urged that Facebook put the brakes on end-to-end encryption until it is able to satisfactorily demonstrate that there will be no reduction in children’s safety.

The petition says: “Strong encryption plays a hugely valuable role in keeping citizens and their data safe. We fully recognise that users of online services have a legitimate interest in ensuring their data is protected, and there seems to be a growing appetite for users to have greater control over how their data is used by tech companies... Facebook has a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to prevent the use of sites and services for sexual abuse, including grooming, the sharing of child abuse images, and children being coerced into sending self-generated images and videos.” In fact, Mr. Zuckerberg has himself recorded such concerns in a blogpost: “When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. But we face an inherent trade-off because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves.”

What’s the future?

The process of securing end-to-end encryption is not easy. Meanwhile, the coalition has also pledged its support to work with Facebook to embed safety mechanisms. Ultimately, the true test will be to pick that mode of encryption that will ensure privacy but address concerns of online safety too.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/khfg21/article30831657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th16-Ramya-Encryption,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-do-activists-fear-that-facebooks-encryption-plans-will-reduce-child-safety-online/article30831658.ece

Iran will never hold talks with the United States under pressure, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, adding that Tehran’s help was essential in establishing security in the Middle East.

U.S. President Donald Trump has adopted a policy of “maximum pressure” to force Tehran to negotiate a broader deal that further curbs Iran’s nuclear work, ends its missile programme and its involvement in regional proxy wars.

“Iran will never negotiate under pressure ... We will never yield to America’s pressure and we will not negotiate from a position of weakness,” Mr. Rouhani said in a televised news conference. Although the reimposed U.S. sanctions have crippled Iran’s economy, slashing its oil exports, Tehran has repeatedly dismissed talks over any new deal, saying they are possible only if the U.S. returns to the pact and lifts trade curbs.

“America’s ‘maximum pressure’ towards Iran is doomed to failure ... our enemy (the U.S.) is very well aware that their pressure is inefficient,” he said

American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working.

An announcement on the public address system aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.

More than 40 infected Americans from the cruise will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

“They are not going to go anywhere. They're going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Dr. Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”

Canadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.

“Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,” U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters.

COVID-19 | Will provide all possible help to Indians on cruise ship to return home, says Indian Embassy | Death toll in China exceeds 1,600

Seventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Dr. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.

Within China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.

“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.

The new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who travelled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.

The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China's central province of Hubei. China's response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.

Mr. Mi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.

Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.

But he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”

Declining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.

Restrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.

After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.

On board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to transport U.S. nationals. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.

The ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital in Japan. No one from the ship has died.

Countries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival.

The U.S. Department of Defense has said it is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

The evacuees would be subject to a 14-day quarantine.

Another cruise ship, Holland America's MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding.

Taiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9ocgxw/article30837010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DiamondPrincess,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-americans-leave-japan-ship/article30837011.ece
56,2020/02/16,Chinese President Xi’s early involvement in virus outbreak raises questions,"A recent speech published by the state media indicates that he was leading the response to the crisis, but also opens him up to criticism over why the public was not alerted sooner

A recent speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping that has been published by state media indicates for the first time that he was leading the response to a new virus outbreak from early on in the crisis.

The publication of the Feb. 3 speech was an apparent attempt to demonstrate that the Communist Party leadership had acted decisively from the beginning, but also opens Mr. Xi up to criticism over why the public was not alerted sooner.

In the speech, Mr. Xi said he gave instructions on fighting the virus on Jan. 7 and ordered the shutdown that began on Jan. 23 of cities at the epicenter of the outbreak. His remarks were published by state media late Saturday.

“On Jan. 22, in light of the epidemic’s rapid spread and the challenges of prevention and control, I made a clear request that Hubei province implement comprehensive and stringent controls over the outflow of people,” Mr. Xi told a meeting of the party’s standing committee, its top body.

The number of new cases in mainland China fell for a third straight day, China’s National Health Commission reported Sunday. The 2,009 new cases in the previous 24-hour period brought the total to 68,500.

Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the percentage of severe cases has dropped to 7.2% of the total from a peak of 15.9% on Jan. 27. The proportion is higher in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the outbreak started, but has fallen to 21.6% from a peak of 32.4% on Jan. 28.

“The national efforts against the epidemic have shown results,” Mi said at the commission’s daily media briefing.

Taiwan on Sunday reported its first death from the virus, the fifth fatality outside of mainland China. The island also confirmed two new cases, raising its total to 20.

Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported that the person who died was a male in his 60s living in central Taiwan. The man had no recent overseas travel history and no known contact with virus patients, CNA said, citing Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung.

China reported 142 more deaths, almost all in Hubei, raising the mainland China death toll to 1,665. Another 9,419 people have recovered from COVID-19, a disease caused by a new coronavirus, and have been discharged from hospitals.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an experts meeting to discuss measures to contain the virus in his country, where one person has died and more than a dozen cases emerged in the past few days without any obvious link to China.

“The situation surrounding this virus is changing by the minute,” Mr. Abe said.

Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the country is “entering into a phase that is different from before,” requiring new steps to stop the virus from spreading further.

About 400 Americans on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan were awaiting charter flights home, as Japan announced another 70 infections had been confirmed on the Diamond Princess. Canada, Hong Kong and Italy said they were planning similar flights.

Japan now has 412 confirmed cases, including 355 from the cruise ship, and one death from the virus.

Mr. Xi’s role was muted in the early days of the epidemic, which has grown into one of the biggest political challenges of his seven-year tenure.

The disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak’s potential severity weeks before such dangers were made known to the public. It was not until late January that officials said the virus can spread between humans and public alarm began to rise.

Zhang Lifan, a commentator in Beijing, said it’s not clear why the speech was published now. One message could be that local authorities should take responsibility for failing to take effective measures after Mr. Xi gave instructions in early January. Alternatively, it may mean that Mr. Xi, as the top leader, is willing to take responsibility because he was aware of the situation, Mr. Zhang said.

Trust in the government’s approach to outbreaks remains fractured after the SARS epidemic of 2002 and 2003, which was covered up for months.

Authorities in Hubei and Wuhan faced public fury over their initial handling of the epidemic. Wuhan on Jan. 23 became the first city to impose an unprecedented halt on outbound transportation, a measure since expanded to other cities with a combined population of more than 60 million.

The anger reached a peak earlier this month following the death of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who was reprimanded by local police for trying to spread a warning about the virus. He ended up dying of the disease himself.

In apparent response, the Communist Party’s top officials in Hubei and Wuhan were dismissed and replaced last week.

Even as authorities have pledged transparency through the current outbreak, citizen journalists who challenged the official narrative with video reports from Wuhan have disappeared and are believed to be detained.

The fall in new cases follows a spike of more than 15,000 on Thursday, when Hubei began to include cases that had been diagnosed by a doctor but not yet confirmed by laboratory tests.

Overwhelmed by the number of suspected cases, the province has not been able to test every person exhibiting symptoms. The clinical diagnosis is based on doctors’ analyses and lung imaging and is intended to allow probable cases to be treated as confirmed ones without the need to wait for a lab result.

About 400 Americans aboard the cruise ship docked at Yokohama, near Tokyo, were told to decide whether to stay or take chartered aircraft arranged by the U.S. government to fly them home, where they would face another 14-day quarantine. Those going were to begin leaving the ship Sunday night. People with symptoms were to be banned from the flights.

About 255 Canadians and 330 Hong Kong residents are on board the ship or undergoing treatment in Japanese hospitals. There are 35 Italians, of which 25 are crew members, including the captain.

American passenger Matthew Smith told that he and his wife were not taking the flights, because the 14-day quarantine for the ship is set to end on Wednesday. The evacuees will be taken to Travis Air Force Base in California, with some continuing to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

Malaysia said it would not allow any more passengers from another cruise ship to transit the country after an 83-year-old American woman from the MS Westerdam tested positive for the virus.

She was among 145 passengers who flew from Cambodia to Malaysia on Friday. Her husband also had symptoms but tested negative for the virus. The Westerdam was turned away from four ports around Asia before Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville late last week.

Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said that her country would bar cruise ships that came from or transit any Chinese ports from docking.

Cambodia said earlier that all 1,455 passengers on the Holland America-operated ship had tested negative for the virus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/exc7d8/article30836160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAKECONOMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-president-xis-early-involvement-in-virus-outbreak-raises-questions/article30836161.ece
57,2020/02/16,COVID-19 | Hong Kong protesters rally against planned virus quarantine centres,"The virus has opened a new front for protesters after months of demonstrations over the perceived erosion of freedoms had largely fizzled out over the past month

Hundreds of demonstrators rallied for a second day in Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against plans to turn some buildings into coronavirus quarantine centres, reviving anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city.

The virus has opened a new front for protesters after months of demonstrations over the perceived erosion of freedoms had largely fizzled out over the past month, as people stayed at home amid fears of a community outbreak of the virus.

About 100 people braved the rain in the New Territories district of Fo Tan, where authorities plan to use a newly built residential development that was subsidised by the government as a quarantine centre. Riot police stood by.

A 38-year-old mother of two said she had waited eight years for her home in the Chun Yeung estate and was expecting to get her keys by the end of this month.

“There’s no consultation and we don’t know how long they’ll use Chun Yeung estate. That’s why we are so mad,” said the woman.

Koby, 36, also expressed frustration at not being told for how long the public housing might be used for quarantine. “I’ve waited eight years. I have two children studying in kindergarten and have already transferred them to the school in Fo Tan,” he said.

Protesters gathered in other districts on Sunday.

With Hong Kong property prices among the most expensive in the world, owning a home is a distant dream for many, and frustration over housing has triggered protests in the past.

Many Hong Kong people, already angry about what they see as meddling by Beijing in the former British colony's affairs — which it denies — have criticised the government’s handling of the virus scare, piling pressure on embattled city leader Carrie Lam.

On Friday, the government sought to appease families that have been allocated a flat in the Fo Tan estate by pledging a special subsidy.

Three weeks ago, protesters set alight the lobby of a newly built residential building in another district in the New Territories, that authorities had planned to use as a quarantine facility. The government dropped the plan.

Hong Kong has had 57 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. One person has died of it in the city.

Some Hong Kong people have called on the city government to seal the border with the mainland to block the virus, but Ms. Lam has ruled that out.

The death toll from China’s coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,665 after 142 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei Province, and the confirmed cases jumped to 68,500, officials said on Sunday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qvhwd2/article30835384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THLTHONGKONGCHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-hong-kong-protesters-rally-against-planned-virus-quarantine-centres/article30835385.ece
58,2020/02/16,U.S. election 2020 | Joe Biden takes on Bernie Sanders' gun votes in fiery speech,"The former Vice President devoted the majority of his Saturday night speech to deliver a fiery charge against the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers

U.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, standing on a Las Vegas stage roughly 1,000 feet from the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, took on White House rival Bernie Sanders for his past vote to exempt gun manufacturers from liability for shootings.

The former Vice President devoted the majority of his Saturday night speech at a Democratic gala on the Las Vegas Strip to deliver a fiery charge against the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers, vowing to hold gun makers accountable if elected President.

Also Read Trump’s march and the Sanders factor

“When I’m the President, we’ll take them on, remove the immunity and allow those parents who are trying now to sue for the pain and mayhem they have caused,” Mr. Biden said on stage at the Tropicana casino-resort. The resort sits adjacent to the grounds where a gunman in 2017 unleashed a torrent of gunfire on a country music festival-an incident that only Mr. Biden referred to Saturday night.

Mr. Biden, after decrying “carnage in our streets” and the anguish of families whose loved ones were killed in gun violence, said he “will not rest until they’re able to sue the gun manufacturers and get a ban on assault weapons.”

Mr. Biden didn’t cite Mr. Sanders by name when referring to a 2005 federal law that shields gun makers from liability in most crimes, but said, “some of the people running for office voted for that exemption.”

“Ladies and gentlemen that immunity was granted. Granted. And it was a horrible, horrible decision,” he said.

Mr. Sanders has since changed his position, co-sponsoring legislation to repeal the protections for gun manufacturers. He’s also called in his campaign this year for sweeping gun control measures.

Mr. Biden’s speech came after a frenzied Saturday of campaigning across Las Vegas on the first day of early voting in Nevada’s Democratic caucuses. Mr. Biden, counting on Nevada’s diverse population to keep his campaign alive after disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, faces his biggest challenge in the Western state from Mr. Sanders. The progressive icon is seen as the most well-positioned in the state and has reached deep into Latino neighbourhoods.

After holding forth on gun violence, Mr. Biden lasered in on health care, a sticking point for Mr. Sanders with Nevada’s most politically powerful labour group, the casino workers’ Culinary Union. Again without naming Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden repeated a recent argument from the powerful Culinary Union that a single-payer “Medicare for All” system would eliminate union members’ health coverage won through collective bargaining. Mr. Biden touted his idea to add a “public option” to existing health insurance markets.

And, he added, “I can actually get my plan passed.”

Also Read Businessman Andrew Yang announces withdrawal from Democratic presidential race

Mr. Sanders, who was the first candidate to take the stage Saturday night, laced into billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg, rattling off a list of heresies against the Democratic Party he accused the former New York mayor of committing. Mr. Bloomberg implemented “racist policies like stop and frisk” in New York, opposed the minimum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy during the Obama administration, Mr. Sanders said.

“The simple truth is that Mayor Bloomberg, with all his money, will not create the kind of excitement and energy we need to have the voter turnout we must have to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr. Sanders said.

It was a rare attack by name from Mr. Sanders. Mr. Bloomberg is skipping the Nevada caucuses and was not at the Clark County Democratic Party dinner where Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and other 2020 contenders spoke.

While the state’s formal presidential caucuses are still a week away, Democrats opened the first of four days of early voting across more than 80 locations. State party officials at some sites across Nevada were overwhelmed by long lines.

A spokeswoman for the Nevada Democrats, Molly Forgey, downplayed concerns related to the large early turnout as the political world anxiously watched from afar less than two weeks after Iowa’s presidential caucuses turned disastrous. Ms. Forgey said Nevada Democratic Party staff and volunteers were working to make every site as efficient as possible.

Early votes cast on paper ballots will be added to in-person caucus votes made on February 22, when Democrats will attend about 2,000 precinct meetings around the state. The Nevada State Democratic Party abandoned its plans to use an app like the one that caused trouble in Iowa and has scrambled to come up with a new system to tabulate results.

Former Senator Harry Reid, an icon in Nevada’s Democratic politics, told reporters that “people should not be counting Joe Biden out of the race yet,” but also offered warm words for Mr. Sanders’ candidacy. When asked he downplayed concerns from some Democrats that Mr. Sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.

Elizabeth Warren, reeling after a weak performance last week in New Hampshire, took the stage Saturday night with a raggedy voice, having lost it after a day barnstorming the city. Ms. Warren talked about Mr. Reid tapping her over a decade ago to oversee the bank bailout after the mortgage crisis, which hit Nevada particularly hard.

“When I saw the crash and saw how many millions of people lost their homes and lost their savings and lost their jobs, I was determined that this would never happen again.”

Earlier Saturday, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar began to introduce herself to the state’s voters, addressing an African American festival in a Las Vegas park. She praised the state’s voting protections and Democratic legislative majority while pitching her appeal to pivotal Midwestern voters.

""In the middle of the country where I’m from I want a little more Nevada there,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “My plan is to build a great blue wall around those states and make Donald Trump pay for it.”

Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Peter Buttigieg, who is looking to show he can win support from voters of colour after strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire pitched his brand of moderation to the Latin Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas, noting his tax plans would touch top earners “but it’s not unreasonable.”

""We don’t have to go back to the tax levels of the 1960s to deliver on our promises. At least not my promises,” Mr. Buttigieg said, noting the massive expense of Mr. Sanders’ health care plans. “I’m not interested in creating a tax just because...”

Campaigning in a state with a large immigrant population, Mr. Buttigieg also drew on his own background as the son of an immigrant from the tiny Mediterranean island nation of Malta.

Billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer, who like Mr. Biden is banking on a most diverse pool of voters in Nevada and later South Carolina to lift his campaign, pledged Saturday night to take on President take on corporations, fight for a living wage and “will kick Donald Trump’s ass on the debate stage.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k9zahh/article30834891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THLTELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-election-2020-joe-biden-takes-on-bernie-sanders-gun-votes-in-fiery-speech/article30834892.ece
59,2020/02/16,"Important for India and Pak to ‘de-escalate, both militarily and verbally’, says Antonio Guterres","The UN Secretary-General will hold talks with President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi

UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Sunday it was important for India and Pakistan to de-escalate “militarily and verbally” and exercise “maximum restraint” as he began his four-day visit to the country, amidst tense relationship between the two nuclear armed neighbours.

Addressing a press conference after his meeting with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the UN Secretary-General said he was “deeply concerned” over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and tensions along the Line of Control.

The UN chief on Sunday arrived on a four-day visit to Pakistan during which he will attend an international conference on Afghan refugees and visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib.

“Diplomacy and dialogue remain the only tools that guarantee peace and stability with solutions in accordance with the Charter of United Nations and resolutions of the Security Council,” Mr. Guterres told reporters.

He emphasised the importance to “de-escalate, both militarily and verbally” while talking about relations between Pakistan and India.

Mr. Guterres said he had “repeatedly stressed the importance of exercising maximum restraint”.

“I offered my good offices from the beginning. I am ready to help if both countries agree for mediation,” he said.

Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after New Delhi abrogated ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year. India’s decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded its diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian envoy.

India has defended its move, saying the special status provisions only gave rise to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

“The country took the decision of abrogation of Article 370, which had only given separatism and terrorism to that state,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in October last year.

The UN chief said that the issue of Kashmir should be resolved according to UN resolution.

“UNMOGIP (UN Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan) should be given free access. It is already there on the Pakistan side, and it should also be given on the other side,” he said.

“We have taken a position that UN resolutions (on Kashmir) should be implemented, there should be ceasefire (on LoC) and human rights should be respected,” he said.

India maintains that UNMOGIP has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the LoC.

India has rejected any third party intervention to the Kashmir issue and has maintained that all outstanding matters in Indo-Pak ties should be resolved bilaterally.

In August last year, Prime Minister Modi categorically rejected any scope for third party mediation on Kashmir, saying it was a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, and “we don’t want to bother any third country“.

Calling the Kartarpur initiative a “symbol of interfaith harmony, a unique experiment in cross-border ties”, the UN chief said that the opening of the corridor showed “Pakistan’s commitment to peace”.

Mr. Guterres said one of the main purposes of his visit was to “spotlight the real Pakistan, with all its possibilities and potential.”

Mr. Qureshi in his remarks said that he briefed Guterres on the “challenging situation” after India revoked the special status of Kashmir.

He also demanded that UN human rights commissioner should come up with a report on post-August 5 situation in Kashmir.

Earlier on Sunday, the UN Secretary-General was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Munir Akram and senior officials of the Foreign Office and the United Nations in Pakistan on his arrival at the Nur Khan Airbase, Radio Pakistan reported.

According to Pakistan Foreign Office, Mr. Guterres will also hold talks with President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan.

During these meetings, Pakistan will share its perspective on the Kashmir issue, it said.

His other engagements include interactions with parliamentarians and the youth.

He will deliver special talks on themes of sustainable development, climate change and peacekeeping.

Mr. Guterres will also visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev, in Kartarpur.

Guru Nanak Dev spent the last 18 years of his life at Gurduwara Kartarpur Sahib, which has now become the world’s largest Sikh Gurdwara.

The UN chief will speak at the international conference on ‘40 Years of Hosting Afghan Refugees in Pakistan’, which is being organised by Pakistan and the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

World’s first yoga university outside India would start its post graduation course later this year in the US along with research in the ancient Indian practice and the admissions for it will begin in April, university officials said on Saturday.

The Vivekananda Yoga University (VAYU) has established its initial campus in Los Angeles with a budget of $5 million.

Sree Sreenath, a Professor from Case Western University, has been named its president and Indian yoga guru H R Nagendra as its chairman, the university said in a statement.

The programmes would roll out from August 2020, for which the admissions will be starting from April 2020 for the Master’s programme in yoga under the leadership of Sree Sreenath as the founding President, the university said in a statement.

The announcement by the university came within three months of receiving official recognition from the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, California to offer yoga-based higher education programmes in November 2019.

VAYU would facilitate collaborative research, credit transfers and joint programmes with multiple premier universities across the world.

As Swami Vivekananda said education is the manifestation of perfection already in man, VAYU aims at providing man-making and nation-building education by promoting an all-round personality development in students of generation next, Mr. Nagendra said in a statement to PTI.

VAYU is said to be the brain child of Mr. Nagendra, a former scientist from NASA, who has been working on converting yoga into a socially relevant science for the last four decades.

Having started the first Yoga University in India (S-VYASA) in 2002, Mr. Nagendra said he aspires to create a global university for yoga-based higher education combining the best of the East with the best of the West.

The university will help thousands of yoga teachers in the US whose yoga education was limited to 200 or 500 hours of certificate programmes to progress further into university-based higher education, said Prem Bhandari, a member of the VAYU board of directors.

It is further to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was instrumental in getting the UN declaration of International Day of Yoga on June 21st, his yoga guru H R Nagendra’s team’s hard work which made the establishment of a yoga university in US a reality, he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g26pz1/article30834586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YOGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/worlds-first-yoga-university-outside-india-to-start-classes-later-this-year/article30834587.ece
61,2020/02/16,Darfuris rejoice as Sudan agrees to hand Bashir to ICC,"Bashir, who was deposed in April 2019 following mass protests, has for the past decade flouted International Criminal Court arrest warrants on charges of genocide and war crimes in the ravaged Darfur region of western Sudan.

In the sprawling Camp Kalma, refugees displaced by the Darfur conflict are overjoyed at the decision by Sudan's new authorities to finally deliver president Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court.

Bashir, who was deposed in April 2019 following mass protests, has for the past decade flouted International Criminal Court arrest warrants on charges of genocide and war crimes in the ravaged Darfur region of western Sudan.

On Tuesday, Sudan's transitional authorities agreed to transfer him to stand trial before the court based in The Hague.

""There was rejoicing across the camp after people heard Bashir is being handed over to the ICC,"" 65-year-old refugee Adam Ali, a longtime resident of Kalma camp in Nyala, capital of South Darfur state, told AFP.

Darfuris and rebel groups have repeatedly demanded he be handed over to the ICC over alleged war crimes in a conflict which according to the United Nations left 300,000 people dead and displaced 2.5 million others.

Local community leader Yaqoob Mohamed said the decision was ""a victory for the victims"" and would go a long way towards ""rebuilding trust"" with the leadership in Khartoum.

Hundreds of thousands of those displaced by the conflict that broke out in 2003 in Darfur, a vast region made up of five states, still live in camps and remain dependent on aid provided by the UN and other international organisations.

The conflict erupted when African minority rebels rose up against Bashir's Arab-dominated government in Khartoum that they accused of marginalising the region.

To crush the rebellion, Bashir's government unleashed an armed militia of mostly Arab raiding nomads known as the Janjaweed, accused by rights groups of ethnic cleansing and widespread rape.

Thousands of the militiamen were later incorporated into the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by commander and current political powerbroker Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.

- 'Great relief' -The decision to surrender Bashir to the ICC came after protracted talks between rebel groups including from Darfur and Sudan's ruling body who took power after Bashir's ouster and arrest.

Three of his aides, including former defence and interior ministers, are also to be handed over to the court, although a timeframe has not been announced.

""If Bashir and his aides are not handed to the ICC, peace will never find its way to Darfur,"" said Hassan Issac, another Darfuri living in Kalma.

Hassan Isaac Mohamed, a 72-year-old Darfuri, said he felt ""relief"" in the wake of a war that had decimated his family, killing his father and two brothers.

Government spokesman Faisal Mohamed told reporters on Wednesday that ""details of how Bashir and others will be presented in front of the ICC will be discussed with the ICC and armed groups"".

Rights groups such as Amnesty International are pressing for a swift handover of the toppled strongman.

Since its creation in August, Sudan's transitional government has been pushing to forge a peace settlement with rebel groups and to end conflicts across the country.

It has promised accountability and kept Bashir in Khartoum's Kober prison on a string of charges including corruption.

He was removed from power after street protests against his rule broke out in December 2018 triggering unrest that left dozens dead, hundreds wounded and thousands jailed.

64,2020/02/16,"Candy, cheese soar to space station to satisfy crew cravings","Besides the usual experiments and gear, the capsule holds chocolate and three kinds of gummy candy expressly requested by the three station astronauts

A cargo ship rocketed toward the International Space Station on Saturday, carrying candy and cheese to satisfy the astronauts’ cravings.

Northrop Grumman launched its Cygnus capsule from the Virginia seashore. The nearly 4-ton shipment should arrive at the orbiting lab Tuesday. It took three tries over the past week to get the Antares rocket off the pad, with it finally taking flight at 3:21 p.m.— an auspicious 3-2-1.

""Awesome launch,” Joel Montalbano, NASA’s deputy space station program manager, said once the capsule reached orbit.

Besides the usual experiments and gear, the capsule holds cheddar and manchego cheeses, fresh fruit and vegetables, chocolate and three kinds of gummy candy expressly requested by the three station astronauts – Skittles, Hot Tamales, and Mike and Ike’s.

Periodic supply runs by Russia, Japan and NASA’s two private shippers, Northrop Grumman and SpaceX, usually provide more than experiments, equipment, clothes and freeze-dried meals. The capsules also bring family care packages, as well as fresh food to offset the run-of-the-mill station grub.

This latest delivery should have arrived well before Valentine’s Day. But last-minute equipment concerns at the Wallops Island launch pad halted last Sunday’s countdown for the Antares rocket, then bad weather moved in. Dangerously high wind scuttled Friday’s attempt.

This was the company’s 13th space station delivery for NASA. The Cygnus capsules get their name from the Swan Constellation.

This particular Cygnus has been christened the SS Robert H. Lawrence in honor of America’s first black astronaut. Lawrence, an Air Force major, was chosen in 1967 as an astronaut for a classified military space program known as the Manned Orbiting Laboratory. He was killed five months later in a plane crash and never flew in space.

The space station is now home for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan and Russian Oleg Skripochka. Morgan has been up there since July and the two others since September; they’ll remain on board until April. Three other astronauts returned to Earth earlier this month.

Until astronaut launches resume from Florida — possibly by SpaceX this spring — the station crew will be limited in size to three. NASA astronauts now launch on Russian rockets from Kazakhstan.

65,2020/02/16,Multiple rockets hit U.S. coalition base in Baghdad,"The assault sent warning sirens blaring across the high-security diplomatic compound but it was unclear exactly what was hit and how many rockets made impact, the source told AFP.

Multiple rockets hit an Iraqi base hosting American troops near the U.S. embassy early Sunday, the latest in a flurry of attacks against U.S. assets in the country.

“The Coalition confirms small rockets impacted the Iraqi base hosting (coalition) troops in the International Zone... No casualties,” said coalition spokesman Myles Caggins. An Iraqi military statement said three Katyusha rockets had hit the fortified Green Zone which hosts the U.S. Embassy, other foreign missions and Iraqi government buildings. A fourth rocket hit a logistics base in a different neighbourhood operated by the Hashed al-Shaabi, a military network officially incorporated into the Iraqi state, the Iraqi military said.

There was no immediate statement from the Hashed.

19th attack

Strikes on assets of both the U.S. and Hashed at the same time are unusual, as Washington has blamed hardline elements within the military network for repeated rocket attacks on American installations across Iraq.

Sunday’s was the 19th attack since October to target either the Embassy or the roughly 5,200 American troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq. No group has claimed responsibility for any of the incidents. In December, a rocket attack on the northern Iraqi base of K1 left one U.S. contractor dead and unleashed a dramatic series of events.

Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq. Days later, an American drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair’s death but said they would prioritise a political objective first: the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/roghl4/article26419035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-flag,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rocket-attack-hits-near-us-embassy-in-iraq-capital-us-military-source/article30834245.ece
66,2020/02/16,COVID-19 | New China cases drop for third day,"Death toll reaches 1, 665, while more than 68,000 have been infected; Taiwan records first fatality.

The number of new cases from China’s COVID-19 epidemic dropped for a third consecutive day on Sunday, as the World Health Organisation chief warned it was “impossible” to predict how the outbreak would develop.

The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected — but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline. In hardest-hit Hubei, the number of new cases slowed for a third consecutive day and at 139, the number of deaths was level with Saturday’s toll. The number of new cases in other parts of the country has dropped for twelve straight days.

Mi Feng, National Health Commission spokesman, said the figures were a sign that China was controlling the outbreak. “The effects of epidemic prevention and control in various parts of the country can already be seen,” he said.

But the WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that it was “impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take”. “We ask all governments, companies, and news organisations to work with us to sound the appropriate level of alarm without fanning the flames of hysteria,” he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference.

Taiwan reported its first death on Sunday, after a 61-year-old man with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital on Saturday. It is the fifth recorded death outside mainland China — previous victims were in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, and France.

The scale of the epidemic ballooned on Thursday after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day.

Movement restricted

Chinese authorities have placed some 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

Even as China insisted the epidemic was under control, Hubei authorities announced on Sunday a tightening of movement across the province. This includes broad instructions that residential compounds and villages are “sealed off” from unnecessary visitors, with tenants’ outings “strictly managed”, as well as recommending bulk purchases of daily necessities. All non-essential public spaces will also be closed, and residential areas and workplaces with confirmed cases should implement a 14-day quarantine.

Beijing’s municipal government has enacted a rule requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pq1f/article30834220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-death-toll-in-china-exceeds-1600/article30834221.ece

Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement accused the Saudi-led coalition of carrying out retaliatory air strikes on Saturday that killed at least 30 people including civilians.

The United Nations office in Yemen said preliminary field reports indicated that “as many as 31 civilians were killed and 12 others injured in strikes that hit Al-Hayjah area” in Al-Jawf province.

The Health Ministry in Houthi-controlled Al-Jawf province said women and children were among those killed, Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported. It followed a Houthi claim to have downed a coalition Tornado warplane in the area on Friday. But the Saudi-led coalition’s spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said only that a Tornado jet had crashed in Al-Jawf, Saudi state news agency (SPA) reported on Saturday. He later said that rescue operations had been launched and that the possibility of “collateral damages” has been reported, without providing more details.

68,2020/02/16,Ex-'Love Island' host Caroline Flack found dead in London,"A family lawyer said Flack had killed herself and was found in her London apartment.

Caroline Flack, a British television presenter who hosted the controversial reality TV show “Love Island,” has died at age 40, her family said Saturday.

""We can confirm that our Caroline passed away today, the 15th of February,” the family said in a statement. A family lawyer said Flack had killed herself and was found in her London apartment.

Flack hosted “Love Island” from its launch in 2015, but stepped down last year after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton. She denied the charge and was scheduled to stand trial starting next month.

British commercial network ITV, which broadcasts the show, said in a statement that “everybody at ‘Love Island’ and ITV is shocked and saddened by this desperately sad news.”

“Caroline was a much loved member of the ‘Love Island’ team, and our sincere thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends,” the network statement said.

The sixth season of the show is currently airing. The next new episode is due to be broadcast Sunday, although an episode of unseen footage was scheduled to air later on Saturday.

""Love Island” deposits young and attractive contestants in a tropical paradise, where they must pair up or risk being exiled. Critics claim the program puts vulnerable young people under intense scrutiny and pressure, increased by blanket tabloid newspaper coverage of the show.

Two former “Love Island” contestants, Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, died by suicide in 2018 and 2019.

Their deaths renewed a debate about the ethics of reality TV that has raged in the U.K. since producers started making British equivalents of sensationalist American programs like “The Jerry Springer Show” two decades ago, putting ordinary people under a microscope on reality shows such as “Big Brother.”

Reactions

Flack’s career, though, blossomed after she won the BBC show “Strictly Come Dancing” in 2014, the British version of “Dancing With The Stars.” Fellow TV presenters expressed shock over her death Saturday.

Talk show most Piers Morgan tweeted that Flack “was a fun, bright & sparky person whose whole world collapsed recently, both professionally & personally. She told me it had been the worst time of her life, and was clearly struggling to cope with losing everything she held dear. This is such sad, awful news.”

Another well-known host, Eamonn Holmes, tweeted- “Caroline Flack .... Dear God. Shocked beyond belief. May she have found peace . {nldr}Rip Has to be repercussions for Love Island now surely?”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gow6af/article30832929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FLACKKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ex-love-island-host-caroline-flack-found-dead-in-london/article30832930.ece
69,2020/02/16,"Meet Miranda, a mysterious moon","Discovered on February 16, 1948, Miranda, one of Uranus’ moons, is best known for its monstrous appearance. A.S.Ganesh offers you insights into Miranda, a moon that looks like it was pieced together from parts that didn’t really fuse...

Either now, or when you were younger, you would have surely played with jigsaw puzzles. But have you ever tried to piece together parts from different puzzles and see what you can end up with? What if the same thing actually happened on a celestial scale? The result probably would look something like Miranda.

One of Uranus’ five major moons, Miranda is the innermost and smallest among them. It was discovered by Gerard P. Kuiper on February 16, 1948 in telescopic photos of the Uranian system. Kuiper worked at the McDonald Observatory in western Texas and the photos were obtained using the Otto Struve Telescope at the University of Texas in Austin.

Shakespeare connect

Weeks within its discovery, Miranda’s motion around Uranus was confirmed, on March 1, 1948. With Uranus’ previous moons Ariel and Umbriel discovered in 1851, this made Miranda the first satellite of Uranus to be discovered in nearly 100 years.

Like Uranus’ other major moons Oberon, Titania, Ariel and Umbriel, Miranda’s name too was related to the works of English poet William Shakespeare. Miranda was named for the daughter of Prospero in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest.

At about one-seventh the size of our Earth’s moon, Miranda is among the smallest objects in the Solar System to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium. Taking 1.4 days to complete an orbit around Uranus and with an orbital period that is also 34 hours, it is tidally locked with Uranus and hence has the same side facing the planet at all times.

Five features

What makes Miranda mysterious, however, is the fact that it has one of the weirdest and most varied landscapes among all extraterrestrial bodies. Scientists agree upon at least five types of geological features on Miranda. These include craters, coronae (oval-shaped features), regiones (areas strongly differentiated in colour or albedo), rupes (scarps or canyons) and sulci (complex parallel grooved terrain).

There are younger, lightly cratered regions and older, heavily cratered regions on Miranda. There are three large coronae in the southern hemisphere, which are kind of unique among objects known in the solar system. These racetrack-like grooved structures are named Arden, Elsinore and Inverness, all locations in Shakespeare’s plays.

Largest cl iff in Solar System

The largest known cliff in the Solar System is on Miranda and is known as Verona Rupes, named after the setting of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. With the cliff face estimated to be 20 km high, this rupes is as many as 12 times as deep as the Grand Canyon in the U.S.

As Miranda is almost invisible to most amateur telescopes, almost everything we know about it is through the Voyager 2 mission. The only flyby of the Uranian system so far was achieved by Voyager 2 in 1986, providing us with a sneak peek of Miranda’s geology and geography.

Considering only the southern hemisphere of Miranda faced the sun during Voyager 2’s flyby and the northern hemisphere was in darkness, only the southern hemisphere has been studied to some extent. Theories have been proposed and discussed as to what might be the reasons for Miranda’s varied geological features. But these mysteries will be solved only with more information and that might well require further missions to Uranus and its system.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/pz9j2m/article30762304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16istbmiranda2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/meet-miranda-a-mysterious-moon/article30762305.ece

72,2020/02/16,Food Corporation of India agrees to procure paddy from cultivators in Puducherry,"18,000 tonnes to be sourced from Puducherry; move to benefit 25,000 farmers.

In a major relief to around 25,000 farmers, the Food Corporation of India has agreed to procure paddy from Puducherry and Karaikal regions shortly.

In a communication to the Chairman and Managing Director of FCI and Secretary, Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Puducherry, Jai Prakash, Under Secretary to Government of India, on February 11 has conveyed the decision to start the procurement of paddy.

Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan in response to a letter written by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on January 15 requesting market intervention by FCI had given his consent to procure 30,000 tonnes of paddy from Karaikal and Puducherry during Kharif Marketing Season 2019-2020, said Mr. Prakash in his communication to the officials.

It might be recalled that Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan, who also holds the Agriculture portfolio, at the special session of the Assembly on February 12 accused the Lt. Governor of “threatening” FCI chairman for holding talks with the Chief Minister and Minister to discuss paddy procurement.

Gain for farmers

Terming the FCI decision a major gain for the farmers, Mr. Kamalakannan, told The Hindu on Saturday that around 20,000 paddy cultivators in Puducherry and another 4,600 farmers in Karaikal would benefit from the market intervention by FCI. Of the total quantum to be procured, 18,000 tonnes would be from Puducherry and the rest from Karaikal.

On an average per year in three seasons, farmers produced around 99,000 tonnes of paddy in the Union Territory.

The corporation last procured paddy from the U.T. 10 years ago. Since then, the government-run marketing society made attempts to intervene in the market but could not make much strides in stabilising the price because of financial constraints.

The minimum support price for paddy fixed by the Centre was ₹18.35 per kg.

In the absence of government intervention in procurement, paddy farmers were selling their product to private agencies at around ₹15 per kg.

Now, with FCI intervention, the private players will be compelled to increase the price, Mr. Kamalakannan said.

“Even if they are going to procure 30,000 tonnes of the total 99,000 tonnes produced, farmers are going to benefit immensely . So far, they have been incurring loss to the tune of ₹3000 per quintal. The market intervention by FCI will be a major boost,” said Director of Agriculture Bala Gandhi.

Next target

Mr. Kamalakannan said the next target would be to persuade FCI to supply rice to the Civil Supplies Department for free distribution through the Public Distribution System.

The FCI supplied rice to the State governments at a lower price, he said, adding that the administration could save a substantial amount if the corporation supplied rice to U.T. also. The government could renew distribution of rice through PDS outlets instead of remitting money into the beneficiaries account, the Minister added.

“The Chief Minister has already apprised Mr. Paswan on the need to supply rice. After the latest decision of FCI to procure paddy despite objections from certain quarters, we are hopeful of rolling out free distribution of rice,” the Minister said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ovakiy/article30831682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15FEBTHPADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/food-corporation-of-india-agrees-to-procure-paddy-from-cultivators-in-puducherry/article30831683.ece

76,2020/02/16,"Akkulam Lake shrank by 1,727 cents since 2003","GIS survey maps current condition of lake

A geographic information system (GIS) survey of Akkulam Lake and its periphery has found that 1,727 cents of the lake area has been lost since 2003.

The survey was undertaken as part of the first phase of the Mission Akkulam lake restoration project. Mission Akkulam is an offshoot of Revive Vellayani, a drive by the Swasthi Foundation and the State government.

The GIS survey, conducted by P.G. Vinod, S. Nalinakumar, and V.R. Remya using state-of-the-art satellite imagery, focussed on mapping the current condition of a stretch of Akkulam Lake from the Akkulam boat club to the Akkulam bridge, covering an area of 39.36 hectares.

The survey report highlights the loss of geographic area of the lake. From 46.37 ha in 2003, the lake shrunk to 40.77 ha in 2011 and 39.38 ha in 2019.

Human activities

The report also details the impact of human activities on the lake. Streams such as the Kannammoola, formed by the confluence of the Ulloor and Pattom streams and the Amayizhanchan canal, and the Kulathur stream drain into the lake. Numerous houses and slums are situated along these streams. Sewage from the houses, domestic waste, and industrial waste have polluted these streams and the lake.

Today, the lake is clogged with water hyacinth. The sides of the lake are polluted by dumped garbage, burnt plastic, covers, and even construction waste. Unused boats, all rusty, make matters worse.

Without proper sewerage in areas surrounding the lake, sewage gets dumped into the lake. Hospital waste too is a source of pollution. A bund built for the construction of Akkulam bridge in 2000 has not been removed till now. This prevents free movement of water from the lake to the sea, leading to proliferation of the hyacinth.

Highly polluted

A water quality analysis of a sample collected from near the boat club found that the water was highly polluted.

The report, prepared following a month-long research and survey by the research team of the Swasthi Foundation, was released recently in the chamber of Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran who is also the chairman of Mission Akkulam.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/akkulam-lake-shrank-by-1727-cents-since-2003/article30832484.ece
77,2020/02/16,"From discarded coir pith, emerged a kitchen bin","Around two and a half decades ago, Joshy Cherian quit his job as a botany professor, bought a piece of land at Anthiyur, near Pollachi, to become a farmer. But the challenging geography and water scarcity proved to be roadblocks. He noticed that large amounts of coir pith, thrown out as waste from de-fibreing units, was being burned in those regions.

“I thought of ideas to make use of this material. It later became by PhD thesis, as I found a method to process it, clean it and compact it into brick form. I landed upon an export opportunity for this, as the material was much sought after for home garden and similar uses in Australia and other countries,” says Mr. Cherian.

The humidity factor

It was this experience with processing coir pith that came in handy for him in developing the kitchen bins and inoculum, now being used by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and other local bodies for decentralised waste management. Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the three-day National Conference of Cities for Zero Waste, organised by the city Corporation, he said the high humidity in Kerala was a challenge for wet waste management.

“If moisture is not maintained correctly, bad odour will emanate from the bin because of the humidity. The coir pith, one kilogram of which can absorb 10 kg of water, comes in handy here. Earlier, we had experimented with holes-ridden cement bags, because aeration is needed for processing waste. Later, we tried a plastic bucket, but rats damaged them. Now we use a polypropylene material. The pilot project was in 2,000 houses in Thiruvananthapuram, four years ago. It was soon expanded,” he says.

He says that changing the mindset of the public, to make them realise the importance of processing their own household waste, is the success of any decentralised model.

“In the first level, the public, passionate about environment and waste management, adopts it easily. But, the next level is the key. In Kerala, because this has now almost become a mandatory situation, we are seeing such large numbers of kitchen bin adoption. The convenience of use, in the end, decides how many would adopt it,” he says.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/h3o900/article30832448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvtv,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/from-discarded-coir-pith-emerged-a-kitchen-bin/article30832449.ece
78,2020/02/16,A mix vital in waste management: Isaac,"‘Where centralised plant is not feasible, decentralised plant should be used’

Making it clear that the State government cannot rule out centralised waste treatment plants, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said that a judicious mix of decentralised and centralised systems will be the ideal model to meet the future challenges in waste management. He was speaking at a session on ‘Solid waste management in Thiruvananthapuram — Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,’ as part of the three-day National Conference of Cities for Zero Waste, organised by the city Corporation here on Saturday.

“The government’s stand is that the centralised plants cannot be avoided, but the decentralised model can continue in places where it is not feasible,” he said.

The Minister lashed out at the Green Tribunal and the Pollution Control Board (PCB), for raising ‘baseless objections’ to the successful decentralised model in local bodies such as the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. He said that several entrepreneurs had now come up, operating pig farms and other such facilities, which are in need of large amounts of waste. Some bodies such as the PCB had attempted to stop even the transport of waste to such facilities.

He said that the government’s aim this year was to make 500 panchayats and 50 towns waste-free. “The work towards declaring the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation as ‘clean’ on August 15 this year is progressing. This will be the year in which a process which we began in 2012 will finally become a success,” said Dr. Isaac.

Sanitation history

R. Ajayakumar Varma, former scientist, National Centre for Earth Science Studies, laid out the sanitation history of Thiruvananthapuram, right from the formation of a town improvement trust in the erstwhile State of Travancore in 1870. He traced the history through the adoption of bucket-type latrines in 7,427 houses, employing 228 manual scavengers in 1900, mandating street cleaning in 1920, construction of 32 public toilets in 1940, formation of scavengers’ union in 1946 and their strikes for various demands, replacement in bucket latrines in 1959, building of latrines in 80% houses by 1991, the opening and closure of the Vilappilsala plant to the current state of the decentralised model.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/v4gjm1/article30832419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVTVSEMINAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-mix-vital-in-waste-management-isaac/article30832421.ece

80,2020/02/16,Prominence of IT professionals specified at first convocation of IIIT-Tiruchi,"TIRUCHI

The first convocation of Indian Institute of Information Technology - Tiruchi on Saturday witnessed speakers apprising graduands of the emerging opportunities and their role.

Forty-four graduands of Computer Science Engineering and 25 of Electronics and Communication Engineering were awarded degrees in the presence of the Chairman of the Board of Governors K. Shanmugam, Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu; and other prominent members of the Board of Governors.

Delivering the convocation address, Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT-Madras, said IT professionals will have a prominent role to play in seeing through dominance of renewables over fossil fuel over the next 10 to 15 years.

A lot needs to be done in the area of storage to enable renewables to become the dominent source of energy. Similarly, most of India's vehicles will be running on electric power by 2030. Electric aircraft will not be too far behind.

“Your ability to learn new things, train and adapt yourself quickly, can get you to lead the world,” Prof. Jhunjhunwala said.

Artificial Intelligence was another technological advancement in recent years that was directly related to the IT field. Continue to learn in the fast-changing technological world, Prof. Jhunjhunwala told the graduands.

81,2020/02/16,Purpose of Kallikudi market tweaked,"A portion to be allotted to the Farmers Producers Organisations

In a major move, the State government has proposed to allot a portion of the Central Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers at Kallikudi, situated about 12 km away from the city off Tiruchi-Madurai national highway, to the Farmers Producers Organisations.

The move assumes significance against the backdrop of the defiant opposition by the traders of Gandhi Market to shift their businesses to the newly built market at Kallikudi. It otherwise means that the new market, which was built in the wake of growing demand for shifting the traders of Gandhi Market to a more spacious location, will no longer serve the original purpose.

Highly placed sources told The Hindu that the Commissioner of Agricultural Market, S.J. Chiru, who visited the Kallikudi market a few weeks ago, had submitted a proposal to the Agricultural Secretary on ways and means to utilise the facility.

He had placed his recommendation for allotting a portion of the market to the Farmers Producers Organisations. Depending upon their requirements, the space could be used for either storage purposes and exhibiting their produce for sales.

The sources added that as per the recommendation, out of 19 blocks, 5 blocks could be earmarked to the Farmers Producers Organisations. It would be a win win situation for both the farmers, who were associated with the FPOs, and the Agricultural Marketing department that owned the Kallikudi market. Suitable rent could be collected from the FPOs for utilising the shops.

The recommendations came up for discussion when Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam visited the Kallikudi market along with Collector S. Sivarasu on Saturday. Mr. Shanmugam asked the Collector to explore various options to make use of the facility, which remains unused since 2017.

The idea to build a central market at Kallikudi emerged when former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa represented Srirangam Assembly constituency in 2014. It soon became a reality with the construction of over 1000 shops spread over 10 acre. It was built with financial assistance from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and a sum of ₹77 crore has been spent for the sprawling market at Kallikudi.

The market was declared opened on September,5,2017. Citing long distance from the city, most of Gandhi market traders refused to move to the new market. After several rounds of discussions and persuasions by the district administration, just 5 traders began their business at the Kallikudi market on June,30,2018. They also shut down their businesses within a few days due to poor patronage.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/pp71w6/article30836601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY17NEWMARKETCOMPLEX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/purpose-of-kallikudi-market-tweaked/article30836602.ece
82,2020/02/16,Corporation drops plan to establish bus stand at Srirangam,"Site identified site at Panchakarai on Kollidam embankment to be made a parking lot

The City Corporation has dropped the plan to establish a bus stand at Srirangam. Officials say the identified site near Yatri Nivas at Panchakarai on the Kollidam embankment will be made a parking lot.

The civic body had earlier identified the 6.6-acre site for establishing the bus stand and also readied a detailed project report entailing ₹ 23 crore investment. However, the plan has been changed as it falls outside of the ambit of the smart city mission plan for the year, officials said.

S. Sivasubramanian, City Corporation Commissioner, told The Hindu that during discussions with citizens and officials, it was noticed that a parking lot was necessary. Vehicles bringing the devotees occupy the sides of roads leading to Srirangam on auspicious days, and so, the parking lot would be a relief, he said. The parking lot could also be used as a bus shelter, he said.

The civic body has also adopted some sustainable measures to construct the parking lot by using materials from the redevelopment work of the Chathram bus stand.

“We are using the soil which was dug up from the bus stand to level the ground as it lies in a low-lying area. The steel rods from the dismantled structures at Chathiram Bus Stand will also be reused in the parking lot,” he said.

A section of residents welcomed the move saying the location was perceived as unsuitable for a bus stand.

“The northern bank has no traffic flow. Vehicles travel via Amma Mandapam and that is where a bus stand is required,” said N. Ramakrishnan, a civic activist.

The civic body must clear all encroachments first, he said, adding that a spot near Rajagopuram would be ideal for a bus stand.

“Buses can ply from Srirangam to cities like Chennai and Madurai as also to smaller places like Manapparai and Perambalur,” he added. Lack of political representation to the Chief Minister is the reason for the plan being dropped, Mr. Ramakrishnan said. “The Ministers must take the demands of the people to Chennai,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/kqzp8w/article30836523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY17PROPOSEDSITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/corporation-drops-plan-to-establish-bus-stand-at-srirangam/article30836524.ece

Collector M. Govinda Rao on Saturday said the district had so far procured close to 1.75 lakh tonnes of paddy as against the target of six lakh tonnes set for this season.

The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation was equipped with sufficient gunny bags to sustain the momentum of procurement, he told mediapersons after inspecting a direct procurement centre at Thingalur in Thiruvaiyaru block on Saturday.

Paddy procurement was progressing on expected lines, with the maximum daily procurement limit at DPCs increased to 1,000 bags a day from 800 to expedite the process.

Further, additional staff and machinery were deployed in five DPCs in the district where arrivals were more, necessitating procurement of paddy beyond the restricted number of 1,000 gunny bags per day.

90,2020/02/16,Muslim organisations hold anti-CAA demonstrations in delta districts,"They condemn police action on protesters at Washermenpet in Chennai

Members of various Muslim outfits on Saturday blocked traffic on Madurai Road and Gandhi Market Road at Palakkarai in the heart of the city condemning the police action on anti-CAA protesters at Washermenpet in Chennai on Friday.

When they began to assemble at Palakkarai in the morning, police asked them not to disturb vehicular movement. Though they relented for a while and gathered on Sub Jail Road, they then blocked the entire road at Palakarai.

They raised slogans against the Central government for enacting what they described as an oppressive Act.

They also blamed the ruling AIADMK government for supporting the CAA in Parliament. They indulged in sloganeering against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

Traffic on Madurai Road was thrown out of gear for more than two hours on Saturday due to the protest. Buses bound for Chathiram Bus Stand were diverted via Bheema Nagar. It caused traffic snarls at various parts of the city. Several shops and business establishments run by Muslims were closed in view of the protest.

Condemning the attack on protesters at Washermenpet, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi leader M.H. Jawahirullah said several persons, mostly women, had sustained injuries. The attack on peaceful protesters could not be accepted. The high-handedness of the police could in no way dilute the spirited and spontaneous protests of the people.

The Chief Minister should take action on police officers responsible for the attack, he added.

Tiruvarur

Demonstrations by anti-CAA protesters that began on Friday night continued on Saturday in major towns of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts.

In Tiruvarur district, police detained over 1,000 persons assembled in groups on thoroughfares in Tiruvarur town and Muthupettai to express protest against police action on a crowd of protesters at Washermenpet in Chennai.

91,2020/02/16,Champions league | Atletico faces a rampant Liverpool,"Now or never for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City

Liverpool returns to the scene of its Champions League triumph when it visits Atletico Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano on Tuesday very much the team to beat for those hoping to succeed Jurgen Klopp’s men as European champion.

Liverpool is coasting towards a first Premier League title in 30 years having dropped just two points all season and is likely to be crowned English champion before the Champions League quarterfinals commence in early April.

Liverpool remains on course for a potential five-trophy haul this season. It has already lifted the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup and is used to reaching European finals under Klopp.

The German has overseen three in four seasons at Anfield, losing the Europa League final to Sevilla in 2016 and Champions League to Real Madrid two years later before getting over the line against Tottenham in the Spanish capital last year.

“I have no clue if we can win the Champions League again but we should be ready to go for it,” said Klopp. “What I know and what we showed last year is that we can beat the best.”

On current form Atletico is little match for the holder.

Languishing

For the first time in over eight years in charge, the future of Diego Simeone has been questioned with Los Rojiblancos languishing well off the pace in LaLiga and battling just to qualify for next season’s Champions League.

A chronic struggle to score goals has hampered Simeone’s side all season.

Joao Felix has failed to deliver on his $138 million price tag and the Portuguese wonder kid is a doubt for Tuesday’s first leg.

By contrast, Liverpool has hit the money with almost every major signing in recent years.

With Alisson Becker, Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah it has built a side capable of not just winning, but retaining the Champions League.

Miserly defence

Simeone’s Atletico sides that came so close to winning the competition in losing two finals to rival Real Madrid in 2014 and 2016 were built on the most miserly defence.

But even the Argentine would be impressed by Liverpool’s run of winning its last 11 league games by the combined score of 24-1.

Across the continent, no other side looks as well-balanced and settled heading into the latter stages.

Manchester City’s stunning two-season ban from the competition handed down by UEFA on Friday means it could be now or never if the English champions are ever to conquer Europe with Pep Guardiola in charge.

However, City is running into a rejuvenated Real Madrid in the last 16, which has shot to the top of LaLiga on a 14-game unbeaten run.

Zinedine Zidane has again revived the Spanish giants in his second spell in charge and is yet to lose a Champions League tie after winning the competition during his previous three seasons in charge.

Heartbreaks

Paris Saint-Germain also begin its quest to overcome three years of heartbreak at the last 16 stage on Tuesday when it visits Borussia Dortmund.

Dortmund has the firepower to cause former coach Thomas Tuchel more Champions League pain in free-scoring new signing Erling Braut Haaland, who already has eight goals in the competition this season as a Red Bull Salzburg player.

Barcelona lurches from one institutional crisis to another and has a new coach, Quique Setien, with no previous Champions League experience for a tricky tie against Napoli.

Kind draw

The success or otherwise of Juventus’ season will also be judged on winning the Champions League for the first time in 24 years.

A kind last-16 draw against Lyon should give Maurizio Sarri more time to turn the Italian champion into potential conqueror of Europe, but big questions are already being asked of Sarri’s suitability for that target as Juve is struggling to hold off Inter Milan and Lazio to preserve its domestic dominance in Italy.Bayern Munich’s grip on the Bundesliga is also being challenged this season, but the German giant will be confident of gaining revenge for losing the 2012 Champions League final on home soil to Chelsea, which has just four of its last 13 Premier League games.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/8tronn/article30837029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17SIM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-atletico-faces-a-rampant-liverpool/article30837030.ece
92,2020/02/16,Financial rules at risk of being ‘scuppered’,"This could happen if Man City overturns European ban

European football’s financial fair play rules risk being “scuppered” if Manchester City overturns its two-season ban from continental competition, according to a soccer analyst.

Since the Sheikh Mansour takeover in 2008, which put the financial might of Abu Dhabi behind it, City has won 10 major trophies — including four Premier League titles.

Yet the prize that has eluded it is the one the Abu Dhabi project most desires — the UEFA Champions League.

The Chinese government has provided City with additional backing, as has US private equity firm Silver Lake.

They are all set to ensure City has a no expense spared legal team that will challenge the validity of UEFA’s ruling.

Should City succeed, the entire FFP system could collapse, according to Professor Simon Chadwick, director at the Centre for the Eurasian Sport Industry.

“In essence UEFA has to try to win this because, if it doesn’t win or is undermined in any way, then its position on Financial Fair Play begins to unravel... FFP is scuppered,” Chadwick told Britain’s Press Association news agency.

“However, they are not taking on Wigan, they are taking on Asian governments, US tech investors and some of the smartest, most-talented people in football.

“It is transnational power versus localised governance.”

UEFA’s take

UEFA says City has breached FFP rules that place restrictions on how much money a club can lose.

Over a three-year period, clubs are not permitted to lose more than €30 million with exceptions for costs such as youth development and women’s teams.

UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body found City ensured it did not fall foul of those restrictions by overstating its sponsorship revenue between 2012 and 2016.

Exodus of stars?

If City’s appeal fails, manager Pep Guardiola and several star players could leave the club.

Guardiola’s contract runs until the end of the 2020/21 season, but the only major task left for the Catalan in Manchester is to make City European champion for the first time.

City plays Real Madrid in the last 16 of this season’s edition and if the campaign ends with the club yet to lift the Champions League trophy, Guardiola may bow out rather than compete for domestic honours alone.

Similarly, players of the calibre of Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling are unlikely to want to waste two of their peak years without the lure of Champions League football.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/2899m5/article30836965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17PEP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/financial-rules-at-risk-of-being-scuppered/article30836966.ece

A resolute TRAU FC held defending champion Chennai City FC to a goalless draw in a Hero I-League match here on Sunday.

TRAU goalkeeper Shayan Roy was magnificent under the bar to deny the visitors three points.

TRAU earned a penalty in the 13th minute when Ajith Kumar was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the 18-yard box. Skipper Princewill Emeka stepped in but his effort hit the woodwork, thus squandering a glorious opportunity.

With this result, TRAU rose to the fourth spot with 16 points, while Chennai City slipped to seventh with 15 points.

94,2020/02/16,Liverpool opens up 25-point lead,"Super-sub Pasalic hits winner for Atalanta

Sadio Mane struck as Liverpool overcame Storm Dennis and feisty basement club Norwich 1-0 to extend its lead at the top of the Premier League table to 25 points.

Jurgen Klopp’s champion-elect was short of its fluent best in windy conditions at Carrow Road on Saturday but returned immediately to winning ways after its winter break.

Liverpool has gone 43 top-flight matches unbeaten, just six matches behind Arsenal’s record of 49 games in 2003-04 and is sprinting towards its first league title for 30 years.

“They caused us a few problems but overall I thought it was another good performance and we got the goal to get us the three points,” Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson told Sky Sports.

The result leaves Daniel Farke’s Norwich rooted to the bottom of the table, six points behind 19th-placed Watford. It looks set for an immediate return to the Championship despite its battling performance.

Atalanta beats Roma

Mario Pasalic scored the winner seconds after coming off the bench as Atalanta came from behind to beat Roma 2-1 and consolidate fourth place in Serie A at the expense of its Champions League rival from the capital.

The Croatia midfielder came on just before the hour mark on Saturday to fire in the crucial goal 19 seconds later, to boost confidence ahead of his side’s first ever Champions League last 16 game against Valencia, not at its home 21,300-seater Gewiss Stadium, but at the much larger San Siro next week.

“This is an important victory,” said Atalanta coach Gianpiero Gasperini.

“Against a side like Roma this advantage is not definitive. They are a strong team, but in us there is the belief that we can finish in front.”

The results: Premier League: Aston Villa 2 (Alderweireld 9-og, Engels 53) lost to Tottenham 3 (Alderweireld 27, Son 45+2, 90+4)

Liverpool's Sadio Mane marked his return from injury with a late goal to crack Norwich City's resistance and secure a 1-0 win on Saturday to extend his side's Premier League lead to 25 points.

Bottom club Norwich were proving a tough nut to crack on a windy evening for Juergen Klopp's side but Mane, who came on as a substitute on the hour, pounced to drill home a fine finish from inside the area in the 78th minute.

It was his first appearance since going off injured in Liverpool's win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Jan. 23.

Norwich had defended resolutely and twice came close to taking the lead, but Liverpool's relentless romp towards a first English title for 30 years continued.

Victory was their 34th in their last 35 league games and their 17th in succession.

97,2020/02/16,Discoms move to put in place real-time monitoring system,"Idea is to ensure quality nine -hour supply to the agriculture sector

Andhra Pradesh power distribution companies (Discoms) are exploring the possibility of putting in place a real-time monitoring system and creating additional infrastructure for enhancing the quality of three-phase free power supply for nine hours to the agriculture sector.

It will aid in the detection of overloading of Distribution Transformers (DTRs) and other technical snags and facilitate immediate rectification.

The proposed system also helps in measuring agriculture consumption accurately and energy audit efficiently.

Monthly reports

Besides, the Discoms are gearing up to submit monthly reports on the metering status of DTRs, feeders and consumers to the Central Electricity Authority as per the directions of the Union Ministry of Power, according to official sources.

Minister for Energy Balineni Srinivasa Reddy issued instructions to the officials of power utilities to take necessary steps for improving the supply to farm sector which topped government’s priority list, pointing out that the government fulfilled its commitment to provide ₹10,061 crore towards the subsidy to agriculture services for 2020-21.

Mounting losses

Officials of the Energy Department informed the Minister that the losses of power utilities which stood at ₹7,070 crore as on March 31, 2014, reached a whopping ₹33,420 crore by the end of December 2019. The operational and capital expenditure of utilities also increased manifold.

The Minister said the Discoms had to face a severe financial crisis due to high-cost renewable energy purchases and unavoidable payment of fixed-costs to thermal power generators to accommodate the high-cost renewable power. However, the government was striving to enable the Discoms to achieve the much-needed turnaround.

Energy Secretary N. Srikant said in spite of the hardships, efforts were being made to improve efficiencies and reduce costs and pass the benefit to consumers.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/2kjvbk/article30839906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17ONG4BALINENI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/discoms-move-to-put-in-placereal-time-monitoring-system/article30837202.ece

All the students aged 18 or above who signed up were marked with indelible ink on their forefingers to avoid duplication of registrations.

IRCS AP chapter chairman A. Sridhar Reddy said that about 30,000 students of different age groups came to register as planned and only majors were allowed to make the pledge by signing up papers, he said.

In all, 10, 573 students signed up and the Guinness Book Records observer present at the event declared 10, 217 registrations valid.

102,2020/02/16,About 92% of large taxpayers filed annual returns for 2017-18: GSTN,"This is the first time businesses registered under the GST have to file an annual return, GSTR-9, and a reconciliation statement, GSTR-9C, after the tax was launched 2017

The GST Network (GSTN) on Sunday said around 92% of large taxpayers with a turnover of over ₹2 crore have filed annual returns for the 2017-18 fiscal.

This is the first time businesses registered under the goods and services tax (GST) have to file an annual return, GSTR-9, and a reconciliation statement, GSTR-9C, after the tax was launched on July 1, 2017.

“Statistics show that out of the eligible large taxpayers, 91.3% had filed their annual returns by February 12, 2020. Similarly, 92.3% eligible large taxpayers had filed their reconciliation statement before the said date,” the GSTN said in a statement.

While the annual return filing is optional for taxpayers having an annual turnover of up to ₹2 crore, the same is mandatory for those having an annual turnover of above ₹2 crore. Such taxpayers are also required to file a reconciliation certificate known as the GSTR-9C, which can be filed only after filing the GSTR-9.

Data shows that the number of taxpayers with a turnover of more than ₹2 crore is 12.42 lakh, which is only 13.4% of the total 92.58 lakh regular taxpayers.

This means around 80.16 lakh taxpayers are not mandated to file annual returns.

The GSTN statistics, however, showed that 1.04 lakh taxpayers who had an annual turnover of up to ₹2 crore have filed reconciliation statements.

The top three States where businesses registered under GST (Goods and Services Tax) recorded the maximum return filings are Maharashtra (96%) followed by Rajasthan and Gujarat (95% each).

The last date for filing the GSTR-9 and the 9C was staggered for various States and was February 3, 5 and 7.

“The taxpayers who have not filed by the due date can still file the returns for 2017-18, but will be required to pay the late fee,” the GSTN said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/o2h9ul/article30835344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THLTGST,https://www.thehindu.com/business/about-92-of-large-taxpayers-filed-annual-returns-for-2017-18-gstn/article30835345.ece
103,2020/02/16,"Oil India to move TDSAT against DoT seeking ₹48,489 crore","Non-telecom firms such as OIL, GAIL and PowerGrid filed clarificatory petition on applicability of the October 24 order on them

State-owned Oil India is likely to move the TDSAT this week against the telecom department, seeking about ₹48,500 crore in past dues on the surplus bandwidth capacity it had leased to third parties, its Chairman and Managing Director Sushil Chandra Mishra has said.

Other non-telecom firms, which have also been slapped with similar demands, too are likely to move the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).

Those likely to go to the TDSAT include gas utility GAIL India Ltd, from whom ₹1.83 lakh crore has been sought, Power Grid Corp that has been slapped with ₹21,953.65 crore liability and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd which faces a payout of ₹15,019.97 crore.

Also read: Why is the telecom sector under stress?

Following the Supreme Court ruling of October 24, 2019 that non-telecom revenues should be included for considering payments of the government dues by firms holding any sort of telecom license, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) slapped ₹1.47 lakh crore demand on mobile phone operators such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd and another ₹2.7 lakh crore from non-telecom firms.

Non-telecom firms such as OIL, GAIL and PowerGrid filed clarificatory petition on applicability of the October 24 order on them, but the apex court on February 14 asked them to approach the appropriate authority.

“As per our licence condition, any dispute has to be referred to TDSAT and so we will be approaching TDSAT within a weeks time,” Mishra told PTI.

On February 14, the Supreme Court had pulled up the DoT for not enforcing its October 24 order that gave telcos three months time to pay dues. Hours later, the DoT sent notices to Airtel and Vodafone Idea asking them to clear dues immediately but hadn’t so far raised such demand with non-telecom companies, industry sources said.

OIL, the nation’s second biggest state-owned oil producer, holds a National Long Distance Service Licence (NLD) with primary objective of monitoring and operation of its pipeline network.

The surplus bandwidth capacity available with the company was leased out to the telecom operators/other users, on which the company regularly paid the applicable license fee to the telecom department (DoT).

But after the October 24 Supreme Court ruling for including non-telecom revenues for calculating dues, the DoT included all revenues from oil and gas to seek ₹48,489 crore from the company for the period from 2007-08 to 2018-19.

OIL believes that the October 24 judgement was not applicable to the company and had represented to the DoT stating that the demand raised is not sustainable either in law or on facts as the nature of licence in case of telecom service providers is different and distinct from the licences given to the company, Mishra said.

In case of GAIL, which held a IP-II licence, the DoT assessed ₹1,83,076 crore as outstanding after including interest and penalty computed on the entire revenue of the company.

PowerGrid, which holds NLD and Internet Service Provider (ISP) licences, was asked to pay ₹21,953.65 crore (including interest and penalty) for FY 2012-13 to FY 2017-18 by adding revenue related to power transmission and consultancy as ‘miscellaneous income’ in adjusted gross revenue, company sources said, adding the firm will approach the TDSAT in next few days.

Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd, which had a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) and a Category ‘A’ ISP, was asked to pay ₹15,019.97 crores for financial year 2005-06 to 2018-19.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/i37x0h/article30834694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1920px-OilIndiaLogoz,https://www.thehindu.com/business/oil-india-to-move-tdsat-against-dot-seeking-48489/article30834695.ece

Opposition leaders on Sunday slammed the Delhi police and the Centre after a CCTV footage of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) library where police personnel, along with paramilitary forces, were seen beating up students, went viral.

Sharing the CCTV footage (recording the event of December 15, 2019) on Twitter, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the government’s intentions would stand exposed if no action is taken against the ‘erring’ policemen.

Ms. Vadra also accused the Home Minister and the Delhi Police of ‘lying’ that Jamia students were not beaten up inside the library.

“Look at how Delhi Police is blindly assaulting students in the library. A boy is flashing his book but the policeman is continuing to attack him with batons. Home Minister and Delhi Police lied when they said students were not beaten up in the library. If no action is taken even after watching this Jamia video, the government’s intentions would stand exposed before the whole country,” Ms. Vadra tweeted in Hindi.

The 48-second video purportedly shows some seven to eight security personnel entering the Old Reading Hall and beating up students with batons.

“CCTV footage has emerged showing police assaulting Jamia students without provocation. Horrifying. Exemplary punishment must be levied on these lawless policemen,” tweeted Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also shared the 48 seconds video and tweeted, “Police sponsored hooliganism under a fascist Modi government.”

“It has exposed the excesses committed by the Delhi police and the horrific attack on students. Delhi police are directly under Home Minister Amit Shah and now he must tell the nation what action is being taken against the policemen who did this,” CPI General Secretary D. Raja told The Hindu.

The official handle of the CPI(M) also demanded action against the police personnel. “This is what Delhi Police did in Jamia that day. #ShameonDelhiPolice.

After the Rahul Gandhi ordinance-trashing episode of 2013, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked Montek Singh Ahluwalia whether he thought he should resign, the former Deputy Chairman of the now-defunct Planning Commission said.

Mr. Ahluwalia said he told Dr. Singh, who was then on a visit to the U.S., that he did not think a resignation on this issue was appropriate.

Mr. Gandhi had denounced the ordinance brought by the UPA dispensation to negate a Supreme Court verdict on convicted lawmakers. He had termed it as “complete nonsense” that should be “torn up and thrown away.” Dr. Singh, while returning home, had ruled out his resignation though he appeared piqued over the entire episode.

“I was part of the Prime Minister’s delegation in New York and my brother Sanjeev, who had retired from the IAS, telephoned to say he had written a piece that was very critical of Dr. Singh. He had emailed it to me and said he hoped I didn’t find it embarrassing,” recalled Mr. Ahluwalia.

The article was widely reported in the media with reference to the author being Mr. Ahluwalia’s brother.

“The first thing I did was to take the text across to the Prime Minister’s suite because I wanted him to hear about it first from me. He read it in silence and, at first, made no comment. Then, he suddenly asked me whether I thought he should resign,” Mr. Ahluwalia writes in his new book “Backstage: The Story behind India’s High Growth Years.”

“I thought about it for a while and said I did not think a resignation was appropriate. I wondered then, whether I was simply saying what I thought he would like to hear but on reflection I am convinced I gave him honest advice,” he reasoned.

“Most of my friends agreed with Sanjeev. They felt the Dr. Singh had for too long accepted the constraints under which he had to operate and this had tarnished his reputation. The rubbishing of the ordinance was seen as demeaning the office of the Prime Minister and justified resigning on principle.

106,2020/02/16,Analysis | Arvind Kejriwal wants to get on with governance now,"Signalling his desire to end the politics of confrontation, the AAP chief says he wants to work with everyone

Arvind Kejriwal sounded more chief ministerial as he commenced his third term as Delhi’s chief executive in less than seven years. In his speech to tens of thousands of people at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday after being sworn-in, Mr. Kejriwal sounded mellow, confident and aware of the challenges ahead.

As the huge crowd listened with rapt attention, the Aam Aadmi Party chief made it clear that he intended to work closely with the Central government to develop Delhi, quite unlike the confrontation that marked his second term in office.

Mr. Kejriwal himself, his Ministers and at least a score of AAP MLAs were targeted in his last term by Central agencies and the Delhi police in an effort to browbeat the Delhi government, but these efforts came a cropper.

“I want to work with everyone,” the Chief Minister announced, pointing out that he had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the swearing-in function on Sunday, but the Prime Minister could not make it due to other commitments. Mr. Kejriwal went to the extent of saying that he wanted the blessings of the Prime Minister to develop Delhi.

Underlining the change in tack, no Chief Minister from any Opposition-run State was invited to Sunday’s ceremony, sending a clear signal that Mr. Kejriwal was not interested in beginning his third term on a confrontational note.

Given the multiple sources of authority in Delhi and the fact that the Delhi police are very much under the firm control of the Union Home Ministry, Mr. Kejriwal’s effort appears to be able to get on with the job of governance.

Dikshit’s playbook

Former Congress Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who worked under this same system, took pains to ensure that she worked with the Centre under two Prime Ministers — Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the BJP and Manmohan Singh of the the Congress. Mr. Kejriwal is, perhaps, taking a leaf out of the late Chief Minister’s book.

By retaining the same Cabinet as in 2015, the Chief Minister has signalled continuity and also put the lid on the ambitions of new contenders. Many analyses after the current Assembly election suggest that women workers turned out in large numbers and it remains to be seen what role Mr. Kejriwal gives to the women elected as MLAs on AAP ticket.

Given his stress on governance and delivery (kaam ki rajiniti as he has called it time and again), expectations from Mr. Kejriwal and his team are sky high as he commences his third term.

Mr. Kejriwal also stressed he had forgiven his opponents for all the name calling and allegations during the campaign, and promised to be the Chief Minister for all voters irrespective of political affiliation, religion, caste or whether they were poor or rich.

The AAP Chief Minister will be closely watched, but his solid political support cutting across religion, caste, class and ethnicity will stand him in good stead.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1nhta7/article30836508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AAP-supporter,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-arvind-kejriwal-wants-to-get-on-with-governance-now/article30836509.ece
107,2020/02/16,"Education and affluence drive families to divorce, says Mohan Bhagwat","With education and affluence comes arrogance, as a result of which families fall apart, the RSS chief says.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on February 16 said the cases of divorce are found more in “educated and affluent” families nowadays as education and affluence brings arrogance along, which results in families falling apart.

Mr. Bhagwat also said that there is no alternative to a Hindu society in India. He was addressing RSS workers in Ahmedabad.

“Nowadays the number of divorce cases have increased a lot. People fight over trifle issues. The cases of divorce are more in educated and affluent families, because with education and affluence comes arrogance, as a result of which families fall apart. The society also falls apart because society is also a family,” Mr. Bhagwat was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the RSS.

“We expect swayamsevaks to tell their family members about their activities in the Sangh, because many times women members of the family have to carry out more painful work than us to ensure that we can do what we do,” he said.

Mr. Bhagwat said confining women to homes has resulted in the condition of the society that we see today. “The condition of the society is because of the customs that have been practising here for the last 2,000 years. Women we have here were confined to homes. This was not the case 2,000 years ago. That was the golden age of our society,” he said.

“Hindu society should be virtuous and organised, and when we say society, it is not only men. A society is the one which gets its identity due to its sense of belonging,” he said.

“I am a Hindu, I respect the places of reverence associated with all faiths. But I am firm regarding my own place of reverence. I have got my sanskar from my family, and it is matru shakti, which teaches us so,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.

“There is no society without a household, and women, who comprise half of the society, should become more enlightened. But if we do not care about our society, then neither will we survive, nor our family,” he said.

“India has no option other than a Hindu society and Hindu society has no option but to behave like a family,” the RSS chief said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q4g3ts/article30836307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHAGWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/education-and-affluence-drive-families-to-divorce-says-mohan-bhagwat/article30836308.ece
108,2020/02/16,Election Commission of India working on remote voting system,"IIT-Madras is providing the technology.

The model of an Aadhaar-linked electronic voting system that would enable electors to cast their votes from any part of the country — irrespective of where they are registered to vote — or even abroad, is being prepared for the Election Commission of India by the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M), ECI officials said.

The model is likely to be presented before the Commission next month and if approved, a prototype could be readied by the end of the year or early next year, Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena told The Hindu. If the project is given the go-ahead by the ECI, changes to the election laws would be required for which the Law Ministry would be approached.

The system would allow, for example, a Delhi-registered elector who happens to be in Hyderabad to cast his or her vote in elections in the Capital electronically, Mr. Saxena said. To start with, the proposal would be to enable voting at designated centres in different cities, but the second phase of the project, if approved, could be used to enable overseas electors to cast their votes, he said.

“The IIT-M is developing a system for two-way remote voting in controlled environment using blockchain technology. The system can’t work in isolation. It will have to be integrated with our ERO Net so if a person votes remotely, the electoral roll will reflect that,” he said.

With the proposed linking of the Aadhaar biometrics with voter IDs at an “advanced stage”, the official said the two-way electronic voting system would be possible only when the linking is complete.

The ECI had used a one-way electronic system for service electors for the first time in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The postal ballots were transmitted electronically to the service electors, which led to an increased turnout or 60.14%.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/avyygp/article30821915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ECI-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/system-to-enable-electors-to-cast-votes-from-anywhere-in-the-works/article30836003.ece

Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia on Sunday called Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot the leader of the ‘tukde-tukde’ gang in the wake of his recent participation at a sit-in here against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

He said Mr. Gehlot has “attempted to push the State into anarchy” in the name of freedom of speech and expression.

“The Chief Minister’s participation has encouraged such protests across the State. There have been reports that the protests are being funded by the Popular Front of India [PFI] and the organisation has a connection with the Students Islamic Movement of India [SIMI],” Mr. Poonia said at a press conference here.

“All this indicate that there is a network working behind such protests. I don’t have any inhibition in saying that the Rajasthan Chief Minister is the leader of tukde-tukde gang,” he said, adding that Mr. Gehlot’s act was “shameful” as it aimed at taking political mileage.

Addressing the indefinite dharna against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at the Shahid Smarak on Friday, Mr. Gehlot claimed that information on the birthplace of parents was being sought for the National Population Register (NPR).

“If I am not able to furnish the details, I, too, would be asked to live in a detention centre. You stay assured, if such a situation arises then I would be the first to go there,” he said.

Taking a swipe at the anti-CAA protest at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Sunday said what is happening there is not an expression of the right to dissent, but “an attempt to impose views on others“.

Some people have decided to take the law into their hands and disrupt normal life, he said on the sidelines of a conference here.

A group of protesters, mainly women, have been staging a sit-in at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) for the past two months.

The sit-in on the major thoroughfare connecting South Delhi with Noida has led to suspension of vehicular traffic.

“This is not the right to dissent, this is an attempt to impose views on others. You have the right to express your views but you don’t have the right to disrupt normal life,” the governor said.

When asked about protests in various other parts of the country against the CAA, he said that even in 1986 there were lakhs of people who were opposed to the Supreme Court’s Shah Bano judgment being reversed. “But was it is justified on my part to say that I am going to sit in (in protest) till the law is withdrawn,” said Mr. Khan, who had walked out of the Rajiv Gandhi Cabinet over the issue in 1986.

Mr. Khan was here to speak on the topic “Free Speech, Censorship & the Media: Does Law Impede Freedom of Speech?” at the ‘Difficult Dialogues’ conference at the International Centre Goa.

He said one can have a dialogue with somebody who is expressing an opinion but it is difficult in this instance when protesters refuse to budge.

“When you have this attitude that only I am right then dialogue is not happening. Dialogue happens when you are open to listening. Here, it is being asserted forcefully that we will not get up unless this law is withdrawn. The government is not going to decline dialogue if somebody comes,” Mr. Khan said.

He said that taking into consideration India’s culture and civilisation “we have to be liberal, opinionated, we have to accept and respect diversity but at the same time we cannot ignore facts“.

On the Kerala government invoking Article 131 in the Supreme Court to challenge the CAA, he said the matter will be decided by the court. “It is for the court to decide whether the government can come to it without clearance from the governor,” Mr. Khan said.

The Jammu and Kashmir administration has extended the 2G mobile data service and fixed line internet connectivity wherever provided across the Union Territory till February 24, an official spokesperson said on Sunday.

However, the internet service providers (ISP) have been given directions to ensure access to 1,485 white-listed sites only and not to any social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private network (VPN) applications, he said.

Also read: J&K Internet links partially restored

“The directions shall be effective from February 16 and remain in force till February 24, unless modified earlier,” he said, quoting an order issued by the Home Department.

The 2G internet facility on mobile phones was restored in Jammu and Kashmir on January 25 after remaining suspended since August 5 last year after the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the erstwhile State into Union Territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

“Whereas, reports have been received from the intelligence and law enforcement agencies inter-alia bringing out the manner in which social media sites are being accessed through the virtual private network (VPN) applications, for coordinating terror activities as well as to upload provocative material aimed at disturbing the public order.

“It has also been reported that attempts have been made to disturb the public peace by spreading rumours to incite the general public over the last week which necessitated temporary suspension of the mobile data services for limited period of time by the authorised officers,” read the order issued by Principal Secretary, Home department, Shaleen Kabra.

With regard to mobile data service, he said ISPs would ensure access only to the 1,485 whitelisted sites and not to any social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and VPN applications.

“Data services shall be available on the postpaid mobiles and on prepaid SIM cards of such holders whose credentials have been verified as per the norms applicable for postpaid connections; and the internet speed shall be restricted to 2G only,” he said in his order.

About fixed line internet connectivity, he said, “Wherever connectivity has been provided with effect from January 14 and onwards, ISPs shall ensure that access is limited to the whitelisted sites and not to any social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and VPN applications.

“Internet connectivity shall be available only after mac-binding. It is further directed that all those who are provided access to the internet shall ensure that it is not misused for uploading the provocative material inimical to the interest of the state,” the order read.

Mr. Kabra said the access or communication facilities made available by the government by way of e-terminals or internet kiosks apart from special arrangements for tourists, students and traders would continue.

Despite international pressure, the government will continue to stand by its decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and introduce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Sunday.

He said the country had “awaited” these decisions for many years. “In national interest, these decisions were necessary,” Mr. Modi said at an event in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi.

“Aur duniyabhar ke sare dawaabo ke bawajood, in faislo par hum kayam hai aur kayam rahenge [Despite the various international pressures, we stand by these decisions and will continue to stand by them,” Mr. Modi said. The country was now taking decisions that were always left behind in the past, he added.

The Prime Minister’s tough talk assumed significance in view of protests against the CAA in various parts of the country.

Launches projects

In Varanasi, Mr. Modi launched projects worth ₹1,250 crore. He unveiled the statue of Deendayal Upadhyay, which, at 63 feet, is the largest statue of the leader in the country, as per the government. The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre.

Mr. Modi flagged off the third corporate train, Mahakaal Express, which links three Jyotirling pilgrim centres — Varanasi, Ujjain and Omkareshwar.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Modi attended the closing ceremony of the centenary celebration of Jagadguru Vishwaradhya Gurukul at Jangamwadi Mutt and released the translated version of ‘Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth’ in 19 languages. He also launched the ‘Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth’ mobile app.

Citing certain key decisions of his government, Mr. Modi referred to the trust set up for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and said it would work “rapidly.”

He said that after setting up of the trust, the work on the construction of ‘Ram dham’ would start fast and added that his government had also decided to transfer 67 acres of land to the trust.

He also inaugurated a 430-bed superspeciality government hospital.

Mr. Modi said that in the past few years, ₹25,000 crore worth developmental projects had either been completed or were going on at a fast pace in Varanasi.

Roadway, highway, waterway and railway had been given top priority by the government and the Purvanchal Expressway work was going on at fast speed in Uttar Pradesh.

The Prime Minister also laid emphasis on better connectivity of heritage and religious sites, saying tourism would be the main source of making the country a $5 trillion economy.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday alleged that the Centre has handed over probe in the Elgar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra wants to “hide something“.

Mr. Pawar, who earlier demanded constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case in which human rights activists have been arrested for alleged links with Maoists, said the Centre should have taken the Maharashtra government into confidence before handing over the case to NIA.

Also read | Dubious decision: On NIA takeover of Bhima Koregaon case

The former Union Minister also asked whether speaking against the government is an “anti-national” activity.

“There seems to be something that the then Fadnavis government wants to hide, hence the investigation has been handed over to NIA. When the Koregaon-Bhima violence took place, Fadnavis government was in power,” Mr. Pawar told reporters in Jalgaon.

It is the Centre’s prerogative to investigate the Elgar Parishad case, but it should have taken the State into confidence, said Mr. Pawar, whose party is an alliance partner in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government.

“Koregaon-Bhima, and Elgar Parishad, held in Pune a day before the violence, are two different issues. Is writing rebellious literature and speaking against the government an an anti-national activity?” he asked.

Every year people gather at Koregaon Bhima (village in Pune), but some people went to nearby villages and “turned them against those who regularly visit the place”. Police have taken action against these people, including (right wing leaders) Sambhaji Bhide, Milind Ekbote, Pawar said.

In a change of stand, the Maharashtra government recently said it has no objection to NIA taking over probe into the Elgar Parishad case.

The Centre last month transferred the probe in the case from the Pune Police to NIA, a move then criticised by the state Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government.

The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed, triggered violence near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial in the district the next day.

The Pune Police have claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists.

During the probe, the police arrested Left-leaning activists Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao for alleged Maoist links.

These nine activists, currently in jail, are among 11 people booked by the NIA in the Elgar Parishad case.

While the Pune Police had applied IPC section 124A (sedition) in the case, the NIA FIR does not have this charge.

Similarly, IPC Sections like 121 (waging or attempting to war or abetting waging war against the Government of India), 121-A (conspiracy to commit offences punishable under section 121) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) were missing from the NIA’s FIR.

The accused have been charged under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between groups ), 505 (1)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public), 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons), among others, and certain sections of the anti-terror act UAPA.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/z0701d/article30820565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/previous-bjp-govt-wants-to-hide-something-sharad-pawar-on-elgar-parishad-case/article30834758.ece

Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said the Delhi Assembly poll results indicate that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah are not invincible.

He said the BJP, which appeared invincible during the Lok Sabha polls, fell like a “house of cards” in Delhi.

“No country is without religion, but religion does not mean patriotism...a follower of Lord Hanuman, Kejriwal brought Ram Rajya in Delhi, though the BJP almost fielded Lord Ram in this election,” Mr. Raut said.

“The picture of Delhi was of Kejriwal as a devotee of Hanuman and the people of Delhi became Ram...Ram strongly stood behind Hanuman,” he said, adding that there are lessons to be learnt from this election.

“BJP leaders earlier said that those who do not vote for the saffron party would be traitors, so is the entire Delhi going to get that stamp?” Mr. Raut asked.

“The Delhi verdict indicates that Modi-Shah are not invincible any longer. It also points out that voters are not dishonest. Religious whirlwinds were stoked for political gains, but voters did not get carried away,” he said.

People should get over the “myth” that only Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah can win elections, the Rajya Sabha member said.

Sharing an experience from a recent international visit, Mr. Raut said while he was at the Tashkent airport in Uzbekistan, two Indians living there for years told him that the “BJP bubble has started to burst now”.

“Even Lord Ram is not helping the party win polls. They [the two Indians] shared their views on the day of vote counting [for Delhi polls],” the Shiv Sena leader said.

The common factor between Prime Minister Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is that “both are self-centered”, but Mr. Modi also has “huge arrogance and pomposity”, Mr. Raut added.

He said Mr. Kejriwal also wanted to “conquer the entire country”, but after facing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, he realised his limitations and built his party and its network in Delhi.

“The BJP has ridiculed Kejriwal’s freebies, like free electricity and water. BJP’s definition of patriotism comprises waging war against Pakistan, abrogation of Article 370, strong steps against infiltrators and random sloganeering of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai,” he said.

“The better form of patriotism [referring to Mr. Kejriwal] is offering better education and health services, while also providing electricity, water and shelter to the needy"", Mr. Raut said.

“Will you [BJP] call it patriotism when two crore people lost jobs in the last two years?” Mr. Raut asked.

Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP promised to deposit ₹15 lakh in every citizen’s bank account, but not even ₹15 has been deposited, he added.

The BJP also pushed the Delhi poll narrative towards issues like the Ram temple, [abrogation of] Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir, surgical strike and the promise of Hindutva, but people instead chose Mr. Kejriwal, who provided them essential services, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cycnat/article30599506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SANJAYRAUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-shah-not-invincible-says-sanjay-raut-on-delhi-assembly-poll-results/article30834753.ece

A 60-year old villager was killed and four others were injured on February 14 when Pakistan army engaged in heavy mortar shelling and firing on civilian areas and forward posts along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district, officials said.

Pakistan Army targeted civilians when they were heading towards a mosque to offer Friday prayers in Shahpur hamlet along the Line of Control (Loc), they said.

Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire and launched mortar shells and fired from small arms on villages and forward posts along the LoC in Shahpur and Kerni areas of the district, the officials said.

They used 120 mm mortars to target villages, the officials added.

A mortar shell exploded near a mosque, killing one civilian and injuring four others, they said.

The officials said Indian Army guarding the borderline retaliated befittingly to the Pakistani shelling. The exchange of fire was going on when the reports last came in, they said.

The deceased was identified as Badar Din of Shahpur, the officials said, adding two among the injured were identified as Mohmmad Shabir (32) and Imtaiz Ahmed (33).

The injured have been shifted to the district hospital, they said.

Deputy Commissioner, Poonch, Rahul Yadav and SSP Ramesh Angral visited the hospital Poonch and met the injured persons undergoing treatment there.

Mr. Yadav announced an ex-gratia of ₹1 lakh to the family of the deceased and ₹5,000 each to the injured persons out of the Red Cross, a statement issued said.

118,2020/02/16,Anti-CAA protests: ₹1 crore fine slapped on U.P. poet-politician,"It is a way to ‘gag’ the voices against the CAA-NRC, says Imran Pratapgarhi who unsuccessfully fought the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Moradabad on a Congress ticket

The Moradabad administration has slapped a fine of ₹1.04 crore on poet-politician Imran Pratapgarhi for violating Section 144, participating in an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, and allegedly instigating protesters at the Idgah ground.

Listing the amount of money being spent on the security arrangements to maintain law and order during the sit-in protest, the notice issued by additional district magistrate (city) said, “One company of Rapid Action Force and a half section of Provincial Armed Constabulary has been deployed at the protest site. It amounts to a total expenditure of ₹13.42 lakh per day...the total sum spent on security amounts to ₹1,04,08, 693. It could be charged from Mr. Pratapgarhi.” The notice further said a large number of protesters continue to assemble at the protest site on the poet-politician’s call.

Responding to the notice, Mr. Pratapgarhi said it was a way to “gag” the voices against the CAA-NRC. “The government is trying to find a newer way to scuttle legitimate protest, but we cannot be afraid of such tactics,” said Mr. Pratapgarhi who unsuccessfully fought the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Moradabad on a Congress ticket.

A poet with a huge following, Mr. Pratapgarhi said he reached Moradabad on February 7 but the notice was issued on February 6. “I had informed the Superintendent of Police (City) about my visit,” he said.

Rajesh Kumar ADM (City) said a notice was issued to him a day before his visit under Section 111 of Cr. PC that peace would be maintained. “He was asked to appear on February 12, but he didn’t do so,” he told reporters.

While police sources said the notice of recovery was preventive in nature, local sources said the Idgah ground was private property and Section 144 could not be imposed there.

The reports are expected to be received by Monday.

The final samples of all the people quarantined at the ITBP facility were collected by a team of doctors on Friday and the reports are expected to be received by Monday.

“Based on the reports, a decision will be taken to discharge the travellers, if agreed to by the authorities, which is expected to be done in next week observing laid down protocols and due medical procedures as per the directives of Health Ministry,” said Vivek Kumar Pandey, Public Relations Officer, ITBP.

A senior Home Ministry official said all of them will be released by next week if the final samples test negative.

A total of 650 people were brought back from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the outbreak, on February 1 and 2 in two 747 Boeing Air India aircraft.

While 406 people, including seven from Maldives, are being looked after at the quarantine facility, the rest are housed at an Army centre at Manesar in Haryana.

The ITBP centre is being looked after by an expert team of doctors and medical professionals. There are seven children in the group, including an infant.

“No fresh symptoms have been seen today. Food, bed and other basic requirements are catered. Sufficient amount of medicines are also kept at the centre,” said Mr. Pandey.

The death toll in China’s novel coronavirus epidemic has climbed to 1,523 with 143 new fatalities reported mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province. The confirmed cases jumped to over 66,000, said health officials on Saturday.

121,2020/02/16,Child rights panel chief ‘unaware of police brutalities on children’,"National Commission for Protection of Child Rights Chairman seeks info from activists and organisations on illegal detentions during anti-CAA protests.

National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) Chairman Priyank Kanoongo has said he has no information of illegal detention of children in jails or abuse by policemen either in Uttar Pradesh or anywhere in the country.

The NCPCR has been criticised by activists for allegedly turning a blind eye to police brutalities following the crackdown on protesters holding demonstrations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, in U.P. and Delhi.

The Supreme Court on February 10 ordered the Centre, the NCPCR and its arms in New Delhi and U.P. to submit a report on detention of children in jails, calling such actions as a violation of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.

“I appeal to activists and organisations to provide me information about any illegal detentions, abuse, torture or exploitation in the context of anti-CAA protests. Give me the details of the victims and I will ensure justice is delivered,” Mr. Kanoongo told The Hindu.

Seeks reply

Mr. Kanoongo said he had written to the Superintendents of Police of Muzaffarnagar and Bijnore seeking their response to media reports of children being detained for several days, beaten up in police custody, denied water and access to toilet, adding that he received their response calling the reports “false” and “rejecting” that children were either taken into custody or beaten up while quelling protests held in various parts of U.P. The Hindu has seen these letters.

Asked if the NCPCR accepted these responses, or whether it would conduct an independent inquiry, Mr. Kanoongo replied, “We accept the reports submitted to us as of now”.

The NCPCR Chairman said he would await a report from the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on the Bidar police questioning schoolchildren in a sedition case following the performance of a play against the CAA.

On his controversial letter last month asking the District Magistrate of South-East Delhi to “identify” and “counsel” children seen in some viral videos opposing the CAA and National Register of Citizens, Mr. Kanoongo said he did not regret his comments. “If children anywhere in the country espouse violence, I will ask for them to be counselled,” he said.

Asked how he proposed to protect children from Ministers and MPs inciting violence against a particular community, Mr. Kanoongo said: “I am concerned only about the actions of children, not those of adults”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7ejfr0/article30832885.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kanoongo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/child-rights-panel-chief-unaware-of-police-brutalities-on-children/article30832886.ece
122,2020/02/16,Air India aircraft damaged as pilot forces early takeoff,"Jeep, man enter Pune airport runway

The fuselage of an Air India aircraft was damaged on Saturday when its pilot lifted the plane to avoid hitting a person and a jeep that had suddenly come on the Pune airport runway during takeoff, an official said.

However, the A321 aircraft landed at the Delhi airport safely.

“During takeoff roll, while at 120 knots speed, the crew saw a jeep and a person on the runway and to avoid conflict, they did early rotation...,” the official of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation said.

Another DGCA official said, “The aircraft has been withdrawn from service for investigation. Air India has been advised to coordinate with the Pune Air Traffic Control to find out any marking on the runway.”

An Air India spokesperson said, “The A321 aircraft that was scheduled to operate AI 825 to Srinagar was observed to have certain marks towards the tail area.

123,2020/02/16,When can a judge opt out of a case?,"What is the process of recusal in court? Do the reasons have to be specified?

The story so far: On February 12, Supreme Court judge Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar recused himself from hearing a petition filed by Sara Abdullah Pilot, sister of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, against the government’s move to charge him under the Public Safety Act. The case was finally heard by another bench. Recusal usually takes place when a judge has a conflict of interest or has a prior association with the parties in the case.

What are the rules on recusals?

There are no written rules on the recusal of judges from hearing cases listed before them in constitutional courts. It is left to the discretion of a judge. The reasons for recusal are not disclosed in an order of the court. Some judges orally convey to the lawyers involved in the case their reasons for recusal, many do not. Some explain the reasons in their order. The decision rests on the conscience of the judge. At times, parties involved raise apprehensions about a possible conflict of interest. For example, if the case pertains to a company in which the judge holds stakes, the apprehension would seem reasonable. Similarly, if the judge has, in the past, appeared for one of the parties involved in a case, the call for recusal may seem right. A recusal inevitably leads to delay. The case goes back to the Chief Justice, who has to constitute a fresh Bench.

Should the reasons be put on record?

In his separate opinion in the National Judicial Appointments Commission judgment in 2015, Justice (now retired) Kurian Joseph, who was a member of the Constitution Bench, highlighted the need for judges to give reasons for recusal as a measure to build transparency. “It is the constitutional duty, as reflected in one’s oath, to be transparent and accountable, and hence, a judge is required to indicate reasons for his recusal from a particular case,” Justice Kurian wrote. One of his companion judges on the Constitution Bench, Justice (retired) Madan B. Lokur, agreed that specific rules require to be framed on recusal.

The two judges were referring to senior advocate Fali Nariman’s plea to Justice J.S. Khehar, who was then in line to be the next Chief Justice, to recuse himself. But Justice Khehar refused to recuse himself though he admitted that Mr. Nariman’s plea left him in an “awkward predicament”. Justice Khehar reasoned that he did not recuse himself for fear of leaving an impression that he was “scared”.

What happened in the Judge Loya and Assam detention centres cases?

In 2018, petitioners in the Judge Loya case sought the recusal of Supreme Court judges, Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, from the Bench as they both hailed from the Bombay High Court. The case banked on the written statements of two judges from that High Court, both saying that Judge Loya’s death was from natural causes. The court refused the request and called it a “wanton attack”. Recusal, the court observed, would mean abdication of duty. Maintaining institutional civilities are distinct from the “fiercely independent role of the judge as adjudicator”, the court explained.

In May 2019, in the middle of a hearing of a PIL filed by activist Harsh Mander about the plight of inmates in Assam’s detention centres, the then-Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was asked to recuse himself. In a lengthy order, Justice Gogoi said a litigant cannot seek recusal of the judge. “Judicial functions, sometimes, involve performance of unpleasant and difficult tasks, which require asking questions and soliciting answers to arrive at a just and fair decision. If the assertions of bias as stated are to be accepted, it would become impossible for a judge to seek clarifications and answers,” the court observed.

Why did Justice Mishra argue against recusal?

Refusing to recuse himself from the Constitution Bench hearing a question of law on the Indore Development Authority v. Manohar Lal (the issues involved in the case related to a reading of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013), Justice Arun Mishra said acquiescing to the wishes of parties to recuse himself would sound the death-knell for judicial independence. The petitioners had objected to Justice Mishra leading the Constitution Bench which was hearing a question of law challenging his own earlier judgment in the case. But Justice Mishra said it would be a “grave blunder” on his part to bow out.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/onois8/article30831684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th16-Krishnadas-Recusal-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/when-can-a-judge-opt-out-of-a-case/article30831685.ece
124,2020/02/16,Decks being cleared for transfer of archives to Andhra Pradesh from Telangana,"Four-member expert panel to ensure safe relocation and upkeep

After a long wait, the ball has been finally set rolling for transfer of valuable historical research works of Andhra Pradesh from Telangana to the residuary State.

The government has constituted a four-member expert committee to advise the A.P. State Archives on safe transport and proper arrangement of the records and also to establish and strengthen a modern archive wing here on scientific lines.

The panel comprises V. Ramakrishna, B. Kesavanarayana and A. Ramachandra Reddy, retired professors from the University of Hyderabad, Andhra University in Visakhapatnam and Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati respectively as members and V. Ranga Raj, Director, A.P. State Archives, as member convenor.

The committee will discuss all aspects relating to the safe transfer from Hyderabad to Andhra Pradesh of the important records, proper arrangement and upkeep so they could be preserved for future generations.

At the time of bifurcation, both States were ready to share the “wealth” in a very amicable way but the process hit a roadblock due to certain reasons, fund constraint being one of them.

Prof. Ramakrishna, who has written many books on history and culture of Telugu-speaking people, and has been pursuing the cause with the officials, is happy that things have finally started moving. “The government has rightly recognised the importance of this key sector. Imagine, otherwise, what will happen to the future of our historical wealth,” he said, talking to The Hindu.

Sources in the department said that 30% of the archives have been shifted to the State Archives office at Mangalagiri. The issue of staff crunch is being addressed by absorbing outsourced employees.

Brought from Madras

The journey of these original historical documents has been quite arduous. They travelled from the erstwhile Madras State to Kurnool when Andhra State was formed on October 1 in 1953 with its capital in Kurnool. Though the State of Andhra Pradesh was formed on November 1 in 1956, based on the recommendations of the State Reorganisation Commission, the Andhra Record Office continued in Kurnool as a branch of the Central Record Office (in Hyderabad) till April 31 in 1957. But on May 1 in 1957, it was merged and documents of the period 1920-1952 were shifted to the Central Record Office at Errammanzil in Hyderabad.

The invaluable documents in the Hyderabad office include oldest records, hand impression and seal of Muhammed Adil Shah dated 1643 AD, a document abolishing the practice of Sati and letters written by important people like Mahatma Gandhi.

The wealth of information also has records of Mughal era (1628 to 1707 AD) the times of Asaf Jahi (1724 to 1948), introduction of Andhra State and Andhra Pradesh, district Collectorates, factories, electoral rolls, and inter-State water dispute tribunals to name a few.

There are also documents related to Masulipatnam and Krishna districts, film archives, archival museum, Central assistance schemes, cataloguing and indexing and citizen charter among many other components.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/oluxfe/article30837283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJPG4-ARCHIVES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decks-being-cleared-for-transfer-of-archives-to-state-from-ts/article30837284.ece

126,2020/02/16,YSRCP is a trustworthy ally of BJP: Sailajanath,"‘Jagan should have conveyed to Modi and Shah his opposition to NRC’

APCC president S. Sailajanath wondered why Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not make it clear that he was against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) during his recent meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.

Addressing party leaders at the Dharna Chowk here on Sunday, where they staged a protest against the Supreme Court judgment on SC/ST reservations, Mr. Sailajanath said that the “YSRCP is a close ally of the BJP.”

The YSRCP had voted in favour of the NRC in the Lok Sabha, but was speaking against it in the State, he said.

“Why did Mr. Jagan not convey his opposition to the NRC to Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah? For the BJP, the YSRCP is the most trustworthy ally,” the APCC president said.

All political parties were citing “interests of the State” as the reason for their political decisions, and trying to reap personal gains, he observed.

“How does abolition of the Legislative Council make a difference to the State? Where is Pawan Kalyan, who claims to be drawing inspiration from Che Guvera, now? The Chief Minister should tell people what he has achieved by visiting New Delhi twice,” Mr. Sailajanath said.

Referring to the capital issue, Mr. Sailajanath said that the BJP’s stand was not consistent.

Chandrababu Naidu and Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, were paying a deaf ear to it.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-is-a-trustworthy-ally-of-bjp-sailajanath/article30837191.ece

128,2020/02/16,"Agarala Eswara Reddi, former Speaker, dead","He had authored several books on public administration

Educationalist and statesman Agarala Eswara Reddi (87), who had served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in combined Andhra Pradesh, died after a brief illness at the SVIMS hospital here on Sunday.

He is survived by a son and a daughter.

Reddi was admitted to a private hospital in Chennai one month ago following a lung infection. He later returned home. But, as his condition worsened, he was taken to a private hospital in Tirupati 10 days ago, and later shifted to SVIMS.

Popularly known as ‘AER’, Reddi was born at Thukivakam village of Renigunta mandal in Chittoor district in 1933.

He had become sarpanch of the village in 1957, and contested twice as Congress candidate for the Tirupati Assembly constituency.

He had served as Deputy Speaker during 1981-82 and was elevated to the post of Speaker in 1983.

An ardent follower of Madabhushi Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, a former parliamentarian from Chittoor who had served as Lok Sabha Speaker, Reddi had launched an institute, M.A. Ayyangar Institute of Public Affairs (MAIPA), in memory of his mentor to nurture policies on good governance and public administration.

When thespian N.T. Rama Rao launched the Telugu Desam Party and decided to take the plunge from Tirupati, several candidates shied away fearing imminent loss of face.

However, Reddi came to the party’s rescue and faced a crushing defeat, which he referred to as his “Waterloo moment.”

He had openly criticised the Congress for not recognising his “sacrifice” and compensating him for his “suicidal act,” which made him fade away from the State’s political landscape.

Turning to education, he had launched schools and colleges in the backward Rayalaseema region and authored several books on public administration.

Jagan’s condolences

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy conveyed his condolences to the bereaved family members.

Prameelamma, who hails from Tirupati, said that Reddi was “man of clean record and a role model in public life.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/agarala-eswara-reddi-former-speaker-dead/article30837165.ece

Prabhakar Reddy, said, “The party welcomes the move to shift the High Court to Kurnool, however, the district requires to be developed comprehensively. Mr. Jagan must make an announcement during the public meet to be held on 18 February on allocation of funds to the projects.”

Lakhs of people are seasonally migrating from the district in search of work due to lack of irrigation water, he said, adding that there would not arise a need for this if the projects are completed.

Highlighting the shortcomings in health and education sectors, he said that both the Rayalaseema University and Urdu University need more facilities to provide better education. He said the Government General Hospital(GGH) in the city, which serves over 2,000 people every day, is severely understaffed and demanded that the government fill the vacancies immediately.

He also demanded that the government divert its attention to developing Orvakal as an industrial hub, to address the issue of unemployment in the district.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hhslw0/article30837064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJCPIM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/release-funds-for-irrigation-projects-in-kurnool-district-demands-cpim/article30837057.ece
132,2020/02/16,Prakasam police win SKOCH award for ‘Abhay’ initiative,"Several other States have replicated the district police’s service

The Prakasam district police won the SKOCH award in the District Governance category for its ‘Abhay’ initiative — a first-of-its-kind service meant for the help of stranded women.

The initiative was launched by the Prakasam police in the wake of the gangrape and murder of a Hyderabad veterinarian in November 2019 that sent shockwaves across the country.

Superintendent of Police Siddarth Kaushal will receive the award in New Delhi on March 14, according to a press release issued here on Sunday.

Under the ‘Abhay’ initiative, police personnel will escort stranded women travelling late at night safely to their homes, between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. This initiative was also replicated by several States and districts across the country.

“It is a satisfying moment for us as apart from the SKOCH award, Prakasam police also recently won the ‘Technology Sabha’ award, the SKOCH award for Project JIO (Junior Investigation Officer) and 7th GFiles Award for improving administrative efficiency through innovative use of technology,” Mr. Kaushal said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xfotg6/article30836842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-ABHAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/prakasam-police-win-skoch-award-for-abhay-initiative/article30836843.ece
133,2020/02/16,Perupalem Beach Festival celebrated on grand scale,"Food court, burra katha, musical night and 5K Run were the highlights of the event

The two-day Perupalem Beach Festival saw thousands of tourists, fishermen and villagers living along the Mogaltur coast and adjoining mandals in attendance.

The festival was organised for the first time here by the State government. The village of Perupalem in Mogaltur mandal was decked up for the event.

Women arranged a food exhibition with ethnic and traditional dishes. Officials of the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), Horticulture, Fisheries, Endowments, Women Development and Child Welfare and other departments arranged stalls depicting the culture of the area under the theme ‘Godavari Ruchulu’.

APTDC, in association with the district administration, organised the festival on February 15 and 16 on the beach. Villagers from K.P. Palem, Narsapuram, Mogaltur, Kalipatnam, Bhimavaram, Palakol and other places thronged the events.

Cultural shows

Housing Minister Cherukuwada Sriranganatha Raju, Women Development and Child Welfare Minister Taneti Vanita, Narasapuram MP Kanumuru Raghu Rama Krishna Raju, MLA Mudunuri Prasada Raju, APTDC Chief Executive Officer Pravin Kumar and Collector Revu Mutyala Raju inaugurated the festival.

All roads leading to the Perupalem beach were illuminated, and organisers arranged a dais on the beach. Artistes performed ‘burrakatha’, classical dance, songs and group dances on the seashore.

“It was a great experience. We enjoyed the festival amid the sound of the waves lashing the shore. The government should develop all the beaches in a similar manner and conduct more such festivals,” said M. Pedda Babu, a villager.

Local delicacies

Local delicacies like ‘bobbatlu’, ‘kobbarundalu’, ‘ariselu’, ‘sunnundalu’, ‘putarekulu’, ‘alva’, and ‘khakalu’ were on offer at the food stalls arranged on the beach. APTDC and Endowments officials arranged photo exhibitions at different tourist spots and temple tourism across the State.

The Ministers said that the Perupalem beach should be developed on par with Rushikonda, Kakinada and other beaches in the State. APTDC was organising beach festivals along the coast on ten beaches at a cost of ₹10 crore, said APTDC CEO Pravin Kumar.

MLA Prasada Raju and Narasapuram Sub-Collector K.S. Viswanadham, who flagged off the 5K Run on the beach on Sunday, said the unique feature of Perupalem beach is that both sunrise and sunset can be viewed from here.

Prizes were given away to winners of cultural shows, food festival and 5K Run during the closing function of the beach festival.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vo62v9/article30836821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-PERUPALEMDANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/perupalem-beach-festival-celebrated-on-grand-scale/article30836822.ece
134,2020/02/16,TDP to sue YSRCP for “misinformation campaign”,"‘Ruling party leaders twisting facts on I-T dept. searches’

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has asserted that defamation cases will be filed against YSRCP leaders for their “misinformation campaign” against it and its leaders.

“Contrary to the YSRCP’s allegations that fraud to the tune of ₹2,000 crore took place, the ‘panchanama’ report of the Income- Tax Department says that cash to an extent of only ₹2.6 lakh was found in their searches. We will file defamation cases against the YSR Congress leaders and its media group which carried the false reports,” said Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council and senior TDP leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu.

The caution comes in the wake of inventory of cash found and seized by the I-T Department in the raids on the residence of P. Srinivas, former personal secretary of TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, on February 6. The inventory puts the total cash found at ₹2.63 lakh and 12 tolas gold. The YSRCP leaders alleged that Mr. Naidu and his son Lokesh had amassed wealth through corrupt means in the execution of Polavaram, Pattiseema and other projects.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said the I-T raids were blown out of proportion. The YSRCP leaders owe an explanation on the ‘panchanama’ of the I-T Department. “We will take legal action against those who resort to the false campaign,” he said.

Meanwhile, former Minister Nimmakayala Chinarajappa, in a tweet, said that those who indulged in corruption would see corruption everywhere.

TDP senior leader KE Prabhakar said the YSRCP leaders were shocked over the release of the ‘panchanama’ report.

Repalle MLA Anagani Satyaprasad said that the YSRCP leaders were not aware of the difference between I-T raids and searches. They should tender an apology to TDP leaders for making false allegations against them. People would teach a lesson to the YSRCP for its “anti-people policies”, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2ot4li/article30836322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-YANAMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-to-sue-ysrcp/article30836323.ece
135,2020/02/16,Anantapur steps on the gas,"The Penukonda-Gudipalli-Hindupur-Madakasira region is expected to become an automobile hub soon

The southernmost tip of Andhra Pradesh in Anantapur district is poised to become an automobile hub, with National Highway-44 passing through the region, presence of several railway stations nearby, and its proximity to Bengaluru city.

The Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd. (APIIC), sensing the potential in the area from the number of enquiries it has received, has embarked on developing R. Ananthapuram and Goudanahalli villages in Madakasira mandal of the district as an industrial area with focus on automobile ancillary units.

As an indication of its resolve to develop the region as an industrial hub, APIIC in the past three months bifurcated Anantapur district into two zones and put a new zonal manager in place to have greater focus on potential projects.

With KIA Motors already establishing a manufacturing plant at Erramanchi, north of Penukonda, in 600 acres, and Veera Vahan Udyog Private Limited beginning land-levelling work in 125 acres for its ₹1,000 crore electric bus manufacturing unit, the need for MSMEs coming up in the region has become imperative to cater to the continuous demand of the automobile majors.

Veera Vahan is yet to obtain statutory permissions for setting up its industry, but is projected to produce 3,000 hybrid, 2,000 diesel and another 3,000 electric buses at the facility to begin production within one year as per the MoU. The job potential is 9,000 employees, both direct and indirect, said Joint Director of District Industries Centre Gurrala Sudarshan Babu.

APIIC has 639.58 acres to be offered to entrepreneurs as undeveloped land in bulk on the road connecting NH-44 and NH-48. There is an MSME Industrial Park at R. Ananthapuram village and the land available next to it is being projected as the future destination of automobile ancillary units. There is a proposal to acquire another 808 acres if the demand increases.

When KIA Motors commenced manufacturing at its Erramanchi factory close to Penukonda along NH-44, it gave impetus to the automobile manufacturing sector with 22 ancillary units coming up at Ammuvaripalli and Gudipalli and creating a conducive atmosphere for MSMEs.

KIA Motors and the ancillary units together have invested ₹17,000 crore in the region, providing 17,000 jobs, said Mr. Sudarshan Babu.

Hindupur industrial area is home to several electronic units, paints and chemicals, textile and garment-making units due to its proximity to Bengaluru and further extending this corridor to the north, the DIC plans MSME parks and industrial areas in Kalyandurg and Rayadurg, where some garment factories have been operating for several years.

The district currently has 6,227 registered units with an investment of ₹2,289 crore, providing employment to over 70,000 people. More than half of them began operations after 2015. Minerals, agriculture and horticulture-based units are the other areas in which MSME entrepreneurs are showing interest.

One-time restructuring of loans to MSMEs has been allowed till March 31 and 158 of them have applied and some have got the benefit of YSR Navodayam Scheme. The lending bank decides on the restructuring of loan depending on the unit’s revival feasibility, the DIC Joint Director said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/anantapur-steps-on-the-gas/article30835817.ece
136,2020/02/16,Sailing in troubled waters,"MSME sector in Chittoor district is facing lack of coordination among departments and outdated technology

The MSME sector in tail-end Chittoor district is facing difficult times thanks to outdated technology, poor marketing and lack of coordination among entrepreneurs, nodal agencies and central laboratories.

Chittoor district is blessed with rich mineral wealth, and has a good scope for food processing industries. Flanked on either side by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the district is a haven for about 3,600 registered MSMEs with a turnover of ₹6500 crore, in addition to hundreds of unregistered units and artisan workforce from the unorganised sector.

Interestingly, the MSMEs present a unique phenomenon in Chittoor district, with the concentration of similar industrial units in one particular area. For instance, a vast majority of the powerloom sector is concentrated in Puttur and its adjoining Nagari municipalites. Coming to the mango canning and packaging units, their concentration is in and around Chittoor. The tamarind processing units are located in Punganur.

The predominant granite and stone crushing industry is almost confined to a few mandals surrounding Chittoor district headquarters, followed by an equally dominant stretch in faraway Kuppam.

The presence of different categories of artisans is also unique to their location, such as terracota in Palamaner, Kalamkari in Srikalahasti, and silk reeling in Madanapalle. According to official estimates, there are 345 granite cutting and polishing units, 143 stone crushing units, 83 milk chilling units, and 1,500 automobile service units among others, such as cold storage, paper, poultry feed, and handloom units.

Real estate slump

Members of the Granite Industries Association decried that 70% of their plants are on the verge of closure due to heavy royalties and regional fluctuations in prices. This sector, which ruled the roost in Chittoor, is said have fallen prey to political dabbling. A slump in the construction sector all over the South, coupled with shortage of sand, has also thrown the sector into turmoil.

Coming to mango cultivation, farmers are going through a tough time for the last five years due to low and delayed yields marred by adverse climatic conditions. The processing units, except for caning purposes, have nothing to do with the product, while the mango growers are far removed from the latest technologies and utilities and marketing strategies.

No skill upgradation

The MSMEs are patronised by their respective departments and the entrepreneurs deplore that there is no coordination among the allied wings. For the last five years, no seminars or symposiums have been held for entrepreneurs by national research laboratories such as CFTRI or CLRI, nor was any study tour organised for the MSMEs.

Almost half of the posts are vacant at industrial estates at Gajulamandyam, Madanapalle, Kuppam, Srikalahasti and Palamaner. There are allegations that some influential members in the MSMEs are misusing land allotments for real estate deals.

Assistant director (District Industries Centre - Chittoor) C. Suri Babu said that the MSMEs are capable of generating thousands of jobs compared to major industries. He said that the MSMEs should constantly update their knowledge and skills prevailing trends in various sectors and be ready to adapt to latest technologies. The central research institutes could work wonders with their active participation in the MSMEs, Mr. Suri Babu said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sailing-in-troubled-waters/article30835813.ece
137,2020/02/16,Hopes brighten in Vizag,"Thousands of MSME units in the city have faced one setback after another beginning with Cyclone Hudhud

Considered one of the leading Tier-II destinations in the country for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Visakhapatnam has units dabbling in engineering, lathe work, coir processing, handicrafts, toymaking, fabrication, casting, machining and allied fields.

The city’s robust base led to the mushrooming of MSME units in and around the region. However, in the last few years, MSME entrepreneurs have been facing one setback after another, beginning with Cyclone Hudhud in 2014 which forced them out of action for some time.

Just when the industry was hoping to get back on its feet, came the demonetisation decision in November 2016, and later the decision of the Central Government to switch over to the GST regime in 2017. Two years hence, the economy began witnessing a slowdown in 2019 which has also affected the MSME units.

The situation came to such a pass that in 2019, major manufacturing industries like Visakhapatnam Steel Plant imposed severe cuts in production. Of late, the order book position by major industries including VSP, HPCL Visakh Refinery and BHEL (Heavy Plate and Vessels Plant) has improved. Prior to Hudhud, the industry was also badly hit by a power holiday in 2012 and the Samaikyandhra agitation.

Now, the State Government’s decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital has given fresh hopes to the MSMEs on the prospects of major investments coming into the region in the near future.

MSMEs are a major contributor to GDP and employment creation. The district has an estimated 14,000 units of which 6,000 are located in the city. The units have provided jobs to an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people. The district has several industrial estates at Atchutapuram, Parawada, Kancharapalem, Gajuwaka, Autonagar, Pedagantyada, Gambheeram, Gurrampalem and Rachapalle.

The MSME sector has a plethora of opportunities with the government offering several incentives. ""We have already set up two MSME parks at Gurrampalem and Rachapalle. At Gurrampalem park which is developed in 45 acres, plots have been allotted to 182 units,"" District Industries Centre General Manager Ramalingeswar Raju told The Hindu.

Though some allotments have been made at Rachapalle in Makavarapalem mandal, efforts are on to pacify farmers who are protesting against the project in the area. There is no documentation on the number of unregistered micro and small units.

Though there is no quota for local MSMEs for e-procurement, the units are getting preferential treatment, according to Visakha Autonagar Small Scale Industries Welfare Association president A.K. Balaji.

He said access to easy finance has become a herculean task for them though there are no problems in securing orders. Though under the Mudra and 59-minute loan schemes, assistance should be given without any collateral security, due to insistence on documents and adhering to RBI guidelines, sanction is not that easy, Mr. Balaji lamented.

He said they were being forced to shell down interests ranging from 9% to 15% and sought hassle-free loan sanction with less documentation and timely release of payments from major industries. He also wanted implementation of the decision of a plant-level committee of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant to give orders up to ₹50 lakh if five local firms come to an understanding.

Mr. Balaji wanted establishment of Electronics Manufacturing Clusters and product-specific industrial estates and MSME parks to encourage micro, small and medium entrepreneurs.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hopes-brighten-in-vizag/article30835808.ece
138,2020/02/16,Tobacco auctions set to commence,"To start with, farmers expect a per-kg price ranging between ₹180 and ₹200 for bright grade varieties

Amid high expectations from the farmers, e-auctions are set to commence at six auction platforms in Prakasam and Nellore districts from Monday.

Farmers coming under different auction floors in the Southern Black Soil(SBS) and the Southern Light Soil (SLS) regions took stock of the prevailing market conditions in Mysuru, at a meeting organised at the Tobacco Board Regional Office here on Sunday and decided to demand a per-kg price ranging between ₹180 and ₹200 for the bright grade varieties to start with.

Production of the Flue-Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco in the SBS and SLS regions put together is estimated to be between 90 and 95 million kg. The bright grade varieties are expected to be about 40 to 45% of the total crop, the medium grade varieties 25 to 30%, and the low grade varieties the remaining, according to the Tobacco Board sources.

“We want the Indian Tobacco Association to bail us out this year by offering better prices for our produce as the unseasonal rains last month led to false ripening of leaves and not-so encouraging grade out-turn. Labour cost has also gone up,” said former Tobacco Board member P. Bhadri Reddy after the meeting.

‘Buy tobacco waste too’

The farmers also wanted the Tobacco Board to purchase tobacco waste, as at least 8 to 10 leaves per plant turned out to be waste this time due to adverse climatic condition.

“We will not hesitate to stall the auctions if the prices offered by the traders is far below our expectations after seeing for a week or so,” farmer leader from Ongole II auction platform V.V. Prasad said.

The increase in the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on cigarettes proposed in the Union Budget is likely to adversely affect the fortunes of the farmers this year.

The sliding prices in the auction platforms in the Mysuru region do not augur well for the farmers here as their counterparts got an average price of only ₹120 per kg now as against ₹140 per kg till last month.

Untimely rains

Everything was fine for the farmers till December-end as they were able to grow the crop in the district to the full extent after five consecutive years of drought.

But the untimely rains in January hit the quality of crop as also productivity, especially in the areas coming under auction platforms of Tangutur I and II, and Kandukur I and II.

The ITA members were mulling an offer price of ₹170 per kg to start with and scale it up, or bring it down, as the auction progresses, according to the ITA sources.

Meanwhile, farmers started moving the high quality bales to the auction platforms of Ongole I, Velampalli, Kondepi, Podili and Kanigiri in Prakasam district and D.C. Palli in the neighbouring Nellore district after curing in barns, the primary processing units.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6munc8/article30835737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJPG4-TOBACCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tobacco-auctions-set-to-commence/article30835738.ece
139,2020/02/16,Orders issued for formation of A.P. Green Energy Corporation Limited,"‘Need for evolving an alternative mechanism to provide quality power’

The State government has issued orders for the formation of A.P. Green Energy Corporation Limited (APGECL) as a 100% subsidiary of AP-Genco under the Companies Act, 2013, for establishing 10,000-MW of solar power projects.

It was stated in the G.O. issued by ex-officio Principal Secretary (energy) G. Sai Prasad that the State is incurring an expenditure of more than ₹10,000 crore on agriculture and aquaculture subsidies and Lift Irrigation (LI) power charges every year and the subsidies have been increasing over the years due to the rising cost of power supply as well as an increase in the number of pump sets.

The government has since felt that to ensure subsidies are provided on a sustainable basis, there is a need for evolving an alternative mechanism to provide quality power and nine hour daytime free supply to farmers.

Solar energy

It found that solar energy has the potential to fulfil those requirements as its cost is lower compared to the current average procurement cost of DISCOMs and also due to the fact that all solar power is generated during daytime.

In order to provide free power to the agriculture sector and LI schemes, the total capacity of solar plants required is likely to be approximately 10,000 MW, including the projected annual increase in agricultural demand.

The government has, therefore, resolved to set up the APGECL for establishing approximately 10,000 MW of solar power projects as a permanent solution to supply free power to farmers.

‘No contract employees’

While welcoming the formation of APGECL, as a subsidiary of AP-Genco, APSEB Assistant Electrical Engineers’ Association president B. Vamsi Srinivas condemned the move to recruit AEEs and other cadre employees through contract/outsourcing.

He insisted that all the staff should be from APGenco and that the association would make a plea for it to the government and the APGenco management.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/orders-issued-for-formation-of-ap-green-energy-corporation-limited/article30835598.ece
140,2020/02/16,"Avoid jumbo-friendly crops, farmers urged in Chittoor district","Steps will be taken to enhance compensation to crop loss, arrange solar fencing: Collector

District Collector Narayana Bharat Gupta observed that in view of the unabated crop raids by the wild elephants in the western mandals, the farmers could think of avoiding jumbo-friendly crops such as sugarcane and paddy and replacing them with mulberry and other alternative crops.

Addressing a meeting with the forest, agriculture and power department officials here on Sunday, the Collector said that steps would be initiated to enhance the compensation to the crop losses, arrange solar fencing and elephant-proof trenches at the vulnerable villages and fields abutting the forests of Koundinya sanctuary and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Man-animal conflict

Mr. Gupta mooted the idea of extending compensation to the farmers when the farm equipment such as pipelines, motors and drip systems was damaged in jumbo raids. He observed that the farmers could also be provided with solar fencing equipment on subsidy, so as to make their involvement active in arresting the man-animal conflict.

Joint Director (Agriculture) N. Vijay Kumar brought to the notice of the Collector that awareness camps would be conducted to rope in farmers to avoid jumbo-friendly crops and replace the pattern with crops such as mulberry and other commercial varieties. He said the issue would be addressed with the officials concerned, apart from aspects of enhancing the crop loss compensation and subsidy to farmers to have solar fencing around the fields abutting forest areas.

The forest officials informed the Collector that in a span of one year, as many as seven wild elephants had perished, while electrocution in fields formed one of the major causes for jumbo casualties. In recent months, the incidence of crop losses due to elephant raids was on the rise in Bangarupalem, Yadamarri and Palamaner mandals. In addition to the 10 resident elephants of the Koundinya sanctuary belt, a herd of about 15 elephants from Tamil Nadu had emerged into the western mandals of Chittoor, resulting in more crop damage. The officials said that trenches or fencing was required in the sanctuary belt to the tune of 100 kilometres.

Mr. Gupta sought the officials to prepare the estimates for the fencing and trench works so that an early solution could be found for the man-animal conflict.

The electricity department officials were instructed to erect transformers at considerable heights and avoid overhanging of power lines over the fields, in order to avoid the possibility of elephants getting electrocuted.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cpj5ap/article30835580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJPAGEJUMBOMENACE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/avoid-jumbo-friendly-crops-farmers-urged-in-chittoor-district/article30835581.ece

142,2020/02/16,"Safe drinking water to all in State through water grid, says Minister","Kuppam to get funds for water, roads

Minister for Panchayat Raj, Mines and Geology Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy said that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was committed to providing safe drinking water to all families in the State through separate water grid, and the task would be accomplished at the earliest in a phased manner.

Speaking as the chief guest at the swearing-in ceremony of the new body of the Kuppam Rural Electric Co-Operative Society Limited (KRECS) at Kuppam on Saturday, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said other priority areas were to develop the rural infrastructure such as roads and housing scheme for the poor. “We are committed to creating housing for 25 lakh beneficiaries at 5 lakh units per year. By Ugadi, all the eligible persons would be getting housing sites,” he said.

Referring to Kuppam development, Mr. Reddy said that already the government had sanctioned ₹10 crore for the drinking water needs of the region, and another ₹10 crore would be released soon. “The Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanti waters would be brought to Kuppam in five years. A plan has been made for laying of roads in the rural areas of the region with ₹82 crore. The solar power infrastructure would be completed in Kuppam in five years,” he said.

He said that Mr. Chandrababu Naidu was answerable to the people of Kuppam as to why he had failed to make it a municipality despite representing the constituency for three decades, and being the Chief Minister for three terms. “Within six months of coming to power, the YSRCP government took the initiative to make Kuppam a municipality,” Mr Reddy said.

Pensions

Allaying the fears of the public that the government was resorting to removal of social welfare pensions to a section of people, the Minister said that there was no question of removing the pensions to anyone. “During the previous TDP government, the total numbers of pensions were 52 lakh, and now our government is providing for 54 lakh beneficiaries. After re-verification process, all the eligible persons would be given their pension in March, for two months,” Mr Reddy said.

He inaugurated the new building of KRESCO at Kuppam and the new blocks at the government hospital.

The third-year students belonging to the civil engineering stream have built a model bridge that would soon be erected in a nearby village in Krishna district.

Project lead Athikela Vijay told The Hindu, “The 27-metre-long bridge has been designed and put to use on the campus on Saturday. The cost per metre is about ₹400 and it yielded the expected results by withstanding a weight of 520 kg. A maximum of five persons can walk on the bridge at a time.”

The rope is prepared with coconut coir and bamboo sticks are used for steps while a parallel rope that runs along the bridge helps the walker to hold it for support.

“The villages which wait for the high-cost concrete bridges to be built across irrigation canals and streams and tribal areas could try it. We have designed it as a solution for such habitations,” said Mr. Vijay.

M. Sudheer, G. Srinu, Surya, Ch. Manikanta, A. Naveen, P. Raja, K.V.S. Babavali and P. Anudeep are the other students who worked on the project.

The model will be kept on display till Sunday evening and later thrown open for use by the students for some days.

IIIT-Nuzvid director D. Suryachandra Rao and other teaching staff commended the efforts of the students.

The model bridge was a major attraction during a two-day project exhibition held on the campus.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/t4v5vx/article30832622.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJCITYPAGE3IIIT-NUZVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/students-design-suspension-bamboo-bridge-for-rural-folk/article30832623.ece
145,2020/02/16,State to launch conservation plan for Eurasian Curlew,"Expert panel studying threats to come up with remedial action

The Andhra Pradesh government is all set to launch an action plan for the conservation of near threatened Eurasian Curlew (Numenius Arquata).

The Asian Waterfowl Census (AWC-2020) carried out in January recorded as many as 138 Eurasian Curlews in the Godavari estuary, mud-flats and salt pans in the East Godavari Riverine Estuarine Ecosystem (EGREE) in Andhra Pradesh.

“The Census has recorded 138 Eurasian Curlews through direct sighting. We are preparing a map archiving the sighting sites for future references and preparing the conservation plan,” Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife-Rajamahendravaram) told The Hindu.

National plan

The national action plan (2018-23) has committed for habitat conservation and research with international cooperation on the list of migratory birds, including Eurasian Curlew.

“The global population (of Eurasian Curlew) is on the decline due to habitat destruction,” observes the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). The action plan aims to conserve migratory birds and their habitats along the Central Asian Flyway and the plan has been developed by MoEFCC - Wildlife Division.

Expert panel

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Forest Resources) V. Bhaskara Ramana Murthy told The Hindu, “The sighting of 138 Eurasian Curlews is still considered a low number in the EGREE. The experts in the areas of population dynamics, habitat management and remote sensing have been formed into a team that is working on the conservation plan of the Eurasian Curlew in the EGREE. It will be executed once it gets the approval of the MoEFCC.”

“The details of the Eurasian Curlew recorded in the East Godavari district were shared at the 13th meeting of the CoP to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (January 15-22) held in Gujarat,” added Mr. Ramana Murthy.

According to a book, ‘Waterbirds of EGREE’, authored by P. Sathiyaselvam and Mr. Mrutyunjaya Rao, the Eurasian Curlew is solitary or in small parties. It migrates from the Central Siberia to the EGREE in October and is home-bound by April.

Indian Bird Conservation Network coordinator (Andhra Pradesh) and AWC-2020 principal coordinator K. Mrutyunjaya Rao said, “Recording the Eurasian Curlew is a celebration in the EGREE. However, documenting the threats of the migratory birds, preparation and execution of the action plan is need of the hour.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cur43u/article30832563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPAGEMUDFLAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-to-launch-conservation-plan-for-eurasian-curlew/article30832564.ece
146,2020/02/16,"Childhood cancers can be cured by timely diagnosis, say experts","Cure rates are low in India due to several challenges

Cancer in children constitutes 5.5 % of the total cancer cases in India, according to data available with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

While cure rates for common childhood cancers like lymphoma and leukaemia are over 80% in the developed world, in India they are abysmally low at around 30% due to challenges like inadequate access to timely and quality healthcare and exorbitant treatment costs in the private sector.

A majority of childhood cancer cases are being diagnosed between five and 14 years of age, that too at fairly advanced stages. These cancers are completely curable, if diagnosed early and treated in time, said Dr. Nirmalya Deo Pradhan, paediatric oncologist at Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (HBCH & RC), on the occasion of International Childhood Cancer Day on Saturday.

Around 90% of children with cancer are being given free treatment at HBCH & RC with funds for Women and Children’s Cancer, provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.

“The symptoms are different for different cancers, but children suffering from cancer have poor growth, poor weight gain and decreased appetite. One must get their children evaluated on seeing these symptoms,” said Dr. Pradhan.

Calling upon the public to make a difference by sponsoring a child’s treatment or enabling their access to supportive care services, Dr. D. Raghunatha Rao, director of HBCH & RC, said: “For every child who dies of cancer, the world loses several decades of life. Families that are left behind also experience tremendous agony. Let us act now before another child loses his or her life to childhood cancer.”

Lack of access

He underlined the need for diagnosis and treatment services to be more accessible to families all over the country. Currently, a number of the major cancer hospitals or those that have the requisite facilities are concentrated in big cities. Families who have a child suffering from cancer often need to travel long distances to access treatment. This only compounds the distress and anxiety.

Genetic susceptibility and specific environmental exposure play a major role in cancer incidence, said Dr. Maruti Prasad Upputuri, consultant paediatrician, KIMS ICON Hospital.

The symptoms differ with each type of cancer and are generally non-specific. Prolonged fever, weight loss, night sweats, painless swellings (especially lymph nodes), early morning headache with vomiting, abdominal mass, unexplained pains (especially bone pains) may be an indication of cancer.

Most general paediatricians rarely encounter children with cancer and they might miss the early symptoms. Whenever a child has unusual course of common child illness, one might consider malignancy, Dr. Maruti Prasad said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/childhood-cancers-can-be-cured-by-timely-diagnosis-say-experts/article30832262.ece

149,2020/02/16,"Lawson’s Bay beach, once a star attraction, now resembles a dumpyard","Protests planned by Waterman Rajendra Singh and Jal Biradari urging State govt. to set up a sewage treatment plant

The Lawsons Bay beach in Visakhapatnam, once hailed as one of the most pristine in the region, now resembles a dumpyard with mounds of plastic littering the beach.

The beach attracts few visitors, as there is barely any space to walk along the sea, let alone find a place to sit and enjoy the waves.

Tourists, both domestic as well as foreign, are taken aback when they arrive at the beach. “We read on a number of travel websites that Vizag is home to several beautiful beaches, with one of them being Lawson’s Bay. We came here with high expectations, but are shocked at seeing its present plight,” said a tourist who had come from West Bengal.

An added eyesore at the beach is the practice of allowing untreated sewage water from the city to flow into the sea at the beach.

Members of Jal Biradari, led by Waterman of India Rajendra Singh and JB’s national convener Bolisetty Satyanarayana, have planned to stage protests at the beach demanding that the State government take steps to set up a sewage treatment plant and stop the flow of untreated sewage water into the sea.

Addressing the media in Lawson’s Bay here on Saturday, Mr. Satyanarayana said that the beach was one of the most frequented ones in the city by tourists and was popular even before Independence. “It used to be one of the most beautiful places in the city and was the safest beach along the coast. But ever since the sewage drains were connected to the stormwater drain, the beach has become heavily polluted and has become reduced to an eyesore,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

Health risks

Apart from the untreated sewage water, chemical and toxic waste is also finding its way into the sea, thus posing a risk to marine ecology and affecting the livelihood of fishermen and the health of people bathing in the beach.

About 20,000 fishermen live along the coast in Yendada and Jalaripeta, and their lives are being affected due to the unchecked pollution at Lawson’s Bay beach, he said.

“For the last three years, we have been trying to raise awareness on this issue but authorities have not shown any concern. On the contrary, the situation is becoming worse with every passing day,” Mr. Satyanarayana added.

Whenever there is a downpour, the rainwater washes large amounts of plastic on to the beach, further aggravating the situation.

Authorities should realise that environment, ecology, air and water pollution amount to violation of the right to life of the fishermen as assured in Article 21 of the Constitution, Mr. Satyanarayana said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ctus3r/article30832143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-VZ-PLASTICGARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lawsons-bay-beach-once-a-star-attraction-now-resembles-a-dumpyard/article30832144.ece

P.V.N. Madhav, BJP MLC, has described the move to abolish the Legislative Council as “unfortunate and unilateral.”

“This proves that the YSRCP government is not willing to listen to alternative views in a democracy.” Mr. Madhav said while addressing the media here on Saturday.

At the national level, the BJP was of the view that Legislative Councils should continue to function, he added. The BJP was opposed to the three capitals proposal, Mr. Madhav said.

Referring to the procedure of constituting the select committee to look into the Bills pertaining to the three capitals and repeal of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA), he said the legal and constitutional process should be followed, but the Chairman should be respected.

“The BJP has suggested my name for the committee on the decentralisation Bill and the name of Somu Verraju for the one on the CRDA Repeal Bill,” Mr. Madhav added.

Railway zone

The MLC further said that a detailed project for the new railway zone had been sent to the government.

151,2020/02/16,"Passports of former CM, his son should be cancelled: Minister","‘I had to quit Telugu Desam because of large-scale corruption in it’

The fact that ₹2,000 crore was siphoned off allegedly by the firms and persons known to TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, as was detected in the raids conducted by the Income Tax Department recently, indicated that the former Chief Minister was into money laundering, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao alleged on Saturday.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said he had to quit the TDP because of the large-scale corruption in it.

“It was for this reason Prime Minister Narendra Modi had distanced himself from Mr. Naidu. The Centre had stopped supporting the TDP government based on information about its corrupt practices,” the Minister claimed.

Charging Mr. Naidu with swindling funds allotted by the Central government for various projects, Mr. Srinivasa Rao alleged that the former Chief Minister had even funded the oppositions parties in various States that contested against the BJP.

‘Detailed probe needed’

“We urge Mr. Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to order an inquiry by the law enforcement agencies into all the benami assets of the TDP leaders. The passports of Mr. Naidu, his son Lokesh, and all those under scanner should be cancelled,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said.

Referring to the talk that the YSRCP might join the NDA, he said, “Such decisions will be taken only by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and nobody else is authorised to talk about it.”

Land pooling

On pooling of land in Visakhapatnam, the Minister said the agitation against it was politically motivated.

“We will pool 6,000 acres to benefit 1.7 lakh people who do not have houses. The scheme is for the poor, and the agitation indicates that the TDP and other parties are anti-poor,” he said.

On the ongoing agitation by the resource persons, he said, “The TDP government used to pay them ₹3,000 per month. It had not paid them the amount in the last eight months of its tenure. On the other hand, the YSRCP government increased the pay to ₹10,000. The amount will be paid to them in a week’s time.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/44rzds/article30832100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-VJ-MUTTAMSETTISRINIVASARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/passports-of-former-cm-his-son-should-be-cancelled-minister/article30832101.ece
152,2020/02/16,YSRCP failed to get Special Category Status: Sailajanath,"Capital should ideally be located at State’s centre, says APCC chief

Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president Sake Sailajanath on Saturday slammed the YSR Congress Party for failing to deliver on its promise made in its election manifesto of securing Special Category Status for the State.

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Sailajanath said that the YSRCP was unable to put pressure on the Centre to grant SCS for the State.

He added that funds were not released for the Sujala Sravanthi scheme and the Visakhapatnam railway zone, which was announced in February last year.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should tell the people what he has achieved in his recent meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah,” the PCC president said.

Mr. Sailajanath said that the Congress was opposed to the three capitals move. “The capital of a State should ideally be located in its centre,” he said.

He added that while the Chief Minister had welcomed the establishment of the State capital in Amaravati when it was proposed in the Assembly, the ruling party is now singing a different tune.

Mr. Sailajanath also accused the YSRCP of using the three capitals issue as a distractionary tactic to sideline public attention from its failures.

He said that an all-party meeting should be convened on the capitals issue.

“Visakhapatnam witnessed rapid development during Congress rule. Several IT and pharma industries were set up when Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister,” Mr. Sailajanath said.

On local body elections, he said that Congress would contest all seats in the local body and municipal elections across the State.

Earlier, PCC working president Tulasi Reddy criticised the YSRCP for its proposal to establish three capitals in the State. He said that Visakhapatnam should be developed as a financial and IT capital of the State, and alleged that YSRCP leaders were eager to be a part of the NDA government at the Centre.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/t7z99y/article30834236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-VZ-SAILAJANATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-failed-to-get-special-category-status-sailajanath/article30832093.ece
153,2020/02/16,"Telugu Desam leaders’ role in scam evident, alleges Buggana","‘Exposures in the recent I-T raids are just the tip of the iceberg’

“This is only the tip of the iceberg, and more such revelations will follow,” Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy has said while commenting on the recent Income Tax raids on the TDP leaders.

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy alleged that P. Srinivas, the former personal secretary of TDP national president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu, was the “kingpin” in the scam.

“Mr. Srinivas had worked in the Chief Minister’s Office from 1997-2004 when Mr. Naidu was at the helm. Later, he joined the TDP. In 2014, he became Mr. Naidu’s personal secretary,” the Minister said.

Levelling serious allegations of financial impropriety against the TDP leaders, the Minister said, “These are the ones who give lectures about morality and integrity.” Mr. Rajendranath Reddy further alleged that K. Rajesh, the TDP organising secretary and a childhood friend of its general secretary N. Lokesh, was also directly involved in the scam.

Staff Reporter in Guntur writes: “There is no truth in the reports published by a section of the media that is close to Mr. Naidu that the real estate sector has crumbled in the Amaravati region,” YSRCP MLA Kolusu Parthasarathy said while addressing the media at Tadepalli in Guntur district.

‘Ploy to save TDP’

“Such stories are being put out with the sole aim of saving the TDP. It is a clever ploy to deflect attention from the recent raids conducted by the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on industrialists close to the TDP,” he said.

“I am sad to say that Mr. Naidu is conducting himself as a village sarpanch. The stories on the real estate sector are nothing but figment of their imagination,” said Mr. Parthasarathy.

“The agitation by Mr. Naidu for Amaravati has no real strength as people across the State believe that he is doing it for the sake of a few realtors,” he said.

‘Realty boom’

“In fact, there is a real estate boom in all the three regions of the State after the announcement of the three capitals proposal,” he claimed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/telugu-desam-leaders-role-in-scam-evident-alleges-buggana/article30832076.ece

Santhosh, national joint organising secretary of BJP, said on Sunday that the “political stability” in the State following the byelections to 15 Assembly seats would result in good governance.

He was speaking at the meeting of the BJP district unit. He said electoral success was not dependent on money, but on good governance and the way in which a party responds to the problems of the common man. Claiming that the benefits of welfare schemes reached only a small section of society during the Congress and coalition rule, he said people who were disappointed with the “maladministration” in the past six years now had high expectations of the BJP government.

Addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi, Mr. Hiremath said daily wage workers had a major role in increasing the forest cover in the district. They not only plant saplings, but also protect them till they grow to a certain height by erecting fences around them. Though the Forest Department issued a circular in March 2018 directing officials to deposit wages in their bank accounts, they are still receiving wages in cash, he said. He said the prescribed minimum wage was ₹11,000 a month, but the workers were being paid between ₹2,000 and ₹6,000.

Srimanth Siddaram and Shivaraya Kotgi, both daily wage workers, said that they were paid once in four months and were asked to collect their wages either from the contractor or the security guards of the department. “The salary that we receive is meagre and insufficient,” said Mr. Siddaram.

Mr. Hiremath demanded that the dues to workers for the past four months be cleared immediately.

Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) national president H.D. Deve Gowda has accused the BJP government in the State of indulging in vendetta politics by cancelling most of the development works sanctioned by the JD(S)-Congress coalition government.

Addressing presspersons here on Sunday, he said that on the one hand the BJP leaders were talking about not indulging in vendetta politics, but on the other they were missing no opportunity to trouble the Opposition party workers. Withdrawal of projects and grants sanctioned by the previous government had hindered development activities in many areas. This apart, the JD(S) workers were being harassed and assaulted by using police force, he alleged, referring to an incident where a JD(S) leader was allegedly threatened by the police.

He said he would fight against any such high-handedness against the Opposition members.

Mr. Gowda said he was not deterred by the debacle in the Parliamentary elections and added that he would take all possible steps to strengthen the party network and instil confidence among the workers by touring the State. Alongside, efforts would be made to expand the party network in Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh, where it had presence, he said.

About the future course of action, he said: “My immediate priority is to prepare the party to face the upcoming Assembly and Parliamentary elections, which are likely to be held simultaneously in 2023.”

Mr. Gowda ruled out any alliance with the Congress and said he had declined the offer by senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on holding fresh talks. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has openly said that poll alliance with the JD(S) had cost his party dearly. “Therefore, there is no scope for fresh alliance,” he said.

He said the Union Budget has failed to address issues concerning the farm sector. Allocation for the agriculture sector has been reduced by ₹1 lakh crore, he said.

Later, Mr. Gowda called on veteran journalist Patil Puttappa who is undergoing treatment at KIMS.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hv6lf1/article30836957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGDVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bsy-government-indulging-in-vendetta-politics/article30836958.ece
160,2020/02/16,Vijayendra’s leadership dreams get a platform,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y. Vijayendra was at the forefront of organising a convention of seers, predominantly from the Lingayat community, here on Sunday. This was a carefully curated platform for him to emerge as a young leader of reckoning within the community, advisers to the father-son duo said.

This is the first time Mr. Vijayendra has tried to project himself as a leader on a mass platform linked to the community, sources in the powerful community body Akhila Bharata Veerashaiva Mahasabha said. “He has turned out to be a rising young leader. But a person’s leadership quality is tested when out of power, not when in power,” a senior functionary said.

The Opposition leaders also sharing stage with him will only give credence to the projection of his leadership, sources said.

Led by Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru, several seers and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who were active in the recent Lingayat religion movement shared stage with Mr. Vijayendra at the convention. This may not go down well with the powerful Panchamasali and Veerashaiva subsects, sources said.

Mr. Vijayendra, with the blessing of his father, has been on an orchestrated campaign to gain foothold both in the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community, trying to position himself as the political successor to his father. He had accompanied the Chief Minister during the recent parleys with the high command over Cabinet expansion, raising eyebrows.

As BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel is all set to reorganise the party organisation here, the Chief Minister has been pushing to get Mr. Vijayendra appointed as general secretary, sources said. Taking him to meetings with the high command was to lobby for the same. However, the central leadership has made no promises, sources said.

Mr. Vijayendra was in-charge of bypolls in K.R. Pet, Mandya, that the party won for the first time in history and this is being cited as proof of his organisational skills. After being denied ticket for Varuna segment during the 2018 Assembly polls, he was accommodated in the party’s youth wing.

However, the Chief Minister promoting his son has irked many senior leaders within the party especially from the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community.

“Opposition to dynastic politics has been our main plank against the Congress and we cannot be seen falling for the same,” a senior party leader said.

In the unsigned letter being circulated in the party and on social media, calling for a change of the Chief Minister, Mr. Vijayendra has been accused of “running a parallel administration”. Shortly after Mr. Yediyurappa took charge last year, Mr. Vijayendra had to publicly deny allegations of interference in administration.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bk50x1/article30836931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGYEDIYURAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vijayendras-leadership-dreams-get-a-platform/article30836932.ece
161,2020/02/16,Unsigned letter calls for change of CM,"Authors of the letter, who claim to be BSY’s staunch followers, cite his ‘age-related health issues’

As Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is all set to celebrate his 77th birthday on a grand scale, the faction rid BJP State unit seems to be in a churn. An unsigned and anonymous letter, being widely circulated in the party and on social media, has called for change of leadership citing his alleged “age-related health issues”.

The letter comes in the wake of dissatisfaction among several senior BJP legislators over not making it to the Cabinet during the recent expansion.

The letter cites the Chief Minister’s alleged age-related issues and says it was better if he retired from electoral politics and turned a “margadarshak”. The letter further suggests that the party should use his experience by making him Governor.

However, sources close to the Chief Minister argued that Mr. Yediyurappa was “fit” as reflected in his extensive touring of the State. “He remains the only mass leader for the BJP in the State as was evident in the recent victory in Assembly bypolls,” a strategist close to him said. He also claimed that the Chief Minister had “full blessing of the BJP Central leadership”.

The authors of the four-page letter, who claim to be “staunch followers of Mr. Yediyurappa”, give considerable space praising his role in bringing the party to power and say that “they made him Chief Minister despite the high command not liking it”. But the letter says it was painful to see how owing to age-related issues, he had become “weak, helpless, and inactive”. Alleging that the Chief Minister had built a fort around himself, the letter says his family members of four generations were interfering in administration. The letter alleges that Mr. Yediyurappa has been asking legislators and other party leaders to meet his son B.Y. Vijayendra over administrative issues.

The letter also alleges that the Chief Minister doesn’t let anyone in the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community grow.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/unsigned-letter-calls-for-change-of-cm/article30836904.ece
162,2020/02/16,Residents of Mysuru killed in Karkala accident cremated,"The bodies of all nine residents of Mysuru who were killed in a road accident near Karkala in Udupi district on Saturday were brought back to the city on Sunday and cremated.

The nine were part of a 35-member group, including employees of a data entry company in Mysuru, that was on a weekend tour. The bodies were brought back to Mysuru around 10 a.m. on Sunday and handed over to relatives. A private bus hit a boulder on Mulnar Ghat, near Karkala, on Saturday evening, killing nine and leaving the others injured. The injured are still undergoing treatment in various hospitals in Karkala and Manipal.

The dead included three women. The Mysuru city police identified them as Radha Ravi, Yogendra, Preetham Gowda, Basavaraju, Anagna, Ranjitha, and Sharul, besides the driver and the cleaner of the bus engaged from a private travel company in Mysuru.

Out of the nine dead, four belonged to Vital Records Pvt. Ltd., a data entry company situated in JCK Industrial Park in Metagalli police limits. The other five who died included the bus driver, the cleaner, and the cook.

However, the company, where more than 150 people work, had not organised the trip. “A few employees of the firm planned it. We still don’t know how many from the company were in the group. We will know only when the office reopens on Monday after the weekend holidays,” said a police source.

The group had left Mysuru around 10.30 p.m. on Friday.

163,2020/02/16,"After years of losses, Sahakara Sarige calls off bus services","With only a few days left for the 30th anniversary of its launch, the Transport Cooperative Society, popularly known as Sahakara Sarige, has called off its services temporarily. Unable to bear the increasing losses, the executive committee of the society has stopped services on 76 routes spread over Chikkamagaluru, Udupi and Shivamogga districts.

E.S. Dharmappa, president of the society, convened a meeting of employees in Koppa on Sunday to discuss the future course of action. The society is finding it difficult to clear a loan of ₹11.5 crore, with the increase in diesel prices and other costs.

The society has 68 buses, with a total of 300 workers, depending on its operations. It has not been able to pay insurance and road tax. The society has appealed to the State government repeatedly to come to its rescue. A delegation had met Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa also in this regard.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Dharmappa said the services would be restarted if the society received financial support. “We are waiting for the Deputy Commissioner’s response,” he said.

The society shared this information on social media on Saturday night across three districts. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation allotted eight buses on these routes on Sunday to help passengers. However, the impact of this temporary shutdown of services could be severe from Monday as more than 12,000 students depend on Sahakara Sarige buses to reach schools and colleges.

Cooperative model

Sahakara Sarige came into existence on March 8, 1991, after Shankar Transport Company, a private firm, closed its operations, and its workers came together to run it on a cooperative model. They adopted an employee-friendly bylaw and the society grew from four buses to 68 over the years. Here, employees are elected to the executive body.

The society offered services in remote areas in the hilly parts of the three districts. It provided students and the physically challenged with passes and concession fare for the elderly. It was making a profit till 2013. Interestingly, many experts from distant places, including researchers from Japan, came here to study its business model.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/after-years-of-losses-sahakara-sarige-calls-off-bus-services/article30836870.ece

Three Kashmiri engineering students, arrested on sedition charges in Hubballi, were released after the execution of a bond under Section 169 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc), police said on Sunday.

The three students from Kashmir, who were studying at an engineering college in Hubballi, were arrested on Saturday on charges of sedition and attempt to disrupt communal harmony, after a video in which they allegedly raised “Pro-Pakistan” slogans went viral, leading to protests from Hindutva outfits.

The students were released after they executed a bond under Section 169 of the CrPc, wherein they come back whenever they are summoned, Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner R. Dilip said.

Section 169 of the CrPc is invoked when an investigating officer is of the view that sufficient evidence is not available to produce an accused before a court for remand.

Mr. Dilip said the police were handling the matter sensitively because the case itself was sensitive with national ramifications, which may lead to a media trial.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fedeh9/article30834827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200215-WA0028,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sedition-charges-3-engineering-students-from-kashmir-released/article30835457.ece

The protesters took out a rally from their office to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and demonstrated by placing a few empty LPG cylinders on the ground.

According to them, the BJP-led Narendra Modi government has increased the LPG cylinder price to avenge its defeat in the recently held Delhi Assembly elections.

Raising slogans against the Centre, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the Mahila Congress leaders said that the economic policies of the BJP government at the Centre have been badly affecting the common man since 2014.

The Centre has increased the price of a cylinder by ₹149, the steepest since 2014. Moreover, it has been failing to curb the rising prices of commodities since it came to power, they said.

He said that, by failing to prevent the price hike, the government has betrayed the families that had voluntarily surrendered their subsidised LPG connections by responding to its ‘Give it up’ campaign.

‘Hasty decisions’

He said that the owners of food outlets that depend on non-subsidised LPG cylinders for their business will suffer from this steep hike. Alleging that the Centre has failed to manage the economy in a proper manner, he said that the “hasty decisions” on demonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax have left the economy in a state of disarray.

172,2020/02/16,Belagavi district struggles to make do with just 7.7% of flood relief fund sought,"As against estimated loss of ₹11,193 crore in the district, only ₹867 crore has been received

With the Centre releasing only a fraction of the financial support sought, flood relief in the State is hampered, admit officials involved in the relief work in Belagavi, one of the worst-hit districts.

An officer in the district treasury confirmed that as against the estimated loss of ₹11,193 crore in the district, relief amount of ₹867 crore had been received. “That is around 7.7% of the required amount. This is proportional to the total relief received by the State from the Centre. Of the ₹867 crore, ₹500 crore is being distributed to those who lost houses, ₹200 crore is being spent on repairing public infrastructure, and ₹167 crore has been adjusted against the money spent on rescue and relief operations,” the officer said.

“In some cases, work done on credit is yet to be reimbursed. Bills of some contractors for vehicles and those of rented community halls are yet to be paid. We are clearing them one by one based on the gram panchayats and municipal towns that had supplied accounts,” said an officer.

Schools get too little

Around 4,000 schools were damaged in the floods in 2019. “As per the Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) norms, each school should get ₹2 lakh for repairs. But according to the fund allotment, we are getting only ₹15,000 for each school. Senior officers are saying that reconstruction of each school will be taken up in due course, under different heads and not necessarily under flood relief,” said an Education Department officer.

Repairs have started in most schools, under the CRF and zilla panchayat funds, another officer said, and added that Belagavi district, for example, has received less than 10% of the relief it sought towards this. District-wise data shows that of the 2.2 lakh families affected by floods in 872 villages in Belagavi district, an ex gratia payment of ₹10,000 had been made to 1.1 lakh families.

The kin of 29 of the 32 people who died have got compensation of ₹5 lakh each. Two victims had no legal representative who could claim the money and payment in another case is stuck owing to delay in DNA test to confirm the identity of the victim.

Damaged public infrastructure include 24,000 km of power lines, 6,000 km of roads, 3,367 government schools and other buildings, and 1,146 drinking water schemes. The loss to these infrastructures is estimated at ₹2,149 crore. But the amount fixed for their repair is ₹200 crore. The rest will be taken up under annual plans in the coming years, said an officer.

Waiting for Budget

“The government has decided that the houses will be built as per the annual district allotment under the Rajiv Gandhi Housing Corporation norms over five years. Roadworks will be taken up under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, and taluk and district main road schemes. Work on wider and longer roads will be taken up under the Central road fund and rural connectivity scheme. Minor repairs will be taken up under the panchayat schemes or the local area development schemes for legislators. A clearer picture will emerge after the State Budget on March 5,” said the officer.

Only 8.5% for State

Across the State, as many as 91 people died and 3,400 animals got washed away in the floods in 2019. Crops on 7.5 lakh hectares were damaged. As many as 2.5 lakh families lost their houses and nearly 22,000 km of roads got damaged.

“The State government had sought a relief of ₹35,160 crore. But the Centre released around ₹3,000 crore. That is around 8.5% percent of the estimated loss. We have no option but to work around it,” said an officer in the Disaster Management Department in the Revenue ministry.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dtw89q/article30832690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGBELAGAVISCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/belagavi-district-struggles-to-make-do-with-just-77-of-flood-relief-fund-sought/article30832691.ece
173,2020/02/16,Yediyurappa’s 77th birthday planned as a ‘non-partisan’ bash,"Four former Chief Ministers to be on stage to mark the day

B.S. Yediyurappa, the only Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Chief Minister the party has chosen for public office beyond the 75-year age limit, is all set to celebrate his 77th birthday on February 27 as a grand public event. A felicitation volume is being planned to be released on the day.

Though many senior leaders of the BJP, including Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, will take part, it is planned as a “non-partisan” event, said sources. Opposition leaders and former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah from the Congress and H.D. Kumaraswamy from the Janata Dal (Secular) are expected to participate.

“Four former Chief Ministers of the State — S.M. Krishna, Mr. Siddaramaiah, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, and Mr. Kumaraswamy — will felicitate the Chief Minister. It is a rare non-partisan occasion to appreciate the long public life of Mr. Yediyurappa, also reflecting the democratic traditions of the State,” said Mahadeva Prakash, media adviser to the Chief Minister.

He is also the chief editor of the felicitation volume. The volume includes 78 articles about Mr. Yediyurappa from all walks of life — politicians cutting across party lines, bureaucrats, writers, spiritual leaders, and even scientists, he added. In a faction-ridden party and amid persistent rumours that refuse to die that central leadership is looking beyond Mr. Yediyurappa to take the lead in the State, the event seeks to reassert the Chief Minister’s position as the only leader of high stature within the party, sources close to Mr. Yediyurappa said.

Sending out a message

“The high command has also often not dealt with him with the respect he deserves, being the senior-most Chief Minister and a mass leader of the party in the country today. The delay in flood relief and Cabinet expansion, and forcing on him three deputies, have created bad optics. He now seeks to remould himself in the role of a senior statesman, whom even the high command cannot ignore,” a strategist close to the Chief Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wcjys5/article30832632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30KRAYEDIYURAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappas-77th-birthday-planned-as-a-non-partisan-bash/article30832634.ece
174,2020/02/16,Hajabba wants village school upgraded,"He has been chosen for the Padma Shri for promoting education

Harekala Hajabba, who has been chosen for the Padma Shri for promoting education in a village, broke down when the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar visited the government school promoted by him in Harekala village on Saturday.

Mr. Kumar was the second Education Minister to visit his school after Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri since it was started about two decades ago. After felicitating the Minister, Mr. Hajabba demanded the promotion of the school — that now has classes from 1 to 10 — to Karnataka Public School so that it could offer education up to pre-university. “This should be done by considering it a special case. With this, we can attract more students,” he said.

Mr. Hajabba also demanded a playground and compound wall for the school that was spread across 1.33 acres. The primary school building needed repairs and a full-fledged science laboratory, library and computer laboratory. Proper bus facility should also be arranged, he told the Minister.

The Minister who felicitated Mr. Hajabba told him that he would examine the demands.

“I came here just to salute the man who built the school for society,” Mr. Kumar said. He told the students to study hard and bring laurels to the school. If the Class 10 students excelled, the school would naturally attract more students. The Minister said that society called those who turned educational institutes into business ventures ‘educationists’. But Mr. Hajabba was the real educationist as he spent all the money he got for the school.

Students told journalists that Mr. Hajabba visited the school every day. “We have only one computer in the high school. We need more,” said Fathima Johara.

The primary section has 91 students and the high school, 73. U.T. Khader, former Minister and MLA of Mangaluru also accompanied the Minister.

His Herculean task

Harekala Hajabba, now in his 60s, has been eking out a living by selling oranges at Central Market in the city. One day, a foreigner asked him the price of a kg of oranges. He could not answer as he did not know English. Mr. Hajabba did not want the children of his Harekala village, on the outskirts of Mangaluru, to face a similar situation and decided to open a primary school.

The school began in a madrasa on June 17, 2000. Later, it became a government school and the high school section was opened in 2007. Mr. Hajabba built the school with grants from the government, companies and from donors. Initially, he contributed ₹5,000, which was his savings from selling oranges.

Mr. Hajabba’s achievement has become a subject of study in UG courses in Mangaluru, Davangere and Kuvempu universities. In addition, Kannada-medium schools in Kerala have been teaching about him to Class 8 and Class 10 students. He has won various awards and used the money he won for the school itself.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a6cc61/article30832624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MNHAJAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hajabba-wants-village-school-upgraded/article30832625.ece

It has upset the intricate livelihood arrangements between communities, land and waterscapes, a new study has found.

‘Closing the Enforcement Gap: A community led ground truthing of the expansion of a National Highway Project in Uttara Kannada’, a study carried out between June 2016 and August 2018 along 187 km of NH 66, shows non-compliance in taking permissions for blasting, groundwater and river water withdrawal, dumping of soil on wetlands and creeks which caused flooding and saltwater intrusion, among others. The recently-released study argues that liner projects such as NH 66 have the potential to change existing land use of large areas, and these changes are visible on landscapes of both sides of the highway.

The study was conducted by the Centre for Policy Research-Namati Environmental Justice Programme and communities from towns and villages situated between Karwar and Kundapura.

Many disputes

It was in 2011 that the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) proposed the widening and upgrading of the existing NH 17 (renaming it as NH-66). It was meant to reduce traffic, fuel consumption and accidents, and save time. It was also claimed that the construction of the highway would bring development in all areas it passed through and led to economic growth of the region. “Right from when project-related activities began, local newspapers consistently reported ongoing disputes between the communities and authorities,” the study states, adding that apart from land acquisition, locals have also raised objection to the non-compliance of the project’s clearance conditions and its adverse impacts.

Researchers pointed out that many village communities lost the right of access to public property such as public roads, drinking water sources and schools. Some communities lost access to common land, while several rivers, streams and creeks had been blocked for the construction of bridges and roads, and these blockages resulted in flooding and saltwater intrusion into farmlands during the monsoon.

“Many villages were affected by the stone blasting activities carried out for the widening of the highway. Villages located near the stone crusher units encountered health and livelihood-related problems due to dust pollution. There were reports of damage to public property such as pipelines, drainage systems, water tanks and other public utilities. The project construction activities led to massive landslips in several areas... (such as) in Byndoor in June 2017. Another landslip near Divgi village in Kumta completely destroyed eight houses. Three children who were sleeping in these homes were killed by this,” says the study.

Gap in population hit

Researchers have said that the project Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report did not estimate the population that would be affected by environmental impacts, instead giving only the estimate of people who would be affected by land acquisition for the project. “As per the EIA report, approximately 2,602 structures/households comprising 3,953 people would be affected by the project. As per our study, more than 44,000 people are affected by various project activities and related impacts,” it said.

The study concludes that permissions which were specified in the EC (Environment Clearance) were not taken, as a result of which many activities undertaken for the project are ‘illegal’, affecting the lives of communities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/541rbk/article30832588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGKUMTALANDSLIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nh-66-expansion-hit-more-lives-ecology-than-estimated-study/article30832589.ece
176,2020/02/16,It was a fraud in the selection process: HC,"Directs govt. to pay relief of ₹10 lakh to candidate who didn’t get job in 2010

The High Court of Karnataka has set aside the appointment of an advocate made to the post of Assistant Public Prosecutor-cum-Assistant Government Pleader (APP-cum-AGP) in 2010 while holding that there was ‘systematic fraud’ in the selection process. The HC also directed the Home Department to pay compensation of ₹10 lakh to a candidate, who was deprived of an appointment despite securing more marks than the one who was appointed.

A Division Bench comprising Justice G. Narendar and Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order in Kalaburgagi Bench while dismissing a petition filed by Ashok Kumar, who had challenged the order passed by the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal in October 2019.

“But for the inflated marks, Mr. Kumar could not have been appointed to the of APP-cum-AGP and inflated marks is a result of systematic fraud,” the Bench held, while pointing out that one Revanna P.C. was denied the benefit of appointment owing to fraud committed by the selection authority.

The Bench said that the Home Department, after paying compensation to Mr. Revanna, should identify the officers responsible for commission of fraud, hold an inquiry, fix responsibility and recover the compensation from them by following due process of law while partly modifying the Tribunal’s directing the government to pay compensation of ₹10 lakh.

It also directed the government to consider appointing Mr. Revanna to the post while rejecting Mr. Kumar’s plea to allow him continue in the post as he had already worked for 10 years. “In an appointment, secured by fraud, this court should require them to disgorge the benefit of these ill-gotten gains but, here, a streak of sympathy has to be shown as Mr. Kumar has worked and earned his salary for the last ten years, and now directing recovery of the salary would be improper,” the Bench observed.

Destroyed answer scripts

The Selection Authority had told the tribunal that it had, in normal course in June 2013 destroyed the answer scripts of the selection process held in 2009-10 to select candidates to the posts of APP-cum-AGP under the quota reserved for the Scheduled Caste, to which both candidates belong, even though Mr. Revanna’s petition was pending since 2010.

Background

The selection authority, after holding a written test and interview during 2009-10, had notified the list of total marks obtained by all candidates.

On the list, Mr. Revanna had secured 86.2 marks and Mr. Kumar had secured 84.4 marks. However, when the provisional selection list was notified in April 2010, Mr. Revanna did not find his name. Mr. Kumar’s name was found on the list, and surprisingly with the higher mark of 87.4 instead of the earlier mark of 84.4. Mr. Revanna moved the tribunal in 2010 as the selection authority did not consider his objection for inflated marks shown to Mr. Kumar in the provisional list.

As the answer scripts were not available for examination due to destruction during the pendency of litigation, both the tribunal and the HC declined to accept the argument of the State government that there was typographical error in marks’ list in relation to marks awarded to Mr. Kumar and hence it was rectified in the provisional list.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cfymxv/article30832579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/it-was-a-fraud-in-the-selection-process-hc/article30832580.ece
177,2020/02/16,Restructuring of Animal Husbandry department on the cards,"Focus on farmer-friendly steps, disease prevention

A makeover is on the cards for the Animal Husbandry Department, with the focus primarily on farmer-friendly restructuring of departmental institutions and heightened vigil against diseases.

Animal Husbandry Director M.K. Prasad handed over an internally prepared draft report containing the recommendations to Animal Husbandry Minister K. Raju last week. It stresses the scientific restructuring of department check-posts to forestall the spread of diseases like foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) through animals trucked in from neighbouring States.

At present, only of two of the 18 rinderpest (RP) check-posts under the department have veterinary surgeons, the draft points out. Their presence is essential for effective disease diagnosis. Many check-posts also have not been repositioned despite road development and changed routes. All check-posts, the report adds, should also have a minimum of three livestock inspectors.

Filling vacancies

Stressing the need for filling critical vacancies, including that of lab technicians, the draft suggests a series of structural changes to enable department veterinarians to spend more time on disease-control measures and interaction with farmers.

It recommends the formation of more taluk-level animal husbandry centres. This will help to bring in efficiency and reduce the burden of District Animal Husbandry Officers who are currently in charge of all such institutions in a district.

Relocating centres

The draft report advises relocating veterinary sub-centres on the basis of factors such as cattle population and geography. Though the State has 1,341 sub-centres, many local bodies lack one. At the same time, some panchayats with low cattle population sport more than two centres. A redeployment would enable timely services to farmers and reduce the workload of veterinary hospitals, the report pointed out.

If a district has multiple veterinary hospitals, they can be shifted to agriculture-oriented districts like Wayanad and Idukki, it says, in addition to outlining measures for streamlining veterinary polyclinics. Polyclinics should be opened in all taluks and they should function from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. At present, there are 50 polyclinics in the State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/restructuring-of-animal-husbandry-dept-on-the-cards/article30837132.ece
178,2020/02/16,115 Keralites in camp test negative for SARS-CoV-2,"‘They have to be in home quarantine for 28 days’

Samples taken from 115 Keralites who were brought to New Delhi from China by air have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said on Sunday.

The information was passed on to the State by the Union Health Ministry, the Minister said. Although they would be allowed to return to Kerala from Monday onwards, they would have to remain in isolation in their residences for 28 days, she added. The 115 persons were placed in isolation in two camps in Delhi.

On alert

Forty-two persons who were placed under observation in Kerala had been discharged as per the revised guidelines. Nonetheless, the Health Department continued to be on alert against the epidemic, the Minister said.

According to her, 2,276 persons are currently under observation in various districts.

Of this, 14 are admitted to various hospitals, while the rest are under observation in their houses.

Of the 418 samples rushed to the National Institute of Virology, 405 have tested negative.

Discharged

A Wuhan-returned patient, who had been undergoing treatment in Kasaragod district for coronavirus infection, had been discharged.

Of the confirmed cases in the State, only the student who was under treatment in Thrissur remained to be discharged.

179,2020/02/16,Minorities moving closer to CPI(M),"Party’s bid to expose communal agenda may strengthen stir against Citizenship (Amendment) Act

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] leadership’s decision to expose the polarisation of fundamentalist elements and maintain the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) agitation as a secular movement are expected to lure and further deepen its clout among different sections that have been reluctant to join hands with the party and the Left Democratic Front (LDF).

Enthused by the response and participation of different denominations of Christian and Muslim communities in the human chain formed by the LDF on January 26, the CPI(M) State committee that was in session here has decided to emulate the same pattern for its future course of action.

The party’s resolve to bare the ‘divisive agenda’ of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Islamic fundamentalists, who were allegedly trying to infiltrate into the ranks of the protesters, is expected to garner more public support for the agitation.

The State committee’s decision to doggedly sustain the tempo as well as tone and tenor of the human chain are expected to help the LDF overcome the allegations that the agitations were aimed at wooing certain sections and appeasing them for electoral gains.

The decision would help cast a clear public impression that the party was equally opposed to fundamentalism and communalism of all hues.

The UDF as well as the Congress will now have to furnish convincing reasons for obstinately dodging calls from the LDF for joint agitations and ignoring the clamour from within the front for such collective moves.

But the contradictory stance of the CPI(M) regional and State leaders on the arrest of two youths from Kozhikode invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act may come in handy for the Opposition to target the party in the coming days.

The leadership will have to strive hard to clear the air.

And that fire-fighting needs to be taken up immediately so that it will not harm the party’s prospects in the local body polls scheduled to be held within next six months.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6m7s57/article30837118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVTV-SHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/minorities-moving-closer-to-cpim/article30837119.ece
180,2020/02/16,Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation to buy cashew apples,"To be bought at ₹3 a piece from farmers, will be used in value-added products

In a bid to support cashew farmers and expand its range of value-added products, the Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) has started procuring cashew apple from various sources. The corporation has been promoting cashew farming to maximise local raw cashew nut production, but it is sourcing cashew apple directly from the farmers for the first time.

New product

“We get the best quality cashew apple during summer and this year we will introduce a new product, natural cashew vinegar. Usually farmers collect only the nut and the highly nutritious fruit is wasted in all other parts of India, except Goa where it is used for making feni,” S. Jayamohan, chairman, KSCDC, told The Hindu.

Of late, the corporation has been striving to ensure sufficient amount of raw nuts to keep the cashew industry afloat, but there was not much demand for cashew apple.

“Farmers will get an extra income as we will buy each apple for ₹3. Currently the KSCDC is offering value-added products, including soda, jam, and juice, using cashew apple,” he said.

Till now, the KSCDC has been procuring cashew apple pulp from Cashew Research Station, Madakkathara, under the Kerala Agricultural University.

Not sufficient

“But it was not sufficient to meet the demand and by directly procuring apple from all sources we will be able to provide the products all year round,” he added.

At present the corporation is procuring raw nuts for its factories from farms at Aralam and the Cheemeni open prison and the ones under the Plantation Corporation of Kerala and the Forest Development Corporation. “We have passed on the information that we will be procuring both nut and apple from now on,” Mr. Jayamohan said.

Shorter saplings

The KSCDC has been distributing a high-yielding, shorter variety of cashew sapling that starts flowering in the first year.

Usually the plants will be ready for harvest by the third year.

“Many farmers have already come forward and they have been instructed how to harvest the cashew properly. It will be very easy to collect the fruit from the variety we provided and we have advised to use nets for taller trees,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kscdc-to-buy-cashew-apples/article30837102.ece

183,2020/02/16,Disaster authority issues advisory to public,"Avoid direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.; drink plenty of water

In view of the sharp rise in temperature over the past few days , the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued directions for the public to avoid direct sun light during the day hours.

As per it, P. K. Sudheer Babu, District Collector and chairman of DDMA, has advised the public to be vigilant about the situation and strictly abide by the directions of the disaster management authorities.

As per the directives, pregnant women, elderly people, children and people suffering from various diseases should avoid direct sunlight between 11a.m. to 3 p.m. It has also been advised to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. People should also make it a practice to carry drinking water with them in small bottles. Wearing loose, light-coloured cotton clothing will help combat the heat better.

“Since it is the time of exams, school authorities and parents should pay special care to their children. They should not be allowed to go outside between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Authorities should ensure sufficient supply of potable water in schools and proper air circulation in classrooms. Local body authorities and anganwadi workers should ensure that high temperature levels will not affect children,” said the Collector.

The Collector also directed employers to keep up with the revised time schedule for workers issued by the Labour Commissioner. Construction workers, roadside vendors, traffic police, media persons, MVD employees, farers, two-wheelers and all professions that require a person to come in contact with direct sunlight should take proper rest and stay hydrated at all times. The Collector has also sought the assistance of socio-cultural and youth wing organisations in providing water to them.

185,2020/02/16,"How community, money power derail reservation","‘Aided schools public-funded institutions’

Issues concerning social justice, representation of Dalits and Adivasis, and the government’s role in public-funded private institutions seem to have been pushed to a corner in the ongoing war of words over teachers’ appointment in aided schools.

Though the salary for teaching and non-teaching staff in aided schools and colleges is being paid from the exchequer, the government has only a limited role in the recruitment process, says the Aided Sector Samvarana Samara Samiti.

Violation

The writ of communities and other groups, who run these institutions, runs large here, money is changing hands, and Constitutional provisions on reservation are blatantly being violated, say samiti functionaries.

“As per the data available under a Right to Information Act petition, the total number of teaching and non-teaching staff in aided schools and colleges in Kerala is 1,44,413 in 2014-15. The representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is just 0.38% or 560 people,” O.P. Raveendran, an activist of the samiti, pointed out.

His book Pothuvidyabhyasa Rangathe Swakarya Colonykal (The Private Colonies in Public Education Sector) gives a detailed account of the history and growth of aided educational institutions in the State and how they are dominated by either members of the communities who run them or those who can pay for the posts.

PSC’s job

The original Section 11 of the Kerala Education Act, 1958, which governs the appointment of teachers in aided and government schools, had proposed that the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) be entrusted with the job of appointment.

Following the ‘liberation struggle’ against the first Communist government, however, that section was cancelled in 1960, giving the right to school managers.

The direct payment system to disburse salaries for aided college staff was introduced in 1972 by the Achutha Menon government, following a bitter feud between the management and the authorities. “With this, the government lost control over appointment in aided colleges and the management was given the right to fill 50% of vacant posts from the community it belongs to and the rest from open merit. This is a violation of the Section 20(1) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956, that directs implementation of reservation policies by institutions receiving government grant,” Mr. Raveendran said.

“The current Left Democratic Front government, however, claimed in an affidavit filed in the Kerala High Court that the recruitment by aided school and college managers was fool proof,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/how-community-money-power-derail-reservation/article30837073.ece
186,2020/02/16,Paddy farming to be part of wayside tourism,"Five locations identified for farming to attract tourists

People travelling along the busy Main Central Road in Kottayam will soon be greeted by the breathtaking sights of luscious green carpet of paddy saplings.

Success in cultivation

Buoyed by its success in restoring paddy cultivation in over 4,200 acres of land, the Meenachil - Meenanthara - Kodoor River re-linking collective is now turning its focus to the fallow lands on both sides of the MC Road.

To begin with, it has identified fallow polders at five key locations including those lying adjacent to the four -lane stretch at Kodimatha, for commencing the farming operations.

“This initiative also seeks to explore the possibility of using paddy cultivation as a tool for developing wayside tourism. The project takes its inspiration from the huge influx of visitors to the rural locations just to witness the green paddy fields,” said K. Anil Kumar, general convener of the re-linking programme.

Based on the response, the project will be expanded to other key stretches including the National Highway.

According to Mr.Anil, expanding cultivation to places having road frontage, reconstruction of bridges that prevent the natural flow of water and setting up bio-diversity parks on the river banks form the three key projects of the re-linking initiative in the current financial year.

Taking a lesson out of the back to back floods that hit Kottayam since 2018, a new initiative titled ‘Floodless Kottayam’ has been launched to ensure free flow water through streams and rivers. “As part of it, we have identified as many as 45 bridges or culverts that require a reconstruction and the works will be executed through the departments concerned,” he added.

Bio-diversity parks

Meanwhile, works are progressing on the first bio-diversity park to be established by the initiative, which is soon set for a formal launch. Named ‘Thanaloram,’ the park is being established on a 10-acre property on the river banks near Kidangoor.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/paddy-farming-to-be-part-of-wayside-tourism/article30837071.ece
187,2020/02/16,5 townships planned as part of Silver Line,"KRDCL to execute project on cost-sharing basis between State and railways

Five new townships are to be developed as part of the 531.45-km ambitious Semi-High-Speed Railway line (SHSR) from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod that will traverse 11 districts of the State, except Alappuzha, Idukki and Wayanad.

Thiruvanathapuram, Kollam, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Thrissur are the townships identified by the Kerala Railway Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL), the special purpose vehicle set up to execute ‘viable’ railway projects on cost-sharing basis between the Kerala government and Indian Railways.

The new townships will be near the Silver Line stations in the SHSR corridor and tenders had been floated to award the consultancy to take the project forward, official sources told The Hindu.

If the needed suitable land cannot be found close to the places identified for the Silver Line stations, the new townships will be developed in places where land is available.

In townships that have to be developed away from the Silver Line stations, connectivity will be provided by the KRDCL.

Green project

The authorities are considering even introducing electric vehicles as the Silver Line project is to be implemented as a Green project.

The KRDCL is of the view that planned urban development of the cities along the corridor and development of new cities down the SHSR line can derive benefits for the socio-economic development in the regions served by the Silver Line.

Last-mile connectivity with system-driven e-vehicle public transport system, multi-modal integration, charging and parking stations, which would take Kerala to the next generation of urban mobility, are some of the key features of the Silver Line.

Only 1,226.45 hectares would have to be acquired for the ambitious ₹56,443 crore SHSR corridor that will be away from the existing railway line in the 300-km Kochuveli-Shoranur section and parallel to the existing line from Thirunavaya to Kasaragod with railway bypasses at Vadakara and Thalaserry.

Railway land

The Railways have agreed to make available the unused land of 200 acres with them in the corridors where the SHSR runs parallel to the existing line.

The KRDCL can also look forward to the idle land with the railways for developing the townships.

The selected consultancy firm will be tasked to identify the land.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5-townships-planned-as-part-of-silver-line/article30837061.ece

190,2020/02/16,Kerala govt. approves programme to mentor schoolchildren,"Teachers to observe, study and assist in improving socio-linguistic, social and scientific aptitude

The State government has approved a programme to mentor students to harmonise their social and emotional skills along with academic competencies.

The programme, Sahitham, was drawn up on the directions of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at a review meeting of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission.

“The school-level master plan will be enhanced to a more academic, student-centric and individual one that is to be realised through the Sahitham programme,” Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath said.

Mentor teacher

As part of Sahitham, a mentor teacher will closely observe, study, and record online the academic improvement of each student along with their socio-linguistic skills, social awareness, scientific aptitude, and so on.

In addition, the teacher will plan corrective learning activities by understanding the learning difficulties of students by observing their social background.

Teachers will be provided with psychological training as part of the programme.

KITE (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education), which has developed the Sahitham portal, will manage it with the academic support of the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT). “The Sahitham portal will act as the backbone of the programme and will have facilities for guiding even parents on their children’s capabilities, strengths, and areas where further interventions are required by effectively utilising the scope of artificial intelligence, data analytics and so on,” K. Anvar Sadath, Chief Executive Officer, KITE, said.

191,2020/02/16,People urged to be cautious against rising temperatures,"District Medical Officer (Health) K. Narayana Nayak has asked the public to be cautious in the wake of a warning by the Weather Department that daytime temperatures will rise in the district.

“Drink two to four glasses of water every hour even if you don’t feel thirsty,” said a press release by the DMO. Those who sweat more should drink salted lemon juice or salted lemon water. Only boiling water should be used.

Those who work outdoors should take rest from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

“Its better to wear thin white or lightweight loose clothing. People can use an umbrella or a hat while stepping out and do not allow children to play under the sun.” Children should not be left alone in the car.

193,2020/02/16,"Driving tests, vehicle checking to go digital","Kannur and Kasaragod districts to have computerised driver testing tracks

With the introduction of Computerised Driver Testing Track (CDTT) and Computerised Vehicle Testing Station (CVTS) by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), driving tests and vehicle checking will go digital in two centres in Kannur and Kasaragod districts.

UL Technology Solutions (ULTS), a subsidiary of Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), has set up fully computerised centres at Kanjirangad near Taliparamba in Kannur and Bela in Kasaragod.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran inaugurated the centres recently.

At a CDTT, instead of an individual invigilator, all procecess, right from registration, will be done using cameras and computers. Opposite to the track, there is a two-storey office of the MVD. On the first floor of the office, computers have been set up to display the movements of vehicles.

Token system and queue management will reduce the time taken for test procedures, which in turn, will help conduct more tests. Currently, one official handles 60 tests. Once the system is in place, it will not need a human presence, and nearly 200 tests can be held. The fully automated system also reduces the chances for errors.

At CVTS, a hi-tech 45-m long centre can check three-wheelers, four-wheelers and heavy vehicles together. The first lane is exclusively for heavy vehicles and the next lane is for three and four-wheelers.

The driver will be allotted time through online registration.

The registration desk at the office will display complete data of a vehicle, and allot it time for testing. Vehicle tests using CVTS can be completed in three minutes while it is done in fully automatic mode.

The semi-automatic mode will take five minutes. On an average, 25 to 30 LMVs can be tested in an hour, whereas 15 to 20 heavy vehicles can be tested in the same duration. Once the testing is over, fitness certificates will be provided to vehicles.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/driving-tests-vehicle-checking-to-go-digital/article30836720.ece
194,2020/02/16,WWS proposal fails to find favour,"Board rejects it after public protest

The Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS), though home to more than half the number of tigers present in Kerala, may not be notified as a tiger reserve as the proposal lacks public support.

The attempts of the Kerala Forest Department to push forward the proposal for notifying the sanctuary as the third tiger reserve in the State came a cropper at the recently held State Wildlife Advisory Board. Citing the public resistance against the earlier attempts, the board rejected the proposal.

The ‘Status of Tigers in India’ report released last year had estimated the tiger population of Wayanad as between 75 and 80 individuals. Periyar Tiger Reserve, the first one in Kerala, has an estimated population of 30 to 35 big cats, whereas Parambikulam, the second reserve, has a population of 20 to 25 tigers.

Piloting the Wayanad proposal, the department officials pointed out that more than half of the tiger population in the State was found in Wayanad. There were five tiger reserves in the neighbouring States that share boundaries with Wayanad, they said.

The arguments of the officials that the notification would ensure financial aid from the Centre and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), better conservation and management of the tiger population and help generate more employment opportunities failed to impress the State authorities.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who chaired the meeting, flagged the issue of human-wildlife conflicts in the district. Referring to the public protests that were staged in Wayanad earlier against the proposal, Mr. Vijayan expressed concern over the possible impact of the proposal. Any such proposal should be implemented only after holding wide public consultations, he said.

Cattle lifting by the ailing tigers and their straying into human habitations had often triggered widespread public protests in the district. The department had to backtrack from its earlier attempts to notify the reserve following stiff public resistance. There were speculations that the notification would bring in stringent restrictions on development activities in the district, though the department tried to counter the campaign.

C.K. Saseendran, the legislator representing the Kalpetta Assembly constituency, highlighted the public resistance against the proposal and suggested that the proposal should be taken forward only after dispelling the public concern.

Each year, the NTCA supports the tiger reserves by funding the proposals put forward through its Annual Plan of Operations. The authority also supports the reserves for implementing the tiger conservation plan.

While Periyar gets an annual support of around ₹9 crore, the Parambikulam gets around ₹6 crore from the authority.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wws-proposal-fails-to-find-favour/article30836415.ece
195,2020/02/16,K-RERA to speed up registration of projects,"Applicants told to rectify errors within seven days

The Kerala Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-RERA) has issued an ultimatum to builders to rectify anomalies in their applications for the registration of real estate projects within seven days of being asked to do so.

The authority was forced to issue an order in this regard after several applicants sat on communications in this regard, a behaviour that could derail the entire registration process. As per a K-RERA decision taken in January this year, all ongoing real estate projects in the State have to be mandatorily registered by March 31.

“We fear that a delay in submitting the clarifications sought by us will result in a last-minute rush which we will not be able to handle. While some of the applications are properly filled in, there are several which are sloppily done and lack the required information,” an official of the real estate watchdog said.

According to the February 13 order, the builders are required to rectify defects in their applications and furnish clarifications sought by the authority within seven days. Failure to comply would attract action under the relevant provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, the authority said.

Under the Act, all real estate projects and real estate agents should be registered with the State-level RERA concerned. Designed to protect consumer interests in the sector, the Kerala RERA was formally inaugurated on January 1 this year.

Despite active measures taken by K-RERA to speed up the registration, only seven real estate projects and 24 agents have been successfully listed so far. Although the authority has received nearly 50 applications, the low number of actual registrations is largely on account of insufficient and incorrect information furnished by the applications.

Earlier this month, K-RERA chairman P.H. Kurian had issued orders warning builders against including false information in their applications. To help the builders, the authority had also issued check-lists of the documents required for getting their projects registered.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/k-rera-to-speed-up-registration-of-projects/article30836162.ece
196,2020/02/16,Cong. to use CAG report as a weapon against LDF,"Anti-Centre protests against LPG hike, CAA on the cards

The Congress appears primed to weaponise the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report on anomalies in the utilisation of police modernisation funds against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government.

The report had focussed public attention on the ""fraudulent misuse"" of Central funds to acquire luxury vehicles and villas for ranking officers at the cost of overhauling the ageing fleet of station house vehicles and quarters for rank and file personnel.

The Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the KPCC will meet here on Tuesday to chart the next course of action.

It might decide on seeking legal recourse to initiate a CBI inquiry into the CAG's ""worrying"" conclusion that the police had failed to account for 25 assault rifles and 12,061 rounds of ammunition.

Simultaneously, the party will campaign to draw public attention to the ""wrongdoings"" of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his ""coterie"" of advisors. The Congress has also demanded an anti-corruption inquiry against Keltron.

It suspects that the government had used the public entity as a front to bestow lucrative police modernisation contracts to ""paper companies"" with alleged links to the CPI(M) leadership.

The Congress is pointedly focussed on Keltron's ""questionable"" contracting of a private firm with ""scant expertise"" to implement the Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS).

The party also seems compelled to factor in the fallout of high-profile anti-corruption inquiries and solar scam-related criminal cases initiated by the Pinarayi government against an array of top Congress leaders.

It has to complete its reorganisation, muster cadres to prepare for the upcoming local body elections and attempt to galvanise public opinion against the Central government for the recent hike in LPG prices.

The Congress could ill afford to cede the initiative in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) agitation against the Centre to the CPI(M). It is increasingly wary of the efforts by the CPI(M) to use the anti-CAA platform to woo Muslim and Christian communities to the LDF fold.

The Congress looks particularly concerned about the CPI(M)'s overtures towards the IUML and wants to prevent its traditional strongholds from falling to the LDF in the tumult of the anti-CAA agitation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cong-to-use-cag-report-as-a-weapon-against-ldf/article30836063.ece
197,2020/02/16,Bihari migrant woman emerges topper in Malayalam literacy exam,"Romiya Kathur, hailing from a nondescript village in Bihar, scored the first rank with full 100 marks in the examination held by the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority recently.

A 26-year-old Bihari woman has proved language is no barrier as she emerged the topper in a literacy examination conducted in Kerala for migrant labourers.

Romiya Kathur, hailing from a nondescript village in Bihar, scored the first rank with full 100 marks in the examination held by the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority recently.

She had reached Kerala in search of a job along with her husband Saifullah and settled down in Umayanalloor in southern Kollam district in 2014.

The mother of three, who runs a juice parlour here, had written the exam at a local higher secondary school carrying her four-month-old baby daughter, Thamanna last month.

A total of 1,998 migrant labourers had appeared for the literacy exam in the second phase of the scheme “Changathi” across the state on January 19.

Changathi (Friend) project is aimed at teaching migrant labourers, living in the state, Malayalam within four months.

It had begun in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district, the hub of migrant labourers in the state on August 15, 2017, Literacy Mission officials said.

Over 3,700 migrants, who flocked to the southern state in search of better wages and living conditions, had cleared the exam under the initiative so far in two phases, they said.

Mission director P S Sreekala visited Kathur at her home here recently and congratulated her for the rare achievement.

The migrant woman said she wanted to clear the higher secondary equivalency exam conducted by the Mission, for which the directed extended complete support.

She also said “Hamari Malayalam”, the textbook prepared for students of the Changathi scheme, was very helpful in the daily life.

“It has helped me a lot in communicating in Malayalam, life especially in railway station and market,” she said, adding she also wanted to teach her children Malayalam.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/th2t4x/article30839546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DIRECTOR-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bihari-migrant-woman-emerges-topper-in-malayalam-literacy-exam/article30834509.ece

199,2020/02/16,One Health concept gains importance,"Expert says programme can reduce incidence of zoonotic threats

The concept of ‘One Health’, which recognises that health of human beings is connected to health of animals and environment, is gaining importance as most of the contagious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic (animal to man origin) in nature.

“The concept of One Health can be effectively implemented for reducing incidence of emerging zoonotic threats like COVID-19. One Health is the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environment, as defined by the One Health Initiative Task Force,” says Dr. B. Sunil, Professor, Veterinary Public Health & Head, meat plant, Kerala veterinary and animal sciences university.

Of the contagious diseases affecting humans, more than 65% are of zoonotic or animal to man origin. While investigating the etiology of diseases strategic approach, incorporating scientists from multidisciplinary sources will yield confirmatory results, he noted.

Accepted model

One Health model is a globally accepted model for research on epidemiology, diagnosis and control of zoonotic diseases, says Dr. T.P. Sethumadhavan, former Director of entrepreneurship, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU).

One Health model facilitates interdisciplinary approach in disease control so as to control emerging and existing zoonotic threats. Current outbreak of COVID-19 still could not find out the actual source of virus. Even though genomics of the virus has been published ambiguity still exists whether it was from bats, snakes, pangolin, etc.

“One Health model will strategically address all these issues and will facilitate to get detailed updates. The WHO is very effectively addressing emerging issues of antimicrobial resistance through One Health research. All the developing countries are in the process of promoting One Health research for developing a sustainable disease control system. They are using health analytics and data management tools for accurate results,” Dr. Sethumadhavan said. The KVASU has launched One Health centre to address the emerging zoonotic threats ike avian influenza, swine flu, monkey fever, coronavirus infection, etc.

“Need of the hour is to scale up such a model across the country and to establish meaningful research collaborations across the world. Asean and trans Pacific countries giving more thrust to this sector. BBSRC( Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Foundation), UK, Future farming based at Australia and Melinda and Gates Foundation are giving potential funding support to One Health model,” Dr. Sethumadhavan, who is also consultant to World Bank on Sustainable development, said.

Task force

Medical, veterinary, paramedical sectors and bioscience researchers need to form a task force to address the issues rather than blaming each other.

Health, veterinary, agriculture and life science research institutions and universities can play a lead role. Further delay may pave way for emergence of new communicable diseases, he pointed out.

“We should expect and be prepared to face more and more such infections in the coming days considering the climate change and environmental degradation,” said Member of Kerala State Planning Board and Public Health activist Dr. B. Ekbal.

Increasing stress on animals due to loss of their habitat would increase scope of zoonotic diseases, he noted.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sogwi8/article30832865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvOneHealth-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/one-health-concept-gains-importance/article30832842.ece

201,2020/02/16,Factionalism in KC(Jacob),"Anoop Jacob convenes meet without Johny Nellore’s nod

Even as the Kerala Congress (M) appears to be heading for a split, factionalism seems to have reared its head in one more constituent party of the United Democratic Front, presenting more headaches to the coalition.

Raising the spectre of an infighting in his party, Kerala Congress (Jacob) leader Anoop Jacob, MLA, here on Saturday convened a meeting of the party’s high power committee and turned down a proposal to merge his outfit with the KC(M) faction led by P.J. Joseph.

The latest move comes even as KC(Jacob) chairman Johny Nellore is slated to convene a meeting of the party’s high-power committee on February 21 in Kottayam to discuss the merger proposal.

“The decisions taken at the previous State committee meeting, which include strengthening the party base and dropping the merger plan, were discussed threadbare during the meeting. We have resolved to equip the party to face the upcoming local body elections. Reports regarding a split in the party are baseless. We will not resort to any move that will destabilise the UDF,” Mr. Jacob told reporters after the meeting.

According to him, 42 out of the 70 high-power committee members that include 10 district presidents, 11 out of 16 State functionaries and one out of three vice chairpersons of the party attended the meeting on Saturday.

Meanwhile, the meeting also decided to hold a State committee meeting of the party on February 21, the same day Mr. Nellore is slated to convene the high-power committee meet.

Merger plans

Terming the meeting on Saturday as a mere factional event, Mr. Nellore held that the party chairman was the lone authority to convene the high-power committee meet.

The party chairman, office-charge general secretary, party vice chairpersons and majority of the leaders were not intimated about any such meeting, he said.

According to him, the party would go ahead with the merger plans after receiving approval from the high- power committee meeting.

202,2020/02/16,Adult diphtheria case reported at MCH,"Patient is a migrant labourer working in Tamil Nadu

A case of adult diphtheria has been reported in the district, the patient being a migrant labourer working in Marthandam in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.

The 20-year-old patient, a native of Assam, came to the ENT casualty at the Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, on February 11 complaining of sore throat and difficulty in swallowing food.

He was immediately hospitalised as all clinical signs pointed to diphtheria. His illness was also severe. Throat swab samples later confirmed the diagnosis. He has been kept in isolation as diphtheria is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets.

He is at present being treated with antibiotics as well as diphtheria antitoxin at the hospital.

Disease complications

The spectrum of disease complications is quite wide, and the patient can develop myocarditis and neurological issues.

In this instance, the patient had developed palatal palsy by the time he sought treatment at the Medical College Hospital.

However, he is recovering well, sources said.

The district health administration said the case had been reported to Tamil Nadu as the patient resided at a labour camp at Marthandam.

Meanwhile, doctors at the MCH said they were having a tough time trying to make the patient understand that he was contagious and had to remain in isolation.

203,2020/02/16,Illicit wealth case against V.S. Sivakumar,"Bid to divert attention from CAG findings, says Chennithala

The State government on Friday ordered the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) to investigate former Health Minister and Congress legislator V.S. Sivakumar on the charge of “illicitly enriching himself” during his period in the office between 2011-16.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala cried foul and accused the government of having launched a political witch-hunt to divert public attention from the high-level Police Department corruption flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.

Mr. Sivakumar is now the third Minister in the Oommen Chandy government to face an anti-corruption inquiry under the current disposition.

The VACB had earlier chargesheeted former Excise Minister K. Babu in an amassment of wealth case.

On Saturday, the agency questioned former PWD Minister and Indian Union Muslim League legislator V.K. Ebrahim Kunju for three hours on the charge of financially favouring the firm responsible for the shoddy construction of the now decommissioned flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan had earlier allowed the government to prosecute Mr. Sivakumar.

Mr. Chennithala appeared piqued by the decision and indicated Mr. Khan was partial to the Left Democratic Front government. He said his requests seeking sanction to investigate four LDF Ministers for corruption was pending decision at Raj Bhavan inexplicably.

Sivakumar’s stance

Mr. Sivakumar said the LDF had resurrected a case written off by the VACB in 2014 to besmirch him.

The VACB reopened the inquiry against Mr. Sivakumar in 2016 after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan hand-picked Jacob Thomas to head the agency. It “found” that Mr. Sivakumar had stashed away the “illegitimate wealth” in the name of his nominees, including his staff. It had reportedly collected 105 documents and recorded the statement of over 100 witnesses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/illicit-wealth-case-against-vs-sivakumar/article30832781.ece
204,2020/02/16,COVID-19: medical student to be discharged,"The Health Department has decided to discharge the medical student who had earlier returned from Wuhan and been isolated at the Kanhangad District Hospital in Kasaragod after he tested positive for COVID-19.

The student in Kasaragod, who tested positive for the virus, was the third case of COVID-19 that Kerala had announced on February 3.

An official bulletin said that he was being discharged as his subsequent blood samples had returned as negative for the disease. He will however remain on home quarantine till the stipulated period.

The student at Alapuzha had been discharged earlier. Now, only the girl at Thrissur remains to be discharged.

For a person tested COVID-19-positive to be discharged, the criteria is that two blood samples taken 24 hours apart should both test negative.

Also, the chest x-ray should be clear.

As per the revised criteria, the Health Department on Saturday ended the home quarantine of 111 persons and allowed them to be free. As on Saturday, the number of those under surveillance is 2,210.

Among these, only 16 are admitted in isolation wards in hospitals, while 2,194 are quarantined at home, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-medical-student-to-be-discharged/article30832662.ece
205,2020/02/16,Man vs. Wild: The battle for survival on Kerala's forest fringes,"The ‘culprits’ are not just marauding elephants or leopards. Even tiny birds and butterflies do their bit in wreaking havoc.

The battle for survival is turning bitter in the forest fringes of Kerala as humans and animals are increasingly jostling for space and resources.

The number of lives lost in five years, between 2015 and 2019, in human-wild animal conflicts is 514, which is almost equal to the loss suffered in the decade from 2006 to 2015 (523). Curiously, snakebites outside forest areas accounted for most of the deaths. The five-year figure was compiled by the Kerala Forest Department, whereas the decadal data was generated by the Department of Wildlife Science of the Kerala Agriculture University, Thrissur.

It is not just the elephants, tigers, leopards, snakes, monkeys, deer and wild pigs that are giving sleepless nights to those living and farming in the forest fringes. Birds and even butterflies are engaged in a pitched battle with humans, though at a lesser degree.

Bleeding exchequer

Data with the State Forest Department and researchers confirm the worst fear. Conflicts involving wild animals in human habitats in and around reserve forests, wildlife sanctuaries, and national parks are on the rise. Besides snuffing out lives, the marauding wild animals often leave a trail of destruction, leaving the exchequer poorer as governments have to shell out compensation of a few crores annually.

Also read: Peacock threat peaks in Palakkad

For every life lost in conflict with wild animals, the State provides a compensation of ₹10 lakh as prescribed in the Kerala Rules for Payment of Compensation to Victims of Attacks by Wild Animals.

The compensation for a death due to snakebite outside forests and the permanent disability caused by wildlife attacks is fixed at ₹2 lakh. The maximum compensation for the loss of crops and cattle is ₹1 lakh each.

Wild elephants and wild pigs contribute to nearly 70% of the conflicts followed by bonnet macaques and snakes. The government decision to provide compensation for snakebite victims might have resulted in increased reporting of the deaths, said P.O. Nameer, Professor, Department of Wildlife Science of the Kerala Agriculture University, Thrissur.

Wild dogs too

Deer, leopard, tiger, guar, porcupine and wild dogs too cross the paths with human beings. South and North Wayanad Forest Divisions, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Kannur, Kasaragod, Mannarkad and Thrissur Forest Divisions were found to be the most hit areas, he said.

While the farmers of Palakkad and Chulannoor complain about the peahens that fly into paddy fields destroying the crop, monkeys and elephants bother farmers of Wayanad. Crop raids by wild pigs have been reported from across the State.

The attempts of the State government to permit the killing of crop-raiding wild pigs by relaxing norms for gunning them down have triggered an animated discussion in the State. Wildlife enthusiasts fear that the relaxation of the norms could lead to hunting of other animals too.

Porcupines and wild pigs are causing widespread damage to agriculture across the State, pointed out E.A. Jaison, former scientist of the Kerala Forest Research Institute, Thrissur. Detailed studies on crop loss caused by these animals were held in Nilambur and Thrissur. The two were found feeding on fallen coconuts in the most affected areas, he said.

Butterfly impact

Sun birds and flowerpeckers, the two commonly found birds in Kerala, play a crucial role in spreading semi-parasitic plant Loranthus, thereby reducing the yield of fruit trees like mangoes, said R. Sugathan, ornithologist.

While the crop loss caused by bigger animals easily gets noticed, the damage wreaked by birds, which may weigh a few grams, is mostly ignored. The birds, while helping the pollination of useful plants and trees, also aid in the propagation of semi-parasite plants, he said. There are also instances of larvae of butterflies from butterfly gardens feeding on plants leading to loss to farmers.

Hornbills and myristica

Grey hornbills have a special liking for myristica fruits which help them produce hormones essential for reproduction. “Myristica farmers need to be compensated for the loss caused by hornbills. Of the 62 bird species found associated with agriculture in the State, as many as 17 have a negative influence on farming,” says Dr. Sugathan.

Wildlife experts have flagged the fragmentation of habitats, cultivation of crops that attract wild animals, and dumping of waste on forest fringes as the key factors that contribute to the increased instances of human-wildlife conflicts. The changes in the land use patterns, reduction of forest areas and the increased farming of paddy, banana, coconut and areacanut in the fringe areas are responsible for the increasing incidents, said Dr. Nameer.

Surendrakumar, the Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, said the department has been constructing elephant-proof trenches, setting up crash guard and stone-pitched fencings and drawing power fences to restrict the movement of wild elephants to human habitations. Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to push the marauding animals back to the forest, he said.

The tracking of movement of regular crop-raiding elephants by radio-collaring them and alerting people about their movements, relocation of cattle-lifting tigers and creation of awareness to avoid farming practices that attract wildlife and relocation of families from settlements located inside the forest area are also being undertaken, Mr. Surendrakumar said.

People need to develop a mindset to share space with animals. The outlook that animals shall restrict themselves to the forest and will not enter the nearby human habitations need to undergo a change.

The coexistence of humans and animals can address the issues to a large extend, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hzi2gb/article30834477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVPEACOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/man-vs-wild-on-forest-fringes/article30832383.ece
206,2020/02/16,Peacock threat peaks in Palakkad,"A fall in jackal population has contributed to a spike in the bird’s numbers

Peacock population have increased menacingly across the district, posing a serious threat to the farmers engaged in paddy and other grain and pulse cultivation. According to farmers, the increase has been palpable over the last 10 years.

Gone are the days when peacocks used to be found rarely in village farmlands. Now, they are no longer confined to bushes in the forest fringes areas. Their population is spread across Palakkad district.

All farmlands in Palakkad, especially those focussing on organic or natural farming, are facing threat from the birds. Environmentalists say the rise in peacock population is directly related to the reduction in the number of jackals in villages.

Jackal population has plummeted after they lost their dens in the wide clearing of vegetation as part of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.

Jackals used to eat the eggs laid by peahens, and thus were instrumental in controlling the peacock population. Experts suggest that the decrease in the population of one species will have some form of ecological impact. As peacocks are omnivorous, they easily survive by feeding on grains, insects and small reptiles and mammals.

In groups too

Peacocks attack farmlands sometimes in ostentation. “Unlike animals, it is not easy to drive them away. When we go near them, they fly to treetops, and come back as they please,” said S. Guruvayurappan, an organic farmer and Paristhithi Aikyavedi leader from Thattamangalam.

Farmers are weary of approaching the government seeking compensation for the crop damage caused by peacocks. They cite delay and red-tapism. Seldom do they get compensation for the actual loss. “The government should compensate the farmers for the actual loss caused by wild animals,” said Mr. Guruvayurappan.

Traps and poison

Although forest officials insist that peacocks enjoy protected status in the country, farmers sometimes kill them by setting traps and poisoning. Out of desperation, some farmers in the district have erected banners warning the Forest Department that they have set poison traps in their farmland.

Forest officials are forced to turn a blind eye to some of the excesses. They agree that controlling a bird like peacock is difficult. Maintaining ecological balance is essential in the management of any wild species, they say.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/k1lgj5/article30832370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVPEACOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/peacock-threat-peaks-in-palakkad/article30832371.ece
207,2020/02/16,"In Wayanad, monkeys hold sway","The last proposal was to relocate them to islets in Banasurasagar

The increasing population of monkeys is a major concern in the urban areas of Wayanad district. They invade houses and destroy crops, complain harried residents. “We cannot grow any plants on the premises. As soon as they sprout, the monkeys would destroy them,” A. George, a resident of Kalpetta municipality says, adding that the simian population has increased manifold in a few years.

Often the intruders come in through ventilators or by breaking tiled roofs. They destroy utensils, tear up clothes hung on clothlines, destroy beds and pillows, and flee with food from kitchen shelves. The situation is not different in other parts of the district, including Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery municipalities.

The Forest Department had prepared a project in 2013 to sterilise the primate population in the municipal area with the assistance of veterinary experts from the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) and the Kalpetta municipality. But, the project did not take off owing to alleged laxity on the part of the municipal authorities and the Forest Department.

KFD threat

The department had planned to set up traps in 12 sites. The municipality had earmarked ₹5 lakh for the purpose and the department had set up a laboratory at a cost of ₹7 lakh at Lakkidi. Delay in fund allocation and shortage of workers to trap monkeys after the outbreak of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD or Monkey Fever) in the district affected the project.

Later, the District Animal Husbandry Department took up the project, but it was a futile attempt owing to lack of technical staff and power connection to the laboratory.

Proposal shot down

Finally the Forest Department submitted a report to the Chief Wildlife Warden a few months ago to sterilise the primates and relocate them to the small islets formed inside the Banasurasagar reservoir under the department. But the proposal was rejected on the ground that the reservoir was also major a source of drinking water schemes for many grama panchayats in the district. Zoonotic diseases like the KFD that might break out among the simian population would harm the public. Now the Forest Department is trying to find out another location for the operation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/aygwrb/article30832295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvwymonkeys,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/in-wayanad-monkeys-hold-sway/article30832297.ece
208,2020/02/16,Fragmented forests leave jumbos jittery,"A colony built in Chinnakanal blocked the animals’ migratory path

Within a decade, 30 lives were lost and swathes of standing crops were destroyed in attacks by crop-raiding elephants in Munnar, where the largest number of man-animal conflicts were reported in Idukki. Fragmentation of forestland is the prime reason cited for the elephants straying into farmlands.

A herd of 28 wild elephants are stranded at Anayirangal dam area for years, surrounded by cardamom plantations and buildings, which block their traditional migratory path to the water source. Due to the steepness of the terrain to Mathikettan shola, the wild elephants often encroach into farmlands.

Most affected

The largest human casualty in wild elephant attack was reported in Chinnakanal after the creation of the No. 301 Colony for rehabilitating tribespeople. Within five years, 11 persons were killed there. It was alleged that the colony was created blocking the migratory path of wild elephants. Of the 110 families resettled, only 34 families live there now. The rest have abandoned the site fearing wildlife attacks.

When the proposal for creating the No. 301 Colony was made, the Forest Department had given a report to the government that the area was on the migratory path of the wild elephants. However, it was overlooked, creating a space for continued man-animal conflict there.

The human habitations that constantly come under elephant attack in Idukki are Chinnakanal, Santhanpara, Rajakkad, Marayur, Mankulam and Anayirangal dam in Munnar, in addition to Neryamangalam and Kothamangalam.

Martin Lowel, Assistant Forest Conservator, Munnar Forest Division told The Hindu that fragmentation of forest areas resulted in wild elephants getting stranded and being violent, due to stress. It was with the aim of relocating them that the first elephant sanctuary in the State was proposed in the Chinnakanal-Anayirangal area.

Lack of fodder or water may not be the only reason for wild animals coming out of the forest areas. When a migratory route is broken, the stranded wild elephants stay there and if they find a farmland there, destroy it for no reason. A herd of seven wild elephants recently strayed into the tea plantation of Kanan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) Ltd. for over a week and caused widespread damage.

Two more projects

When a dam is constructed, the forestland is fragmented at times, affecting the migratory path. The two major development works that may cause further fragmentation are the Thottiyar dam near Valara and the expressway of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway. The Forest Department has written to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) that a separate zone be identified and created for the movement of wild elephants as the heavy traffic would negatively affect them.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ky33q4/article30832277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fragmented-forests-leave-jumbos-jittery/article30832279.ece

210,2020/02/16,Seven arrested for beating Dalit youth to death in TN's Villupuram,"The 22-year-old was beaten to death near Periyathatchur in Villupuram District.

The police on Friday arrested seven people, including three women, for allegedly beating to death a Dalit youth near Periyathatchur in Villupuram District.

The Periyathatchur police identified the victim as R. Sakthivel, 22, a resident of Karai Village. The case was registered based on a complaint filed by R. Theivannai, the deceased’s sister.

Ms. Theivannai in her complaint alleged that on February 12 she received a call from Sakthivel complaining that he was being assaulted by a group near Boothurmalai.

When she reached the spot , a group led by K. Raja, a resident of the locality, along with his wife R. Gowri were found assaulting her brother.

The Periyathatchur police reached the spot and rescued him. He was taken home on a two-wheeler but after a while the youth fainted. A medical team was called and after examining Sakthivel, declared him dead.

211,2020/02/16,New cockroach species named after Kalakkad,"It is said to be endemic to Western Ghats and is nocturnal

A new cockroach species has been discovered by scientists of the Southern Regional Centre, Zoological Survey of India, at the Western Ghats, a region with high species richness, and high percent endemicity.

“Since it was discovered during a field survey in Kalakkad-Mudanthurai, we have named it as Allacta Kalakkadensis,” said S. Prabakaran, who along with M. Senraj and Cristian C. Lucanas, found the insect at Valiyathu Odai in Thriukurungudi range.

Although the species is believed to be endemic to Western Ghats and is nocturnal, Mr. Prabakaran said subsequently they were found in the Eastern Ghats.

“We found them in the bark of a tamarind tree and a litter of leaves. We cross-checked our finding with scientists across the world by publishing on the web and confirmed that it is a new species,” said Mr. Prabakaran. The finding was published in Halteres, an international peer-reviewed journal dedicated to entomology.

The Kalakkadenis differs from others by sexual wing dimorphism, pronotal and facial markings, and the structure of male genitalia.

India is home to 182 cockroach species and 55 of them are in Tamil Nadu. The new finding has increased the figure to 56.

Fr. Maria Packiam, Director, Entomological Research Institute, Loyola College, who was part of the survey, said the morphological features such as legs, antenna, mouth, stomach and body colours and analysis of external reproductive organs helped the team to differentiate the new species from others.

Mr. Prabakaran said, “Due to the distinct pattern difference between the male and female, it may be possible that they are two separate species, despite that they are considered the same on the premise that both were collected from the same tree.” He said additional samples would enable to check the colour variations between sexes and additional molecular information might be needed to clarify this.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qdc83d/article30834123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/New-Species,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/new-cockroach-species-named-after-kalakkad/article30834124.ece
212,2020/02/16,Tamil Nadu achieves drop in maternal mortality,"MMR dips to 57 from 63 in 2015-17

Tamil Nadu’s Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) has dipped to 57 per one lakh live births in 2019 according to the State Health Management Information System (HMIS) data.

This reduction figured in the budget presentation of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Friday. He said MMR has reduced from 90 per one lakh live births in 2010-2012 to 63 in 2015-2017 and further to 57 in 2019 as per data maintained by the State government.

As per HMIS data, the State’s MMR stood at 60 per one lakh live births in 2018. The latest Sample Registration System (SRS) data on MMR for the period 2015-2017 placed TN’s MMR at 63 per one lakh live births, officials said.

“HMIS reflects real-time data that we provide to the Government of India. This decline to 57 per one lakh live births is a good sign and is proof that maternal care has improved in the State. A single intervention alone has not brought about this decline. But a number of efforts starting with the health of adolescent girls to ante natal and post natal care of mothers including high risk women has led to this further reduction. We provide nutritional kits for pregnant women, and have ambulances/dedicated vehicle facility to pick up high risk mothers and bring them to the CEmONC (Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care) centres,” said K. Senthil Raj, mission director, National Health Mission-Tamil Nadu.

The drop is the outcome of multiple factors, K. Kolandaswamy, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, noted. Well-functioning CEmONC centres, direct appointment of specialists, improvement in infrastructure, protocol-based management and full strength of village health nurses and ICDS staff are among the many factors, he said.

“We have achieved reduction in higher order births, while every pregnancy is being monitored through the Pregnancy and Infant Cohort Monitoring and Evaluation system. We have birth waiting rooms in remote areas to enable pregnant women to get admitted at least 10 days before delivery,” he pointed out.

Consistent monitoring

Monitoring of high risk mothers has been one of the focus areas of the authorities.

“We are ensuring timely admission of high risk pregnant women. This includes women who are anaemic, those with cardiac ailments, pregnancy-induced hypertension, bad obstetric history, previous caesarean section and elderly primi. We are identifying such women at the time of ante natal registration,” Dr. Senthil Raj said.

Obstetricians and gynaecologists were appointed as mentors in districts, he said.

“Every month, the block medical officer and primary health centre’s medical officer meet the OG and discuss the high risk cases. In fact, village health nurses keep in touch with the OG in CEmONC centres via WhatsApp,” he added.

Experts said the Tamil Nadu Pregnancy and Heart Disease Registry started a few months ago, would help in recording heart diseases among pregnant women.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-achieves-drop-in-maternal-mortality/article30832940.ece

The protest against the Citizen (Amendment) Act in Old Washermanpet that began on Friday and escalated into violence late at night had its echoes on Saturday too, with people from various parts of the State demonstrating against “police high-handedness”.

On Saturday, cadre of Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath (TNTJ) took out a procession towards the Washermanpet police station. But they were stopped before reaching the place.

Agitations were also organised in Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchi, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Villupuram, Vellore, Salem, and Ramanathapuram districts.

In Tiruchi, members of Muslim outfits held a demonstration at Palakkarai. They blamed the AIADMK for supporting the CAA in Parliament. Several shops and business establishments run by Muslims in the city remained closed.

In Thoothukudi, members of the Thowheed Jamaath staged a protest in front of South Police Station.

In Ramanathapuram district, the members assembled in front of the Pallivasal and demanded a judicial inquiry into the lathicharge. A large posse of police personnel were deployed as a precautionary measure.

In Tiruppur, hundreds of members from TNTJ staged a protest outside the District Collectorate.

According to the police, nearly 600 protesters, including 300 women, gathered on Palladam Road.

Tamil Nadu Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Saturday led a delegation to New Delhi and handed over Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s letter to Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar and Dharmendra Pradhan urging the Centre not to sanction any project without State government’s consent in the Cauvery delta region.

Mr. Palaniswami, who announced that the Cauvery delta regions would made be a “Protected Agricultural Zone” a few days ago, said, “The Government of India should drop any future plans for the exploration as well as mining of hydrocarbons in the ecologically sensitive agricultural Cauvery delta region. It should be excluded from any exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons in future,” the letter said.

The Chief Minister said that apart from the proposed coal-based methane projects occupying 4,266 acres of cultivable land and pumping out of 1,00,000 kilo litres of groundwater daily for the next 25 years, they could pose danger to cultural heritage sites such as Brahadeeswarar Temple, Navagraha temples, Velankanni church and the Nagore Dargah.

215,2020/02/16,"Palaniswami tightens grip over party, govt.","Industry impressed with the ‘business-like’ approach of CM

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who entered office three years ago amid scepticism about his ability to stay in power, appears to have surprised his party colleagues and sections of society alike by gaining a grip over the party and the government in the last three years.

An industrialist, on condition of anonymity, said the Chief Minister’s “business-like style” of functioning had impressed many in the industry and earned him the “image of a doer.”

J.C.D. Prabakar, AIADMK’s organising secretary, said initially many had expressed reservations about who would continue the legacy of Jayalalithaa. “But he has shown that it is doable,” he said.

Legal battles

He pointed out that the government had won several legal battles, the latest being a case in the Supreme Court on the disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs, including Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. He did not foresee any challenge to Mr. Palaniswami’s leadership on the political front as he appeared set for a smooth sailing till the end of his term. Assembly elections are due in April or May in 2021.

Despite the observation of the AIADMK’s veteran, sections within the ruling party seem to be feeling uncomfortable over the controversy surrounding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). This was why the party’s minorities wing, at a meeting a few days ago, adopted a resolution urging the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister to exert pressure on the Centre to assuage the fears of minorities.

‘Mood against govt.’

216,2020/02/16,"HC asks State, Centre not to deport Sri Lankan woman","The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has restrained the Centre and the State from deporting a woman to Sri Lanka.

The woman, married to an Indian, was apprehensive that she would be deported while her application for Indian citizenship was pending.

Justice S.S. Sundar directed the authorities concerned to dispose of the woman’s application based on merits and in accordance with law.

The court was hearing two connected petitions filed in 2018 by Veeran Manonmani, who sought a direction to the Centre to consider the application for Indian citizenship under Section 5 (1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. She also sought a direction to the Centre to not deport her.

The petitioner said her visa was being extended periodically. But she was apprehensive that the authorities, without disposing of her application for citizenship, were trying to deport her by taking coercive steps.

217,2020/02/16,Demand for instant justice impossible to meet: judge,"‘Knee-jerk reactions will not help in addressing crimes against women, children’

“Ours is a society of people full of emotions and knee-jerk reactions. The moment a horrendous crime is committed, our hearts beat for the victim, and the moment the trial is over and the accused is convicted, our hearts beat for the convicts,” said Justice V. Ramasubramanian of the Supreme Court here on Saturday.

Addressing a national conference organised jointly by the Madras High Court and Tamil Nadu State Judicial Academy (TNSJA) on ‘Speedy and effective trial of offences against women and children,’ he went on to say: “Judiciary and law enforcement agencies often get caught in between these two types of heart beats.

“Unfortunately, we, judicial officers and law enforcement agencies, are supposed to work through our heads and not hearts. There is a complete disconnect between the hearts of society and the heads of the law-enforcement agencies and the judicial officers. This is where I think the conundrum lies.”

Disha Act

The result of the craving for instant justice was the enactment of laws such as the recent Disha Act, passed by the Andhra Pradesh legislature after the brutal gang rape-cum-murder of a young veterinarian, prescribing seven days for completing investigation and 21 days for delivering the judgment in heinous rape cases, he said. “We do not know whether it is actually possible, given the way crimes are committed these days, to complete investigation in seven days and deliver judgment in 21 days. As rightly pointed by the Chief Justice [Amreshwar Pratap Sahi of Madras High Court], the accused has a host of remedies under other laws. Therefore, it is impossible for us to match the demands for instant justice ... When we are caught in between these two extremes, delays occur and society blames the law-enforcement agencies and the judiciary for such delays without realising that anyone who steps into our shoes will also face the very same problem,” he added.

Justice Ramasubramanian said, the cry of the Indian judiciary and investigating agencies had been aptly summarised in a plague placed outside the headquarters of Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States. The plague contains excerpts of a letter written by FBI’s legendary director J. Edgar Hoover to the President of his country.

Piqued over the US Senate turning down his repeated proposals for allotment of more funds to the investigating agency, Mr. Hoover wrote: “We, the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful. But we have done so much, with so little, for so long, we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.”

Impressing upon the need to strengthen the support systems, such as training and recruiting highly qualified forensic science experts, the judge said governments should actually concentrate on establishing world-class forensic science departments in universities and colleges and shift their focus to digital forensics and other emerging fields.

“I do not know how many of you have watched the Hollywood movie Taken... The statistics show that in Europe, if a girl child goes missing and if you are unable to trace her within 48 hours, you can never trace her back. But that is not the situation in India. Therefore, when we emulate western models, we should also think of our strengths,” he added.

In her address, Justice Indira Banerjee of the Supreme Court expressed shock over a criminal appeal that came up before her Bench recently regarding a crime committed in 1978. She said as many as seven accused in the case had died and the lone survivor was now seeking suspension of sentence on the ground of age.

Justice R. Subbiah, chairman of the Board of Governors of TNSJA and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam, member of the Board of Governors, expressed satisfaction over judges from 18 High Courts and judicial officers from the length and breadth of the country showing keen interest in attending the national conference.

Advocate General Vijay Narayan said the Tamil Nadu government had always been in the forefront when it came to supporting the judiciary for speedy and effective trial of offences against crime and children by creating a number of special courts. Despite best efforts, cases get dragged for years together, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/demand-for-instant-justice-impossible-to-meet-judge/article30832658.ece
218,2020/02/16,"Mired in exam scams, it’s testing times for Tamil Nadu","Tamil Nadu has seen a string of cases of exam fraud in recent times. The TNPSC scam — the latest to rock the State — may have not even come to light if not for the suspicions raised by a few candidates. Moreover, with fraudsters employing increasingly innovative methods to game the system, investigators have their work cut out

When it comes to examination fraud, Tamil Nadu has hit the headlines on quite a few occasions in the recent past. Be it in the case of the infamous question paper leak ahead of the police recruitment examination in 2005 or the sensational National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) impersonation scam in 2019, the suspects had come up with novel ways to game the system.

The NEET scam was innovative, in that candidates from Tamil Nadu had hired proxies to take the test on their behalf in other centres across north India to gain admission into medical colleges. In another case, a serving IPS officer was caught cheating in the Civil Services Examination in Chennai. It was found that his wife and an associate had been dictating the answers to him from Hyderabad through a mini wireless earpiece. He was caught following a tip-off from the Central intelligence agencies.

The latest exam scam to rock the State is the one involving the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC). The Crime Branch-CID of the Tamil Nadu police, which is investigating the case, has arrested dozens of suspects so far, including candidates, government employees and middlemen.

The TNPSC scam surfaced when a few candidates questioned how it could be that around 40 of the top 100 candidates who had cleared the Group-IV examination had taken the test at the Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres in Ramanathapuram district. Had they not flagged the issue, the scam may, perhaps, have not come to light at all. The TNPSC was quick to react by ordering an internal probe. After prima facie evidence of serious irregularities was established, a formal complaint was lodged with the CB-CID for further investigation.

It didn’t take much time for the agency to question the suspects and unravel the truth. But what emerged was an unprecedented fraud in the history of competitive examinations. The investigators established that the answer scripts had been tampered with to favour select candidates who had appeared for the exam at the centres in question. As many as 39 of the top 100 candidates who had passed the examination had indeed written the test at the centres in Ramanathapuram district, though they all belonged to other districts.

Vanishing ink

S. Jayakumar of Chennai is alleged to have been the man behind the scam. He had chalked out a meticulous plan by colluding with a few TNPSC officials. The gang of fraudsters had contacted around 100 candidates and had asked them to opt for either the Rameswaram or the Keelakarai centre. The modus operandi was that the candidates would use two pens. First, an ordinary pen would be used to write the registration number. Then, another pen, filled with evaporating ink, would be used to mark answers for the objective-type questions.

The candidates were told that the markings made with the evaporating ink will vanish after a couple of hours, and that the correct answers will be entered later. A TNPSC Record Clerk, entrusted with the task of transporting the answer scripts to Chennai, colluded with Jayakumar and gave him access to the sealed bundles. In filmy style, the suspects moved the answer scripts from one vehicle to another and made fresh entries. The answer scripts that were tampered with were replaced in the designated vehicle, which reached the TNPSC headquarters the following day. The question of why the seals on the vehicle’s door and the bundles were not checked properly by the officials who received the scripts remains a part of the investigation.

While the CB-CID was focusing on the Group-IV Services examination, information from different sources pointed to Jayakumar’s role in irregularities in other examinations conducted by the TNPSC earlier. In-depth inquiries with suspects and sources led to the shocking revelation that Jayakumar had also helped candidates pass the Village Administrative Officer (VAO) and Group-IIA Services examinations in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

The Investigating Officer has begun the process of summoning and examining the candidates who had paid the suspects to help them pass the Group-IV Services examination. The CB-CID’s Director General of Police, M.S. Jaffar Sait, recently formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by a senior police officer, to exclusively probe the scam. So far, the police have arrested 41 persons who were allegedly involved in the Group-IIA Services, VAO and Group-IV Services recruitment exam scams. Many of the arrested persons were in government service before being suspended.

The fraud in the Group-IIA Services exam was different. Jayakumar and his associates had told the suspect candidates not to attempt the questions to which they didn’t know the answers. The candidates left many questions unanswered, since the norm of recording the number of questions answered was not in force then.

When the answer script bundles were being moved from the Sub-Treasury office to Chennai by road, the suspects intervened at an opportune moment and broke open the seal. They moved the answer scripts to another vehicle and marked the right answers to the unanswered questions. An investigation is on to ascertain who provided the answers to the questions. In one case, the gang made fresh entries in black ink, while the candidate had used blue ink to attempt a few questions. The usage of different colours of ink in the answer scripts was in itself a reason to suspect foul play, but the candidate went on to pass the test and join government service, though he was arrested after the scam was exposed. The investigators have referred suspicious answer scripts for forensic analysis.

With suspicions being raised about irregularities in recruitment to other posts, the TNPSC, which has the answer scripts for the examinations held in the last five years, has been conducting random checks based on certain parameters to rule out irregularities.

Acting on reports that suspicions were being raised over the recruitment of Junior Engineer (Architects), the Commission had conducted a thorough check of the answer scripts and had come out with a clarification ruling out foul play. In a bid to strengthen the system further, the Commission had rolled out reforms, including measures that made the process of recruitment more transparent.

Aadhaar is a must

A significant move towards establishing the identities of the candidates was a rule making the Aadhaar card mandatory for appearing for the examinations conducted by the TNPSC. The fingerprints of the candidates would have to be verified before they were allowed to write the examination.

The exam timings were revised. An entire hour was allocated for ensuring the genuineness of candidates and completing other formalities before the commencement of the examination. Marking answers for all questions was made compulsory, and a new option, ‘E’, apart from the existing ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’, was brought in for candidates who did not know the answer to any given question. If any question was left unanswered, the answer script would become invalid. Besides, an internal inquiry was ordered to identify the staff who had colluded with the suspects involved in the scam.

But was the involvement of the main suspect limited to the TNPSC examinations? CB-CID sources said no evidence of his involvement in the 2015 Group-I examination scam had surfaced so far.

The interrogation of a few middlemen linked to the case revealed that Jayakumar was closely associated with a few persons in the Directorate of Public Instruction (DPI) complex, which houses the School Education Department. Investigators are now looking at the possibility of the suspect having played a role in other examinations in recent years. The storage devices and mobile phones seized from the premises of the suspects have been referred for forensic analysis, the outcome of which, the police say, could give more leads.

TNUSRB shocker

Even as the TNPSC scam sent shockwaves across Tamil Nadu, irregularities were reported in the recruitment of Grade-II police constables, prison warders and firemen conducted by the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB). Around 1,000 candidates, who had appeared for the examination in centres across the State, were found to have submitted fake certificates for appointment under the 10% sports quota.

The TNUSRB had advertised the recruitment to as many as 8,888 vacant posts in the Police, Fire & Rescue Services and Prison Departments late last year. As many as 3.25 lakh candidates wrote the examination in 32 districts, and 47,000 of them cleared it and appeared for the Physical Efficiency Test.

Nearly 8,800 candidates who had qualified for appointment were called for certificate verification. However, during the process, it was found that at least 1,000 candidates claiming appointment under the 10% sports quota had submitted ‘ineligible’ certificates. The associations that had issued the sports certificates were not recognised by the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu, and hence, were not competent to issue such certificates. The TNUSRB rejected the claims and brought the candidates concerned under the general quota. No decision has been taken yet to refer the matter to an investigation agency to probe the possibility of unrecognised sports associations issuing such certificates in exchange for cash.

Opposition parties, led by the DMK, have demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the TNPSC recruitment scams. While the CB-CID was able to unravel the modus operandi and arrest the suspects in the TNPSC-related frauds, not much progress has been made in apprehending the proxies in the NEET scam, since it is suspected that all of them are residing outside Tamil Nadu. The agency has sent the photographs/biometrics of the accused — suspected to be medics — to the National Medical Commission, the Unique Identification Authority of India, the Director-General of Health Services, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, among other institutions, seeking their assistance in tracking down the proxies.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9f55xd/article30832934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Exam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/testing-times-for-a-state-mired-inexam-scams/article30832523.ece
219,2020/02/16,Tamil Nadu fiscal deficit is within norms: official,"But Finance Secretary says it must be kept under control

The Tamil Nadu government is maintaining debt sustainability, which is reflected by its performance in certain fiscal indicators. But this does not mean that it can be a profligate dispensation, according to S. Krishnan, Additional Chief Secretary (Finance).

“Our fiscal deficit (FD) is within the norm of 3% of our Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). We will have to keep it under control as we are close to the edge. It is a tightrope balance. At the same time, our [State’s Own Tax Revenue - SOTR] tax-GSDP ratio must improve. Local bodies have to increase their revenue,” Mr. Krishnan told The Hindu on Saturday, responding to questions on the issue of borrowings.

In 2018-19, the ratio of FD-GSDP was 2.84%. In 2019-20, it would be 2.97%, as per revised estimates. For the year 2020-21, the government projected the figure of 2.84%.

Revised estimates

Likewise, the SOTR-GSDP ratio, which was 6.34% in 2018-19, was expected to be 6.51% as per revised estimates and 6.38% as per budget estimates.

Refuting the criticism in certain quarters that the government was borrowing only to meet the cost of subsidies, he said a majority of the borrowings went for capital expenditure. For the coming year, the government planned to borrow about ₹59,000 crore, of which around ₹36,400 crore had been earmarked for capital expenditure. Only the rest would be used to reduce revenue deficit.

Pointing out that one had to examine the factors that contributed to revenue deficit closely, he said that “the State government’s investment is essentially on human capital, which is considered revenue expenditure. Apart from investing in capital construction, the government spends on education and health care. We believe that what we spend today will pay us back later in terms of higher growth because we will have a more educated population.”

It was in this context that Mr. Krishnan described as specious, the classification between revenue expenditure and capital expenditure.

Acknowledging that he would not like revenue deficit or the rise in the proportion of debt in GSDP, he, however, said that it was important to keep them all within the prescribed norms. “The government can afford an increase in debt which is in line with overall growth rate of the State’s economy,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xwe75m/article30832326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THSKRISHNAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-fiscal-deficit-is-within-norms-official/article30832328.ece
220,2020/02/16,‘Pattana Pragathi’ from February 24,"State-level meet on February 18

A meeting of the Cabinet on Sunday evening decided to organise a 10-day ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programme to ground developmental works in municipalities and municipal corporations from February 24 with focus on sanitation and greenery.

The over six hour meeting, presided by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, also decided to conduct a State-level conference of mayors, municipal chairpersons, commissioners, MLAs, collectors and additional collectors at the Chief Minister’s Camp Office here on February 18 to finalise guidelines for the programme.

A release later said the participants in the conference will go on a field visit to Gajwel mandal headquarters in the afternoon session of the conference to study the local vegetarian and non-vegetarian market and cremation grounds.

The programme will be implemented with ward as a unit and it will have a special officer as supervising authority. Four people’s committees should be constituted in the next five days in each ward of corporations and municipalities to execute the works.

Funds release

Mr. Rao left instructions that the government should release ₹ 78 crore per month for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and ₹ 70 crore per month in all for rest of the corporations and municipalities in the State from the Finance Commission funds. Thus, urban areas in the State will get ₹ 148 crore per month.

From the 14th Finance Commission funds, Mr. Rao ordered that ₹ 311 crore be given to GHMC and ₹ 500 crore for other corporations and municipalities.

He laid emphasis on greenery, sanitation works and cleaning up of drainages in the 10-day drive. It was decided to keep 3,100 vehicles for sanitation works. Already 600 vehicles had arrived while the balance 2,500 should be arranged and shifted to towns.

Sapling plantation

Mr. Rao asked authorities to plant saplings in a big way. They should identify places in wards to set up nurseries. Strengthening drinking water network, improvement of roads and identification of sites for setting up cremation and burial grounds were other suggestions that he made.

He also wanted them to take steps to build playgrounds and open gyms, vegetarian and non-vegetarian markets, dumpyards, public toilets and parking lots. Officials should not harass street vendors till alternative places were offered to them.

Abrogate CAA

The Cabinet requested the Central government to take steps to abrogate the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 as it will lead to discrimination on the basis of religion while granting citizenship and, thereby, jeopardise secularism envisaged in the Constitution.

It was decided to pass a resolution to this effect in the State Assembly as was done in Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal, a release said.

The Cabinet also appealed to the Union government not to discriminate people on the basis of religion for according Indian citizenship. All religions must be treated on par in the eyes of law.

Congress schemes

The Cabinet decided to sell the flats constructed for urban poor under Rajiv Swagruha programme of the Congress government in combined A.P. To work out the modalities for sale of these houses that were constructed in blocks, the Cabinet decided to constitute a committee comprising Special Chief Secretary, Housing, Chitra Ramachandran, Principal Secretary, Finance, K. Ramakrishna Rao and Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration, Arvind Kumar.

The Cabinet also decided to thoroughly review other programmes of the Congress government, including Abhaya Hastham, Bangaru Thalli and Vaddileni Runalu.

The responsibility for reviewing Abhaya Hastham was entrusted to Finance Minister T. Harish Rao and Panchayat Raj Secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania.

223,2020/02/16,‘No timeline on withdrawing income tax exemptions’,"No compulsion to switch to new tax regime, says Union Finance Minister

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the objective behind introducing an alternative, second personal income tax regime was to take India towards a simplified, exemption-free and reduced rate of tax regime.

“We want to move forward step-by-step,” she said, adding a timeline, however, has not been set for withdrawing all the exemptions.

“At the moment, we only started a second alternative with some exemptions removed or some exemptions included, although the original intention was to remove all exemptions and give a clear simplified reduced rate of income tax,” she said on the new tax regime that was announced in the Union Budget 2020-21. Under the regime, relatively lower rates will be applicable to those foregoing deductions and exemptions, including those available on home loans, life and medical insurance premium payments.

Speaking to media, after an interactive session on the Budget with trade and industry representatives, tax professionals and academics here, she said introduction of the second alternative was not to compel anyone to give up the exemptions and switch to the new tax regime. If tax payers under the old tax regime wanted to continue, they can do so. For the sake of clarity, a computation has been provided showing how much tax one would pay under both the regime. “It is up to the assessee to decide,” she said.

Medical equipment

Earlier, responding to a leading oncologist who said the 5% health cess on imported medical equipment has come as a rude shock to the medical fraternity and was being introduced at a time when funds for Ayushman Bharat remained unutilised, Ms. Sitharaman said the objective behind introducing the cess was to create medical infrastructure in tier II and III cities. Some of the cities now do not have enough hospitals which can be empanelled for Ayushman Bharat. On the unutilised Aysuhman Bharat funds, she said ₹3,500 crore was lying unutilised and they are for patient care and cannot be diverted for other purposes.

Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the health cess is intended to meet the twin objectives of building medical infrastructure in tier-II and III cities and encouraging domestic industry.

A press release from Hyderabad Customs and Central Tax said trade representatives sought clarifications on various issues, including import of machinery for use in poultry industry, classification of locomotive parts, double taxation resulting due to Clean Environment Cess, technology issues relating to revocation of cancellation of registration and Dividend Distribution Tax.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/us9b6d/article30836766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17FINMIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/no-timeline-on-withdrawing-income-tax-exemptions/article30836767.ece
224,2020/02/16,Funds to Telangana as per Finance Commission: Finance Minister,"Further, State has been given higher borrowing limit, says senior official

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said devolution of funds to the States was done as per the recommendations of the Finance Commission and it should not be construed as Centre not doing enough for the States.

“The Centre has not reduced the share of States [as] what it has done is implementation of the Finance Commission recommendation,” she said to queries from media on Telangana ruling party leaders expressing disappointment at the level of devolution. Ms. Sitharaman, accompanied by senior officials of the Ministry, was speaking after the ‘Jan Jan Ka Budget’, an interactive session of Union Budget 2020-21 in the city.

Sharing details of the devolution, Expenditure Secretary T. V. Somanathan said from 2010-2015 the total releases to Telangana under the share of Central taxes, State Disaster Relief Fund, local body funds grants and others was ₹46,740 crore. During the next five years (2015-2020), which includes the rest of this fiscal, the estimated release to Telangana will be ₹106606 crore or an increase of 128%.

Thus, it is not correct to say the transfers to Telangana have been short. “In fact, it has been much higher than for many other States,” he said. Telangana is one of the few States which has been given a higher borrowing limit of 3.5% of SDP instead of 3% which is allowed for most other States. By virtue of the higher borrowing limit and the devolution, Telangana is one of the best endowed States financially, he said.

On a special grant of over ₹700 crore that the 15th Finance Commission had recommended to be issued to Telangana, the Finance Minister said it has been referred back to the Commission seeking certain clarifications as it did seem to be within the terms of reference.

Ms. Sitharaman also refuted that allocation for MNREGA scheme in the Budget had been reduced. “Compared to the BE announced in July 2019, for no programme [we] have reduced BE in 2020,” she said, while Mr. Somanathan said more provision will be made if required under the Revised Estimates.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2ro73p/article30836413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17NIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/funds-to-telangana-as-per-finance-commission-finance-minister/article30836414.ece
225,2020/02/16,A demeaning way of cutting costs,"Government entities continue to boost movie piracy

No crime if it is government!

Time and again, celebrities from the movie industry have been appealing to citizens not to watch pirated movies. However, a bunch of journalists gasped when the violation was played out before their eyes while travelling in the Telangana Tourism Development Corporation bus recently on way to Mannanur, Egalapenta and other tourist attractions in Nagarkurnool district.

And it was the two-part blockbuster movie Baahubali, which was played in the State-run bus. The constant whistles, jeering and poor quality of the video made it evident that the video was recorded in a theatre.

The journalists were taken from Hyderabad, as Tourism and Culture Minister V. Srinivas Goud inaugurated Haritha Resorts in Mannanur and Egalapenta. The journalists were surprised that the corporation bus was playing a pirated print of the blockbuster movie starring Prabhas and Rana Daggubati, which was released in 2017. The movie has already been broadcast by several entertainment channels more than thrice a month.

Changing styles of celebration!

Celebrations of birthdays of popular figures in public life, particularly in politics, and greetings by their followers and colleagues has been undergoing a visible change in the recent years. From meeting the personality concerned and greeting him/her with huge garlands or bouquets, it has now transformed to presenting saplings in attractive flower pots. A couple of years back, the then Nizamabad MP K. Kavitha gave a call to women and grown up girls to present helmets to their brothers on the occasion of ‘rakhi’. Now, a huge exercise is planned across the State to take up tree plantation on the occasion of 66th birthday of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. “Planting saplings is good on any occasion but it would be meaningful only if the plants are protected till they reach a safe stage. Otherwise, the whole effort would end up meaningless,” a ruling party leader said.

Discoms ‘powerless’ on tariff decision

It is as good as no hike in power tariff for all categories of consumers for one more year. The power consumers were insulated from tariff hike in the last five years and, the coming year (2020-21), is also likely to go the same way going by recent developments.

The two power distribution companies in the State were supposed to file their annual revenue requirement with the electricity regulator, reflecting their financial health, on Saturday. Instead, they sought time till February 29 to complete the formalities.

Generally, the regulator would require 45 days to peruse the filings and conduct a public hearing on the proposals made by the companies. In view of time constraints due to delay in filings by distribution companies, it is assumed that the tariff for 2020-21 will remain the same as in the current year. The companies were supposed to file their requirements by November 30 but requested the regulator to extend the date as they did not get the Chief Minister’s approval.

Wait for pay revision continues

The agonising wait of the State government employees for the submission of report by the Pay Revision Commission that could lead to announcement of fitment benefit continues.

The commission, constituted on May 24, 2018, was given more than two extensions and its tenure is coming to close on February 24. Though the PRC members are said to be through with finalisation of their recommendations on pay revision related issues, the commission did not submit its report so far owing to the additional terms of reference given to it by the government from time to time.

The latest of these additional terms of reference to study the scope for enhancing the retirement age from 58 to 60 was given early this month thus delaying the work of the commission further and thereby making the employees impatient.

Barring a few chaotic incidents at Hunsa in Bodhan mandal, the election of chairperson and vice-chairperson of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) passed off peacefully in integrated Nizamabad district on Sunday.

In nine PACS, the election was postponed due to lack of quorum or delay in the arrival of directors. For the 144 PACS, 89 in the district and 55 in Kamareddy, 26 in the former and 12 in the latter, were elected unanimously.

Except in a couple of PACS out of 106, which went for polling for the chairperson and vice-chairperson posts, the ruling TRS is poised to win all the societies.

In Madhavanagar of Nizamabad rural Assembly constituency, the BJP secured victory in 10 territorial constituencies and TRS three. The same happened at Mosra in Banswada constituency. In Damarancha of Beerkur mandal and Hunsa of Bodhan mandal, the Congress is likely to hoist its flag as it won majority TCs. In Jankampet of Yedapally mandal, an Independent has more chances to win the PACS.

There were some tense moments at Hunsa when the followers of some candidates supported by the Congress and TRS came to blows and pushed each other. They were also involved in jostling with the police.

At Munipally and Argul in Jakranpally mandal, Balkonda mandal headquarters, Tandur in Nagireddypet mandal and Gandhari, directors of PACS were elected with one vote and at fifth TC of Mallur, PACS in Nizamsagar mandal Madgi Bhoomavva was elected through a lucky draw as she and her opponent Yedla Laxmi got an equal of 36 votes.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pacs-elections-peaceful/article30836052.ece

Minister for Tourism and Prohibition and Excise V. Srinivas Goud instructed officials to examine the helicopter services from Hyderabad to the Vemulawada temple shrine ahead of Sivaratri on February 21.

The Minister visited Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada on Sunday to offer prayers. Later, he inspected the arrangements for Mahasivaratri Jatara, which would be held from February 20 to 22. He was accompanied by Vemulawada legislator Ch. Ramesh Babu, MLC Naradasu Laxman Rao and Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar.

At a review meeting, the Minister instructed officials to examine the feasibility of operating the helicopter services from Hyderabad to Vemulawada for the benefit of devotees during the festival. He said that devotees coming here in a helicopter should be provided a special darshan and food at Haritha hotel.

Informing the authorities to take up a poster campaign about the festival in Hyderabad, he said that the Tourism department would operate special buses to the Vemulawada temple shrine from Hyderabad.

He also instructed the officials to take all measures for the smooth conduct of the jatara and provide adequate facilities to devotees. He said that they would be organising cultural programmes at the temple shrine under the title “Shivarachana”.

Mr. Ramesh Babu asked officials to provide a chance to local artistes to perform during Shivarachana. Mr. Krishna Bhaskar instructed the officials to work with dedication during the jatara.

228,2020/02/16,Possible high level inquiry into Bhainsa violence: MoS Kishan Reddy,"Citing injuries to DSP and CI in the incident, says it clearly indicated that security needs to be beefed up

Union Minister of State (MoS) for Home G. Kishan Reddy on Sunday said he will assess the possibility of ordering a high level inquiry into the communal violence in Bhainsa town of Nirmal district. The communally sensitive town was rocked by violence on January 12 and 13.

Addressing the media after visiting the violence hit parts of the town in Korbagalli galli, the MoS accused the government of laxity in controlling the violence. He said even the report in damage caused during the violence was submitted to the State government only on Saturday.

‘Will take up relief issue early’

Quoting the report, Mr. Kishan Reddy said 101 persons were affected in the violence and the damages by way of burnt property was about ₹ 2.33 crore. He said he would take up the issue of compensation to the victims of violence at the earliest.

Talking of the recurrence of communal violence in Bhainsa, the MoS said he will discuss with concerned officials the way in which fool-proof security can be given to citizens of the town. “The incident which saw the DSP and CI getting injured clearly indicated that security needs to be beefed up,” he added.

Donates three months’ salary

In an unusual gesture, Mr. Reddy announced that he is donating his three months salary as a Minister towards relief for the Bhainsa victims. While Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president announced a relief of ₹ 15 lakh, Members of Parliament from Karimnagar, Bandi Sanjay and Nizamabad D. Aravind announced a contribution of ₹ 5 lakh each.

Earlier, Mr. Reddy listened to what his partymen had to tell about the incident. He was also briefed about the violence and the steps initiated by the district administration by district Collector Md. Musharraf Ali Faruqui and Superintendent of Police C. Shashidhar Raju.

Stringent action against culprits

The MoS asked the police to take stringent action against the culprits. He said there should be no scope for sparing the culprits whichever political party they belonged to.

Mr. Reddy interacted with families that have suffered losses in the violence.

It is hardly 500 m away from National Highway 65 that leads to Mumbai. At the end of the lane from the main road, stands silently the 11th century Sri Ramalingeswara Swamy temple located in Nandikandi village in Sadashivapet mandal.

Said to be constructed by Kalyani Chalukyas, the structure has a unique style described as ‘ornamented architecture’.

It’s a testimony to attacks during the many foreign invasion and many idols in the temple are mute witnesses to that. One can witness the damaged idols inside the temple premises and in the museum established within the compound.

Whose temple is it anyway?

Perhaps ignoratnt of its importance, someone has partly painted outside the temple structure which needs to be restored to its original form. Whether the Archaeology Department would take it up or not is a big question as it involves some financial commitment. In addition, vertical cracks are developing on the outside structure which needs an immediate attention.

In the past, there used to be an arch indicating the temple at the village entrance. However, it was damaged in the road widening and never rebuilt. Villagers claim they have made repeated appeals to L&T, which was awarded the contract of building the highway.

Passing the buck

“We have made repeated appeals to the company to build the arch again so that it would indicate the existence and direction to the temple. But they have told that the money was deposited with the Endowment Department and they have nothing to do now,” said a villager.

The arch has seven inverted lotuses sculpted on it and it is said that it designed in such a way that sun-rays get focused into the sanctum sanctorum.

In 2014, about ₹ 42 lakh was sanctioned for the temple’s development and works were taken up. In fact, a guest house was constructed opposite the temple.

No pilgrim footfalls

But since then the historic temple has been failing to attract pilgrims. Reason? Locals, as well as officials are reportedly have not been paying any interest to promote it.

“Despite repeated appeals, no concrete steps were put in place to promote the temple which has a potential to attract large number of tourists as this is located near Hyderabad. The only thing needed is focus by the concerned departments to develop and promote it,” said B. Muralidhar, a Nandikandi resident.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pv6juh/article30837558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16-TEMPLE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sans-devotionand-promotion-11th-century-temple-near-hyderabad-lies-in-ruins/article30835356.ece

235,2020/02/16,Dancing for humanity,"Nancy Sahu is on a mission to preserve and promote Rabindranatyam, a dance form created by Rabindranath Tagore

Nancy Sahu uses dance to make a powerful statement about current issues. Particularly moving was one of her performances where she portrayed the pain and grief of families who lost their dear ones in the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir. The sense of hopelessness and helplessness shone through in her ballet she presented in Rabindranatyam.

The dance form, explains Nancy, allowed her to express the denial, loss and anger of the widows and other survivors at the recital. She explains how, “the four main constituents of Rabindranatyam Angika (body language), Vachika (song, recitation, music and rhythm), Aharya (stage-setting, costume, make up, jewellery) and Sattvika (the performer’s emotional connection with the story and audience are different from other dance forms.” Rabindranatyam also deifies the elements of nature, she adds.

Nancy says she finds Rabindranatyam the perfect medium to promote peace and harmony, humanity and equality. In her many national and international shows, she has danced to contemporary themes like women empowerment, conservation of the environment and, so on. “Rabindranath Tagore created this novel classical dance based on the folk dances of Bengal and hence, the footwork is extensive. Abhinaya is predominant in Rabindranatyam,” says the 27-year-old IT professional from Delhi who was in city for a dance recital called Vatan (Motherland). She won extra fans because she danced despite a torn ligament. “My doctor asked me to go to a surgeon, I came here to perform,” she chuckles. Nancy performs regularly in programmes organised by Delhi Tourism, at the Delhi International Art Festival, India International Dance Festival, and other national and international events.

It was her mother who chose this dance form for her, says Nancy who juggles a corporte job, her performances as well as a dance school she set up for underprivileged children in Delhi, called Vasundhara Kala Academy. Her mother who was herself not encouraged to learn dance, made sure her daughter had that chance. She hunted high and low for a teacher and finally chose the Delhi Ballet Group, run by Guru Valmiki Banjerjee, who was the founder director of the dance school (1954) and a research scholar on Rabindranatyam.

Her Guru, quickly recognising the young Nancy’s ability encouraged her to give perfomances (she recollects a recital in Goa where she saw Pandit Birju Maharaj). Even when she was only 16 years old, he enrusted her with the task of conducting a workshop in Mysore. All this was a huge impetus to Nancy’s confidence.

She recollectsa performance of hers on Rabindra Jayanti in 2016. “Minutes before the show, Guruji called me and said ‘Dance today as if this is your last performance’. And I danced like a possessed soul.” She was overwhelmed to see her Guruji’s eyes welling up.

Nancy is collaborating with local schools in Delhi to teach their students Tagore’s Ekla chalo re. “There is a bigger project after that,” she smiles. “But I don’t want to divulge the details now.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/6dtva4/article30835931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ15NANCY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/dancing-for-humanity/article30835933.ece

The Congress and the BJP hit out at each other after the latter unveiled a 32-foot statue of Gond Queen Rani Kamplapati in Bhopal on Sunday.

The ruling Congress said the statue has been installed without permissions while the BJP, which is in power in the Bhopal Municipal Corporation, hit back claiming the former was insulting people of the Gond community by opposing the unveiling.

The statue was installed on the banks of Lower Lake here by Bhopal Mayor Alok Sharma, though Congress Ministers Arif Aqueel, Jaivardhan Singh, P.C. Sharma and Govind Singh, named in the function invite boycotted the event.

Black flags shown

Congress workers led by Corporator Shabista Jaki protested at the site and showed black flags to the Mayor.

Ms. Jaki alleged the approach to the statue was made after removing several legitimate homes, while a road adjoining a bridge leading to the statue was being built on land meant for a Muslim graveyard.

Eyewitnesses said workers from the two parties came to blows during the protests.

Mr. Sharma said the Ministers’ names were included in the invite after their consent was obtained, while Govind Singh, Minister in charge of Bhopal, said he skipped the event as the statue had come up without permission.

237,2020/02/16,‘No lack of communication between Scindia and Nath’,"Talks on with guest teachers over their demands: Digvijaya

Days after Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia threatened to hit the streets against the Kamal Nath-led government over fulfilment of poll manifesto, veteran party leader Digvijaya Singh said there was no lack of communication between Mr. Scindia and the Chief Minister.

Mr. Singh was talking to reporters here on Saturday after attending the Madhya Pradesh Congress Coordination Committee meeting held in New Delhi earlier that day.

“The party manifesto is meant to be fulfilled in five years. Right now, the government has completed only 15 months. Talks are on with the guest teachers over their demands and a formula is being worked out. A solution will be found,” he said.

“There is no lack of communication between Kamal Nathji and Mr. Scindia...there is no need for any mediation,” Mr. Singh added.

‘Peaceful talks’

Amid reports that Mr. Scindia had left the coordination committee meeting midway, Mr. Singh said, “During the meeting (in Delhi) we discussed all the issues. Some reports showed that he (Mr. Scindia) left the meeting in a huff. But they (reports) are absolutely wrong. During the meeting that took place between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., talks were held in a peaceful manner.”

Mr. Scindia, while addressing a public rally in Tikamgarh on Thursday, had threatened that he would hit the streets if the party’s manifesto and guest teachers’ demands are not fulfilled in Madhya Pradesh.

“I want to tell the guest teachers — I heard your demand before Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh. I want to assure you that your demand already stands underlined in our party’s government’s manifesto,” he had said.

“Our turn will come, I assure you.

239,2020/02/16,Encroachment of M.P. National Park land continues unchecked,"Displaced families for tiger corridor await land allotment

The Madhav National Park has claimed denotified land is unavailable for allotment to 39 tribal families displaced 20-years ago to make way for a tiger corridor, even though hundreds of others compensated for to vacate the Park continue to farm and encroach upon the corridor unchecked. Moreover, tigers are yet to be reintroduced in the park, let alone the corridor’s development.

Over several years, the Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF), Shivpuri circle, has flagged the encroachment to the State Chief Wildlife Warden and the district administration stating “the corridor land hasn’t been vacated, and several families who’ve received the compensation continue their encroachment and many have returned to resume farming,” and that “no action had been taken so far,” reveals an October 2019 letter.

“Many who took the compensation didn’t leave. While 77 families which refused to take compensation have stayed back and continue farming,” Y.P. Singh, CCF, Shivpuri circle, told The Hindu.

Of the 15 villages within the corridor of the Park, where tigers were last spotted in 1970s, 10 were relocated in 2000, while 391 of 468 families in the remaining accepted compensation. Still, most have refused to leave.

‘Mistaken allotment’

And as part of the rehabilitation package, which promised two hectare land and relocation to each family, when Balapur village was being relocated, authorities belatedly noticed they had mistakenly allotted 61 families protected forest land instead of revenue, stalling the process for 39 families, although relocated, awaiting ownership of two-hectare agricultural land.

The State government has sought the land’s denotification from the Centre, pending clearance till date.

Without land to till and call their own, men of the 39 Saharia families, a particularly vulnerable tribal group traditionally dependent on forest produce and farming, had taken to working in illegal-run stone mines, a hazardous job that snatched lives with tuberculosis, leaving at least 15 widows in its wake. This prompted the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission to direct the district authorities to compensate their families.

‘Widow’s village’

On Thursday, 60 residents of Budi Barod, referred to as the ‘widow’s village’ locally for its relocated families, staged a dharna at the district Collectorate, demanding pending allotment of agricultural land, and even pointing out the allotted land was not arable, dependent entirely on rain.

“At least in the forest, we fetched tendu leaves, mahua and glue for a living and farmed lands. Now we’re forced to migrate to work as agricultural labourers,” said Kunjawati Adivasi, 45, whose family tilled eight-ten bighas in the forest before.

“The district officials and foresters will hold a camp in the village on February 21 to listen to their grievances,” said Ranjit Balodia, Additional District Magistrate, Shivpuri. This is despite Collector Anugraha P., who unilaterally upended the rehabilitation policy endorsed by the State Congress government in 1999, the Centre, the Park and the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission, informing The Hindu earlier, “Members of the 39 families are ineligible for rehabilitation, as either they were not residing in the relocated village at the time or were minors.”

“When the government’s claiming they’re ineligible, why hold a camp? They must state it in writing if they are ineligible. This is just delaying tactics to take away what rightfully belongs to the families” said Abhay Jain, of the Zenith Legal Aid Clinic.

In 2017, the Commission directed the district administration to speedily rehabilitate the families and reiterate its request to the Centre to denotify the land. “It’s been three years, yet the administration has not acted. This shows its scant regard for our institutions,” said Mr. Abhay.

A long wait

Devendra Namdev, 40, a daily wager, asked for how long they’d have to leave a day’s work every time to flock to the Collectorate 22-km away to demand their rights.

“Ten days ago, when we protested here, the Collector was on leave. Now she says we must allow the Park Director some time to act, as he’s just taken charge. This shows their casual attitude in ensuring our livelihoods,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/43bpxe/article30837150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16FAMILY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/encroachment-of-mp-national-park-land-continues-unchecked/article30837151.ece
240,2020/02/16,"Take back NSA charges against Kafeel, demand AMU students","Gorakhpur doctor’s lawyer alleges district administration acting under pressure

Aligarh Muslim University students protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Sunday demanded that the charges slapped against Gorakhpur doctor Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act be withdrawn. They also condemned the Chennai police brutality against anti-CAA protesters on Saturday.

72-hour ultimatum

In a memorandum given to the Additional City Magistrate, Aligarh, the students demanded a judicial inquiry and immediate action to revoke the NSA on Dr. Khan, as the right to speech is a fundamental right. “We are giving 72 hours to revoke the NSA on Dr. Kafeel Khan, otherwise the student fraternity will go on a mass protest. We also demand appropriate action against the Chennai police,” the memorandum said.

The Gorakhpur doctor was arrested by the Special Task Force of U.P. Police in Mumbai on January 29 on charges of making an inflammatory speech in AMU on December 12 during an anti-CAA-NRC protest at Bab-e-Syed. He was granted bail on February 10 by an Aligarh court but instead of releasing him, the Uttar Pradesh government invoked the NSA on him.

Irfan Ghazi, lawyer of Dr. Khan, said that in the NSA order the District Magistrate has said that the local intelligence unit has indicated possibility of his client returning to AMU and vitiating the peaceful atmosphere.

“If the district administration had any such information, they should have opposed the bail order in the local court or should have approached the higher court. The district administration has taken the decision as an afterthought under political pressure. It seems the order has more to do with Dr. Khan’s revelations on deaths in the BRD Hospital, Gorakhpur case than his speech at AMU,” alleged Mr. Ghazi.

He further said the order held Dr. Khan responsible for the anti-CAA protests and violence in AMU and Aligarh, which is false.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/njj78e/article30837143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16-AMU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/take-back-nsa-charges-against-kafeel-demand-amu-students/article30837144.ece

The Congress in Assam sounded the poll bugle with a rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Nagaon district on Sunday.

The elections to the 126 Assembly seats in the State are a little more than a year away. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the three-party government in Assam, had claimed it would win 100 seats — 40 more than in 2016 — in the 2021 State polls.

“They have set a 100-seat target despite the anti-CAA wave in the State. That is over confidence, if not an impossible dream,” Congress leader and former Minister Rakibul Hussain said at the rally in Rupahihat, about 140 km east of Guwahati.

He criticised the BJP for targeting and arresting a section of Congress workers in the name of violence during the anti-CAA protests. “The Congress will take care of these cases after forming the government,"" he added.

Assam Congress president Ripun Bora also slammed the BJP for dividing people in the name of religion, community and language.

“The BJP wants the votes of Hindu immigrants for whom it brought the CAA which has divided the people. They are making it Assamese versus Bengali, Muslims versus Muslims and Hindus versus Muslims,” Mr. Bora said.

He also blamed the BJP for excluding many genuine Indians from the updated National Register of Citizens by deliberately ignoring certain documents.

Local MLA, Nurul Huda called the CAA a “black law”.

245,2020/02/16,Maharashtra government has right to launch independent probe into Elgaar Parishad case: Sharad Pawar,"NCP chief cuts short tour, calls for a meeting of the 16 NCP ministers in Mumbai on Monday

While the Central government had the right to assign certain cases to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), it was improper to take over the Elgaar Parishad case without taking the State government into confidence, said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, while remarking that the Maharashtra government too had a right to launch an independent probe into the case.

Speaking in Jalgaon district in north Maharashtra on Sunday, Mr. Pawar further questioned whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government was shielding the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government that was in power in Maharashtra at the time of the Bhima Koregaon clashes of January 1, 2018, and the probe into the Elgaar Parishad by the Pune Police.

‘Two different matters’

“The Bhima Koregaon clashes and the Elgaar Parishad case are two different matters. In the latter, the Pune Police have slapped cases of sedition and arrested persons who had no relation to the clashes, but were vocal in expressing their dissent of the Central government through their writings. Such persons have been languishing in jail. This is not right. Does merely expressing dissenting views amount to anti-national activity?” Mr. Pawar asked, reiterating his view that the State government must form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the actions of the Pune Police.

Mr. Pawar, who had urged the constitution of an SIT after publicly casting aspersions on the Pune Police’s investigations in the case, had recently expressed displeasure after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to consent transferring the Elgaar Parishad case.

“While the Centre is entitled to assign a case to the NIA if it feels the need, the State government was not consulted in this matter [Elgaar Parishad case]. The fact that the Central government abruptly took the case from the State government’s hands can only mean that they want to cover up something,” said Mr. Pawar.

Meeting on Monday

The NCP chief, who was due to visit Nashik district to meet with party workers and attend an event, cut short his tour and returned to Mumbai.

Mr. Pawar has called for a meeting of the 16 NCP ministers in Mumbai on Monday, triggering speculation of the possible significance of the meeting in the backdrop of disagreements between Chief Minister Thackeray and the NCP over the transfer of the Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA.

However, the NCP chief, who had earlier expressed disappointment in Mr. Thackeray’s decision to agree the transfer of the case to the NIA, was cautious in stating that it was the Chief Minister’s prerogative to do so.

Legal opinion sought

Meanwhile, State Home Minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh has said that the State government had sought legal opinion to form an SIT to probe the Pune Police’s actions in the Elgaar Parishad case.

Among those arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case include poet-activist P. Varavara Rao; noted trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj; activists Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Rona Wilson and Mahesh Raut; advocate Surendra Gadling’; Professor Shoma Sen; and writer-publisher Sudhir Dhawale — all of whom are presently lodged in Pune’s Yerwada prison.

The Pune City Police’s case rests on a First Information Report registered at the city’s Vishrambaug Police Station in January 2018 in connection with the Elgaar Parishad held at Pune’s Shaniwarwada Fort on December 31, 2017 as part of the bicentenary celebrations of the 1818 battle of Koregaon-Bhima.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/z0701d/article30820565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-govt-has-right-to-launch-independent-probe-into-elgaar-parishad-case-sharad-pawar/article30835989.ece
246,2020/02/16,Accord drives divide in Assam’s Bodo domain,"Signatories to the third Bodo Accord appear to have unsettled signatories to the second accord of February 2003

The third Bodo Accord signed with a set of extremist groups more than a fortnight ago appears to have unsettled another set of extremists who signed the second accord in February 2003 and went on to rule the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC).

The Centre had on January 27 signed the peace accord with all factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and two other organisations, including the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU). The signatories subsequently announced their political ambitions with Pramod Boro suddenly quitting as the ABSU president.

The elections to the 40-member BTC are expected in April.

‘Cannot accept’

The political ambitions of the leaders of ABSU and NDFB appear to have rubbed the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), which has been ruling BTC since 2003 and is a partner in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in Assam, the wrong way.

“The new accord merely changes the name of BTC to Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) and gives us nothing. We cannot just accept this accord, we will not even use BTR as part of our vocabulary,” BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary said at a party meeting in Kokrajhar district’s Parbatjhora area on Saturday.

Mr. Mohilary’s outburst attains significance ahead of the BTC elections, where the ABSU has often sided with rival parties of the BPF, such as United People’s Party Liberal. Moreover, he was a witness to the January 27 accord-signing in New Delhi along with Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.

The BTC chief, who headed the now-disbanded extremist group Bodo Liberation Tigers, has also been critical of Mr. Boro. “He used to say he would never become a politician and contest elections. He lied when he was with ABSU, he will lie more if he comes to power,” Mr. Mohilary said.

Boro retaliates

The former ABSU president retaliated by saying Mr. Mohilary has lost the trust the people of BTC had reposed in him. “The people are desperate for a change in leadership that has foresight and is honest about serving them,” Mr. Boro said at a welcome ceremony for the new accord signatories in Baksa district’s Musalpur area on Sunday.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rq2dne/article30835924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BODOACCORD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/accord-drives-divide-in-assams-bodo-domain/article30835925.ece
247,2020/02/16,Withdraw NSA charges against Dr. Kafeel Khan: AMU’s resident doctors,"The Gorakhpur doctor was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force from Mumbai on January 29 in connection with a speech he had delivered

Resident doctors at the Aligarh Muslim University’s (AMU) Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital on Sunday demanded that the charges slapped against Dr. Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act be withdrawn.

Dr. Khan was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force from Mumbai on January 29 in connection with a speech he had delivered during an anti-CAA protest at the Aligarh Muslim University on December 12.

The Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) held a protest march on the hospital campus against the slapping of the NSA against the Gorakhpur doctor after he was granted bail in connection with the alleged hate speech.

RDA president Dr. Hamza Malik said the move was a “blatant attempt to crush dissent and a violation of the Constitution of India”.

He said by targeting the doctor, the U.P. government had done a great disservice to the entire medical community.

‘Direct assault’

The AMU Students’ Coordination Committee also described the decision to charge Dr. Khan under the NSA a “direct assault” on a member of the medical fraternity who is “known for his upright behaviour and a champion of free speech”.

Committee spokesperson and former AMU Students’ Union president Faizul Hasan said by charging Dr. Khan under the NSA even after he got bail was “a direct violation of a Supreme Court ruling on such issues”.

Mr. Hasan said Dr. Khan’s fate should serve as an eye-opener for the rest of the country regarding democratic rights in Uttar Pradesh.

The doctor was earlier arrested for his alleged role in the death of over 60 children within an week at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur in August 2017. Short supply of oxygen at the children’s ward was blamed at that time for the deaths.

About two years later, a State government probe cleared Dr. Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Yogi Adityanath government.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c6ece9/article30835525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THLTDRKAFEELKHANARRESTEDFORINFLAMMATORYSPEECHMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/withdraw-nsa-charges-against-dr-kafeel-khan-amus-resident-doctors/article30835526.ece
248,2020/02/16,Ready for panchayat polls but release leaders: NC writes to ECI,"The NC party wants “roadblocks” placed in its way to be removed so that it can campaign freely.

The National Conference (NC) on Sunday decided to contest the upcoming panchayat polls in Jammu and Kashmir but asked the Election Commission of India (ECI) “to remove the roadblocks by releasing the incarcerated leadership”.

In a letter to J&K Chief Electoral Officer Shalendra Kumar, NC central secretary Rattan Lal Gupta said: “We reiterate our commitment to strengthen democracy at the grassroots level.”

Stating that the NC was a strong votary of the democratic process and wished to participate in it, the NC spokesman said it was practically impossible for the party as the top leadership, including president Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Ali Muhammad Sagar, had been arrested under the Public Safety Act.

“Kindly advise as how these roadblocks that have been placed in the way of participation in the panchayat elections can be over,” the letter addressed to the ECI reads.

The NC also took exception to the ECI decision to hold polls for vacant 11639 panch and sarpanch seats on party basis. “The schedule is prima facie defective since these elections were earlier held on non-party basis,” the letter said.

The NC decision is in contrast to the earlier stand where it stayed way from the panchayat polls in 2018 over the issue of Article 370 and Article 35A.

The PDP, another regional party, is yet to decide on these polls. PDP leader Firdous Tak said most of the leaders, who are part of the Political Affairs Committee (PAC), are behind the bars and booked under PSA. “We are not even in position to discuss panchayat polls,” he said.

CPI(M) secretary G.N. Malik said the political situation in J&K was not conducive for holding by-elections for panchayats. “At a time when most of the political leaders are under detention or their movements have been curtailed, such exercise will not yield the desired results,”he said.

The Congress, which participated in the 2018 elections, alleged that a particular party was being provided with every facility, including security, and free passage.

“The party is going to hold a meeting soon on its participation,” said Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Monga.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2qevz4/article28969886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001JB6IB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jk-national-conference-decides-to-participate-in-panchayat-polls-wants-roadblocks-to-be-removed/article30835022.ece
249,2020/02/16,Delhi opted for ‘real nationalism’; Nitish will be shown door for riding ‘communal bus’:Tejashwi Yadav,"The onus of defeating the “divisive agenda” of the NDA government in Bihar also lies on the opposition that should provide a “formidable and unified” alternative, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said.

Delhi voters have shown the way by opting for “real nationalism” and the electorate in Bihar should emulate them to vote out Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who has no qualms in taking off his “secular veil” on issues such as the CAA, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said on Sunday.

The onus of defeating the “divisive agenda” of the NDA government in Bihar also lies on the opposition that should provide a “formidable and unified” alternative, Mr. Yadav told PTI in an interview ahead of his ‘Berozgari Hatao Yatra’ starting on February 23 with a massive rally in Patna.

He said the ‘mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) was ready to take on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) against its “divisive agenda and 15 years of misrule” in the assembly polls.

“Nitish Kumar has never criticised the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), NPR (National Population Register) and the NRC (National Register for Citizens). He didn’t utter even a single word on the recent reservation issue. He doesn’t have any courage to criticise any of the BJP’s policies,” the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly said.

While the Janata Dal (United) helped the Bharatiya Janata Party in getting the citizenship bill passed in Parliament, Kumar only said his government will not implement the NRC in the state, Mr. Yadav said.

“Nitish Kumar is a cunning politician. He knows that once the BJP makes NRC an Act, he can do nothing but comply. Then he will cry over his helplessness in light of constitutional norms. His party could have made a difference during voting for the CAB in Parliament, but there he exhibited his true communal character,” the 30-year-old leader said.

The whole exercise of the CAA, NPR and the NRC is for dividing and polarising the nation on religious lines for political gains and Kumar has no qualms in shunning his “secular veil to show his true colours”, Yadav alleged.

On Delhi polls

Talking about the Delhi polls won by the Aam Aadmi Party comprehensively, Yadav said the message was loud and clear not only for the Bihar polls but also for the whole nation that if the government works for necessary amenities and social and financial security, then no diversion will work.

“Welfare of the citizens is real nationalism. Dividing people on communal lines is proving catastrophic for the nation. Youth is on the streets fighting, lynching and abusing. Union ministers are pushing the citizens to indulge in violence against those who are asking questions of the government,” the RJD leader said.

Union ministers are delivering veiled “incendiary and communal” speeches against citizens who are protesting, he said.

Voters of Delhi have shown the nation the right path and now it is up to the people of Bihar and the whole country to emulate them, Mr. Yadav said.

Delhi elections were assembly polls which should be fought on local and state-level issues, but the way the BJP is trying to rake up national issues every time sets a “very dangerous precedent”, he said.

For 15 years in power, Nitish Kumar kept on terming his rule as “sushasan (good governance) and misused state exchequer for filling the coffers of a few obliging media houses to project his image”, he alleged.

But with the advent of social media and online news platforms in Bihar, the reality of all claims of good governance in the state was exposed and the corruption of the government was out in the open, the RJD leader said.

He claimed that Mr. Kumar’s days as the chief minister and a politician are numbered as people will not stand “false propaganda” anymore.

“He (Kumar) has destroyed the education system, health services are in ICU, law and order has completely collapsed, his own MLAs, MPs, Union ministers are questioning the deteriorating law and order, farmers are dejected...And with all these failures he has failed the aspirational citizens of Bihar,” Mr. Yadav alleged.

“In such a gloomy situation, the only option that this government has is to play communal politics. And Nitish Kumar will ride the same communal bus, but this time communal and divisive politics will not bear any fruit,” he asserted.

Talking about his ‘Berozgari Hatao Yatra, Yadav said unemployment is the biggest issue that is bothering the educated youth as Bihar has the highest rate of unemployment in the country.

Bihar’s unemployment rate is so high that one or two members of almost every family have migrated to other states to find jobs, he claimed.

“Nitish Kumar’s 15-year rule had been totally directionless and visionless. He failed to attract a single major investor or any industry worth mentioning. All he could offer to the young people was temporary contract jobs with exploitative fixed salaries,” Mr. Yadav alleged.

A concerted effort was needed in a planned and systematic manner to create necessary industrial infrastructure and ecosystem to attract large scale investments in the State, he said.

“If voted to power, I will take it upon myself to approach industrial houses and create confidence in them about the infrastructure and environment that will be provided by my government for them,” he said.

Rashtriya Janata Dal’s relations with Kumar turned bitter after he left the RJD-led grand alliance in July 2017 and joined hands with the BJP to form the government in Bihar.

The support extended by Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who put in a surprise appearance on Friday at the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) here, has given strength to the agitation. The indefinite protest, organised on the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, has also been replicated in several towns of the State.

The Assembly passed a resolution against the CAA last month, but the ruling Congress leaders have been conspicuous by their absence at the protest site — Shaheed Smarak — since February 1. The protesters, who received support from civil society groups, had been expecting a clear assurance from the Congress.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Gehlot said an atmosphere of “anarchy and fear” was prevailing across the country amid apprehensions about the National Population Register and the proposed National Register of Citizens . “There is no justification for spending ₹76,000 crore and creating long queues of people for preparing the NRC.

258,2020/02/16,4 children killed as school van catches fire in Punjab,"The van was a condemned one and without relevant documents: police

Four children were on Saturday burnt alive while eight others were rescued after the mini-van of a private school caught fire in Longowal town of Punjab’s Sangrur.

Twelve children were inside the van when the incident occurred on the Longowal-Sidsamachar road. The children were returning from school, said a senior official.

Eight rescued

“Today, early afternoon, a van of Simran School, Longowal, caught fire while carrying 12 children from school. While eight were rescued and are safe, four children could not be saved, who died on the spot,” Sangrur’s Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori told The Hindu.

“The van being used was reportedly a condemned one and without relevant documentation. An FIR is being lodged. Action will also be taken against transport officials, if any one is found to be involved,” he said.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered a magisterial enquiry into the incident.

Taking to Twitter, Capt. Amarinder said, “Very sad to learn of the news from Sangrur where we lost 4 children because their school van caught fire. Injured have been rushed to the hospital. DC and SSP Sangrur are on the spot and I have ordered a magisterial enquiry. Guilty will be strictly punished.”

State Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla, who is also the Sangrur MLA, said the private ‘Simran Public School’ had purchased the “very old van” on Friday. He also announced an ex gratia of ₹5 lakh to each of the victims’ families.

AAP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in State Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema demanded strict against the school and civil administration. “My condolences to the families of deceased children. I highly condemn the usage of LPG powered school van that has caused this havoc. Strict action needed against school and civil administration,” he tweeted.

Sangrur MP and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann demanded registration of murder case against school officials and owner of the van. He said the victims included a three-year-old girl who went to school for the first time.

259,2020/02/16,PWD to stabilise sinking Ridge in Shimla,"Reinforced concrete structure to be constructed in phase I of project

The State Public Works Department has chalked out a plan to stabilise sinking portions of the historic Ridge in Shimla in two phases, an official said.

The Ridge has been sinking for several months on three sides — outside Gaiety Theatre, near Lakkar Bazar and DAV School.

Shimla PWD Superintending Engineer Suresh Kapoor said the sinking portions of the Ridge will be stabilised under the Shimla Smart City project.

In phase I, the sinking portion outside Gaiety Theatre will be stabilised by constructing an RCC (reinforced cement concrete) structure at an estimated cost of ₹8 crore, Mr. Kapoor said.

“We are waiting for a technical report from IIT-Roorkee to know whether the construction of an RCC structure outside Gaiety Theatre is feasible or not,” he added. The estimated cost of constructing RCC structures under phase II will be known only after preparing designs and drawings for it, he added.

Earlier in 1980s, a similar problem was faced in the area where Padam Dev Complex is situated now. An RCC structure was constructed in 1988-89 during the tenure of first Shimla Mayor Adarsh Kumar Sood to tackle the problem.

“We created an RCC structure to stabilise the sinking portion after getting a technical report from IIT-Roorkee. A multi-storey PD commercial complex was built beneath the RCC structure for the optimum utilisation of the space. On the top, we installed a statue of late PM Indira Gandhi in 1990,” Mr. Sood said.

IIT-Roorkee roped in

IIT-Roorkee was engaged a few months ago to carry out a study to know the reasons behind the sinking Ridge and probable steps to stabilise it. It is likely to submit its report to the State government soon.

“We have already prepared the designs and drawings for phase I,” Mr. Kapoor said.

He added the work on phase I will start within a month of getting necessary approvals.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/500imq/article30832910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23PG34-COLPTI2152020000091A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pwd-to-stabilise-sinking-ridge-in-shimla/article30832911.ece
260,2020/02/16,Two landmines explode in Maoist-hit Malkangiri,"No injuries reported in the incident

Two landmines planted by Maoists exploded on the Bidarpatna-Hantalguda road in Swabhiman Anchal of Odisha’s Malkangiri district on Saturday. No injuries have been reported.

The landmine blast coincided with the visit of K. Vijay Kumar, senior Security Advisor to the Ministry of Home Affairs on Left-Wing Extremism, to Malkangiri to take note of the continuing anti-Maoist operations in the area.

Mr. Kumar reached Badapada camp of the Border Security Force in Swabhiman Anchal to discuss the future strategy against Maoists with senior police officers. Superintendents of Police of Malkangiri and Visakhapatnam and Deputy Inspector General of police, south-west range of Odisha, were present at Badapada for the review meeting.

The Maoists had reportedly planted the landmines to target the security forces. According to police sources, between 4.30 p.m. and 5 p.m., two blasts occurred when a private vehicle crossed the spot on the road where the Improvised Explosive Devices had been planted. No one was injured in the incident.

Initial investigation has hinted that the two land mines contained around five kilograms and two kilograms of explosives.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/two-landmines-explode-in-maoist-hit-malkangiri/article30832908.ece

262,2020/02/16,₹52 lakh offer tops IRMA placements,"Rural management institute sees 314 offers for 199 students

Final placements of students at the Institute of Rural Management (IRMA), Anand saw a record offer of ₹52 lakh per annum, with 199 students of post-graduate diploma in rural management programme receiving 314 job offers.

A total of 109 organisations offered jobs to students during the placement week held in December 2019. Of the total batch size of 233 students, 226 students had registered for the campus placements where one student was a sponsored candidate, and six students opted out of the campus placements.

Twenty-seven students were placed through Pre-Placement Offers (PPOs), and 199 students were placed through the campus placement process. “We received 314 job offers from 109 organisations, almost 1.8 times the number of students. We feel encouraged because 37 new organisations came to IRMA for the first time,” Professor Pratik Modi, placement coordinator at IRMA said.

The average salary offered by the business sector organisations stood at ₹10.80 lakh per annum and that for the development sector organisations like NGOs, cooperatives, and government development agencies was at ₹10.74 lakh per annum. The median salary stood at ₹10.45 lakh per annum, while the maximum salary for the batch stands at ₹52 lakh per annum.

“The minimum salary consciously chosen by our student in the development sector was ₹4.80 lakh,” Mr. Modi said. A total of 42 students took up offers made by NGOs, government agencies, and CSR foundations.

Organizations such as Vedanta Foundation, Caspian, BAIF Development Research Foundation, TVS-Srinivasan Service Trust, Government of Telangana (Dept of Panchayati Raj & Rural Development), Madhya Pradesh State Rural Livelihoods Mission, Mahatma Gandhi National Council of Rural Education, BASIX, among others, recruited through the campus placements.

As before, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul) was the largest recruiter this year too, followed by Mother Dairy. Multinational and national agribusiness corporations such as Tolaram, ITC Agribusiness Division, ADM Agro, Seedworks, Adani Wilmar, Emami Agrotech, were others who participated in the placements.

IRMA said from the FMCG and retail sectors, Reliance Retails, Future Group, Metro Cash and Carry, Ninjacart, were top recruitors. Banking, finance, and insurance companies such as ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank, Axis Bank, Fullerton, Vivriti Capital, ICICI Prudential, Bharati AXA, Reliance General Insurance, and several small finance banks also recruited from IRMA this year.

Mr. Modi said initial concerns about the job market and dip in placements seen by IRMA’s peers had been eased by 100% placements, a record in the Institute since its inception in 1979. “We are now hoping for a bigger and better placements going ahead. The unique curriculum at IRMA is an attraction. Just concluded summer internships saw 233 students of first year being placed within 3 days. Seventeen new companies took on interns by paying as high as ₹1.8 lakh for the two month internship,” Mr. Modi informed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/52-lakh-offer-tops-irma-placements/article30832240.ece
263,2020/02/16,Only skin bank in the Vidarbha region to close down,"Paucity of donations make facility at Orange City Hospital unviable

The Orange City Hospital in Nagpur, which housed the only skin bank in the Vidarbha region, has decided to shift the facility to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) since meagre skin donations made maintaining the hospital difficult.

The hospital currently has about 10,000 sq cm of donated skin preserved in the bank and as soon as it is utilised for patients, the facility will be shut down and equipment shifted to the GMCH. The hospital boasts of an advanced burns facility and recently treated the 25-year-old lecturer who was set ablaze by a stalker in Hinganghat. She, however, succumbed to her injuries on February 10.

Set up in 2016 under the guidance of the National Burns Centre in Airoli, the skin bank at Orange City Hospital received just five to six donations per year.

Expensive unit

“We are unable to maintain the bank due to scarcity of the donations. Since the government is ready to maintain the bank, we will be shifting all the equipment,” said Dr Darshan Rewanwar, chief consultant of plastic surgery and burns unit, adding that the monthly cost of just maintaining the skin bank runs up to ₹3 lakh even as it has little skin to preserve.

Burns patients suffer from severe skin damage and thus skin grafting becomes crucial to protect them from infections. “There is always a huge requirement of skin,” said Dr. Rewanwar.

Maharashtra has eight skin banks, the largest being at the National Burns Centre (NBC) in Airoli, which not only caters to the patients admitted with them but also other burns centres across the country.

Soaring demand

Plastic surgeon Sunil Keswani, who is heads the NBC said many patients are in need of skin grafts but there is not enough skin available. “For example, Mumbai records anywhere between 20 to 25 donations in a month. However, the actual requirement of the city is at least 150 donations in a month,” said Dr. Keswani.

Skin can be donated within six hours from the time of death and it is harvested from both the legs, thighs and the back. After consent for the donation is given, a skin bank team reaches the donor and harvests an extremely thin layer of skin, which consists of the epidermis and part of dermis. Experts say that the harvested skin is merely 0.4 to 0.6 mm in thickness.

“From one donor, we get about 2000 to 2500 sq cm of skin,” said Dr Keswani adding that on average, donations made by two donors get utilised for one patient requiring skin grafts.

Doctors say that lack of awareness is the main reason behind fewer skin donations, but some families aware about the concept often back out fearing disfigurement of the body. “People need to know more about the process. There is no bleeding when the skin is harvested and after the procedure is completed, the parts are bandaged carefully,” explained Dr. Keswani.

The harvested skin is collected in a solution and then taken to the skin bank where it is washed in an antiseptic and screened.

The strips of skin are then trimmed, measured, meshed and thereafter put in sterile vials containing glycerol.

Experts say that these vials can be stored for up to five years.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ldt08x/article30834192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BM-skin-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nagpur-hospital-to-close-down-skin-bank/article30832177.ece
264,2020/02/16,"There’s never an inopportune time to peak, says Unadkat","Saurashtra skipper has everyone talking about his skillset

Jaydev Unadkat has been the talk of the cricketing arena more for his whopping IPL auction price and gradual correction by Rajasthan Royals than his consistent performances in the domestic arena. However, in the last couple of months, the left-arm pacer has managed to get everyone talking about his skillset, thanks to his astounding returns in the Ranji Trophy.

Excellent tally

Despite resting for the penultimate league game against Mumbai, Unadkat finished the league stage with a tally of 51 wickets in seven games at an average of 11.90.

He has also motivated an otherwise laid-back Saurashtra outfit en route to its second successive knockouts.

He stresses that a 10-day pre-season stint with Steffan Jones, the former Rajasthan Royals pace bowling coach, worked wonders and kept him “fresh and hungry” for the long season, starting “with Duleep, one-dayers, Deodhar and the Ranji”.

He made his solitary Test appearance almost a decade ago and last featured for India’s blues in March 2018, but Unadkat is only 28.

With many pacers at India’s disposal presently, ask him if he feels he has hit peak form at an inopportune time and the lanky cricketer pauses, before giving a measured response.

“Ummm... you can’t really say that. There’s never an inopportune time to peak. I am enjoying my bowling, to say the least. I have never really felt this confident about my skills.

“It’s about what I want to do as a player in my career rather than thinking about why I am doing it now than when it was actually needed,” Unadkat told The Hindu.

Didn’t capitalise

“There were times when I got my opportunity, I didn’t capitalise on it. What I want to do now is to stretch this period — when I am confident about my skills more than ever — longer and longer. When I get my chance again, I should be ready to grab it with both hands.”

Unadkat’s optimism seems to have rubbed off on his Saurashtra teammates. After taking over the reins midway through last season, Unadkat led Saurashtra’s charge into the Ranji final.

This time around, Saurashtra made the knockouts with a league game to spare. Unadkat seems to have done the trick with his boys again, but he shies away from taking credit.

No pre-season camps

“This is one team which doesn’t really have too much of pre-season preparation, not too many pre-season camps. We don’t really have our district games in place as well (due to extended monsoon),” Unadkat said.

“Preparation-wise, only three or four of us can actually travel and prepare ourselves by playing the Duleep or Deodhar, but most of these guys don’t really get the ideal game-time.

“Still, to come into the season, soak in the pressure of First Class cricket and perform is really a great job.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/n4zco0/article30836905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17JAY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/theres-never-an-inopportune-time-to-peak-says-unadkat/article30836906.ece

266,2020/02/16,"India to play D/N Test at Adelaide, says Ganguly","BCCI chief Ganguly outlines slew of measures to protect the interests of the five-day format

Test cricket will be the top priority for Sourav Ganguly and his team of administrators in the upcoming season.

Ganguly, as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has finalised a series of measures to attract spectators to watch Test cricket.

“We will play one day-night Test in each series beginning with the one against Australia (later this year),” Ganguly told The Hindu. He confirmed Adelaide as venue for the day-night Test, one of four listed for the series in which India will also play three ODIs and three T20Is.

“I am convinced that day-night Tests is the way forward. We saw a huge turnout at the Eden Gardens (last November) against Bangladesh and I know all countries are looking to encourage this idea. We are all for it,” he stressed.

Ahmedabad will be the venue for the second day-night Test in India during England’s visit next year.

Ganguly revealed the Board’s plans to “market” Test cricket. “We have formed a committee to market Test cricket. The committee will reach out to various stakeholders and sell Test cricket to fans. There is a huge marketing potential waiting to be tapped,” he said.

End of zonal system

Ganguly insisted the Board had decided to do away with the zonal system in the selection committee.

“There won’t be any zonal representation in the National selection committee. There may be two or even three from one zone” said Ganguly. The CAC will meet this week to conduct the interviews for two slots in the senior and junior committees.

BCCI app

BCCI is also set to launch an app to interact directly with supporters of the game.

“We realise the potential that lies with our fans, majority of them being youth. The app will be launched to acknowledge the reach of social media. The app will allow fans to interact directly with the BCCI. It’s a brilliant way to stay in touch with people who respect and love the game and the players,” noted Ganguly.

269,2020/02/16,India to play day-night Test in Australia,"The decision comes a little over a month after captain Virat Kohli asserted that his team was ready to play a day-night Test anywhere in Australia.

India will play a day-night Test during their much-anticipated tour of Australia later this year, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said on Sunday.

This comes a month after captain Virat Kohli asserted that his team was ready to play a day-night Test anywhere in Australia.

“Yes, India will play a Day/Night Test in Australia. A formal announcement will be made soon,” BCCI president Sourav Ganguly told PTI.

Also Read A flop show by India batsmen

Ganguly, a former captain, also said that the second Test of the next home series against England will be a day-night affair. He added that the Board will try to have at least one day-night Test in each series moving forward.

India played their maiden day-night Test against Bangladesh last November at the Eden Gardens, winning the match quite comfortably with plenty of time to spare.

On the eve of India’s three-match ODI series opener at home against Australia last month, Kohli had said, “We’re ready and up for the challenge — whether it’s Gabba, Perth... it doesn’t matter to us. It’s become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we’re open to playing day-night Tests.”

After India’s mauling of Bangladesh in their maiden day-night Test outing in Kolkata, Ganguly had said that they “will deal as per the request” of the host Board when on tour.

India declined Australia’s offer to play a day-night Test in Adelaide in 2018-19, citing lack of experience.

However, with day-night match seen as a possible answer to Test cricket’s dwindling attendances, Australia had been hoping that India will agree to play one game at the Gabba this year.

A Cricket Australia (CA) delegation met top BCCI officials on the sidelines of a limited-overs series in January with the day-night Test figuring on the agenda.

270,2020/02/16,BCCI CEO Rahul Johri’s resignation yet to be accepted,"Rahul Johri was appointed when Shashank Manohar was BCCI president and Anurag Thakur was its secretary.

BCCI’s first chief executive officer Rahul Johri, who had tendered his resignation a while ago, might have to wait a little more before he is relieved of the plum job by the Board.

BCCI sources said on Sunday that Johri, appointed in 2016 to the then newly-formed position, had made up his mind to step down after the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) exited the scene in October last year, paving the way for the Sourav Ganguly-led team to take charge.

“Johri’s resignation will be accepted but it might take some time. He is trying to negotiate,” a source told PTI.

Since assuming the office of CEO, Johri has been working on multiple fronts, playing a key role in selling the IPL broadcast rights to Star India for a whopping ₹16,348 crore.

271,2020/02/16,"NZ vs IND warm-up match | Agarwal back among runs, Pant too finds form","The match was called off an hour after lunch with India reaching 252 for four just 48 overs into their second innings.

Mayank Agarwal found form on his birthday and Rishabh Pant mixed caution with his customary aggression as India’s warm-up fixture against New Zealand XI ended in a draw here on Sunday.

The match was called off an hour after lunch with India reaching 252 for four just 48 overs into their second innings.

Agarwal, who had gone through a wretched period since the second Test against Bangladesh, retired on 81 off 99 balls with 10 fours and three sixes to his name.

To the relief of the Indian team management, Pant played in his customary manner to reach 70 off 65 balls, but also showed discretion when the opposition bowlers were in the midst of a good spell.

There were four sixes — two each off leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and off-spinner Henry Cooper.

While Sodhi was hit down the ground, Cooper was dispatched over extra cover on a couple of occasions. He didn’t curb his aggression though; there were times when he was ready defend against the spinners and also leave some of the deliveries that the Kiwi pacers bowled.

Even though Pant is easily the better batsman compared to his senior Wriddhiman Saha, the innings might have come too late in the day considering that the latter is a better keeper and possibly a more responsible batsman in pressure situations.

The biggest positive to have emerged from the New Zealand second innings is Agarwal’s poor run coming to an end. The Seddon Park track easing out was definitely a factor but Agarwal’s footwork was more assured as he played some glorious on-drives and pull-shots off fast bowlers.

Before this game, Agarwal had played 10 competitive games including first-class, ODIs and List A matches and couldn’t cross the 40-run mark in 11 completed innings. He even bagged a pair against New Zealand A in an unofficial Test match.

Once he had got his form back, he didn’t come out to bat after lunch giving Saha an opportunity to score an unbeaten 30, his runs coming mostly against non-regular bowlers.

The Agarwal-Pant pair added 100 runs in 14.3 overs and it also helped that part-timers like Cooper was introduced into the action.

In the morning, Prithvi Shaw (39 off 31 balls) was bowled through the gate by Daryl Mitchell as the batsman left a gaping hole between his bat and pad.

Shaw, though, seemed to have done enough during his brisk 72-run stand with Agarwal, which could put an end to the debate around the opening slot even though the tracks in Wellington and Christchurch could be a test of technique for the flamboyant Mumbaikar.

It was a match that Shubman Gill would perhaps like to forget in a hurry as he was dismissed cheaply for the second time in a row. He scored 8 before Daryl Mitchell trapped him leg before.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/d9zjfh/article30835115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AGARWAL-PANT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-xi-vs-india-warm-up-match-day-3/article30835116.ece
272,2020/02/16,Chennai may not host TNPL matches this year,"The fifth edition will also see Coimbatore and Salem join as new venues, alongside Dindigul and Tirunelveli.

For the first time in five years, Chennai is unlikely to host any matches of the Tamil Nadu Premier League this year, as the association is planning to raze down and rebuild the pavilion structure after the completion of the IPL in May.

The fifth edition will also see Coimbatore and Salem join as new venues, alongside Dindigul and Tirunelveli. The Salem Cricket Foundation Stadium was recently inaugurated by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edapadi K. Palanisamy.

In the lead up to the 2011 World Cup, all the stands, barring the MCC terrace and Pavilion Terrace, were reconstructed at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium. Since then the TNCA had issues with the sealing of three new stands and renewal of its lease.

The lease was finally renewed late last year and last week, a portion of the MCC gym was razed down to give the necessary setback space which should pave way for reopening the three stands ahead of the IPL that beings in March.

Final at Tirunelveli?

It is understood Tirunelveli will host the final with Dindigul and Coimbatore possibly hosting the playoff matches.

The players draft for the fifth edition of the TNPL will be held on February 20 in Chennai. With each team retaining a maximum of three players, the eight teams will have a lot on their plates on Thursday. A team is allowed a maximum of 19 players in the squad.

Name change

Of the eight teams, two teams have changed their names and bases for this year. Tuti Patriots, which won the inaugural edition in 2016 will henceforth be called Salem Spartans, while I Dream Karaikudi Kaalai has requested permission to change its name as Tirupur Tamizhans.

Rajasthan’s resolute batting easily denied Delhi an outright victory on the last day of their concluding Ranji Trophy league engagement here on Saturday.

After resuming its second innings at 128 for two, Rajasthan reached 345 for six — a lead of 21 runs — when play was called off by mutual consent.

By virtue of taking the first innings lead of 324, Delhi gained three points and finished its campaign with 21. Rajasthan collected a point and aggregated 17. Both could not make it among the five qualifiers from Elite Groups A and B.

After they departed and skipper Ashok Menaria fell cheaply, a worried Rajasthan was rescued by Salman Khan (56 not out, 5x4, 2x6).

Delhi eventually gave up its hope of forcing an outright win once Salman and Rajesh Bishnoi added 46 runs for the unfinished seventh-wicket stand. On a surface where the bowlers failed to get much assistance, spinner Shivam Sharma finished with three wickets.

276,2020/02/16,Too many works in R.S. Puram leave residents angry,"More than a year after the Corporation started digging roads, the residents continue to suffer

Residents on T.V. Swamy Road, R.S. Puram, can heave a sigh of relief as it will not be a model road.

The Coimbatore Corporation has decided to drop the ₹44 crore project as it feels too many works are under way in R.S. Puram, that their progress is not as scheduled, the roads across the locality are damaged and that the residents are angry, says a Corporation officer familiar with the development. It is yet to make it official, though.

The Corporation has been talking since 2015 about developing D.B. Road and T.V. Swamy Road into model roads, where utility lines will have ducts, pedestrian pathways will be free of encroachments, junctions will be developed for easy movement of vehicles and pedestrians and vehicle movement will be streamlined.

The Corporation started the work in 2017 on D.B. Road. But by August that year, the Corporation saw the work stopped midway as the contractor cited insufficient funds.

This left the southern half of the D.B. Road damaged with pits, dug earth, and narrow carriageway.

After addressing the issues that arose then and floating fresh tenders, when the Corporation wanted to restart the work, it saw itself facing a tough task – how to go about executing the model road work along with the 24x7 drinking water supply project as both involved digging roads.

For, by then the Corporation had decided to start the water project first in R.S. Puram, on a pilot basis before expanding it to rest of the old city area.

After charting a course of action, when the Corporation organised the ground-breaking ceremony, it faced a new task – that of replacing the old underground sewer line on D.B. Road.

Sources familiar with the development say that Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani asked the Corporation officials to replace the old pipelines with new ones after the residents told him that the pipelines were at least 40 years old, not wide enough to carry sewage, were getting choked and that it would be difficult to replace the pipelines after the model road project.

Though this meant more time to start the model road work, the Corporation agreed to do it and reworked the course of action to complete the underground sewer work, then the water pipeline work and then take up the model road project.

On the other roads in R.S. Puram, the Corporation went about digging roads to lay the new water supply lines. This led to a situation where several roads in R.S. Puram were barricaded and dug for work, or damaged after the completion of work and saw reduced carriageway because of dug earth and dumped materials eating away road margins.

This has been the situation in R.S. Puram for over a year now, says a resident complaining, “at one point in time it became even difficult to walk on roads.”

A few months ago, when the South-West Monsoon and then the North-East Monsoon were active, the condition of the roads went from bad to worse. Roads turned slushy, pits dug for works were filled with water and minor accidents almost became an everyday occurrence, recalls the resident.

On the west of R.S. Puram, on Thadagam Road, the choked and overflowing drains only added to the residents’ woes.

It was during this period that the Corporation went slow in executing the 24x7 drinking water project. Officials familiar with the delay say that four months the work progressed at a snail’s pace as the Corporation “was told to delay execution.”

The delay has resulted in the Corporation still continuing to lay main distribution pipelines in some places when it should have completed the work by giving house service connections. In a few other places, it is yet to begin giving house service connections.

The delay in executing the work meant R.S. Puram residents having to put up with damaged roads for longer than necessary. Even today, more than a year after the Corporation started digging roads, they, the residents, continue to suffer, rues a Bashyakaralu Road resident.

The condition of the roads forced the residents to convey their displeasure to the Corporation and the powers that be. The result: the Corporation has decided to complete the water pipeline work by the end of this month or at least by the middle of March.

Meanwhile, the Corporation also rebuilt three of the damaged roads – Periasamy Road, Venkatasamy Road and Ponnurangam Road, to assuage the residents.

And, on D.B. Road the Corporation has decided to focus on completing the model road work in the southern stretch of the road for 400m, show it to the residents before proceeding with work on the rest of the road.

This is to ensure that the northern half of D.B. Road is not dug again, at least for now, the officials say.

Once it completed the water pipeline work, the Corporation plans to rebuild all damaged roads in R.S. Puram and therefore has decided to drop the model road project on T.V. Swamy Road as it does not want to open another front to draw the residents’ ire, the officials add.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/jdk7tz/article30837300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB17-DB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/too-many-works-in-rs-puram-leave-residents-angry/article30837301.ece
277,2020/02/16,Work on constructing fire lines begins in Mukurthi National Park,"Preparing for the summer and peak fire season, the forest department has begun work on construction of fire lines in the Mukurthi National Park (MNP).

Officials said that work has already been completed on “fire lines,” also known as “fire breaks,” in a portion of the park. Fire lines are described as an artificially formed break in foliage or forest cover to control the spread of wildfires by limiting the amount of combustible vegetation available.

This year, already 20 km. of fire lines have already been constructed, with another equivalent amount of fire lines to be constructed in the coming months.

“As there were fires in some areas which are most prone to wildfires last year, there will be no “cool burning” done to control the vegetation available this year,” said Deputy Director of the Mukurthi National Park, S. Senbagapriya. Cool burning is done in the national park, which is closed to tourists, in a controlled manner by artificially creating small, localised fires to limit the amount of vegetation available in any given area, meaning any fires that occur during the summer will not have any build-up of “vegetative fuel” to use to become a large, uncontrollable fire.

“We do not expect very intense fires in the park this year, due to a variety of factors, but every step is being taken to ensure that the chance of major fires affecting the park is minimised,” said another top forest department official.

The removal of invasive trees, such as wattle is also set to be stepped up in the national park. Officials said that they had noticed the spread of the trees from Kolaribetta Peak and Korakundah Forest Ranges in the Nilgiris division into the national park. As a result, sanction has been sought to remove around 20 hectares of invasive wattle trees which have encroached into MNP, officials said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/llf4uf/article30837107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB17FIRELINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/work-on-constructing-fire-lines-begins-in-mukurthi-national-park/article30837108.ece

The civic body has begun works to biomine the 4.45 lakh cubic metre of garbage accumulated in the Vendipalayam compost yard.

Municipal solid waste generated in the last 61 years is being dumped at Vairapalayam (7.4 acre) and Vendipalayam (19.45 acre) yards, which had accumulated to 0.90 lakh cubic metre and 4.45 lakh cubic metre respectively.

Frequent fire accidents, stench from waste, contamination of ground water led to frequent protests by people living near the two yards. Under the Smart City Mission projects, the civic body proposed to biomine the garbage at a total cost of ₹ 37.25 crore.

Work began at Vairapalayam in August last and is nearing completion.

Now, biomining work has begun at Vendipalayam compost yard.

The waste was first bioremediated and process is on to turn waste several times to remove stench and flies. About five tonne waste has been biomined in the plant that has a capacity to process 250 to 400 tonnes of waste a day.

Corporation officials said that the segregated sand would be used for agriculture, while the dry waste would be used as a fuel in cement factories. The entire process is expected to be completed in six months, after which the civic body would decide on putting the land to better use, officials added.

Residents in the area are heaving a sigh of relief now.

Following a request made by K. Subbarayan, Tiruppur MP, to construct mini-flyovers at four places on Salem – Kochi National Highway 544 to prevent loss of lives, the Union Ministry has asked the Secretary of Road and Highways to examine the proposal and submit a report.

In November last, the MP in a letter to Nitin Jairam Gadkari, Minister for Road, Transport and Highways, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, had said that the 340-km-long highway connects Salem and Kochi and the 43-km stretch between Chengapalli and Bhavani in Erode district catered to very high vehicle traffic, especially trucks and local vehicles, due to its proximity to Coimbatore and Tiruppur. Heavy volume of traffic led to frequent accidents as over 100 persons lost their lives last year.

The MP had sought mini-flyovers at Perundurai – Kanjikovil – Kavindapadi junction, Perundurai – Pethampalayam – Kavindapadi junction, Perundurai – Thudupathi – Makkinamkombai and Kolathupalayam – Vijayamangalam junction. He had also asked for service lanes with automatic traffic enforcement systems to prevent accidents.

280,2020/02/16,Concern over overflowing garbage bins outside government school,"Overflowing garbage bins outside the Government Higher Secondary School at Lakkapuram in Modakurichi Panchayat Union here have raised concern among students and residents.

The school is located on Muthur Road and has a strength of over 925 students. There are many houses and commercial establishments near the school. The Lakkapuram Panchayat has placed two bins in front of the school, which are used by the residents. The bins are not cleared regularly, and overflowing garbage is a regular sight for those entering and exiting the school.

“While we were taught on sanitation inside the school, the situation outside is pathetic,” a student said on condition of anonymity. He said that many residents dumped garbage outside the bins. “They do not even walk 20 metres to dump garbage inside the bins”, said another girl student, who wanted action against people dumping on the road.

“The panchayat should clear the bins regularly and levy fine on the people who dump on the road,” said V. Poovarasu of Modakurichi. Since plastic bags constitutes most of the waste, they get blown away in wind and pose threat to two-wheeler riders, he added.

A few residents said that since door-to-door collection of garbage was not regular, they had to dump garbage in bins outside the school. While the blame game by residents and conservancy workers continued, a school teacher said on condition of anonymity that bins should be relocated and strict action taken against those dumping on the road. “Piled up garbage in front of the school portrays the school in a bad light”, he said.

L.P. Salai Manickam, president of Lakkapuram Panchayat, told The Hindu that six battery-operated garbage collection vehicles have been sanctioned for the panchayat. Awareness pamphlets were distributed to people asking them to desist from using banned plastic items. He said that one-acre land has been identified for dumping garbage collected from households and establishments and added that action would be taken against people dumping garbage on the road.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lrt7u6/article30837082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER17GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/concern-over-overflowing-garbage-bins-outside-government-school/article30837083.ece
281,2020/02/16,Eight hotels in Salem get hygiene rating from FSSAI,"To ensure better compliance with food safety guidelines

People who choose restaurants based on social media reviews can now be assured of safe and better dining by checking the hygiene rating of the hotel issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.

On a scale of 1-5, food businesses are rated for the quality of food prepared and compliance with FSSAI regulations. According to Food Safety officials here, a food business operator with one star hygiene rating means the business needs urgent improvement and five star means excellent.

Officials from the Food Safety department said that seeking hygiene rating is a voluntary process and interested hotels should fill up an online self-assessment form on various requirements for the ratings. “Based on the self-assessment ratings, a third party audit agency and food safety officials will inspect the premises and conduct a gap analysis and check whether there are any areas to be improved. If the required elements are met, the food business is given hygiene ratings and if the score is 4 and above they can register to be a ‘Responsible place to eat’,” said R. Kathiravan, Designated Officer, Food Safety.

Dr.Kathiravan said that the aim of the programme was to ensure better compliance with FSSAI regulations. “The audit looks into every aspects of food handling including personal hygiene of food handlers, kitchen hygiene, water source, dining area, source of water and others,” he said. Dr. Kathiravan added that eight hotels had received ratings in the district and they were encouraging more food businesses to take up the rating as it would only help them in improving the business.

The chefs are also provided with food safety training and certification to become food safety supervisors. Karthick R., Food and Beverage Manager of Sivaraj Holiday Inn, which has received hygiene rating said that it was a welcome move and would create awareness among public about healthy dining practices.

Dr. Kathiravan said that food businesses with hygiene ratings would be constantly monitored and the ratings would be reduced if they notice any non-compliance.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hz1wxf/article30837065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA17FSSAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/eight-hotels-in-salem-get-hygiene-rating-from-fssai/article30837066.ece

A.K. Periyarmani, a social activist from Immidipalayam village near Kinathukadavu, said that the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) bus used to make four trips in a day for the past 25 years from the village. “For the past 10 days, the bus comes only once in a day at 8 a.m.,” he said.

287,2020/02/16,Israel’s national bird finds home in a nesting box in Coimbatore,"A. Seyed Rabiya and her family at Kovaipudur in the suburbs of Coimbatore have been waking up to a sharp yet distinct call of a bird for a couple of months. Little did she and her family knew that it was the tweet of Common Hoopoe (Upupa epops), the national bird of Israel which carries an onomatopoeic name for its long “oop oop oop” call.

According to Ms. Rabiya, a pair of hoopoe, which she believed as woodpecker seeing their long beak and crest, occupied one of the nest boxes the family had kept for house sparrows around six months ago.

“The nest box now used by hoopoes was earlier used by house sparrows. A pair of hoopoe chased the sparrows and occupied it. The pair left about two months later when two chicks fledged. The birds were not seen for about two months. Then came the pair which is currently using the same nest box,” says Ms. Rabiya.

After reoccupying the nest box, the pair was in harmony with many house sparrows that use other nest boxes kept in the premises of the house, which is far away from noises and a few kilometres away from the forests of Madukarai forest range.

While one of the birds, believed to be the female, remains inside the box with putting out its slender-curvy-long bill through the hole, the other bird is seen foraging through the premises of the house for food, often fanning its crest and tilting head, she says.

Hoopoe, which finds references in Egyptian mythology and sacred texts like the Quran and the Bible, is a secondary cavity nester as it uses natural cavities or cavities excavated or abandoned by other species.

According to Rajah Jayapal, senior principal scientist at Coimbatore-based Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, though hoopoe was found throughout India, the bird using a nest box was not commonly reported.

“The bird usually nests in cavities in trees, walls and spaces in places like garages. Its nest is known for strong pungent smell that keeps intruders away. The odour is generated as the droppings of chicks are not removed by parent birds unlike other birds that remove the faecal sacs of chicks, a mucous membrane that covers the feces of some nestling birds,” he says.

S. Balachandran, deputy director, Bombay Natural History Society, said hoopoe has high success rate in breeding as the pungent smell keep predators away. As he has observed seven eggs in a hoopoe nest, he adds that the bird is also known for reusing the same nest.

Wildlife photographer T.R.A. Arunthavaselvan, who has been in the field for five decades and clicked hoopoe in tree cavity, recalls that he has not seen the bird using a man-made nest.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/k4d7mk/article30834440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB16-NESTT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/israels-national-bird-finds-home-in-a-nesting-box-in-coimbatore/article30832440.ece

The works being carried out on Dr.Subbrayon Road under the Salem Smart Cities Mission are nearing completion.

The Salem Corporation has undertaken various projects for over ₹940 crore under the Smart Cities Mission. As one of its components, the civic body is redesigning and reconstructing 11 roads covering a total distance of 7.58 km in various parts of the city into smart roads at ₹37.16 crore.

The Corporation officials said that Dr.Subbrayon Road would be the first stretch to be completed under the scheme in the city.

The civic body completed underground drainage works on the 325-m road a few months ago and based on smart road concept, separate ducts for storm water, electric cables and telephone cables had been constructed here. The officials said that through the ducts the cables would be taken underground and the ducts would be covered with non-slippery marbles facilitating comfortable commute for pedestrians.

Openings would be provided at every 10 m to carry out repairs in the future thereby preventing digging of roads for such works. Bitumen would be laid here next week, the officials said.

293,2020/02/16,Avinashi Road flyover work expected to start shortly,"The four-lane flyover will start at Uppilipalayam and end near KMCH

The State Highways Department is likely to start construction works for an elevated road on Avinashi road in maximum three months.

The flyover project is one of the much-awaited infrastructure needs of the city and the State Budget has allocated ₹200 crore for the ₹1,620 crore work.

According to sources in know of the project, the 10.1 km, four-lane flyover will start at Uppilipalayam and end near KMCH. It will have eight ramps, four up and four down near Anna Statue, PSG College, Hopes College, and Nava India and five pedestrian subways. The project, which is expected to be completed in three years, will involve acquiring 20,000 sq.mt (2.15 lakh sq.ft). The main carriageway will be 17.25 metres wide and though the land acquisition is minimum, it might affect a few buildings along the proposed stretch.

On the cost front, ₹300 crore will be the amount for land acquisition and ₹700 crore for the main bridge. Another ₹500 crore will be to reconstruct or widen some of the existing bridges on Avinashi Road, construction of service roads and improvement of junctions.

The sources said the administrative sanction is expected in a week or so and the technical sanction in two weeks. The bids are likely to be invited in a month.

Efforts are on to ensure that traffic movement on the existing Avinashi Road is not affected even when the project is executed, the sources added.

K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said the road should be extended beyond Chinniyampalayam, with a ramp at Chinniyampalayam. The population and infrastructure needs of the city are on the rise and the project is one of the long-pending demands of Coimbatore. This is the first time that the city is seeing a project of such magnitude and hence, it should take into consideration the future needs too. Thanking the Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani for his continuous follow-up and ensuring the city gets the flyover, he said the suitable land acquisition compensation should be settled at the earliest so that the execution does not get delayed.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/rohwrq/article30831962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB16AVINASHIROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/avinashi-road-flyover-work-expected-to-start-shortly/article30831963.ece
294,2020/02/16,Legal issues delay Corporation’s work in Singanallur tank,"The civic body had planned to develop the lake at ₹ 12.55 crore under the Smart Cities Mission

A few days after Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani participated in the ground breaking ceremony in December to kick start work to develop the Singanallur tank under the Smart Cities Mission, the Coimbatore Corporation was served with a notice to respond to a writ petition.

The Madras High Court had issued the notice on the petition filed by Raman Kodhandapani, a resident of Villupuram district, and posted the case to February 26 for hearing. The court notice has effectively put on hold the Corporation’s project to develop the lake at ₹ 12.55 crore under the Mission.

The Corporation had proposed minimum development on the tank, which it had declared a conservation zone in August 2017.

The civic body had proposed development of the 288-acre tank's northern bund, abutting Trichy Road, construction of a watch tower, refurbishment of the boat house and natural treatment of the sewage flowing in, to keep the works at a minimum, said an official familiar with the proposal.

Unlike the other tanks that it had taken up for development under the Mission, Singanallur tank was a special case where it wanted to execute the work with the least possible disturbance to its ecology. But with the court notice, the Corporation had been unable to start the work. Or rather it did not want to start the work before the Court disposes of the case.

The officials said the petitioner Mr. Kodhandapani had earlier filed a case in April 2019 with the Corporation as a respondent. His prayer was for strict enforcement of the District Collector’s August 14, 2018 order banning fishing in the tank.

A division of Justice Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad had disposed of the petition saying that the Collector should implement his August 2018 order in letter and spirit.

The officials said they suspected the writ petition to be the handiwork of a few who seemed to wear the veil of environment activists. They seemed to have vested interest in delaying the project, which the Corporation would overcome.

One of the environment organisations working in the Singanallur tank, the Centre for Urban Biodiversity Conservation and Education, said the court case had led to unnecessary friction with the Corporation, for a few officials were under the impression that it had filed the case.

The truth was otherwise, though, as the Centre was one among the respondents in the case.

The Centre, on its part, had given a set of suggestions to the Corporation to be incorporated in the plan to develop the tank and it was under discussion.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/l6ih9e/article30831954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB16SINGANALLURTANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/legal-issues-delay-corporations-work-in-singanallur-tank/article30831955.ece
295,2020/02/16,Shaheen Bagh protesters not allowed to march to Amit Shah’s house,"Defiant Shaheen Bagh demonstrators await permission

Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters, who have been on an indefinite sit-in at Shaheen Bagh, attempted to march towards Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s residence on Sunday but soon returned after police denied them permission.

“We have been protesting here peacefully and if we go there to meet him, we will only go peacefully,” said Shakila, one of the protesters, explaining why no altercation took place between protesters and the authorities.

The march, which started at 2 p.m., went till one of the barricades, where a police contingent stopped protesters and told them that they would not be allowed to move forward as they were not granted any permission. “We were assured that our request to meet Mr. Shah would be conveyed,” Ms. Shakila said.

Shadab Azam, a volunteer, said that the local SHO had proposed that the protesters form a delegation of about 10 people who may visit Mr. Shah, but many called this untenable.

“It is a public protest, it is highly decentralised,” he explained.

“It would be easier if he [Amit Shah] comes here. If we have to meet him, then lakhs of us will have to go,” said Rahat Parveen, another volunteer, adding that the Minister would be welcomed if he chose to come to Shaheen Bagh.

The demand of the protesters remains the same since demonstrations started over two months ago.

“Tomorrow if the Supreme Court tells us to move, we will not,” said Shagufta Kausar, a protester, commenting on the hearing on Shaheen Bagh in the Supreme Court on Monday.

“If the Citizenship law is rolled back, we will all leave the protest site in a minute,” said Ms. Kausar.

R.P. Meena, DCP (South-East) said, the protesters had called for a march to Mr. Shah’s residence stating that approximately 5,000 of them will start the march at 2 p.m. for a dialogue over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

297,2020/02/16,Arvind Kejriwal extends olive branch to Centre after taking oath for third term,"AAP leader seeks Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s blessings for development of the National Capital.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal took oath as the Chief Minister of Delhi for the third time at a swearing-in ceremony held at the Ramlila Maidan grounds on Sunday. Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal administered the oath of office and secrecy at the ceremony attended by thousands of AAP supporters.

Senior AAP leaders Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Rajinder Pal Gautam and Imran Hussain were also sworn in as Ministers in the Delhi Cabinet. All six were Ministers in the previous AAP government.

Mr. Rai, who was the Labour Minister in the previous government, took oath in the name of martyrs of freedom struggle. Mr. Gautam, who held the Social Welfare portfolio in his last tenure, took oath in the name of Buddha and Mr. Hussain took oath in the name of Allah. The other three ministers took oath in the name of God.

The swearing-in ceremony, for which Mr. Kejriwal had invited all of Delhi, was turned into an occasion to thank the voters for bringing the AAP back to power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been invited to the event, did not attend.

Setting his government’s roadmap for the next five years, Mr. Kejriwal sought the Prime Minister “blessings” for fast paced development of the national capital and asserted that people may have voted for different parties, but he would work for all of them. “We have forgiven our Opposition for whatever remarks they made. I would also like to request the Opposition parties to forget what happened during the elections. I want to work together with all the parties for the development of Delhi. I want to work together with the Central government to make Delhi a world-class city.”

Striking a conciliatory political tone, the former bureaucrat the sought cooperation of his rivals in the BJP and Congress in making Delhi the “number one city”, saying he has “forgiven” them for the remarks against him during the high-octane poll campaign.

Mr. Kejriwal termed himself Delhi’s “son” and the “Chief Minister of all” people irrespective of the party they voted for. “The two crore people of the national capital are my family,” he said.

Special invitees

The AAP invited 50 people from all walks of life as special guests. The party said it was these people, whom it termed ‘Delhi ke nirmata’ (builders of Delhi) who had run Delhi in the last five years and were being acknowledged for their contribution.

Among them was Shabina Naaz, who has been working with night shelters around Chandni Chowk and Kashmiri Gate for the past five years. Ms. Naaz said, “When I got a call, I could not believe that it is really happening. I can tell you that only the AAP government can invite a person as unimportant as me.”

Another special guest was Lazwanti, a sanitation worker. She said recognising people like her shows the “affectionate nature” and the ground connect of the AAP government.

The special guests included traders, teachers, principals, labourers, advocates, engineers, doctors, sportspersons, framers and students.

The AAP chose to use the Ramlila Maidan for the third time for its swearing-in ceremony as it was the venue where the anti-corruption protest were held in 2011 which led to the formation of the party. After the Lieutenant Governor left the dais, Mr. Kejriwal addressed the gathering, expressing thanks, and said it was not his victory that was being celebrated but the victory of every Delhiite.

Mr. Kejriwal credited the people of Delhi for giving birth to a new kind of “politics of work and performance.” He listed his government’s various initiatives and defended the ‘freebies’ saying it would be a shame if he charged people for basic amenities like education and health.

The Chief Minister said that his government was often criticised for making everything free but God had made everything free in this world. “When a mother loves her child or makes a sacrifice, that love is free in the same way, Kejriwal loves his Delhiites and Delhiites love Kejriwal and this love is free. How can I charge a fee from a child in a Delhi government school.”

The new politics is “of schools, hospitals, 24-hour and cheap power supply, water, roads, women’s security, corruption-free Delhi” and is being discussed all over the country, he said.

He also said that initiatives like mohalla clinics are being replicated across the country and abroad.

“In the last five years, we have tried to develop Delhi on a fast mode and in the next five years, we will continue the same,” he said.

The AAP supremo began his address with ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’, ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ and ended it by singing ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’, in which he was joined by the crowd at the venue.

Mr. Kejriwal’s parents, wife Sunita, and daughter Harshita also attended the swearing-in ceremony.

Supporters also poured in from several states, including Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.

At least, six ‘Little Mufflermen’ dressed up in Kejriwal’s trademark winter wear and sporting a faux moustache were the cynosure of all eyes at the event.

Huge banners sporting ‘Dhanyawad Delhi’ were also put up in and around the venue and there were tight security arrangements.

Many AAP supporters said it is time for Kejriwal to go national and his next aim should be to change the country’s politics.

“The atmosphere in the whole country has turned toxic, now the AAP should work towards changing that. It is very important to clean other parts of the country,” Suman Rao, a construction worker from Bhopal, said.

299,2020/02/16,Video of police brutality in Jamia Millia Islamia library goes viral,"In a statement, Jamia Milia Islamia said the video had not been released by the university.

A video, purportedly from the CCTV footage from inside the Jamia Millia Islamia’s library, showing security personnel beating up students, has gone viral on social media.

On the night of December 15, 2019, police personnel allegedly carried out a crackdown at the Jamia Millia, following protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, including entering the university library and assaulting students studying there. Police had said they had entered the campus after miscreants, who had set buses in the vicinity on fire, took shelter inside. Students, however, had alleged that security personnel had even entered the research scholars’ section of the library and assaulted students.

The footage shared late on Saturday, shows security personnel allegedly entering the section for research scholars and hitting students with canes. In a statement, Jamia Milia Islamia said the video had not been released by the university.

The footage shared late on February 15, shows security personnel allegedly entering the section for research scholars and hitting students with canes. People sitting at desks are seen being approached by security personnel and hit with lathis and chased out of the area.

In a statement, Jamia Milia Islamia said the video had not been released by the university.

It highlighted that multiple twitter accounts were using the university’s name which was causing confusion. It also said that any communication from the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) or the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) which has been spearheading the protests against the CAA in front of the university should not be treated as official university communication.

300,2020/02/16,"Rohit’s wife killed him in frustration, says mother","Local court records her statement

Rohit Shekhar Tiwari, the son of former Uttarakhand Chief Minister N.D. Tiwari, was murdered by his wife Apoorva Shukla “in frustration when she did not succeed in her plans”, his mother told a Delhi court on Saturday.

The submission was made by Rohit’s mother Ujjwala Tiwari before Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav during recording of her statement as a prosecution witness in the murder case.

Ujjwala said that Apoorva, arrested in connection with Rohit’s murder, had married him as he was the son of the late veteran politician and she believed she would get a ticket to contest elections in Indore after marrying him.

Tense ties

Ujjwala, who was represented by advocate Tariq Nasir, further alleged that relations were tense between Rohit and his wife immediately after their marriage and that she fought with him over trivial issues.

She claimed that Apoorva allegedly pressured Rohit to not keep his mother with them at their house and get a separate bungalow for her in Delhi so that she could get her father treated here. “When she did not succeed in her plans, she [Apoorva] murdered him [Rohit] in frustration,” Ujjwala alleged.

She claimed that after Rohit’s death, Apoorva tried to stop the post-mortem proceedings. “Apoorva said what was the necessity of post-mortem. If post-mortem was conducted, how will we bathe the body with holy water,” Ujjwala said.

301,2020/02/16,Hectic preparations for AAP’s big day,"Hundreds of workers help set up the stage for AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to take oath as Chief Minister for the third time

Around 5 p.m. on Saturday, eight daily-wage workers carried a board, supported on a wooden frame about 20-feet-long and eight-feet-high, above their heads at a noisy Ramlila Maidan.

As they erected the board along one of the entry gates leading to the ground, it revealed a message: “Thank you, Delhi”, written in Hindi, next to a photo of a beaming Arvind Kejriwal.

The Aam Aadmi Party national convener will take oath as the Chief Minister of Delhi for the third time at the ground, and hundreds of workers were charged to spruce up the place for the event. “We have been working since Friday... we worked through the night also,” said Deepak Kumar, 64, from Uttar Pradesh, who was fixing another board.

Mr. Kumar said he had slept for only four hours since Friday. “I get ₹700 for a day’s work and extra ₹700 for the night shift... I also get food,” he added.

The white stage from where Mr. Kejriwal and his Cabinet will take oath on Sunday afternoon is being decorated with orange, white and yellow flowers. Facing the stage, thousands of metal chairs with green and red seats were being arranged for the event.

The chairs were divided into nine blocks for the public, which were separated by metal walls, and in one such block more than 100 AAP volunteers had assembled to take instructions for Sunday’s duty.

“If you do not come, then the programme will not succeed. It is your duty to make it a success,” an AAP worker addressed the crowd. “You have to be here at 6 a.m. and we will take your attendance and give ID cards,” he added.

Around 3,000 AAP workers will assist the police in crowd management for the event that is expected to attract a crowd of around 1 lakh people.

Apart from the nine blocks for the public, there will be one area — right in front of the main stage — for the newly elected MLAs and their families. Behind it will be another area for officials of the Delhi government.

“We always work with the police in all our events to make it a success. We want Sunday’s event to be a grand success,” said Adil Ahmad Khan, 34, an AAP leader overseeing arrangements.

Around 6 p.m., orange, yellow, and white garlands started appearing on the white walls and roof of the main stage; dozens of policemen and white gypsies continued to criss-cross the ground and labourers hurriedly carried on with their work — they had a lot of work to do before the big day.

Dinner meeting

Meanwhile, Mr. Kejriwal on Saturday called a dinner meeting of his Ministers-designate to discuss the roadmap for the development of the Capital, especially the initiatives that need to be prioritised in the coming three months.

“Hosted my Delhi Cabinet designate colleagues for dinner at my residence. Congratulated them on their victory in the election and wished them success for their terms as Ministers in the Delhi govt [sic.],” he said in a tweet.

According to party functionaries, Mr. Kejriwal also discussed the roadmap for making Delhi a global city.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/k5546n/article30832453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DERAM2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hectic-preparations-for-aaps-big-day/article30832457.ece
302,2020/02/16,COVID-19 outbreak in China takes toll on retailers at Lajpat Rai market,"With the price of products increasing following supply chain disruptions in China, buyers in the Capital are just window shopping

Usually brimming with shoppers, particularly on a weekend, the popular electronics wholesale market in Chandni Chowk — Lajpat Rai market — wore a forlorn look on Saturday. The retailers here have begun to feel the pinch as demand has nosedived due to increasing prices of products such as mobile phones, speakers, and televisions, following supply chain disruptions in China as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Shahid Ansari, one of the retailers at the Lajpat Rai market, said prices across all the products have gone up, which has directly affected the demand.

“The impact on business is now very much visible. We open shops at 10 a.m., and it is usually only by 2-3 p.m. that we are able to make our first sale,” said Mr. Ansari, who sells a range of electronic items, mainly from China, including speakers, hair straighteners, electric kettle, fans and tripods.

For accessories such as mobile phone covers and tempered glass, the price hike is in the range of ₹25-50, while for speakers it goes up to about ₹50-₹500 depending on the size, and for Chinese TVs, it is ₹1,000 onwards. Another shopkeeper in the area, Eshaan Siddiqui, said almost all phone accessories come from China and with the price increase, buyers are just window shopping.

With anticipated shortage of products, the dealers have increased prices, forcing retailers to pass on the cost to the buyers. “We buy products from distributors but they are releasing very limited stocks thinking about possible shortage in the future so that is impacting the prices,” Mr. Siddiqui added.

India is heavily dependent on China to meet its requirements for electronic goods. India’s electronics industry imported over $20 billion worth of items from China in 2018-19.

Harish Bhasin who deals in wholesale LED TVs said price for a ₹5,000 TV has gone up by ₹1,000. “So now customers are delaying purchase. Until a couple of weeks ago, we used to sell four-five TV units in a day... we are not even selling one unit a day now,” he said.

Wait and watch mode

While the situation is not as bad for bigger retailers and brands yet, they are in a wait and watch mode. Harpreet Kohli, owner of Kay Dee Electronics, Noida, said while there has been no official communication, all major mobile phone and television brands have indicated that there is uncertainty with regard to supply chain. “If the situation does not improve soon, we have been told that supply for products such as LEDs could be impacted by as much as 50%. With the summer season approaching, AC supply and sales could be hit too,” Mr. Kohli said.

However, given that India largely has a good manufacturing eco-system refrigerators and washing machines, should not feel any negative impact of the situation, he added.

Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association president Kamal Nandi said as of today he doesn’t see much impact of supply chain disruption till March. “If manufacturing activity does not get streamlined by end of this month, then we will see production constraints as a lot of components and even some finished goods come from China, said Mr. Nandi who is also executive vice-president & Business Head, Godrej Appliances. The supply for ACs could be badly hit as most compressors are imported from China, along with microwave ovens which many manufacturers import as finished good from China, he said.

An industry representative who did not want to named said that LED TVs sales are generally low in January-March quarter mainly as it follows a buying (festive) season. This has further been aggravated. “So a lesser demand might mitigate some impact or pressure on any supply chain.”

Smartphones segment, however, is likely to see lower sales and increase in prices due to heavy reliance on components from China. For a smartphone enthusiast, this may even mean a delay in new device launches by various companies.

“Xiaomi has already increased the price of Note 8 Pro device by about ₹500. Usually, prices of old smartphone models drop as newer models arrive. But this is not happening now because there is a shortage of supply. There has been no formal communication, but almost all companies have indicated that due to a shutdown in China, supply chain constraints may continue. We are also seeing an increase in prices of accessories such as headphones, speakers, phone covers etc.,” said Arvinder Khurana, president of All India Mobile Retailers Association.

He added that earlier there was a smooth supply of iPhone 11, but now the allocation (by distributors) is being rationed.

Exploring channels

A Xiaomi spokesperson said, “The extended shutdown in China is likely to have an impact on our supply chain and, there is a risk of impact on overall quantum of component supplies. While we are working to explore alternative supply channels for components and raw materials, the immediate impact is that the short supply might cause some negative pressure on prices of these components.”

However, another Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has said that it may not immediately hike prices of its handsets in India.

Additionally, market research agency Counterpoint estimates a 10%-12% decline in smartphone sales in January-March 2020 in India due to COVID-19 outbreak.

“This is likely to have an impact on Q2 also. Assuming situation will start getting better in March, we expect impact on new launches to be pushed by at least 4-5 weeks and the ones which are being launched will have limited stock,” Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint Research said.

“If the virus is contained in March it will still take two months for commercial activities to normalise in China,” Mr. Pathak added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/82ifyh/article30832422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DELPRIYALAJPATRAIMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-outbreak-in-china-takes-toll-on-retailers-at-lajpat-rai-market/article30832424.ece
303,2020/02/16,Fire breaks out in basement of luxury hotel; case registered,"Blaze broke out due to short circuit, say police

A fire broke out in the basement of The Park hotel here on Saturday morning following which 12 people, including 11 foreign nationals, were taken to a hospital, said officials. Nine of them were released after first aid, they said.

The incident happened at 9 a.m., said Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav. However, the fire department said they were informed about the incident by the police at 12.25 p.m. after which five fire tenders were rushed to the spot.

The blaze was brought under control by the hotel staff with the help of fire extinguishers before the fire tenders reached the spot, a senior official said. But the smoke had engulfed the building, he said, adding that none of the people staying at the hotel suffered any serious injuries.

The police said they were not informed about the incident by the hotel management. “The police were informed about the incident by the hospital [Ganga Ram Hospital] at 11.45 a.m. from Rajinder Nagar police station,” Mr. Yadav said.

The Park said they are “deeply concerned about the incident that took place at the basement of the hotel this morning” and that “safety has always been our top priority”. Norwegian nationals — Abdi Bhasir and Joshim Kvan — were admitted to the hospital after they suffered breathing difficulties along with 30-year-old Kundan Rai, who suffered minor injuries.

The police said the fire started from the hotel basement due to a short circuit when a generator was being tested. A case under Section 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 337 (causing hurt by act of endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC has been registered.

A statement by The Park hotel read: “There was a short circuit that lead to a minor fire, however, the situation was quickly normalised by our in-house crisis management team. Some of our guests were exposed to smoke and were sent for a thorough check up to the hospital...An investigation has been initiated to get to the bottom of the incident to ensure we can take measures to avoid a similar situation in future.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jqgqol/article30834160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DELPRIYATHEPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fire-breaks-out-in-basement-of-luxury-hotel-case-registered/article30832406.ece

A group of people, including students of Jamia Millia Islamia, held a demonstration near Tamil Nadu House on Saturday protesting against the alleged lathicharge by the Chennai police on anti-CAA demonstrators.

The police said all of the protesters were released by 6 p.m. The small group of protesters, which also included a couple of young women, tried to march from Bihar Bhawan towards Tamil Nadu House, and raised anti-BJP and anti-RSS slogans in Tamil.

The protesters were detained halfway as they tried to march towards Tamil Nadu House in Chanakyapuri, the police said. Later, a few more people, including women, were also detained.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said 27 protesters were detained and taken to a nearby police station.

Out of them, seven protesters were women, he said, adding all of them were released later.

The call for the protest was organised by the Jamia Coordination Committee.

An anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest turned violent in Chennai on Friday when a clash broke out between protesters and the police.

Four police personnel — a woman joint commissioner, two women constables and a sub-inspector — were injured in a stone throwing incident at the rally, the police said, even as reports emerged that some protesters were also hurt.

305,2020/02/16,When obsession turns a police officer into a criminal,"In the Patparganj murder case, accused met SI on matrimonial site, families agree to match, but what went wrong? Sociology prof. blames case on patriarchal mindset

As a computer engineer, 28-year-old Priti Ahlawat from Rohtak had ample opportunities for a lucrative job. But her love for the uniform drew her towards joining the Delhi Police as a Sub-Inspector.

Coming from a family with a long tradition of serving in the Central Armed Police Forces, her fascination for the uniform was not misplaced either. However, little did anyone knew that her path will be crossed with an “obsessive” colleague who would take her life.

The murder and suicide

On February 7, Priti was shot twice in the head point-blank by her colleague, an SI, outside Rohini East metro station. She had come across the accused through a matrimonial site barely a year before the incident. A few hours after the incident, the accused from Sonipat was found dead inside his car on February 8 early morning.

The man had shot himself with his service revolver.

“Though batchmates, having joined the Delhi Police in March 2018, the two never met during the training period. It was in April last year that the man approached Priti after seeing her profile on the site and expressed his interest in a match. She spoke with her parents about his proposal, and though both belonged to the Jat community, there still was a little hurdle regarding gotras,” said Priti uncle Kalyan Ahlawat, a Gururgam-based advocate, who quit Air Force after a brief stint more than a decade ago.

Due to the things in common between the duo — the same workplace, came from families with good social standings and engineering backgrounds — , Priti’s family agreed to the proposal and was even ready to overlook the “social hurdle”. The families gave their consent for the two to meet and know each other. Meanwhile, Priti’s family met the accused’s father in September last and decided to take it forward.

‘A control freak’

However, Priti began to face issues with the accused’s behaviour and told her parents that he was “too possessive” and a “control-freak”.

“Involved in the investigation of grim crime cases such as rape, Priti, who posted at Patparganj police station, would often get late at work and usually some male officers would accompany her to her rented accommodation in Rohini. But the accused seemed to have an issue with this and would often tell her that they both would quit their jobs after marriage. But Priti was happy with her job and told us that he had ego issues,” said Mr. Ahlawat.

Gradually, Priti began to avoid him, who according to his colleagues would often remain absent from his work at Bhajanpur police station to visit her at Patparganj. Meanwhile, the woman’s parents told the police officer’s family in November that they were not interested in the match.

However, the officer called up Priti’s elder brother Anand, a software engineer in New Zealand, on a few occasions to apologise for his behaviour and asking him to clear the misunderstandings.

But Priti had made up her mind and blocked him from all social media sites. As per the investigation officer in the case, the two spoke over the phone on January 3 for the last time.

When he continued to stalk her, Priti’s family met his father, ex-SI in Haryana Police, on January 15 at his residence in Shastri Nagar regarding the matter. They told his father to tell his son not to harass Priti. Mr. Ahlawat said it was their last contact with his family before the tragedy.

A national Taekwondo player and an ace dancer, Priti, M. Tech in Computer Science from Rohtak’s Baba Mastnath University, had appeared at Service Selection Board for Armed Forces and also selected as Sub-Inspector in Central Reserve Police Force before she joined the Delhi Police.

“Both her father and grandfather had served in the BSF. She too had fascination for the stars on the uniform. Though happy with her present job, she would sometimes talk about taking Union Public Service Commission exam as well, but not interested in a corporate job,” says Mr. Ahlawat. Her school friends described as her “ambitious” and “friendly”.

The accused, a mechanical engineer, had quit five government jobs to settle for Sub-Inspector in Delhi Police. But he was expecting an appointment letter from the Income Tax Department as Tax Assistant in the next few months and mulling to leave his present job. His batchmates remembered him as a “loner” who would not socialise much. He had stress-related issues as well during the training and had to be counselled thrice.

Former MDU Sociology professor Jitender Prasad blamed the incident and similar such cases on the upbringing of the children in North Indian society, especially Haryana, with a patriarchal mindset where the woman is not allowed to have a free will and the man’s ego was too fragile to take no from her.

“With the women stepping out of their houses to work, they want to exercise their newfound economic freedom and live life on their own terms, but the men still want to control them and hold them back. It often leads to friction and hurts the male’s ego leading to crimes,” said Mr. Prasad.

306,2020/02/16,Housing organisation told to pay over ₹6L compensation,"‘Complainant paid 90% of the cost of flat’

A District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum here has directed the Central Government Employees Welfare Housing Organisation to compensate a complainant by paying over ₹6 lakh for canceling the allotment to a flat despite the latter having paid 90% of the total cost.

‘No unit available’

The panel said: “The cancellation was not warranted after receipt of amount of 90% of the total cost of the flat. Since the counsel for the opposite party has categorically argued that the said scheme had already been closed and no unit or flat is available, therefore we hold the OP to be deficient in service and adopting unfair trade practice.”

The organisation had however contended that while it had received ₹5.74 lakh for the flat, the allotment was canceled for “non-payment of outstanding amount.”

However, dismissing contentions put forth by the opposite party, the Bench directed compensation of ₹5.74 lakh to be paid to the complainant at an interest of 10% from January 2006 till the date of realisation.

The consumer panel added that an amount of ₹15,000 was to be paid to the complainant as cost towards litigation and “mental tension.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/housing-organisation-told-to-pay-over-6l-compensation/article30832280.ece
307,2020/02/16,‘India is ageing much faster than previously thought’,"Dr. Chatterjee of AIIMS explains in his book how people look at the growth of older adults which impacts society

“India is ageing much faster than previously thought and is expected to have nearly 20% population of the world’s 60 years and above by 2050 with the largest number of older adults in the world,” said Prasun Chatterjee, Department of Geriatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

Speaking about his new book — Health and Well Being in Late Life — Dr. Chatterjee said: “Through my book, I have tried to help people look at this tremendous growth of older adults which impacts nearly all sectors of the society from finance to social protection and family structures to intergenerational ties, in addition to humongous cost of complex health-related problems..”

He cautioned that the existing health system for the elderly is not commensurate with the felt-needs, especially to actively screen and manage various age-related complex health problems like fall, frailty, dementia and multi morbidity. “There is no mechanism to prevent and deal with 21st centuries menacing health problems like dementia and loneliness,” he said.

Currently six medical institutes — AIIMS, New Delhi; Madras Medical College, Chennai; Christian Medical College, Vellore; Amrita Institute of Medical Science, Kochi; Mahatma Gandhi Medical College, Pune and Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi provide postgraduate training in geriatric medicine.

Active ageing

Despite this, unlike many other developed nations, preparation for active ageing is not a priority in India, said Dr. Chatterjee. He noted that ageing population could be a demographic dividend but due to non-preparation the dependency ratio would increase exponentially. Furthermore, a pragmatic solution to make our senior citizens be active in late life is yet to be discussed in our country.

As per World Population Ageing Report by UN, older adults aged 65 and above would be expected to be more than the children aged 5 years or less the by end of 2019. In India, geriatric health care is changing with national programme for the Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE) being in process of implementation across the country.

“The objective is to provide easy access to promotional, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services to the elderly through community based primary healthcare approach, capacity building of the medical and paramedical professionals as well as the care-takers within the family. The book lets the reader understand how old age-related problems exist and can be positively tackled through clinical and non-clinical means,” the doctor concluded.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wew40c/article30832269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15OLDISGOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/india-is-ageing-much-faster-than-previously-thought/article30832270.ece

Following a plea seeking removal of encroachment from a parcel of land in Noida, the National Green Tribunal has directed the District Magistrate of GautamBuddha Nagar to provide police assistance for the same.

A Bench headed by NGT judicial member Justice Raghuvendra S. Rathore observed: “This is rather surprising that in a matter of removal of encroachment, the District Magistrate does not take steps at the relevant time.”

The observations came after the green panel was informed that the District Magistrate had expressed inability to provide such assistance when approached by the Noida Authority.

“In view of the above, we direct the District Magistrate, GautamBuddha Nagar to provide adequate police assistance or any other help required by the Noida Authority for removal of encroachments completely. In case need arises, the DM may approach the higher authorities and get adequate force immediately and ensure that encroachments are removed,” the Bench, also comprising of NGT expert member Justice Satyawan Singh Garbyal, said.

309,2020/02/16,Controlling everything,"The Vishnu Sahasranama is a praise of Lord Vishnu through a thousand of His names. But, the first name is not Vishnu. It is Visvam — which means He is complete in every respect, having no deficiency whatsoever. He is perfection embodied. Visvam indicates totality. Those who recite this nama of the Lord will lack nothing in their lives, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse.

The second name is Vishnu, which indicates His all pervasiveness. The third name is vasatkArah. Sankara Bhagavadpada explains this with reference to yagas. When a yaga is performed, the Vedic pandits say, “vasat.” It is Lord Narayana who is addressed as ‘vasat.’ So He is vasatkArah, says Bhagavadpada. Satyasanda Teertha explains the name as meaning the One who is in possession of six auspicious qualities, namely jnana, bala, aiswarya, virya, sakti and tejas.

According to Parasara Bhatta, vasatkArah means the One who makes everything go according to His plans. He is in control of everything. The Lord directs how everything takes place, and this is seen in an episode in the Mahabharata. Krishna is going to meet the Kauravas as a messenger of the Pandavas, and the Kauravas and their advisers discuss how to welcome Him. Duryodhana says not only should Krishna not be welcomed, but should be treated disrespectfully. He also wants the others to follow his treatment of Krishna. Krishna arrives, and Duryodhana is the first to welcome Him! He does not even realise he is welcoming the Lord. So, although he wanted to insult Krishna, he ends up receiving Him warmly. The Lord ensures that Duryodhana is unable to carry out his plan. This shows that no matter what plans we make, it is ultimately His plans which will prevail. So clearly, He is vasatkArah — the One in charge always.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/controlling-everything/article30837229.ece
310,2020/02/16,Trains to chug into Gajwel soon,"SCR starts engine trials between Manoharabad and Gajwel, a precursor to safety trial runs

Train connectivity to Gajwel, constituency of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, is within the horizon as the South Central Railway (SCR) has started conducting ‘engine trials’ between the 32-km Manoharabad and Gajwel stretch.

This exercise is a precursor for the Commissioner of Rail Safety to take up safety trial runs and once he gives his clearance, it opens up the scope for railways to extend train services up to Gajwel providing a cheaper, safer, faster and eco-friendly public transport system for passengers and cargo, point out senior railway officers.

The virgin line is actually the first phase of the 151.40-km Manoharabad-Kothapalli project estimated to cost about ₹1,200 crore as on 2016 with the Telangana government accepting responsibility to foot one-third of the cost and provide land free for the project.

It has also offered to pay annuity for up to five years of commissioning the railway line where it will foot the cost of operations.

Link to Sircilla, Siddipet

Once the entire route is completed, it will connect Sircilla and Siddipet too, the constituencies of IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao and Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, resepctively. The work is obviously behind schedule — the Gajwel railway line was supposed to have been completed at least two years ago.

Delays are attributed to land acquisition, diversion of crossing of national highway, diversion of Mission Bhagiratha pipelines, etc. SCR had spent ₹240 crore including State government’s share of ₹60 crore and the latter is yet to pay another ₹70 crore for constructing four major bridges, 46 minor bridges and six road over/under bridges on the route.

A total of 220 acres was acquired for the work with new station buildings coming up at Manoharabad, Nacharam and Gajwel for the section along with modern electrification and signalling system.

SCR officials aver that the remaining sections between 33 km Gajwel-Duddeda, 15 km Duddeda - Siddipet and 38.60 km Siricilla-Kothapalli can be completed within the next four to five years if the land acquisition process is completed and the funds are released on time as there is bound to be cost escalation too.

An art exhibition of selected cartoons, paintings and pencil sketches on the life of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was inaugurated at the Art Gallery in Madhapur here by Labour Minister C. Malla Reddy on Sunday, the eve of the leader’s 66th birthday.

The exhibition displaying rare moments in the public life of Mr. Rao has captured the attention of visitors. Speaking after inaugurating the exhibition organised by party leader Manne Krishank, Mr. Malla Reddy appreciated the artists for their affection towards the Chief Minister.

Stating that people were celebrating his birthday like they would of a family member, he said the sketches were inspiring and looked lively. He appealed to people to plant saplings on Mr. Rao’s birthday and also nurture them. On the lines of leading a successful people’s movement for statehood for 14 years, Mr. Rao has been working on the progress of Telangana in mission mode for the past six years, Mr. Malla Reddy said.

Mr. Krishank said the best cartoons, paintings and pencil sketches of several artists were selected by curator Ramana Reddy for the exhibition. Every moment in the Telangana movement led by Mr. Rao was sweet memory for people.

Chairman of the Telangana State Technology Services Rakesh Chirumilla said the villages across Telangana were enveloped in green with cultivation of crops, thanks to 24-hour free power to agriculture and creation of new irrigation potential through Kaleshwaram and other projects.

Health profiling

Meanwhile, TRS in-charge for Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency Marri Rajasekhar Reddy has taken up an initiative in Medchal-Malkajgiri district by getting the health profile prepared for the students in 50 government schools and people in 14 villages on 36 parameters with the help of Veera Healthcare Solutions.

313,2020/02/16,Reader’s Mail - Hyderabad,"Morning metro

Now that all the three sections of the metro rail are operational and connect the major rail/bus terminals of the city, it would be prudent if the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) authorities introduce skeletal services from 4 a.m to 6 a.m. Considering the fact that several long distance buses/trains arrive in the city quite early in the morning, it would be of immense help to passengers to comfortably avail the services of metro rather than wait for autorickshaws and buses.

Walkers’ zone

The straight stretch of road from Kachiguda crossroads to Koti covering the main market areas of Sultan Bazar and Bade Chowdi underneath the metro line should be developed as walkers’ shopping street with plantations, streetlights and chairs on the lines of Karolbagh in Delhi and Mahatma Marg at Gangtok.

Since this shopping street is the heritage of Hyderabad, it needs to be protected and given a facelift, so that it transforms into a walkers’ zone.

This is about a recent, pleasant experience after dialling 100. On the morning of February 12, when a large tree fell across our lane completely blocking the road opposite the Jagannath temple. We were completely cut off and as the tree fell on the service electric wire, the entire power supply was cut off. However, within 10 minutes of dialling 100, we had a disaster response team at the site. They removed the tree within half hour and power was restored. Kudos!

Sporadic protests broke out in different parts of the city on Sunday against CAA, NRC and NPR. The protests took place after city police reportedly rejected a permission application by the Joint Action Committee against CAA-NRC-NPR for a women’s sit-in at Dharna Chowk.

Eyewitnesses said that a large contingent of police arrived at Dharna Chowk and started clearing Indira Park of visitors. They then began to barricade the Dharna Chowk vicinity. Shops and other business establishments near Dharna Chowk downed their shutters.

Police detained JAC convenor Mohammed Mushtaq Mallik, who on Saturday encouraged women to protest near their houses. Protests were also seen at Chandrayangutta, where a large number of people carrying the tricolour and anti-CAA, NRC, NPR banners converged.

316,2020/02/16,GHMC for global tenders to set up leachate treatment plant,"Civic body has sought a go-ahead from the government in this regard

In order to find a permanent solution to the legacy leachate problem at the Jawahar Nagar dump site, which has turned into an albatross around its neck, the GHMC has sought a go-ahead from the government to invite global tenders for a leachate treatment plant.

A letter has been addressed to the government in this regard, seeking constitution of a committee to process its proposal for calling for Expression of Interest and Request for Proposal for appropriate and cost-effective technologies to treat about six lakh kilolitres of legacy leachate.

Legacy leachate is the seepage from close to 14 million tonnes of dump at Jawahar Nagar landfill site, which was handed over to the concessionaire firm Hyderabad Integrated Solid Waste Management under the agreement for solid waste management. While the agency could complete profiling of the refuse at the location and is progressing with its capping, seepage thick with contaminants continued to flow out of the dump. Increased in volume by the rainwater, the leachate was entering the Malkaram tank nearby and damaging crops.

In 2014, when a protest had erupted, the concessionaire created several ponds along the route for storing the leachate. As per a report by EPTRI, 5.88 lakh KL of leachate spread over 37.5 acres in a total of 12 ponds. Every monsoon, the ponds overflowed, and the leachate entered the lake. GHMC’s attempts to divert and treat the leachate at the sewage treatment plant at Nalla Cheruvu fell through as the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), which was operating the STP, allowed disposal of only 20 KL leachate per day, citing high levels of pollutants and heavy metal.

In 2017, GHMC began a pilot project to treat the legacy leachate before monsoons so that the volume is brought down in ponds. Using reverse osmosis technology, the mobile treatment plant set up by a private agency from Mumbai, functioned with 2,000 KL capacity per day. It proved insufficient to treat the entire six lakh KL leachate, as the recovery rate ranged between only 55-61%. The rest had higher concentration of contaminants left behind from the treated water, and during monsoons, its volume increased, bringing the situation back to square one.

A GHMC official informed that the plant was causing an annual drain of ₹10 crore on GHMC’s coffers, without any improvement. “Once capping of the legacy dump is done, seepage will be reduced and the concessionaire is installing a treatment plant with 500 KL capacity to treat it. However, the legacy leachate still remains,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ghmc-for-global-tenders-to-set-up-leachate-treatment-plant/article30837243.ece
317,2020/02/16,Traffic and road safety issues take centre stage at city convergence meeting,"GHMC chief raises need for signboards on speed limits to minimise accidents

GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar has asked Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) officials to complete road and footpath restoration works and development of central medians and hand them over to GHMC on the recently-launched stretch between Jubilee Bus Station and Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station.

Addressing the monthly city convergence meeting on Saturday, Mr. Lokesh Kumar also asked the officials to provide signboards indicating speed limits on various road stretches to minimise accidents. Most roads are suitable only for 40 km per hour speed, he noted.

He asked for all road cutting proposals to be submitted to private agencies carrying out the maintenance works, and directed various departments to circulate the proposals among themselves so that other utilities are not disturbed.

Police officials who attended the meeting said in 31% of deaths due to accidents, the victims are pedestrians, and asked HMR officials to raise the height of central median grills to prevent pedestrians from crossing over to the other side of the road.

The Commissioner asked officials to complete illumination of dark spots by February 29.

On housing front, he has asked for data on allotment of houses under various schemes such as JNNURM and VAMBAY since 2000, to eliminate duplication. Issues pertaining to shifting of electric poles and improvement of footpath also came up for discussion. As did notification of parking places at metro rail stations.

318,2020/02/16,Kishan Reddy regrets skipping Metro inauguration,"‘Invitation extended to me at the eleventh hour’

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy on Saturday regretted that he could not attend the inauguration of the JBS-MGBS corridor of the Metro rail project by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on February 7 because the invitation was extended to him at the eleventh hour.

Reviewing the utilisation of Central funds in the project with Metro authorities on Saturday, Mr. Reddy informed officials that he was informed about the opening of the corridor by Animal Husbandry Minister T. Srinivas Yadav just a day before the programme. But, Mr. Reddy said that he expressed his inability to attend as Parliament was in session and the BJP had issued a whip to all its MPs to be present for the proceedings without fail.

Present at the meeting were L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) MD and CEO K.V.B. Reddy, project director M.P. Naidu, COO Anil Kumar Saini and chief project manager Anand Mohan.

A release said Mr. Reddy informed officials that the Centre had already released ₹1,200 crore out of ₹1,458 crore that it had allotted. He demanded the officials to extend the corridor up to Falaknuma as indicated in the DPR. The extension should connect not only Falaknuma but other tourist places enroute.

After the meeting, Mr. Reddy, BJP State president K. Laxman and party MLC N. Ramchander Rao travelled by a Metro train from JBS to MGBS. He bought a ticket for himself and inspected the console in the train driver’s cabin at the destination. He addressed the media when he criticised MA&UD Minister K.T. Rama Rao for levelling false charges that the Centre was not giving money to the State. Mr. Laxman said that MIM prevented execution of the Metro rail project in Old City.

In his response later, Mr. Srinivas Yadav issued a release saying that he invited Mr. Reddy over the phone after learning about the programme from Metro authorities. The programme was fixed for February 7 at the instance of Metro officials because they were unavailable for the next 25 days for a foreign tour. Nevertheless, there was no protocol violation for Mr. Reddy because his name figured in the marble engraving for the occasion immediately after CM.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/jjabss/article30832212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KISAN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kishan-reddy-regrets-skipping-metro-inauguration/article30832193.ece

320,2020/02/16,Scribes share daily reporting challenges,"Workshop on protocols for reporting on women and children’s issues held

At a workshop on protocols for reporting on women and children’s issues, journalists shared their experiences and opinions on challenges they face. “We need to report these issues with sensitivity and responsibility. It isn’t enough that we have protocols,” said broadcast journalist from city Uma Sudhir.

A booklet on the protocol to be followed by TV and print journalists was released. Journalists shared challenges they face in reporting when they are hamstrung by laws prohibiting release of information that can lead to identification of minor victims.

In a case involving schoolchildren in Bidar, where a woman and her child have been booked for sedition, even the name of the school has not been released leading to under-reporting of the issue.

“The difference in reporting can be seen in the Disha case and another case in Warangal, where a similar crime was perpetrated. As the name and details of Disha were released in the initial stage, it drew a lot of attention while the case from Warangal was ignored,” said Ms. Sudhir.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scribes-share-daily-reporting-challenges/article30832157.ece
321,2020/02/16,Lower cost of credit key to more exports,"Urgent need to provide finance to exporters at an affordable cost: industrialist

Veteran industrialist from Hyderabad Mahesh K. Desai, who is set to become the next chairman of EEPC India (formerly Engineering Export Promotion Council), said that it is imperative to reduce the cost of credit for exporters.

“There is an urgent need to provide credit and finance to exporting community at an affordable cost. If not at par with London Interbank Offered Rate, the [rate of interest] should be LIBOR plus 2%,” he said.

Speaking on the sidelines of an awards’ distribution function, the export promotion body had organised here recently, he sought to underscore how reduction in the cost of credit would be helpful in the present, globally challenging times for trade. It is also important as India is eyeing to double engineering exports in the next five years and touch $200 billion by 2030.

Higher cost of finance is bound to impact the competitiveness of exporters. The government can support with concessional finance for import of machinery or lower the duties for such imports.

A delegation of exporters that had recently met the Commerce Minister and highlighted the issue was assured by the latter that the government will look into their plea, he added.

While cost of credit remains important, there also are other measures required for accelerating the pace of engineering exports, including exporters enhancing their efforts and adoption of latest technologies such as Artificial Intelligence at the manufacturing centres.

Mr. Desai, who is likely to take charge next month as EEPC India chairman for two years, said that he would be the first resident of south India to do so.

The Council, coming under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, was set up in 1955. A lot of ground has been covered from engineering exports of $10 million then to around $80 billion now, he said.

As the exporters set out to achieve new targets, including contributing to India’s share in global trade growing from 2% to 5%, the need for engineering exporters is to “move from traditional items to value added items.”

The opening up of the defence and avionics sector, particularly defence, offered growth prospects for the exporters. Other aspects that will help push up growth is harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence. “We all have to adopt new technologies, new systems and new ways of working. We have missed the industrial revolution, and do not want to miss Industry 4.0, which includes IT and IoT. The government is very much with us,” said Mr. Desai, chairman of Meera Group.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ndyeht/article30832139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-MAHESH-EEPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lower-cost-of-credit-key-to-more-exports/article30832120.ece

326,2020/02/16,Call to revamp higher education system,"Isaac seeks ‘high-precision’ knowledge to cater to the businesses

Industries in Kerala, particularly in the information technology and tourism sectors, have grown exponentially in the past few years and surpassed the national performance, but the higher education system would have to catch up and offer “high-precision” knowledge to cater to the businesses in the State, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said on Sunday.

He was speaking on the concluding day of the Krithi International Book Fair and Knowledge Festival in the city.

Speaking of a ‘Kerala model’ of growth, Mr. Isaac said that skill and service-based industries would fare well considering the State’s human and natural resources, provided that the education system could be restructured with a focus on scientific knowledge.

He also pointed out that for the first time in a few years, the number of Malayalis returning to the State from the Gulf countries had grown over those leaving. There was a need to explore employment potential in other countries like Australia and Canada, he said.

The year’s budget had kept such changes in mind and included aspects like soft-skill training for nurses seeking jobs overseas, he said.

About the State’s continued reliance on the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the Minister said the government had financial constraints, but pressing infrastructure projects, particularly those that could boost industrial growth, had to be implemented immediately and could not be placed on the back burner.

Democracy

Speaking at an earlier session, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that Indian democracy was being challenged by the Hindutva perspective. “The notion of Indianness is being conflated with Hinduness,” he said, pointing out that the anti-CAA protests would have to continue till the government scrapped National Population Register questions on the birth place of parents, and did away with the power of officials to mark people as “dubious citizens” during the enumeration.

Wrapping up the festival, Minister for Tourism, Cooperation and Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran said that the event had turned out to be a defence against the divisive forces that seek to undermine the Constitution and damage the secular fabric of the nation.

The third edition of the festival saw around 8 lakh visitors, of which 60,000 were children. Under the ‘Book for every child’ scheme, books worth ₹1.5 crore were given away. Further, books worth ₹3 lakhs will soon be distributed to children of migrant workers.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/call-to-revamp-higher-education-system/article30836797.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has expressed anguish at the widespread use of drugs by youngsters and urged people to cooperate with the police and Excise departments to rein in the menace.

He was speaking after launching the mobile app, Yodhav, introduced by the City Police Commissionerate to enable the public to alert the police about the sale, use, transportation and distribution of drugs, here on Saturday.

Mr. Vijayan said the public could inform enforcement agencies by remaining completely anonymous. Information can be passed on to the WhatsApp number 99959-66666 while remaining unknown even to the police, he added.

The Chief Minister also launched a slew of other projects of the police in the city on the occasion, including the Cyberdome, cybercrime police station, new building of the Infopark police station, Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, and the lower subordinate quarters for police personnel. He also unveiled a model of the new police complex to be built at Marine Drive.

Mr. Vijayan said the state-of-the-art Cyberdome was aimed at protecting people from cybercriminals. Apart from identifying and pre-empting cybercrimes, the Cyberdome will create awareness about cybersecurity, he added.

Qualified officers

The cyber police station is solely meant for investigation of petitions registered under the Information Technology Act. The station will be manned by police officers trained in Information Technology. Mr. Vijayan said the station was capable of effectively probing cybercrimes, including online financial frauds.

Speedy action can now be taken against cybercrimes with the setting up of cyber police stations at Kochi, Thrissur, and Kozhikode, the Chief Minister said, adding that forensic evidence was pivotal in investigation. The Regional Forensic Science Laboratory launched here is the fourth in the State after the ones in Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, and Thrissur.

Mr. Vijayan said the government was duty-bound to ensure proper accommodation for police personnel.

In his welcome address, State Police Chief Loknath Behera said the police were also racing along the modernisation path at a time when virtual courts had become a reality.

328,2020/02/16,Eloor fire station reels under acute staff crunch,"It had to handle 54 fire breakouts in less than two months

Fire and rescue personnel at Eloor rarely have had a breathing space since the dawn of the New Year, with the force having been called up to attend to as many as 54 incidents of fire breakouts in less than two months.

This was in addition to around 11 water-related incidents, which claimed two lives, including that of a two-year-old boy who drowned in a well, during the same period.

The latest incidents of fire breakouts were reported on Saturday morning when waste and dry grass caught fire along the national highway near Apollo Tyres at Kalamassery and Edappally flyover.

Temperature soars

With the ambient temperature soaring, even a speck of fire triggers fire breakouts over large swathes of area as was reported a couple of weeks ago in an area spread over 10 acres near the old fire and rescue station.

“Container Terminal Road has emerged as a particularly vulnerable stretch accounting for an average of two fire incidents daily,” said T.B. Ramakrishnan, station officer, Eloor.

The extremely dry grass along its side has turned Container Terminal Road a powder keg, while the illegally parked trucks along the stretch face the prospects of going up in flames in any of these frequent fire breakouts.

Further worsening the threat perception is the practice of roadside cooking by truck workers, especially from other States. Not to mention the disruption of traffic along the area by smoke billowing out following fire incidents.

Indifference

“Notwithstanding frequent awareness programmes, people continue to be largely insensitive to fire breakouts and keep on setting fire to waste and dump cigarette butts, which could easily trigger a fire,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said.

Despite set bang in the middle of an industrial area with factories dealing in hazardous chemicals and being a major storage and transit point for tonnes of such chemicals, the Eloor fire and rescue station remains woefully understaffed.

Though the station should ideally have 24 fire and rescue officers, previously known as firemen, considering the workload, it has an allotted sanction strength of just 12.

Of them, three are undergoing training and are likely to join only in the coming months, while another has been assigned the job of writer, leaving the station effectively with just eight firefighters.

Count out those on leave or off and those in different shifts, and the station mostly has to do with just about two firefighters at any given time.

A nightmare

In place of a minimum of five drivers needed, the station has to do with just three, out of whom just one would be on duty at a time, making multiple fire breakouts a nightmare of the station.

Though the station has the service of nine home guards, mostly retired firemen, they could hardly be burdened with the same workload as those on the rolls.

And, making matters worse during a period of frequent fire breakouts is the difficulty in getting fuel bills cleared.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/eh84x3/article30832271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-KI-FIREjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/eloor-fire-station-reels-under-acute-staff-crunch/article30832272.ece
329,2020/02/16,Over 350 animals affected by lumpy skin disease,"Milk production unlikely to be hit significantly, say officials

Farmers and veterinary doctors in the district are heaving a sigh of relief with the viral lumpy skin disease among cattle beginning to subside. As the disease has come under control, milk production is unlikely to be hit significantly.

A senior Veterinary Department official said that there were 359 confirmed cases of lumpy skin disease in the district till Saturday, but the intensity of its spread was showing signs of slackening.

According to the official, vaccination has been intensified. Nearly 2,000 animals have been vaccinated, and 20,000 doses of vaccines had arrived in the district last week.

It will be possible to vaccinate all vulnerable animals in a short span, the official said.

The disease has been confirmed in animals in Kothamangalam, Varappetty, Nellikkuzhy, Mookkannoor, Pothanikkad, Kuttampuzha, Kizhakkambalam, Rayamangalam, Chellanam, Pindimana, and Maneed.

The first symptoms of the disease were noticeable in the last week of January. Some cases were reported on January 24. However, the disease was confirmed only in early February. Though the disease has not led to high mortality rate, morbidity could hit milk production.

Meanwhile, Milma officials claimed that lumpy skin disease had resulted in a drop in milk production. The cooperative had reported a shortfall in milk production across the State. The situation had been compounded by the inability of the cooperative to source milk from neighbouring States like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where supplies were held up due to high prices. Milma chairman P.A. Balan had said the procurement was around 11.5 to 12 lakh litres a day, whereas the actual requirement was around 13 lakh litres a day. The Kozhikode region is showing some surplus production, while Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram regions are running short on milk production.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/over-350-animals-affected-by-lumpy-skin-disease/article30832238.ece

Little KITEs experimented with Internet of Things (IoT) devices as part of a two-day camp organised by the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) for developing the skills of schoolchildren in advanced computer technologies, here on Saturday.

Over 100 students (Little KITEs) from schools in Ernakulam were exposed to making IoT devices and 3D character modelling using free and open software solution during the camp held at the Regional Resource Centre under KITE in the city.

Students received training in mobile app development (torch app, QR code scanner) and electronic voting machines using Raspberry Pi board. They were also taught Python programming for creating coding for electronic voting machines and IoT device models.

The students made sensor-driven alarms, electronic voting machines, 3D animation of solar system, and 3D models of home equipment during the camp. The participants will get an opportunity to attend the State-level training programme soon, according to an official release issued here.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qudft8/article30832155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-KI-KITEjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/little-kites-day-out-with-internet-of-things/article30832156.ece
331,2020/02/16,Call for sustained struggle to protect democratic values,"Kerala drew nation’s attention by putting up united fight against CAA, says CM

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has reiterated his call for continued fight to protect the democratic and secular values of the country. He said the youth had set an example in this, and that a united fight for the values of the Constitution must continue.

Mr. Vijayan recalled that Kerala had drawn the attention of the entire nation by putting up a united fight against the move to impose religious bias on granting citizenship. Though some did not like the united fight, the efforts must continue, he said.

The Chief Minister was inaugurating a session on ‘Challenges faced by Indian democracy’ here on Saturday. The session was held as part of the ongoing Krithi International Book Festival here.

The State government had made it clear that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would not be implemented in Kerala. The State will participate in Census operations, but it will not be part of the National Population Register preparation, he added.

Mr. Vijayan said the attack on students on the JNU campus in Delhi was one of the most frightening sights in the fight against the erosion of values of democracy in recent memory. He highlighted the way JNU students’ union leader Aishe Ghosh was attacked brutally with iron rods.

“The values that are being imposed on the country are those of the RSS. It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implementing his agenda. It is the agenda of the RSS. RSS ideologues have identified the enemies of Indian society just as Hitler identified the enemies of Germany,” he observed.

The Chief Minister also released the book of screenplay, Shakuntala, written by Lalithambika Anthrajanam. T.J. Vinod, MLA, received the first copy. Cooperative Guide, a handbook on the cooperative sector, was also released on the occasion. A collection of photographs by B. Manoj based on C. Radhakrishnan’s Theekkadal Kadanja Thirumadhuram and the book Thenmanakkum Vaakkukal were also released.

They were allegedly in an affair, and the woman’s decision to back off reportedly infuriated the accused.

The police said Sageer waited outside the woman’s office on M.G. Road and tried talking to her when she came out. However, she ignored him and drove away, following which the accused tailed her.

333,2020/02/16,Trial run begins on metro’s Thykoodam-Pettah viaduct,"The 1.2-km corridor will be commissioned by the first week of April

A trial run on the Thykoodam-Pettah viaduct of the Kochi metro was conducted on Saturday, the last stretch of the metro’s Phase I, as a prelude to commissioning the 1.2-km corridor by the first week of April.

The trial run, at an approximate speed of 5 km per hour, started at 7.40 a.m. from Thykoodam and reached Pettah at 8 a.m. During the trial run, officials of Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) inspected the functioning of tracks and the traction system laid beside the tracks, from where the trains source power. The return trip started at 8.20 a.m. and reached Thykoodam at 9 a.m.

A success

“The first trial run was a success. In the coming days, further trial runs will be conducted in the corridor. Once they are over, the Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety [CMRS] will conduct the mandatory inspection, following which KMRL will proceed with the commissioning of the stretch,” said KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

The main focus of the trial run was identifying obstructions. Signalling trials will be conducted on Saturday midnight and on Sunday night for track data checking, KMRL sources said.

Meanwhile, the Pettah metro station is getting ready. Work on the northern side entry is nearing completion, while work on the entry on the southern side will take a couple of months more.

With the metro touching Pettah, the 25.60-km Phase I of the project, executed by DMRC, will get over.

KMRL has taken up widening of the Pettah-Vadakkekotta-SN Junction Road and is also engaged in piling on the stretch. There will be two stations in the corridor — Vadakkekotta and SN Junction.

The stretch is slated for commissioning in the third quarter of 2021. The metro viaduct will later be extended to near the Thripunithura railway station where a new bus station too has been proposed.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ll7s3k/article30832000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16KITRIALMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/trial-run-begins-on-metros-thykoodam-petta-viaduct/article30832001.ece
334,2020/02/16,Balbir Singh Sr. — the grand old man of hockey,"The triple Olympic gold medallist, now 96, insists on doing things by himself

His home in Chandigarh can be termed a tribute to the great game of hockey. You are ushered into the drawing room, a virtual museum displaying a magnificent collection of trophies, medals and award citations that document Balbir Singh’s journey.

The trophy, his first as a teenager when in school, may have lost the lustre but not the value.

Balbir’s eyes sparkle as he holds the precious belonging, his hands tremble, but he does not let go of the little gem. “It’s very dear to me,” he fumbles. And why not? It has been with him for close to 88 years now.

Daughter’s support

To call the 96-year-old Balbir frail, ill would disappoint him, for he protests by shaking his head. “I am fine,” he insists with a smile.

“He is as good as he has been last three decades,” smiles his doting daughter Sushbir.

She gave up hockey to pursue studies on Balbir’s advice and has not regretted it. “I have lived my hockey through my father’s exploits on the field and his love for the game.”

For grandson Kabir, life revolves around Balbir. Having quit a lucrative job in South Africa and now devoted to serving his Nanaji, the genial Kabir is Balbir’s eyes and ears.

“I just love every moment spent with him. His energy and memory are an amazing source for all of us. It is such an honour to be known as his grandson,” gushes Kabir.

Balbir, triple Olympic hockey gold medallist (1948, 1952 and 1956) has spent 160 days (from October 1, 2018 to November 20, 2019) in hospital — 95 of them in Intensive Care Unit.

He returned from the brink to the warmth of the house, owned by Sushbir. “He would divide time here and in Vancouver (with two sons),” smiles Kabir.

According to Sushbir, Balbir needs constant attention. “He needs the help of a care-taker but also insists on doing things by himself too.

“He loves reading newspapers and watching news. He can stay up late if there is a live hockey match. He keeps himself abreast of the happenings the world over.”

Sharp memory

Balbir’s memory is sharp, though not razor sharp as before. He recalls the 1948 Olympics with amazing details. “There was no greater joy for me than seeing the Tri-colour going up.

“The national anthem and the fact that we beat our rulers (British) on their home soil to retain the Olympic hockey gold can never be forgotten,” the excitement in his tone confirms the awesome feat of the team in London.

The family has kept him in the dark on the loss of some of the memorabilia he had donated to Sports Authority of India.

“It was callous of them to have lost such priceless gifts from his personal collection,” says a sad Sushbir. She and Kabir have made frantic efforts, in vain until now, for retrieving the medals, trophies and blazers.

“Come again soon,” the grand old man of Indian hockey says with a warm handshake.

You wish him “good health”, holding on to the hands that created magic on the hockey turf.",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/cg7b0c/article30836895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17BALBIR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/balbir-the-grand-old-man-of-hockey/article30836896.ece

Hundreds of students of Chaudhary Charan Singh University in Meerut blocked the road in front of the office of Inspector General of Police (Meerut Range) on Saturday after an alleged case of abduction and gang rape of a student of the university came to light.

Police have filed an FIR against the four accused under Sections 365, 376D, 323 and 342, but later IG Praveen Kumar said preliminary medical examination didn’t prove rape.

According to the FIR lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s father, the 20-year-old student used to travel to Meerut every day to attend classes.

“On February 13, she left for Meerut in the morning but when she didn’t return, we approached the police,” said the father in the FIR. The police traced her phone number and the woman was recovered from Siyana in Buladanshahr on Thursday evening. She had severe injury marks on her body.

“She told us that the accused and his three friends abducted her and took her to Siyana where they raped her. When she protested, they hit her,” said the father in the FIR.

Mr. Kumar said the police got the woman admitted to a hospital in Meerut.

“Preliminary investigation has revealed that it is not a case of abduction and rape. Both are adults. The woman went with her classmate, on her own on a motorcycle. During the ride to Siyana, the bike slipped,” said Mr. Kumar. This, he said, explains the injuries.

One of the accused has been arrested and is being interrogated.

339,2020/02/16,Minor in ‘guilty’ list for destroying property during anti-CAA protest,"Lawyer Mannan Baliyan, representing some of the guilty, says he would approach HC

Among the 53 persons held guilty by an Additional District Magistrate-led panel for destroying public property during the December 20 protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a minor. His mother Salma (name changed) said her son is 14 and had not stepped out of home after his name appeared in the list 20 days after the protest. “He has stopped going to school out of fear. On December 20, he went out to pray at the Himayati Masjid and when the protests broke out, he rushed home. I feel somebody has given his name for money,” alleged Salma, whose husband works as a barber.

“He earns at the most ₹200 a day and we have seven children, including four girls. How does the government expect us to pay the penalty,” she asked. “My sons are learning haircutting. There is no point in going to school now,” she added.

‘Not provoking’

Shamshad, 62, whose two young sons, in their early 20s, figure in the list, said Shahnawaz was in his ancestral village on December 20. “Salman was helping police to defuse the situation. There are at least 400 witnesses who would say he was not provoking or throwing stones. Still, both my sons have been named,” said Shamshad, adding both work as labourers and earn not more than ₹200 a day.

Akram Akhtar, social activist and lawyer, said the U.P. government sent the notices on the basis of Allahabad High Court’s decision in the Shujauddin vs. State of U.P. (2010), wherein it issued guidelines for recovery of damages for destruction of public property during agitations.

“However, they failed to take into account that the decision of Justice Sudhir Agarwal clearly mentions that such agitations are usually led by political leaders and parties. The protest of December 20 was not led by any political leader or party. In case of individuals, the High Court said the person should be identifiable which, those named by the ADM, are refuting.”

Damage recovery

Mannan Baliyan, a lawyer representing 17 of those held guilty, said he would approach the High Court as in the Destruction of Public and Private Properties vs. State of A.P. and others (2009), the Supreme Court had made it incumbent on the High Courts, not State governments, to recover the damages. “The High Court has granted stay in a similar case in Kanpur,” he said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/minor-in-guilty-list-for-destroying-property-during-anti-caa-protest/article30832899.ece

341,2020/02/16,A wholehearted battle against plastic in Kozhikode,"Influx of carry bags under the cover of compostable plastic a spoiler

A month after the ban on single-use plastic came into effect, people in Kozhikode seem to have accepted the change, more voluntarily than out of compulsion. At the same time, an influx of carry bags under the cover of compostable plastic is threatening to sabotage the very purpose of the ban in the absence of proper implementation.

The thin polythene and poly propylene (non-woven) bags have almost disappeared from even roadside shops and customers are not making a fuss about being charged extra for cloth bags. Better yet, they are learning to carry shopping bags with them.

“We have shifted completely to cloth bags. Our customers are cooperating very well”, said Sajith.K, marketing head of a network of super markets in the city. Being the district secretary of the Supermarket Welfare Association of Kerala, he said the association was making every effort to comply with the ban.

Several shops have cropped up in the heart of the city selling shopping bags made of cloth, jute and even thicker plastic. Paper bags in various sizes are available in even retail shops. Vegetable stores have started using paper cones like in the old times.

On vigil

The implementing agencies, including the Kozhikode Corporation and the district administration, are on high vigil against the use of single-use plastic. More than 500 kilograms of carry bags, mostly made of polypropylene (non-woven) and disposable utensils were seized in the inspections carried out in shops in the heart of the city over the past one month. The Sub Collector led an inspection that resulted in the confiscation of more than 18,000 kilograms of ‘biodegradable plastic’.

Alternate plastic products claimed to be ‘biodegradable’ and ‘compostable’ getting circulated widely is a major challenge for the implementing agencies. The guidelines issued by the State government at an earlier stage of the ban had permitted the use of compostable plastic carry bags provided they carried details of the manufacturing company including ISO 17088 certification, Pollution Control Board certification as well as QR code. But with several ‘duplicates’ getting circulated under its cover, the ban was recently extended to all types of carry bags including compostable plastic which has made the task much easier for officers.

“It is not practical to test if a product is really compostable during every inspection,” said C.K. Valsan, Health Inspector at the Kozhikode Corporation, who is in charge of the ban implementation.

The hefty fines levied, if violations are detected, could be a major factor behind the sudden change of stakeholders in the city. The fines for violations are ₹10,000 for the first time, ₹25,000 for second time and ₹50,000 for the third time.

While cloth and paper bags are available in plenty, the non-availability of substitutes to polythene pouches used to pack gravy and other liquids in restaurants is an issue.

With the steep rise in demand for cloth bags, the Kozhikode Corporation Kudumbashree has started several new manufacturing units and have brought the existing ones under one umbrella. “We now have 150 units, two each for every ward.

343,2020/02/16,KGMOA seeks ‘delivery points’,"Steps to ensure better services to pregnant women

The Kozhikode district unit of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) has urged the State government to have dedicated ‘delivery points’ at taluk hospitals and the Government Hospital for Women and Children (WMC), Kozhikode, to ensure better services to pregnant women.

C.K. Shaji, who recently took over as the KGMOA district president, said here on Sunday that the hospitals at Thamarassery, Koyilandy, Vadakara, and Kuttiyadi and the WMC should have six to seven dedicated staff to attend delivery cases. They should also have facilities such as blood bank and others. This would go a long way in reducing health complications in a majority of delivery cases, he said.

Need for more doctors

Dr. Shaji also flagged the doctor-patient ratio in Kozhikode, which, he claimed, was the lowest in the State. “There is only one doctor for a population of 9,000 here while the standard ratio could be at least 1:900,” he said. He said that doctors in outpatient wards in government hospitals were not able to pay enough attention to patient because of this. “With the improved infrastructure in government hospitals, more people are now approaching us for treatment. However, a primary health centre with four doctors are now examining around 200 patients a day. This is affecting the quality of our service. There is an urgent need to appoint more staff,” he said.

The KGMOA has sought the involvement of elected representatives from the district to solve the issue. According to sources, the doctor-patient ratio was much better in districts such as Malappuram and Wayanad.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kgmoa-seeks-delivery-points/article30835783.ece

The plastic used by multinational companies also affects the environment. So, the government should relax rules concerning plastic ban in favour of small scale traders, he said.

Addressing the media here on Sunday, he said that when the economy was facing a slowdown, the government was working only towards the interests of multinational companies.

Expressing disappointment over lack of policies for the welfare of small traders in the State budget, he said “several developmental schemes were announced in the budget but there were no schemes for entrepreneurship development. So, we have decided to organise an ‘anti-slavery economy conference’ in Chennai on May 5.”

He said retail business in the country was facing a slowdown. He flayed the Central government for encouraging online business. “Products of foreign companies are attractively advertised on these websites affecting sale of local traders. The government should help in improving the domestic business,” he said.

He said the government should ban sale of palm oil. Instead, the government can sell groundnut oil, gingelly oil and coconut oil through ration shops too. Pointing out that the consumption of beedi, cigarettes and tobacco is injurious to health, he said the government should ban manufacture of these products. Instead, the government is allowing their production and distribution.

348,2020/02/16,Visually challenged thrilled by drive on Madurai roads,"They navigate sighted drivers for around 25 km using Braille route map

MADURAI

It was an exciting Sunday for M. Nithya, a visually challenged Class 9 student of the Indian Association for the Blind (IAB) here, as she navigated a visually abled person to drive a car across the city. “I had always felt disheartened that I could never drive a car. But, after successfully navigating a person for around three hours, I feel empowered,” she said.

Nithya, along with other visually challenged persons, participated in the sixth edition of ‘Insight Car Rally’ organised by Madurai Ladies Circle 8, in association with the IAB. It was a unique rally, where the visually challenged persons navigated sighted drivers using a Braille route map. A total of 42 cars participated in the event. Each car started at Fortune Pandiyan Hotel, travelled around 25 kilometres criss-crossing the city, and returned to the hotel.

“The route map had clues which had to be cracked to cross different checkpoints. It was an interesting experience as I had a chance to explore many places in the city,” said M. Srikanth, a visually challenged college student.

Explaining the purpose of organising the event, chairman of Madurai Ladies Circle 8 Sukanya Raghuram said that the funds raised from the event would be used for building classrooms, libraries, toilets and anganwadis. A part of the funds raised would be given to the IAB.

“In addition, this year we are concentrating on projects for the upliftment of transgenders and acid attack victims,” she said.

Director (Projects) of the IAB N. Sivaram said that the rally acted as a great platform to encourage the visually challenged to use the Braille system regularly. “Irrespective of technological developments, learning Braille is essential. Usually, there is some resistance among them to use the Braille system. But, when participants shared their exciting experience, it will motivate them to learn the system,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/il3vro/article30835912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17MDUINSIGHTCARRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/visually-challenged-thrilled-by-drive-on-city-roads-madurai/article30835893.ece

353,2020/02/16,Moneywise | How to set effective financial goals,"Know where you want to go. Then ensure your planning for financial requirements doesn’t depend on external factors

“Saab kahaan jana hein aapko (Sir, where do you want to go?)” is typically what an autorickshaw driver or a taxiwala would ask us when we flag them down.

Imagine our answer is “Pata nahi hein (I don’t know)”, how do you think the driver would react?

In all probability, after initial awe, he may either request us to alight, or take us on a long ride, to fulfil his goal of making money.

Remember this, those individuals who do not work for their own financial goals, work for someone else’s financial goals.

Goal setting, first step

The first step in any financial planning and wealth creation activity is to make a list of financial goals. Financial goals are those responsibilities and dreams for which we save and invest money.

All of us have a certain set of responsibilities and dreams in life for which we work hard. That hard-earned money is then invested after paying off our expenses.

“My financial goals and those of my wife are the same” is the typical answer from husbands. The same is true in the case of the wife if she is the active partner, of the two, in managing family finances. The typical answer from women would be “my husband earns and I am responsible for managing the show, he never questions me.”

As a financial planner, it is very common for me to hear such answers. However, real-life situations are different. The moment a separate sheet of paper is given to both the husband and wife to make a list of their family’s financial responsibilities and aspirations, the quantum of money needed and the priorities, the reality is different. Sometimes, the list is completely different. If that is not the case, then the priorities of each financial goal and the amount needed to fulfil it would vary.

Know your destination

Here is a suggestion, after reading this piece, at the earliest, take your selfie. If you are married, take one with your spouse. Next to it, write down the list of responsibilities and dreams for which as a family you have been creating wealth and will continue to create. This will give focus and direction to your wealth creation activity. From then on, every step of wealth creation will be in the direction of your own internal condition.

Those individuals and families who have not articulated their financial responsibilities and dreams are like passengers in a rickshaw/taxi not knowing where they want to go.

Look within

These individuals and families save and invest their hard-earned money looking outward. Their decisions are based on external factors; for example, investing in equity as an asset class if the markets are up, or in a bank fixed deposit if the rate of interest is quite decent.

Their chain of thoughts does not end there; they find excuses to postpone their decisions — such as a falling GDP or unstable geopolitical conditions.

Fulfilling our responsibilities is not dependent on external conditions.

If someone falls sick in the family and requires hospitalisation, we wouldn’t wait for the economy to stabilise to go ahead with the treatment. What are the chances of a family cancelling a vacation to Europe just because GST rates on international air tickets have gone up?

Only when there is no clear articulation of financial goals, individuals and families take financial decisions based on external conditions. External conditions are always volatile and fragile. Many of them are based on hearsay. This leads to anxiety.

Queries like “Should I buy, sell or hold?” are manifestations of investments which are not linked to financial goals.

“We were at complete ease this time when there was a fall in stock market. We knew our monthly SIP in equity-based funds is for a retirement which is more than decade away. Fall in stock market for 10 consecutive days also did not disturb us,” said a member of an audience in an investor awareness programme. This is an exemplification of investments made based on internal requirements. To this investor, the volatility outside did not lead to anxious moments.

My mind, my GDP

Wealth creation is a habit. Habit is an auto-behaviour of the mind. Develop the habit of looking within before taking and executing any financial decision. Instead of looking outside on parameters like the country’s GDP, GST rates or WPI, focus on the ‘My GDP’ — my goals and dream plan.

354,2020/02/16,Why have LPG prices seen a sharp rise?,"What is the pricing mechanism? What happens to those with subsidy?

The story so far: On February 12, LPG prices, which are revised on a monthly basis, went up again. The rate for unsubsidised, 14.2 kg cylinders has risen by a steep ₹144.50 in Delhi, at ₹858.50. In January 2020, a non-subsidised LPG cylinder cost ₹714 in Delhi. In three other metros too, LPG prices jumped — Kolkata: ₹896 (increase by ₹149); Mumbai: ₹829.50 (increase by ₹145); and Chennai: ₹881 (increase by ₹147). The recent price hike has been the sharpest since January 2014.

What influences LPG prices in India?

Domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are based on a formula — the import parity price (IPP), which is based on international LPG prices. Saudi Aramco’s LPG price acts as the benchmark for the IPP and includes the free-on-board price, ocean freight, customs duties, port dues and the like.

This dollar-denominated figure is converted into rupees before local costs — such as local freight, bottling charges, marketing costs, margins for oil marketing firms and dealer commissions and the Goods and Services Tax — are added. This helps the government arrive at the retail selling price for LPG.

The government resets the LPG price every month, the decision being influenced by international prices and how the rupee has behaved against the dollar in the immediately preceding weeks.

How have international prices behaved recently?

For most of December, the Brent crude price had been on an uptrend, and had breached the $68 level late that month. It peaked at $68.91 in early January, but with the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease hogging headlines in recent weeks, fears of a global slowdown have pushed oil prices down through January, save for a few spikes.

Saudi Aramco had raised its propane prices to $565 per metric tonne in January, up sharply from $440 a metric tonne set for December. Aramco propane prices offer a benchmark for pricing the West Asia LPG sales to Asian markets.

The dollar-rupee dance has since been within the range of ₹71-₹72 to the dollar, having briefly breached the ₹72 mark in early January.

Who will the price rise affect?

The price increase will affect retail consumers who have given up the subsidy.

The government has said that for those who avail subsidy, the increase would be mostly absorbed by the rise in subsidy. The Centre said the price of an unsubsidised cylinder would increase from ₹714 to ₹858.50 in Delhi, for example, and that the subsidy offered would go up from ₹153.86 to ₹291.48. Of the 27.76 crore retail consumers, 26.12 crore consumers avail LPG subsidy. Likewise, for Ujjwala consumers, the subsidy would go up from ₹174.86 to ₹312.48 per cylinder.

Does this help the government move to an open pricing regime?

Prior to the latest round of the price increase, the government had raised LPG cylinder prices by ₹62, starting from August 2019. Compare this with the increase of ₹82 that had taken place over five years to mid-2019, indicating a penchant for increasingly lesser subsidy. In the latest round, though, the Centre has sought to absorb much of the increase for those availing subsidy. It looks like the most recent increase has been beyond its control and it is hence raising the subsidy levels to protect consumers, given that the economy is reeling from lack of consumer spending.

What is the outlook?

With international crude prices on the downtrend, it is plausible the LPG prices too would see a slump. Aramco has lowered its propane price for February to $505 per metric tonne. Assuming we receive no surprises from the rupee-dollar tango, a softening of LPG prices in the domestic context may be expected.

What are the implications for the broader economy?

At a time when consumer demand, in general, for goods and services in the country has slumped, more cash in the hands of the retail consumer may have helped spur demand. It is ironic that the government has had to raise LPG prices now.

This sucks away even more disposable income from those consumers who pay market rates for LPG. As a result, household budgets are bound to go up, especially for those not availing the subsidy. The increase in LPG price could spur headline inflation even further. As it is, the consumer price index inflation has seen a rise over the past few months. For January, it had accelerated to 7.59%, compared with 7.35% in December 2019. The January inflation metric was the highest since May 2014, when the figure was at 8.33%.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uwpuvh/article30831874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12FEBTH--LPG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/why-have-lpg-prices-seen-a-sharp-rise/article30831666.ece
355,2020/02/16,Explained: What does ‘developed’ tag mean for India?,"How will the U.S. move to strip India of benefits reserved for a developing country impact trade?

The story so far: On February 10, the U.S. removed more than a dozen countries, including India, from its list of countries that are classified as “developing” for trade purposes. These countries will now be classified instead as “developed” economies, thus stripping them of various trade benefits. The move, which comes just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India later this month, has led to doubts over the chances of a trade deal being signed between India and the United States.

What is the “developing country” status?

The office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) maintains a list of countries that it classifies as “developing”, “developed”, and “least-developed”. Countries that are classified as “developing” are allowed to export certain goods to the U.S. without being hit by punitive tariffs that are usually imposed on goods from “developed” countries. The “developing country” status owes its origin to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which authorised the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to help poor countries develop faster. These benefits were extended further under the World Trade Organization wherein rich countries agreed to grant trade benefits to countries that classified themselves as poor. It is worth noting that about two-thirds of countries that are members of the WTO classify themselves as “developing” countries and avail benefits.

Is such a classification justified?

Any classification of whether a country is “developing” or not is bound to be arbitrary. While the economic progress that India and China have achieved over the last few decades is seen by some as reason enough to get rid of their special status, others point to the various development indicators in which India and China still lag behind the rich world. Further, opinion on whether such a classification is required in the first place is divided.

Why is India being stripped of this status?

The U.S. administration under President Trump has repeatedly accused fast-growing countries such as India and China of wrongly claiming trade benefits that are reserved only for the truly developing countries. Therefore, Mr. Trump has sought to renegotiate trade deals with countries like China, essentially trying to make these deals more “fair” to the interests of the U.S. India has traditionally been one of the largest beneficiaries under the GSP, with over 2,000 goods having been exempted from import tariffs, until the Trump administration stripped it of the special benefit last year.

With the current change in India’s status under the USTR’s classification, the task of reclaiming the lost GSP benefits now becomes even harder. In support of its actions, the Trump administration has argued that countries like India and China have witnessed significant growth in the last few decades. This, it believes, is enough reason to scale back the various trade benefits. It has further cited the share of global trade enjoyed by India and China and their membership in the G20 club to argue that they enjoy significant economic power. Moreover, many developed countries also classify themselves as “developing” in order to escape tariffs.

How will the U.S. decision affect global trade?

Any move to end duty-free access for foreign goods into the U.S., which becomes more likely after the change in trade status, will increase the overall tax burden on goods crossing international borders. This will add further pressure on the global economy, which has already witnessed a slowing of growth this year. The growth effects of a tariff war could rise further if countries that are stripped of their “developing” economy status decide to retaliate by imposing tariffs on goods that they import from the U.S.

Recently, India offered to scale back tariffs on American dairy and other products that are imported into India. This came after the U.S. complained about the restricted access that American companies have to developing countries like India. If such trade tactics manage to bring down trade barriers on both sides, it can benefit the global economy. But, with both the U.S. and its various warring trading partners looking to protect their domestic producers rather than consumers who benefit from lower tariffs, a general fall in tariffs across the board seems unlikely.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lwsc6l/article30831679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th16-Prashant-Developed-country,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/what-does-developed-tag-mean-for-india/article30831680.ece
356,2020/02/16,ISRO to launch an unprecedented 10 earth imaging satellites,"They include new categories such as first Geo Imaging Satellite

The country will send up an unusually large number of 10 earth observation (EO) satellites during 2020-21, according to the latest annual report of the Indian Space Research Organisation for 2019-20.

On a quick look, such a pre-ponderence of the EO launches is unprecedented and includes new categories such as the first Geo Imaging Satellite, GISAT-1.

In comparison, only three communication satellites — which is another major category in space infrastructure — and two navigation satellites are planned for the coming financial year starting April.

The annual plan mentions 36 missions, another high for a year: these includes both satellites and their launchers.

The high number also stands out amidst the immediate two years before and after the plan. For the ongoing fiscal, ISRO had proposed launching six EO satellites, of which two are due to go. For 2021-22, the plan is to add eight EO satellites.

ISRO says 19 national EO satellites, 18 communication satellites and eight navigation satellites are in service, driving uses from broadcasting, telephony, Internet services, weather and agriculture-related forecasting, security, disaster-time rescue and relief and location-based services. Three of the communication satellites are dedicated for military communication and networking.

In the ongoing fiscal 2019-20, 17 missions have been planned to be launched and up to six of them are due to be completed by March 31, it says.

ISRO was recently given a budget of nearly ₹13,480 crore for the next fiscal.

The EO sats are ostensibly for benign uses such as land and agriculture watch. But their images also have a very important use for the military, for keeping an eye on the borders. The satellites such as RISATs, which carry a synthetic aperture radar on them, provide all-weather, 24-hour information to security agencies.

Apart from GISAT-1 that is apparently fixed over the subcontinent at an orbit 36,000 km high, the space agency plans to launch a new series of high resolution HRSATs as a threesome on a single PSLV launcher.

The upcoming EO satellites include radar imaging satellites RISAT-2BR2, RISAT- 1A and 2A; Oceansat-3 and Resourcesat-3/3S.

The RISAT-2BR2 will form a triad fleet with its predecessors RISAT-2B and RISAT-2B1, all going around 120 degrees apart. They will “increase the frequency of observation in the areas of interest to provide all-weather, day/night imaging services from space,” the report said.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/zhkwkl/article30830788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/isro-to-launch-an-unprecedented-10-earth-imaging-satellites/article30830789.ece
357,2020/02/16,Should I invest in PPF or SIP? Answers to your personal finance queries,"Readers can send in queries on personal ﬁnance and investing to moneywise@thehindu.co.in

Q. I am a 34-year-old central government employee with a net salary of ₹35,000. I could not save earlier but now I have no obligation. I'm not married and don’t intend to get married. How much money should I be saving and where should I invest my money to get a guaranteed monthly income of ₹2 lakh (from 2046) once I retire at 60?

Shekhar S.

A. It is heartening to note that you are eager to save for retirement the moment you have some surplus. If we assume ₹25,000 a month of expenses for you, and a 5% inflation, after 26 years (when your reach 60), this expense would be about ₹89,000 per month. This will go up with inflation every year. For example, in your 80th year, if we assume the same rate of inflation, the monthly expense would be ₹2.24 lakh. If we consider that (assuming a lifespan until 80), you will need about ₹2 crore as corpus at the age of 60. If you save about ₹17,000 a month and your investments earn around 9%, you should be able to comfortably build your retirement corpus.

Start with whatever surplus you have and increase it slowly as salary goes up. Consider a 60:40 mix of quality multi-cap equity funds and 40% through your government NPS as well as low-risk, short-term debt funds. Closer to retirement, shift the equity funds to safer debt options such as deposits and post office schemes, depending on what safe options are available then.

Q. I am 23 and work for an MNC. I earn about ₹20,000 after deductions. Over the last six months, I traded in stock markets and lost ₹60,000. Now, I am thinking of trading in options through short selling. But I need a minimum capital of ₹1 lakh. I don't have this sum as I lost all my savings in the past six months. So, I'm thinking of taking a bank loan of ₹1 lakh to do short selling. Is my idea of taking loan to do trading worthy or not?

Mohith

A.The answer is — avoid taking a loan to enter derivatives. This decision should not change, whether the loan is available at cheap rates or otherwise. Having lost money, don’t compound the risk it by taking a loan to make up the loss. It will likely push you into a debt trap. There are no sustainable short cuts to investing. Start by saving small sums in a few equity mutual funds every month. They can even be index funds. Add some mid and small-cap funds for some aggression, if you like that. Have a horizon of not less than 5 years.

If you want more excitement, allocate 10-15% of your total savings to stocks by having a mix of large companies and some well-known mid-sized companies — not for trading but for long-term investing.

Think long-term by following news on companies and reading up their annual reports. This will open your interest to the world of equity.

Like the famous economist Paul Samuelson said, “Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow.”

Q. I am 27. I want the best plans to invest ₹12,000 per month. I have heard about PPF and SIP. Please advise which option can get me good returns in 10 years among the two.

Vinayak Gopal

A. It need not be either, or. It can be a combination. PPF will provide you with a safe avenue to invest as it is a government scheme but will give deposit-like returns. SIP is a mode of investing monthly in mutual funds. It can be used to invest in a high-risk and volatile asset class like equity.

A combination of both will give you some stability and returns. Invest in both with a 60% allocation to equity funds and rest in PPF. Seek proper guidance and hold for the long term.

358,2020/02/16,Spread your risks,"The central government has raised the insurance for deposits in banks, as proposed in the Budget 2020-21.

What has changed?

The central government has raised the insurance for deposits in banks, as proposed in the Budget 2020-21. Earlier, deposits were insured up to ₹1 lakh; now insurance cover has risen to ₹5 lakh.

What does it mean to you, the depositor?

Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India and in case of failure of a bank, the corporation provides cover to bank deposits of customers.

If the bank in which you have deposited funds goes bankrupt, the DICGC will ensure that your deposits are now covered against such risk up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.

All funds held in ‘the same capacity and right’, as defined by the DICGC, at the same bank are added together before deposit insurance is determined. But, if the funds are in different types of ownership or are deposited in separate banks they would then be separately insured.

For example, if Mr. A has a deposit with a bank in his individual capacity, and also holds an account with his spouse as the secondary holder, then these two accounts would each have deposit insurance cover of up to ₹5 lakh separately.

If Mr. A holds a third account for a minor, say his son Ajit, then the deposit insurance cover would apply separately to this account as well. A fourth account under Mr. A’s name held jointly with his business partner would also be separately insured.

But if you have several accounts of the same type (under one name, with one bank, across multiple accounts, and across branches) the insurance cover would be applicable to all your deposits at a clutch. Assume you have a deposit of ₹13 lakh with the Bandra (Mumbai) branch of a scheduled commercial bank, and ₹6 lakh with the Jayanagar (Bengaluru) branch of the same bank, both in your name. If the bank goes bust, all your deposits together would still be covered only up to ₹5 lakh.

Is it better to distribute money across banks, to make the best of one’s savings?

Yes, it is. For someone with sizeable savings in the form of deposits, it is worth your while to split them up across banks, up to ₹5 lakh per bank. If you have deposits with more than one bank, deposit insurance coverage limit is applied separately to the deposits in each bank.

While the safest option may be to earn interest through deposits with large, nationalised banks, your returns would be minimal, for, such banks don’t offer high interest rates. Some good, Small Finance Banks (SFBs) currently offer better returns on deposits than do large nationalised banks. Choosing a strong SFB and opening deposit accounts may be a good option for those reliant only on interest from deposits for their upkeep.

What does it mean to banks?

Banks now have to cough up more annual insurance premium to DICGC to cover deposits placed with them. From 10 paise per ₹100, the premium has been raised 20% to 12 paise per ₹100 worth of deposits with them, effective April 1, 2020",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/r43u6m/article30835499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-RBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/spread-your-risks/article30831576.ece
359,2020/02/16,All about insurance policies for cancer treatment,"Cancer treatment can be prolonged and its high cost requires proper planning

Cancer has become the most dreaded and least understood medical threat. It also appears much more prevalent than ever before. What is pretty clear is the havoc it plays with lives, lifestyles and finances. Cancer treatment can be prolonged and its high cost warrants proper planning.

Cancer insurance can be in the form of benefit policies or indemnity policies.

An indemnity policy reimburses hospitalisation and treatment expenses within the policy scope. It can be renewed in the usual course after a claim and will continue to offer coverage. Examples of indemnity policies covering cancer are Star Health Insurance Company Limited’s pilot product, Star Cancer Care Gold, and HDFC ERGO Health Insurance Company Limited’s iCan cancer insurance. The latest in this stable is Cancer Guard launched by The New India Assurance Company Limited. The policy covers expenses related to cancer treatment and is available in sums insured of ₹5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50 lakh and anyone from 18 to 65 years of age is eligible for coverage.

A benefit policy pays the SI on diagnosis of cancer with no reference to expenses, and coverage ceases once the claim is paid. The payout can be one lump sum or over several years in a pre-specified manner.

Aditya Birla SunLife Insurance Company’s ABSLI Cancer Shield is a benefit policy, as are ICICI Pru Heart/Cancer Protect and HDFC Cancer Care.

So, it is important to be aware of the type of policy you are finalising. Usually, life insurance companies offer benefit policies and non-life insurance companies offer indemnity policies.

A person can avail one in each type of policy and claim under both — the combination offering added protection. Many indemnity policies now have an inbuilt lump sum benefit as well.

Specialised cancer policies cover multiple types of cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, and coverage is available at multiple stages of the disease. In most benefit policies, a lumpsum is paid on diagnosis and further premiums are waived under certain conditions. A monthly income is paid for a specified number of years for certain conditions.

Critical illness policies also pay for cancer treatment, but cover cancer only at an advanced stage and do not offer benefits like waiver of future premiums. While they do pay for hospital treatments, regular hospitalisation policies do not offer the robust financial support needed for cancer treatment. Indemnity type policies are more complex than benefit policies.

Complications arising from cancer, cases where cancer symptoms manifest within 90 days, skin cancer and any cancer due to sexually-transmitted diseases, HIV or AIDS are not covered, and neither are cancers due to congenital conditions, pre-existing conditions and biological, nuclear or chemical contamination.

Age at entry determines the maximum sum insured and renewal is available on an ongoing basis. Most policies have no pre-underwriting medical check-up.

Once a positive diagnosis of cancer is made, claims for outpatient, inpatient and day-care expenses will be payable. Hospitalisation claims have their usual requirements and 30 days’ pre-hospitalisation and 60 days’ post-hospitalisation expenses are also within the ambit of the policy.

Some companies cover hospitalisation expenses to the insured and the donor in case of organ transplant as part of cancer treatment, within the SI limit. The cost of the organ is excluded.

Reconstruction of the affected body part to restore essential physical functioning is covered.

Some policies offer an additional lumpsum benefit if the insured is diagnosed for the first time with Stage IV cancer or advanced metastatic cancer.

360,2020/02/16,"Airtel, Vodafone Idea to pay AGR dues on February 17","The three companies are jointly liable to pay dues of over ₹1 lakh crore, but they have informed DoT of making only partial payment.

Telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices are likely to make payment for adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues on Monday to avoid stringent punitive action from the Telecom Department, according to an official source.

The three companies are jointly liable to pay dues of over ₹1 lakh crore, but they have informed the Department of Telecom (DoT) of making only partial payment, as per their representatives.

“Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices have said that they will make payments on Monday. DoT will take action after evaluating the amount paid by them,” an official source told PTI.

Earlier on Friday, Bharti Airtel offered the DoT to pay ₹10,000 crore by February 20, but a DoT official said that the department can’t grant any extension.

Vodafone Idea on Saturday said that it is assessing the amount that can be paid towards AGR dues, even as it flagged concerns over the continuation of its business.

Telecom operators are collectively liable to pay ₹1.47 lakh crore in AGR dues as per the Supreme Court order dated October 24, 2019. The deadline to pay the amount ended on January 23, but none of the telecom operators, except Reliance Jio, paid the amount.

Even state-owned BSNL and MTNL did not pay the dues.

As per the last available estimates, Airtel owes nearly ₹35,586 crore, including licence fee and spectrum usage charges, to the government.

Vodafone Idea is staring at dues worth ₹53,000 crore, which includes up to ₹24,729 crore of spectrum dues and another ₹28,309 crore in licence fee. Tata Teleservices owes around ₹13,800 crore, BSNL ₹4,989 crore and MTNL ₹3,122 crore.

Out of ₹1.47 lakh crore, around ₹1.13 lakh crore is likely to be recovered, as other companies, which are liable to pay AGR dues, have folded up their businesses.

Reliance Communications and Aircel are going through insolvency proceedings.

The apex court on Friday came down heavily on the Telecom Department for not taking steps to recover statutory dues, estimated to be around ₹1.47 lakh crore from operators.

The DoT issued fifth and final notice to telecom operators on February 14 for making payment on the same day, but none of the companies paid the dues.

When asked about telecom operators having sought time to assess the amount they have to pay, the DoT official said that the court gave them three months to do so and even after missing January 23 deadline telecom operators had sufficient time to calculate their dues.

“Before the due date, DoT has sent telecom operators 4 notices and reminders to pay to avoid punitive action under license condition. After court order on modification plea, telecom players are not left with any excuse to delay the payment and the DoT can take action against them without serving any further notice,” the source said.

The apex court pulled up telecom operators and the government on non-payment of AGR dues despite its order. It has asked managing directors and directors of the company to be present in person before court on the next hearing, scheduled for March 17, in case there is violation of its order in the AGR case.

Public sector companies, that do not sell telecom services, owe DoT around ₹2.65 lakh crore, with GAIL India alone owing around 65 per cent of the total amount. However, these PSUs have the option to approach court for a legal recourse.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/plj9sl/article30836519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THAIRTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/airtel-vodafone-idea-to-pay-agr-dues-on-monday/article30836520.ece
361,2020/02/16,Will not just defend market share but also charge at competition: Maruti Suzuki MD,"MSI had a share of 50.59% in the passenger vehicles market in the April-January period of the current financial year

The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) will not only defend its market share but also “charge” at and “chase” competitors in the wake of newcomers, such as Kia and Chinese players, intensifying competition, according to a top company official.

MSI, which had a share of 50.59% in the passenger vehicles market in the April-January period of the current financial year, is not new to competition and will focus not only on new products but enhance its customer relationship in order to maintain its grip in the Indian car market.

“I am not defending, I am charging. We are charging anytime. If they are good products, we try to chase them,” MSI managing director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa said.

He was responding to a query on how prepared the company was to defend its market share in India as competition heats up with the entry of Kia Motors and MG Motor, and with China’s Great Wall Motors and Haima Automobiles also set to enter the market.

According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), in the April 2019-January 2020 period, Maruti Suzuki sold a total of 12,04,404 units of passenger vehicles, this cornering about 50.59% of the market share. Total PV sales during the period stood at 23,80,699 units.

Stressing that the company is used to competition, Mr. Ayukawa said, “Competition itself is there all the time. In the 1990s, new players came in and so the competition was there. Some new players are coming in. This time, players from Korea and China are coming.”

“We have to develop our product portfolio and manage our business to encourage customers and also set up strong sales and service networks. Through these activities we can maybe compete better,” he added.

When asked if the company would need some more stand-out models, especially in the SUVs segment, Mr. Ayukawa said, “We have to develop new models, but the car business is not only about products. It is also about how you take care of your customers.”

Reiterating the significance of customer relationship, he said, “It is important because we are not only selling, we are taking care of customers after the selling of the vehicle... A customer selects Maruti because of the convenience of having a lot of dealers, sales and service points.”

“We are also ensuring they do not wait long for spare parts if something happens to their cars. These kind of convenient services, they [customers] recognise.”

When asked about the growth outlook for the ongoing financial year, Mr. Ayukawa said only two more months were remaining and “we have already dropped about 18%. That is not easy to recover in this fiscal”.

He, however, added that looking at the market performance after the festive season, there is a little bit of improvement and that is why the company is trying to “encourage” the market further.

The transition to BS-VI from BS-IV is also adding uncertainty as “nobody knows at this point if customers will wait and buy discounted BS-IV model or [go for] BS-VI, which we have already been introduced”.

Commenting on whether the company will have to rethink its exit from diesel models in the BS-VI era, he said MSI has not closed the option and will do a review depending on the market demand and said at present it was difficult to gauge.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/irucfs/article30834633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THLTAUTOSHOW-INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/will-not-just-defend-market-share-but-also-charge-at-competition-maruti-suzuki-md/article30834634.ece
362,2020/02/16,"IMG clears BPCL sale bid documents, to be issued after ministerial group nod","The government plans to sell its entire 53.29% stake in BPCL.

An inter-ministerial group has approved sale bid documents for privatisation of India’s second biggest oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), and a notice seeking bids will be issued after a small group of ministers approves it, sources said.

An inter-ministerial group or IMG comprising representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Petroleum, Law, Corporate Affairs and Department of Disinvestment has approved Expression of Interest (EoI) and Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) for the company.

This will now be put up for approval by ‘Alternative Mechanism’ which is essentially a very small grouping of key Cabinet ministers, sources privy to the development said.

Once the approval is granted, an EoI seeking interest from potential buyers will be floated, they said, adding the EoI along with PIM was likely to be out in the market within this month.

The government plans to sell its entire 53.29% stake in BPCL that will give buyers ready access to 14% of India’s oil refining capacity and about one-fifth of the fuel market share in the world’s fastest-growing energy market.

Sources said a two-stage bidding process will be followed wherein request for proposal or RFP in the first stage will be followed by due diligence-cum-bidding by qualified bidders in the second phase.

BPCL has a market capitalisation of about ₹1.03 lakh crore and the government stake at current prices is worth about ₹54,000 crore. The successful bidder will also have to make an open offer to other shareholders for acquiring another 26% at the same price.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15% of India’s total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes. While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants.

The company distributes 21% of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.

Sources said the disinvestment process being followed for privatisation of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) is based on decision-making through inter-ministerial consultations and involvement of professionals and experts.

After in-principle consent by the administrative ministry of the state-owned company concerned, approval of the proposal to disinvest is taken from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).

CCEA approved BPCL stake sale in November last year. Following this, an inter-ministerial group (IMG) was constituted. IMG appointed advisers for the transaction, including merchant bankers, asset valuers and legal advisers.

The ‘Alternative Mechanism’ approves reserve or base price as well as price bids. Sources said BPCL privatisation process may take six to eight months to complete.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/al0w6y/article30351520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBPCL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/img-clears-bpcl-sale-bid-documents-to-be-issued-after-ministerial-group-nod/article30834558.ece
