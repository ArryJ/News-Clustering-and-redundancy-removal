4,2020/02/21,Facebook to pay users for recording to improve speech recognition,"Although one user will be able to make only $5, this is an interesting approach by Facebook to improve its artificial intelligence-driven transcription skills.

Facebook has announced it will pay select users who agree to record their voice to improve its speech recognition technology.

The social networking giant will pay select users to record snippets of audio through a new programme called “Pronunciations” in its Viewpoints market research app, according to The Verge.

If you qualify to be part of the programme, you’ll be able to record the phrase “Hey Portal,” followed by the first name of a friend from your friends list.

“You’ll be able to do this with the names of up to 10 friends, and you have to record each statement twice,” the report said on Thursday.

The Facebook announcement comes at a time when several tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google have paused their audio transcription programmes after reports emerged that third-party contractors were listening to audio recordings.

Amazon now lets users opt-out of audio recording “review.”

5,2020/02/21,MIT scientists use AI model to identify powerful new antibiotic,"Scientists with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created a machine learning computer model looking for chemical features that make molecules effective at killing E. coli.

US researchers used an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify a powerful new antibiotic compound, which could kill many of the world’s most problematic disease-causing bacteria in lab tests.

The study published on Thursday in the journal Cell showed that it could kill some strains that are resistant to all known antibiotics and also clear infections in two different mouse models, the Xinhua news agency reported.

Scientists with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created a machine learning computer model looking for chemical features that make molecules effective at killing E. coli.

They trained the model on about 2,500 molecules, including about 1,700 FDA-approved drugs and a set of 800 natural products with diverse structures and a wide range of bioactivities.

After training, the algorithm was tested on a library of about 6,000 compounds, finally helping identify a molecule that was predicted to have strong anti-bacterial activity and had a chemical structure different from any existing antibiotics.

The molecule called halicin, previously investigated as possible diabetes drug, was tested against dozens of bacterial strains isolated from patients and grown in lab dishes. It was able to kill many that are resistant to treatment like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, according to the study.

In a mice test, halicin-containing ointment completely cleared the infections of A. baumannii, which is resistant to all known antibiotics, within 24 hours.

In another study, the researchers found that E. coli did not develop any resistance to halicin during a 30-day treatment period.

The researchers are planning to work with a pharmaceutical company or nonprofit organization, in hopes of developing the new antibiotic for use in humans.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/q7god1/article30878209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THANTI-BACTERIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mit-scientists-use-ai-model-to-identify-powerful-new-antibiotic/article30878210.ece

The 234 infections among prisoners outside Hubei ended 16 straight days of declines in new mainland cases excluding that province, where the virus emerged in December in its locked-down capital, Wuhan.

State television quoted Communist Party rulers as saying the turning point in combating the outbreak had not yet been reached, and more than 30 cases in a hospital in Beijing highlighted a sharp jump in the tally there.

Total cases in the capital of the disease — known as COVID-19 — were at 396 with four deaths, out of an official mainland toll of 75,400 cases and 2,236 deaths.

Vice Science and Technology Minister Xu Nanping said China’s earliest vaccine would be submitted for clinical trials around late April. That timetable is in line with a World Health Organization estimate of a vaccine reaching the market in 18 months.

As international authorities seek to stop the virus from becoming a global pandemic, public health officials are hoping for signs that the arrival of warmer weather in the northern hemisphere might slow its spread.

The spike in cases in two jails outside Hubei — in the northern province of Shandong and Zhejiang in the east — made up most of the 258 newly confirmed Chinese infections outside the epicentre province.

The virus has emerged in 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing 11 people.

9,2020/02/21,FATF places Iran on black list,"It failed to comply with global anti-terrorism financing norms

An international agency placed Iran on its black list on Friday after it failed to comply with international anti-terrorism financing norms, a move that will deepen the country’s isolation from financial markets.

The decision came after three years of warnings from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), urging the Islamic Republic to either enact terrorist financing conventions or see its reprieve from the black list lifted and some counter-measures imposed.

“Given Iran’s failure to enact the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions in line with the FATF Standards, the FATF fully lifts the suspension of counter-measures and calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures,” the group’s 39 members said.

These would entail more scrutiny of transactions with Iran, tougher external auditing of financing firms operating in the country and extra pressure on the few foreign banks and businesses still dealing with Iran. “The consequence of (Iran’s) inaction is higher costs of borrowing and isolation from the financial system,” a Western diplomat told Reuters.

However, the FATF appeared to leave the door open for some engagement with Iran saying in its statement: “Countries should also be able to apply countermeasures independently of any call by the FATF to do so.”

“It’s a middle solution. A sort of a fudge to leave the door open for the Iranians,” said one of the diplomats.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fatf-places-iran-on-black-list/article30883377.ece
10,2020/02/21,Julian Assange may seek French asylum: lawyer,"It will be on humanitarian, health grounds

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is jailed in Britain fighting extradition to the U.S. for espionage and computer hacking, may seek asylum in France, his lawyer Eric Dupond-Moretti said on Friday.

Mr. Dupond-Moretti said that Mr. Assange’s legal team would be in contact with French President Emmanuel Macron to make the case for Mr. Assange to get asylum in France. Mr. Assange has said that his youngest child and the child’s mother are French.

Mr. Assange’s lawyers noted the request for asylum was “not an ordinary demand” as Mr. Assange is not on French soil. He said the request would be based on humanitarian and health grounds, arguing that Mr. Assange was showing signs of “psychological torture”.

“Article 53 of our constitution also allows for France to give refuge to a man who is being threatened on reasons of his freedom of expression,” he said.

The 48-year old Julian Assange, who spent seven years holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy before he was dragged out last April, is wanted in the United States on 18 counts, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades behind bars if convicted.

Mr. Assange is currently in jail in London, and Judge Vanessa Baraitser will hear arguments next week as to why he should or should not be sent to the United States.

Australian-born Assange made global headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.

An earlier request made in 2015 by Mr. Assange to get asylum in France was rejected.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lh2pub/article30883245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Assange-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/julian-assange-may-seek-french-asylum-lawyer/article30883246.ece
11,2020/02/21,Erdogan ramps up diplomatic pressure over Syria crisis,"He calls for an end to Syrian govt. strikes on rebel-held Idlib

Turkey’s President spoke with two European leaders by phone on Friday and called for an end to a Syrian government offensive on the last rebel stronghold in the country that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s joint telephone call with the heads of France and Germany came amid mounting tensions between Turkey and Russia, which are backing opposing sides in Syria’s civil war.

On Friday, Russian warplanes struck rebel-held areas in northwestern Syria as insurgents and government forces exchanged artillery and mortar fire in other parts of Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, opposition activists said.

The violence came a day after two Turkish soldiers were killed in an airstrike in Idlib after an attack by Ankara-backed opposition forces that targeted Syrian government troops. The deaths came after Mr. Erdogan threatened to expand his nation’s involvement in Syria if another one of his troops were hurt.

The Turkish leader told French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel that “the Syrian regime and its backers’ aggression in Idlib must be stopped,” according to a statement from Mr. Erdogan’s office.

It followed a similar call by Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, during which they proposed urgent talks with Mr. Erdogan to ease tensions.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/erdogan-ramps-up-diplomatic-pressure-over-syria-crisis/article30883205.ece
12,2020/02/21,Sri Lankan parliamentary committee proposes immediate burqa ban,"The report suggested that the police should have the power to ask anyone wearing a face covering in a public place to take off such clothing in order to establish the identity of the person

A Sri Lankan parliamentary committee on national security has proposed an immediate ban on the burqa and suspending the registration of political parties on ethnic and religious basis, following the Easter Sunday terror attack that killed over 250 people.

The proposals featured in a special report presented in Parliament on Thursday to resolve 14 controversial issues following the April 21 Easter attack last year. The report was tabled by MP Malith Jayatilaka, Chairman Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security, the Daily Mirror reported.

According to the report, a number of countries have already banned the burqa.

The report suggested that the police should have the power to ask anyone wearing a face covering in a public place to take off such clothing in order to establish the identity of the person.

If such a request is not complied with, police should have the power to arrest the individual without a warrant, the report said.

It also recommended the country’s Election Commission to enact a legislation to suspend the registration of political parties on ethnic and religious basis.

The report also said that the registration of political parties which have some racial or religious conflict or in its name should also prohibited.

Such a party should be converted into a political or non-religious political party within a specified period of time, the report said.

The report states that all students studying in madrassas should be absorbed into the normal school system under the Ministry of Education within three years.

The report also proposes to establish a special committee to regulate the madrasas under the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs.

The United States is preparing to sign a deal with the Taliban on February 29, building on an agreement on reducing violence across Afghanistan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday.

“Upon a successful implementation of this understanding, signing of the U.S.-Taliban agreement is expected to move forward,” he said in a statement released after visiting Saudi Arabia.

A week-long “reduction in violence” between the Taliban, the U.S. and Afghan security forces will commence shortly, Afghanistan's National Security Council spokesman Javed Faisal said on Friday.

The partial truce will mark a historic step in more than 18 years of gruelling conflict in Afghanistan and would pave the way for a deal that could, ultimately, see the war end.

Mr. Pompeo said that intra-Afghan negotiations would begin shortly after the February 29 signing, expected to take place in the Qatari capital Doha.

They will “build on this fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political roadmap for Afghanistan,” he said.

15,2020/02/21,Pakistan retained on grey list of FATF,"Global watchdog gives Islamabad a stern warning to comply with terror finance action by June 2020

Pakistan has been retained on the “grey list” of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for another four months, with a stern warning from the global watchdog that met in Paris (February 19-21) to complete the 27-point action plan it has been given by June 2020 or face being put on the “black list”.

“All deadlines in the action plan have expired. While noting recent and notable improvements, the FATF again expresses concern given Pakistan’s failure to complete its action plan in line with the agreed timelines and in light of the Terror Financing risks emanating from the jurisdiction,” a statement issued by the FATF’s plenary session on Friday said.

According to the FATF summary report released on Friday evening, Pakistan needs to continue to work on eight specific areas, including demonstrating it is “identifying and investigating” all terror financing activity in the country, freezing the funds of all designated terrorists and that its prosecutions result in “effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions” against all terror entities in Pakistan.

Pakistan was given a deadline of September 2019 to complete the tasks that included shutting down all access to funding of United Nations Security Council designated terrorist groups, including the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad and prosecuting their leadership for any access to finance, as well as tightening laws and banking security norms that deal with them.

In November 2019, after Pakistan was judged to have complied with only four points of the action plan, the FATF extended the deadline to February, where its statement noted it had been cleared of 14 points. The FATF urged Pakistan to “swiftly complete” the remainder of the list.

“Otherwise, should significant and sustainable progress especially in prosecuting and penalising Terror Financing not be made by the next Plenary, the FATF will take action, which could include the FATF calling on its members and urging all jurisdiction to advise their Financial Institutions to give special attention to business relations and transactions with Pakistan,” the world body said its strongest warning yet.

A high-level team from Pakistan was present at the plenary to defend Pakistan’s record, while delegations of security and diplomatic officials from the 39-member body, which includes India, attended the meeting.

The “black list” refers to countries for who there has been a “call to action” or strict banking and international finance sanctions, a list which at present includes Iran and North Korea. Pakistan is one of the 12 countries on the “grey list” or “other monitored jurisdictions” that are being reviewed for actions to stop terror financing and money laundering.

Pakistan has been lobbying to get off the grey list, citing actions already taken, and reportedly has the backing of Turkey to be removed from the list entirely.

Significantly, even Indian government officials said placing Pakistan on the black list might prove counter-productive, as it would not be incentivised to complete the action plan under a deadline. Pakistan has been on the grey list in the past as well, including between 2012-2015, after which it was taken off the watch list until 2018.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k5hmis/article30881829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FATF-plenary-roomjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-retained-on-grey-list-of-fatf/article30880521.ece

Dr. Peng Yinhua, doctor of a Wuhan hospital who treated patients infected with the coronavirus, died on Thursday night, according to the health bureau.

Peng, a respiratory acute care medical professional, became infected while working to combat the novel coronavirus at the First People’s Hospital of Jiangxia District of Wuhan. He was hospitalised on January 25 and transferred to the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital for treatment on January 30.

“Peng Yinhua, a frontline doctor at Jiangxia First Hospital in virus epicenter #Wuhan, died of #COVID19 on Thursday night. He had earlier delayed his wedding as he wanted to treat patients with the disease at hospital,” State-run Global Times tweeted on Friday.

He died from the virus despite doctors’ all-out efforts to save his life.

Chinese health authorities have asked health agencies to apply for the honour of martyr for deceased medical staff to the veteran’s affairs authorities, comfort the families of the deceased and help solve their difficulties, as well as publicise stories of those who sacrificed their lives during the epidemic, State-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old Chinese doctor, who was one of the first people to sound the alarm about the new outbreak died on February 7.

Li sent a message to his medical-school alumni group on December 30, warning that seven patients had been quarantined at Wuhan Central Hospital after coming down with a respiratory illness that seemed like the SARS coronavirus. But Wuhan police reprimanded and silenced Li.

Earlier, Dr. Liu Zhiming, head of the Wuchang Hospital succumbed to the virus. On the same day Liu Fan, senior nurse of the hospital, died along with her parents and brother due to the virus.

China’s National Health Commission earlier said that a total of 1,716 medical workers had contracted the infection as of February 11.

Pakistan is already finalising major amendments to at least a dozen of its laws to meet the FATF requirements by June this year and sentenced Mumbai attack mastermind and JuD chief Hafiz Saeed to 11 years in two cases of terror financing on February 12.

Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the U.S. has placed a $10 million bounty on, was arrested on July 17 in the terror financing cases. The 70-year-old fiery cleric is lodged at the high-security Kot Lakhpat jail here.

19,2020/02/21,‘We were eating our meal when the shooter entered’: survivor recounts Hanau attack,"Suspected gunman published racist manifesto, says German prosecutor

A man suspected of shooting dead nine people in shisha bars in a German town before killing himself and his mother had posted a manifesto online including conspiracy theories and deeply racist views, prosecutors said on Thursday.

The presumed attacker — a 43-year-old German man identified as Tobias R. — was found dead close to a gun soon after the shootings late on Wednesday in Hanau, near Frankfurt, authorities said.

At least five of the victims were Turkish nationals, Ankara's ambassador to Berlin told state broadcaster TRT Haber as his government demanded robust action.

Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the “poison” of racism. Her deputy, Olaf Scholz, took to Twitter to say: “Politically, nobody can deny that 75 years after the Nazi dictatorship there is real terror again”.

The gunman burst into in a bar in downtown Hanau then drove to a second bar in town and opened fire again, police and witnesses said.

“First we heard five or six rounds of gunfire,” a German-Turkish survivor who gave his name as Muhammed told Reuters from his hospital bed in Hanau.

“Then I saw the man entering. I was eating my meal at that time. We were all eating. We gave orders. The man entered,” he said, sobbing. “We were 10 to 12 people. Two, three or four people managed to survive. I am one of them.”

Officers chased a car leaving the scene of the last shooting to another address, where they found the bodies of the suspect and his 72-year-old mother, both with gunshot wounds, police said.

“On the suspected perpetrator's home page, he had put up video messages and a kind of manifesto that, in addition to obscure thoughts and absurd conspiracy theories, pointed to deeply racist views,” said Prosecutor General Peter Frank.

In this image taken from an undated self-recorded video, a man who identifies himself as Tobias Rathjen makes a statement. The 43-year-old German man, who posted a manifesto calling for the ""complete extermination"" of many ""races or cultures in our midst"", shot and killed nine people of foreign background. German media have identified the gunman as Tobias Rathjen, and police said the shooter was Tobias R., without providing his full last name. | Photo Credit: AP

Frank told reporters the nine people shot dead had immigrant backgrounds. His office later said they included German citizens and foreigners aged between 21 and 44. Six more people were injured in the attack, one seriously.

Vigils held

Thousands of people gathered for candlelight vigils in about 50 German cities on Thursday evening. In Hanau, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told crowds that Germans and foreigners should unite to defeat racism.

“We are mourning, we are taking part in vigils and we see that we are united both in our mourning and against racism and violence,” Steinmeier said after laying a wreath outside one of the shisha bars.

The Confederation of the Communities of Kurdistan in Germany said several victims were Kurdish and accused Germany's political leaders of “not resolutely opposing right-wing networks and right-wing terrorism”.

Germany is home to three million people of Turkish origin including one million ethnic Kurds.

Bulgarian public broadcaster BNT said a 32-year-old Bulgarian man was among the victims.

Merkel, whose decision to welcome almost one million asylum seekers in 2015 contributed to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, told reporters: “Racism is poison, hatred is poison and this poison exists in society and it is to blame for too many crimes.”

In October, an anti-Semitic gunman opened fire outside a German synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, and in a kebab restaurant in the eastern city of Halle, killing two people as he livestreamed his attacks.

In June, a far-right sympathiser was accused of shooting dead a pro-immigration politician.

20,2020/02/21,"Coronavirus: death toll in China touches 2,200","China says it has changed the the method of counting patients with the novel coronavirus for the second time in eight days.

The death toll in China from the coronavirus epidemic rose to 2,233 on Friday after 115 more people died in Hubei province, the hard-hit epicentre of the outbreak.

The vast majority of the deaths were in the provincial capital of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, according to a daily update from the Hubei health commission.

Also Read All about the China coronavirus COVID-19

Around 75,000 people have been infected by the new coronavirus in China, and hundreds more in over 25 countries.

The Hubei health commission said there were 411 new cases of the virus in the province, with 319 in Wuhan and the rest spread out across several other cities.

China said on Thursday that it had once again changed the method of counting patients with the novel coronavirus and will now include only those diagnosed by laboratory tests.

It was the second revision of criteria in just eight days, a move that could muddle statistics and complicate efforts to track the spread of the illness.

Chinese health officials had last week said that patients from Hubei who had been diagnosed through clinical methods including lung imaging would be added to the count in addition to those confirmed by lab tests.

That led to a huge one-day increase in the number of confirmed cases — 14,840 — on February 13.

The change was blamed on a backlog of patients awaiting nucleic acid tests whose condition was deteriorating and needed urgent treatment.

21,2020/02/21,Boat carrying 91 migrants goes missing in Mediterranean,"The inflatable boat carrying mostly African migrants departed from al-Qarbouli, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the capital Tripoli on February 8

A rubber dinghy packed with 91 migrants that set out from Libyan shores in hopes of reaching Europe has apparently gone missing in the Mediterranean, the UN refugee agency said Thursday.

The inflatable boat carrying mostly African migrants departed from al-Qarbouli, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the capital Tripoli on February 8, said Osman Haroun, whose cousin was on board.

He hasn’t heard from the 27-year-old Mohamed Idris, or his 10 other friends also on the boat, since.

“It’s the first time I’ve heard of this happening,” Haroun told The Associated Press by phone from the western coastal district of Zawiya, where he has lived with his family since fleeing the conflict-ridden Darfur region of Sudan in 2016.

“Those who set out you usually hear from within a few hours ... no one has even seen the boat’s remains.”

News of the missing boat comes amid criticism of the European Union’s lack of rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea.

Member countries agreed earlier this week to end an anti-migrant smuggler operation involving only surveillance aircraft and instead deploy military ships to concentrate on upholding a widely flouted U.N. arms embargo that’s considered key to winding down Libya’s relentless war.

Alarm Phone, a crisis hotline for migrants in need of rescue at sea, drew attention Thursday to what it called an invisible shipwreck, urging Libyan, Maltese and Italian authorities to share information about the day’s rescue missions.

It said a black rubber boat with 91 people on board, reportedly hailing from Sudan, Niger, Iran and Mali, called the hotline in distress at 3:30 am February 9.

The passengers managed to share their GPS coordinates minutes later, which put them in international waters north of Libya.

Alarm Phone passed the SOS to Italian and Maltese authorities and to the Libyan coast guard, an EU-trained force criticized by human rights groups, which patrols Mediterranean waters and intercepts migrants to keep them from reaching European shores.

The Libyan coast guard took five hours to respond to Alarm Phone’s urgent request, and said it dispatched two ships to search for the missing vessel, without providing evidence.

Alarm Phone lost contact with the boat over two hours later, when it heard people panicking, saying the engine had failed. Migrants were slipping into the sea, they told the hotline, as water flooded the shrinking dinghy.

For sure something bad has happened, said Haroun.

The International Organization for Migration cross-checked search and rescue records from Italy, Malta, Libya and the non-governmental Aita Mari rescue ship, but could not match the missing migrant boat with any recent interceptions or rescues.

Italian, Maltese and Libyan authorities did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for information about their rescues. Frontex, the EU border agency, said it deployed a plane to search for the missing boat.

Authorities have also yet to respond to requests put forward by Alarm Phone on Monday.

Both Alarm Phone and IOM say they fear the worst.

Tragically, the last hypothesis is that this could be another invisible shipwreck, said Marta Shez, a project officer with IOM’s Missing Migrants project who examined the records.

Shez said IOM would wait a few days before officially recording the 91 people as missing, to see if any remains turn up.

The IOM tally of ghost boats lost in the Mediterranean Sea has been rising. Last year, the agency documented seven disappeared vessels carrying 417 people, a four-fold increase from the year before.

The migration agency sources its data from non-government organizations and testimony from families, and cross-references the reports against records of attempted crossings, rescues and interceptions.

Haroun, 29, said he and his cousin had repeatedly tried and failed to cross the Mediterranean throughout their years in Libya. As the North African country descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, it became a haven for smugglers ferrying African migrants to European shores.

22,2020/02/21,Trump adviser Roger Stone sentenced to 3 years and 4 months in prison for lying in Russia probe,"In a stern lecture during a 2-1/2-hour sentencing hearing for the veteran Republican operative, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson also delivered an implicit rebuke to Mr. Trump, who has attacked her along with the jury and prosecutors in the high-profile case.

A federal judge on Thursday sentenced President Donald Trump's long-time adviser Roger Stone to three years and four months in prison and said his lies to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election amounted to a threat to American democracy.

In a stern lecture during a 2-1/2-hour sentencing hearing for the veteran Republican operative, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson also delivered an implicit rebuke to Mr. Trump, who has attacked her along with the jury and prosecutors in the high-profile case.

“There was nothing unfair, phony or disgraceful about the investigation or the prosecution,” Judge Jackson said, citing words that the Republican president has used.

Stone's lawyer had asked that he get no prison time. The 67-year-old Stone, who has been a friend and adviser to Mr. Trump for decades, was convicted on Nov. 15 on all seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

“He was not prosecuted - as some have complained - for standing up for the president. He was prosecuted for covering up for the president,” Judge Jackson said.

“The truth still exists. The truth still matters,” Judge Jackson added. “Roger Stone's insistence that it doesn't, his belligerence, his pride in his own lies are a threat to our fundamental institutions - to the very foundation of our democracy.”

The judge also said Stone “knew exactly what he was doing” when he posted an image on social media last year that positioned a gun's cross-hairs over her head.

“The defendant engaged in threatening and intimidating conduct toward the court,” Judge Jackson said. “This is intolerable to the administration of justice.”

Stone, who still has a sealed pending motion requesting a new trial, declined to speak at the hearing. Clad in a dark gray pinstripe suit with a polka dot handkerchief in the pocket, Stone stood at a lectern as the judge announced the sentence.

After leaving, Stone told reporters, “I have nothing to say.” In a chaotic scene outside the courthouse, Stone walked through a throng of people with a slight smile on his face and climbed into a waiting vehicle.

Mr. Trump has stoked speculation he may pardon Stone. A prominent Trump ally, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, wrote on Twitter after the sentencing that the president has “all the authority in the world” to review the case.

Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, who now heads the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee to which Stone was convicted of lying, wrote on Twitter, “It should go without saying, but to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a breathtaking act of corruption.”

The White House had no immediate reaction.

On Tuesday, Trump granted clemency to prominent convicted white-collar criminals including financier Michael Milken and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.

Jackson's sentence fell well short of the seven to nine years that were initially recommended by the original prosecutors in the case before they were overruled by the Justice Department after Mr. Trump complained publicly. Those prosecutors quit the case. The judge said such a sentence was ”unnecessary” for Stone, who has no prior criminal record.

“This was still a very substantial sentence, especially for a non-violent, first time offender of his age,” said Mark Allenbaugh, a consultant who formerly worked for the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

'A human being’

Defense attorney Seth Ginsberg said Stone's career as a self-described “dirty trickster” overshadowed other aspects of a spiritual man who has served as a mentor, loves animals and is devoted to his family.

“Mr. Stone is, in fact, not simply that public persona, but a human being,” he said.

Stone was convicted of lying to the Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump's 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by Russian hackers.

The judge noted that Stone was not charged with or convicted of having any role in conspiring with Russia. But Jackson said Stone's effort to obstruct a congressional investigation into Russian election meddling “was deliberate, planned - not one isolated incident.” The investigators were not some “secret anti-Trump cabal,” the judge said, but members of Congress from both parties at the time when the committee was controlled by the president's fellow Republicans.

Stone's career as a Republican operative has stretched from the Watergate scandal era of the early 1970s to Trump's campaign four years ago. Stone has labeled himself an “agent provocateur” and famously has the face of former President Richard Nixon tattooed on his back.

Wearing sunglasses and a dark fedora as he entered the courthouse accompanied by an entourage of family, friends and lawyers, Stone strode past a giant inflatable rat dressed as Trump and a sign calling for his pardon. One onlooker shouted: “Traitor!”

The charges stemmed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Russian meddling in the 2016 election to boost Trump's candidacy. Stone was one of several Trump associates charged in Mueller's inquiry.

As the hearing got underway, Mr. Trump complained on Twitter that the Justice Department should have prosecuted the former head of the FBI, James Comey, and his former deputy, Andrew McCabe, for what the president said was lying. The Justice Department investigated but opted not to prosecute either man.

“FAIRNESS?” Trump asked on Twitter.

After prosecutors made their sentencing recommendation last week, Trump blasted them as “corrupt” and railed against this ”miscarriage of justice.” U.S. Attorney General William Barr intervened and the Justice Department overruled the recommendation. Congressional Democrats have accused Trump and Barr of politicizing the U.S. criminal justice system and threatening the rule of law.

Judge Jackson had sharp words for John Crabb, the prosecutor newly installed on the case after the original prosecutors quit.

“I fear you know less about the case ... than just about every other person in this courtroom apart from the defense attorney who just joined this team,” Judge Jackson told him.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/frw5hy/article30875025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-adviser-roger-stone-sentenced-to-3-years-and-4-months-in-prison-for-lying-in-russia-probe/article30875026.ece
23,2020/02/21,"Twitter tests labels, community moderation for lies by public figures","NBC News earlier reported that Twitter company documents showing a mock-up of the new approach were accessible on a publicly available website, although it did not identify the site

Twitter Inc said on Thursday that it was testing a new community moderation approach that would enable users to identify misleading information posted by politicians and public figures and add brightly coloured labels under those tweets.

NBC News earlier reported that Twitter company documents showing a mock-up of the new approach were accessible on a publicly available website, although it did not identify the site.

The company said the leaked illustrations showed one possible iteration of a new approach to combat misinformation.

“We’re exploring a number of ways to address misinformation and provide more context for Tweets on Twitter,” Twitter said in a statement. “This is a design mock-up for one option that would involve community feedback. Misinformation is a critical issue and we will be testing many different ways to address it.”

A spokesman said the project was in the early stages and not currently staffed.

The mock-up obtained by NBC News showed a plan to develop a “community reports” feature, which Twitter likened to Wikipedia. Twitter users would earn points and badges for rating “harmfully misleading” content.

Twitter and other social media companies are under intense pressure to stem lies and misinformation on their platforms.

They have introduced measures in recent months designed to head off interference in the U.S. presidential election in November, although critics say they are insufficient compared to the scale of the problem.

Twitter announced in the summer that it would label and de-emphasise tweets that broke its rules but came from important public figures like politicians. But it has not yet done so for any tweets.

The company also banned political ads in the fall and said earlier this month that it would apply “false” warning labels to tweets containing synthetic or deceptively edited forms of media and remove any that are likely to cause harm.

Democratic presidential contender Mike Bloomberg on Thursday tweeted a video of Wednesday night’s debate edited to make it appear as though other candidates were rendered speechless when he asked if any of them had started businesses.

The Twitter spokesman said the company would likely label Bloomberg’s tweet under the new policy on synthetic and deceptively edited media, which is set to come into effect on March 5.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/6d34u2/article30878259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21NETTWITTER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/twitter-tests-labels-community-moderation-for-lies-by-public-figures/article30878260.ece
24,2020/02/21,Google removes 600 disruptive apps from Play Store,"According to Google, one area of focus for the Ads team is developing new ways to detect disruptive ads shown outside of the app — for example, out-of-context ads from an app not currently in use

Google has removed nearly 600 “disruptive” Android apps from its Play Store, along with banning their developers who tricked users to click on ads.

According to the company, one area of focus for the Ads team is developing new ways to detect disruptive ads shown outside of the app — for example, out-of-context ads from an app not currently in use.

“This behaviour violates Google policies, so Google removes these apps from both AdMob and Play Store,” the company said in a statement late Thursday.

“Our investigations are ongoing and when we find violations we will continue to take action,” Google added.

According to Scott Spencer, VP, Product Management, Google Ads, one of the biggest threats to ad-supported content is ad fraud, a pervasive issue for users, developers, and advertisers alike.

“Google blacklisted numerous bad actors that were found to be committing large scale invalid traffic and ad fraud, which violates Google policies,” said Spencer.

In 2019, Google removed tens of thousands of apps and developers that were found to be in violation of its policies.

“Taking corrective action was an imperative step in protecting advertiser dollars, levelling the playing field for legitimate publishers, and removing bad app experiences for users,” said the tech giant.

As industry regulations evolve, Google is providing tools for app publishers to manage their compliance strategy, maintain user trust, and minimise the risk of losing revenue.

“Android is making fundamental platform changes to minimise interruptions in app experiences and keep the user more in control of what’s shown on their screen,” informed Google.

In addition to fighting ad fraud, the Google Play and Ads teams both announced new steps to help ensure that ad content served in apps for children is appropriate for their intended users.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/rq01sl/article30878246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21NETGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-removes-600-disruptive-apps-from-play-store/article30878247.ece
25,2020/02/21,Feeding the addiction: on Narcos: Mexico’s new season,"The show is made up of every single trope that defines not just gangster dramas, but the previous versions of 'Narcos' too

It is clear that ‘too much of a good thing’ is not an adage the Narcos creators live by.

The show, which began strictly as some sort of a Pablo Escobar biopic, has now gone on to spin an additional season off the lives of Columbia’s Cali Cartel, and an altogether new show called Narcos: Mexico, the second season of which premièred recently. Does it feel ‘new’, though? After all, Narcos: Mexico is made up of every single trope that defines not just gangster dramas, but previous versions of Narcos, too.

At the centre of the story, for example, is Félix Gallardo (Diego Luna), a gangster who rose through the ranks in the first season, but whose fall from grace is imminent now. In typical gangster movie fashion, acquiring power and success has distanced him from those he loves most — a wife who cannot recognise the man he is anymore, kids who don’t see him enough, and friends he had to betray to get to the top.

In addition, there are other obvious Narcos elements: American law enforcement officers (‘gringos’) whose lives are constantly in danger, small-time gangsters undergoing mid-life crises and wanting to get out of the ‘business’, and sneaky politicians who are more venomous than the dons. This is clearly a hit formula being re-purposed for as long as audiences haven’t had enough.

To be fair, though, there still seems to be some firepower left in the Narcos engine. I had my reservations about the last season — a trudging, long exercise that did little apart from setting up a singular plot point that would drive future storylines: the torture and murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena (Michael Peña) at the hands of Gallardo and his friends. This edition, though, benefits from the laborious work put into Season 1.

For starters, it gets off the blocks in no time. A group of American agents and a couple of their Mexican counterparts, headed by Walt Breslin, are on a mission to avenge Camarena’s death. This is a fascinating strand, only because for the first time in Narcos’ existence, we see the good guys function with the same alacrity and ruthlessness as the baddies. In a plot line that’s reminiscent of Steven Spielberg’s splendid Munich, Breslin and his boys go about abducting those responsible for Camarena’s capture and death. Starting with small leads, they work their way up, extracting a new name out of a hostage before either finishing him off, or transporting him to the US to stand trial. Scoot McNairy, as Breslin, is a terrific addition to the cast, his wry presence only less comforting than Pedro Pascal’s Peña in early seasons.

There’s a verve and energy to this new season that seems to emanate out of the realisation that relying on the tried-and-tested is going to wear the audience down soon. Yet, with all the fatigue arising from watching more of the same over and over again, there’s something continually seductive about Narcos. It is an addiction that’s hard to shake off, and much like the show’s on-screen antiheroes, the gringos at Netflix seem to know that delivering what the customer badly needs is good for business.

The second season of Narcos: Mexico is now streaming on Netflix.

26,2020/02/21,‘Varane Avashyamund’ has the kind of characters you’d like to meet and wish more of,"Dulquer Salmaan's latest movie is a perfect example of the simplicity in approach to human relationships that makes Malayalam cinema so endearing

The audience for mainstream Malayalam cinema in Bangalore has grown rapidly in the last couple of years. Films with the biggest of stars and the best feedback could garner only a few screens in what was assumed as localities with a sizeable Malayali population. The shows were also at unearthly hours thanks to the notion that people from Kerala were more hard-working and would not skip work for a film. This has taken long considering Bangalore is one city that welcomes good cinema irrespective of language but then that was a major barrier. The average Bangalorean can speak a smattering for Hindi, Telugu and Tamil but Malayalam eluded them probably because there were few settlers from Kerala.

Films starring Mohanlal and Mammootty drew crowds, but failed to lure localites and the ones that did not have them in the cast were considered niche. It was just a matter of time. I don’t mind taking a little credit because I incessantly pestered Vinay who distributes most of the Malayalam films released here to urge producers into subtitling the films. That’s also because I can’t understand Malayalam. Sometimes when I rave about certain films Vinay's response is ‘Vokay’ by their standards. He’s quick to add that what’s released in Bangalore is filtered and they make nearly as many bad movies as elsewhere which is some sort of consolation. ‘Varane Avashyamund’ marking Dulquer Salmaan’s debut as a producer has been released in nearly 30 screens across Bangalore .

There is a simplicity in approach to stories with the most complicated of equations in human relationships that makes Malayalam cinema endearing. It’s about a motley crowd of people inhabiting an apartment complex sharing relationships that seem impractical but justified by scenes which make us wish it were true. It’s unreal but not many want to pay and share woes of strangers onscreen. None of the characters have a bad bone in their body. It’s an apartment complex but the doors are always open and none seem to be in their own house most of the time.

The initial scenes appear awkward in the hands of debutante director Anoop Sathyan, son of the redoubtable Sathyan Antikad as he introduces a crowd of characters, but gets hold of the reins when the emotional entanglements are established. There’s the heroine played by Kalyani Priyadarshan who’s bent upon having an arranged alliance probably because of an estranged father thanks to the physical abuse her mother suffered. Her mother is the elegant Shobana who teaches French, knows she’s beautiful and preens when her looks are praised. There’s the introverted former army Major (a superbly restrained Suresh Gopi) with anger management issues and Dulquer Salman who constantly wrestles with his much younger sibling and their serial actress guardian. The narration seems choppy because Anoop is keen on giving everyone quality screen time making some scenes seem abrupt. It’s the delicious nuggets that he dishes out be it about the food exchanged or the way tiny family niggles are dealt with that makes up. Set in Chennai, watch the landlady who draws Rangoli on her tenants doorsteps because she missed doing it when on a holiday!

There’s Dulquer who unleashes his serial star guardian when he’s refused a cooking gas connection and gets it in a jiffy. Take a note of the dig at TV soaps when eager neighbours are keen to know when a character will be bumped off and the lady says it’ll take one month of tantalizing scenes running up to it. There are tiny digs taken at the star wars between Ajit and Vijay too.

The most memorable scenes are between Kalyani and her prospective mother-in-law played by the amazing Urvashi. The scene where she reveals the marriage will not happen because her son turned out to be more like his father and Kalyani later mentioning to her mother that she missed her prospective mother-in-law more than the groom is touching.

We have Shobana, so she gets to dance in a scene and Suresh Gopi bashes a few baddies but the blossoming of their relationship is sensitively handled. It’s a longing for companionship rather than love and in a casting coup the pair does full justice. Suresh Gopi is a revelation. You know he's overcome anger when a domestic help looks at the decorations on his army coat and exclaims he’d look like Kamal in ‘Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu’ wearing it and he doesn’t react!

Melodrama is anathema in Malayalam cinema, and even the seemingly most explosive of scenes are handled with maturity rather than unnecessary outbursts. Dulquer is aware the plot is the hero and keeps barging into scenes periodically rather than hogging them. Kalyani is minimalistic .You can nitpick but ‘Varane Avashyamund’ has the kind of characters you’d like to meet and wish the world had more of them.

27,2020/02/21,Modern mystery in jazz: How 'Knives Out' turned the audience into a community of ‘crowd’ detectives,"The crime mystery genre has evolved over the years, with Daniel Craig's latest a case in point, as the viewers are inspired to speculate and investigate alongside Benoit Blan

This year’s Oscars (2020) was perhaps one of the toughest for the jury in terms of choosing the best among excellent films in the category of Original Screenplay. Each of the nominees were spearheading innovation in different genres of films. The films dealt with interpersonal relationships (Marraige Story), societal pressures (Parasite), the subject of war and turmoil (1917), the Charles Manson murders and emergence of spaghetti westerns (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) and a twisted crime scene investigation (Knives Out). The crime mystery genre has evolved over the years in terms of extrapolation of events, investigation of the evidence, mixing the timelines, and following clues.

Absorbing a crime-mystery thriller is like walking through a dense rainforest. There is a common thread to every crime mystery story. Usually, there is a dead person and we often follow a series of events which walk us through a maze of clues, circles of suspicion and various sensorial cues. Our perspectives are built using our past experiences of reading thriller books or films. A James Hadley Chase book makes us journey through a web of character developments and incidents that trigger a cyclone of events. On the other hand, an author like Agatha Christie internalizes the mystery by placing the reader directly into the crime scene by describing clues, leading us into a detailed crime scene investigation. Arthur Conan Doyle externalizes a similar experience through the persona of Sherlock Holmes, with his peculiar mannerisms and quirky methods. In cinema, the genre of mystery thrillers have been explored in extensive ways by directors like Hitchcock, Jacques Turnuer through unusual methods of character introduction, narrative intersections and plot dissection.

Rian Johnson manages to coalesce these various interpretations of crime-mystery and transmute them to a unique form in his latest directorial venture, Knives Out (2019). Knives Out is set in the huge cosy mansion of Harlan Thrombey in the middle of a cold mountainous region with winter trees growing old with grace. The music composer, Nathan Johnson, introduces the historical, heritage-rich setting of the home and its interiors, through western classical music reminiscent of the Renaissance period. In a classic opening sequence of the movie, the housekeeper, Fran (played by Edi Patterson), gasps upon finding Harlan Thrombey (played by Christopher Plummer), dead in his private room following the night of his 85th birthday party.

All members of the family are summoned for questioning by a group of detectives, led by the suave Benoit Blanc (played by Daniel Craig), a man who has a repertoire of solving impossible crime scenarios with his lukewarm vigour. Each of the suspects are related in some way to Harlan Thrombey, a rich business man and a prolific mystery writer who is generous with money but also has a skill of knowing people of heart and sensing greed or jealousy.

Rian Johnson with the editor, Bob Ducsay, brings to the fore a smart modern style of editing interrogative sessions, where the pieces of evidence are conveyed through questions coming from the detective on one end and the answers coming out from a different suspect, each time adding a new flavour to the existing sequence of events. A cloudy, hazy narrative of a sequence develops, as described by each member of the household.

The assistant detective listens to the suspects while Benoit Blanc, sits calmly next to a piano keenly digesting these pieces of talk, absorbing the flavour of their behaviours like a wine-taster taking a whiff at his glass of evidence. Blanc is placed out of focus in these initial scenes. Each time the narrative risks dilution with a potential lie from the suspects, Daniel Craig taps a sharp note on the grand piano like a gong of a conscience clock. The crime scene is sculpted like fragments being pasted together into a collage. Neither on the side of conclusion nor on the side of complete dismissal, the audience is personified in this piano sitting in the interrogation room.

Finally, we are introduced to Marta Cabrera (played by Ana De Armas), Harlan’s most favourite companion and housekeeper who gives him his medications and plays board games with him, particularly good at “Go”. A subsequent peek into Marta’s conscience and a recollection of events on the night of the alleged ‘suicide’ of Harlan Thrombey places us into a different thread of the same quilt of events. The repetitive style of the different POV angles of the same event are reminiscent of Run Lola Run (1998) and Amores Perros (2000).

What follows in Marta’s narrative shifts our suspicions in fascinating and shocking ways. Wanetta ""Great Nana"" Thrombey (played by K. Callan), Harlan’s elderly mother, who sits at the door uttering no words, lost in thought, eating her cake and keenly observing each person’s behaviour with her loving, yet eagle-sharp eyes, wins our hearts during the reconstruction of the party night. She shares her personality closely with Benoit Blanc. Both of them are passive observers of the truth and speak when spoken to, except that the Great Nana speaks only through her eyes.

The southern accent on Daniel Craig blends magnificently with the observant and truth loving personality of the curious character of Benoit Blanc. Daniel Craig embodies a vulnerable yet strong personality, slowly chewing on to his thoughts, speaking when the time is right and focussing a carefully concentrated throw of each word like a golfer timing his last putt to precision.

Music binds us to the plot between layers of unrest, suspicion and mood changes. The mood board has a variety of colors like humour, pain, shock, anger, fear, greed, jealousy, each of which can be vividly explored musically due to the vibrancy of the script. One way of perceiving the genre of jazz music is that it is a study in arrangement of notes, chords and percussion in unusual routes, often dismissing the obvious and the dominant, in a family of scales or time signatures. Jazz is intimately analogous to a carefully tailored mystery story where the notes can be events, the scale can be each person’s narrative and each person can be an instrument having different timbres.

Benoit Blanc is finally able to notice the hole in the ‘donut hole’ within the donut, while the musical flourish of the accentuated snares unleash the ‘final reveal’ with style and vigour.

Benoit Blanc resembles a patient percussionist, accompanying the noisy trumpet sections, the Thrombey family members, while they swim in their lies and greed, eccentric in their volume and rhythm.

Great Nana is the pianist, playing her intricate notes softly keenly observing the percussionist. Marta resembles the nervous singer singing out her heart, pausing at times of chaotic instrumental invasion. The cast resembles a jazz ensemble coming out of a different tunnel at the end of each song.

We as an audience, are invited to solve the mystery as a community of ‘crowd’ detectives, inspired to speculate and investigate alongside Benoit Blanc. The theatre is filled with murmurs of people's anticipations, theories and gut feelings. The rigorously nurtured interpretation of a refined, distilled and detailed script transcends the experience of reading a novel to a participative multi-sensorial experience with the characters of a tightly knit plot.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/l9cnpd/article30879300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGF,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/modern-mystery-in-jazz-how-knives-out-turned-the-audience-into-a-community-of-crowd-detectives/article30879303.ece
28,2020/02/21,"'Locke & Key': Too many keys, but too few thrills in Netflix's latest horror drama","Unlike other shows in the same genre like 'Stranger Things' or 'The Haunting of Hill House', this outing fails to make the relationships between their characters grow gradually

Netflix’s latest horror drama, Locke & Key, sizzles with promise and fun in the first few episodes and then dies down as the makers run out of tropes to rehash. The young-adult vibe it gives off is similar to the one you find in Stranger Things, an actual blockbuster offering from the friendly streaming giant.

This series, even with more or less the same amount of intriguing ingredients as Stranger Things, appears as a juvenile attempt at building a world that’s full of magical keys and demons. The ten-episode season centers on the Lockes who’re dealing with the loss of the patriarch, Rendell Locke (Bill Heck). His wife, Nina (Darby Stanchfield), isn’t the one to just accept her fate and move on. She wants to find out why a school student wanted to learn about Rendell’s ancestral home “Key House” – the answer to which Rendell didn’t want to readily hand out and ended up getting murdered. It’s indeed a cunning setup that allows the crumbs of sinister to grow in volume as each of the tree children, Tyler Locke (Connor Jessup), Kinsey Locke (Emilia Jones), and Bode Locke (Jackson Robert Scott), figures out different ways to understand and piece together the puzzle that left their home broken.

As in The Haunting of Hill House, there’s a mansion in Locke & Key (Key House) where the youngest kid, Bode, runs around and explores all the rooms and picks up noises that seem to whisper to him. While the exterior shots that capture the length and breadth of the property are eye-candy-ish, the insides look like they’ve been accommodating secrets from the seventeenth century. Well, at the end of the day, it’s a horror series, so the mysteries must keep tapping on the viewers’ screens!

Now, this is also the place that Rendell hesitated to visit when he was alive. His brother, Duncan (Aaron Ashmore), too, doesn’t wish to live there and his memories about the house are hazy. And he has somehow forgotten the details related to Rendell’s friends and the mischievous activities he was engaged in as a teenager. In the first episode, there’s a scene where Nina enters a mirror and gets lost. As her screams start to grow louder, Tyler walks through the same mirror with a rope tied around his waist (to get back to the real world without bothering about the labyrinths) and follows her voice to reach her. It’s a fantastically written television moment that uses mirrors as a trap, and it relies on the strength of art direction and visual effects. But, since such scenes are few and far between, I couldn’t sit through the entire run of the show without looking miffed.

The various keys that Bode and his siblings find, like the “Head Key” that permits them to step into their own minds, or those of the others’, are mind-boggling. Kinsey’s mind, which is designed as a shopping mall, holds thousands of memories and a demon that attacks people she’s afraid of. Similarly, other keys possess great powers, too. The “Ghost Key” allows the holder to observe the goings-on from above like a ghost. And the “Anywhere Key” lets a person go to any part of the world by simply inserting the key into the lock and pushing the door open. All these might sound as crazy and bombastic ideas and Bode even revels in tomfoolery for a while, however, everything isn’t hunky-dory always.

Locke & Key is based on the comic book series of the same name by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez; hence the detailing appears rich. But what gained Stranger Things and The Haunting of Hill House online and offline fans is their ability to make the relationships between their characters grow gradually. The rare bond that the teenagers shared in the sci-fi horror series and the thorns around which the siblings trundled in the latter aren’t impossible to replicate. Nevertheless, when there are better and well-established versions of such kinds of horror shows, why would the home audiences line up for Locke & Key in the new decade?",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/rtqxhh/article30879251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bg01jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/locke-key-too-many-keys-but-too-few-thrills-in-netflixs-latest-horror-drama/article30879262.ece
29,2020/02/21,"Find out what makes G R Mani Studio, the oldest photo studio in Madurai, still tick","Forever frames: G R Mani Studio, whose history is entwined with the city’s, is the oldest photo studio in the region. What makes it tick? We meet the founding family to find out

A 100 years, four generations of shutterbugs, and still going strong. G R Mani Studio in Puthuthopu, Ponnagaram, has outlived several others from yesteryear.

“My father G Rajamani started this studio in 1920,” says R Mani Nathaniel, whose son M Israel Charles runs the studio at present. “Initially, it functioned from a small space on Town Hall road,” recalls the 87-year-old. He remembers his father photographing the first Bishop of Ramnad diocese, who was an Englishman. “My father was a household name as he was an artist too,” says Nathaniel, adding, “Only artists qualified to become photographers back then because it took artistic skills to enhance the frames and thrive in the field.”

The studio is a landmark in the city. In fact, the Madurai Corporation renamed the erstwhile Annamalai Chetty Lane, where the original studio stood as G R Mani Studio Street in 1999. Today, it stands a few shops away on the same street.

Given the studio’s popularity, the family is planning to celebrate their completion of 100 years. “We hope to revive old memories,” says Charles, unwilling to reveal more.

Nathaniel says that photography was a risky profession to venture into in the early 20th Century. “People believed that their lifespan reduced if they were photographed,” he says. Also, only the wealthy could afford taking photographs. Nathaniel remembers some of his strange assignments where he had to click photographs of the dead.

“The deceased would be seated in an upright position in a chair a few hours before the funeral. It was the order of the day to take a photograph in that posture for remembrance,” he says. Later, the photographer would work on the photo, painting the face and sketching the eyes. The 2014 Tamil film Mundasupatti shows something to this effect.

The first camera Rajamani used was a Madras Kotak with a tripod, which was manual and colloquially called the ‘full-size body’ then. “We used to buy film rolls and spare parts from the now defunct The Photo Bharat Emporium in The American college complex. We also went to the Photo Trade Centre in Madras. We had our own red light room or dark room for developing the photos,” explains Nathaniel, whose favourite camera remains the Canon Mark 4.

Photography, back then, was time-consuming and laborious. “We used hydrochloric acid, bromide paper, sulphide and benzoin tincture for processing photo films. It took nearly a fortnight to finish one roll,” he recalls.

Until the digital age dawned, they took proof copies of the photos in a single bromide sheet and the customer picked the ones he wanted developed. “Also, we used a pencil to do shadow correction in the final frame. Vintage Panama blades were used to scrape off the edges and we would mount the photo in a presser. Sometimes, to complete orders on time, one of us would stand on the reversed frame to apply pressure on the film for drying and straightening it,” recalls Nathaniel, adding, “We used honey wax along with spirit and zinc powder to paste photos on the frame. The cost of passport size photos was ₹2 for three copies and a full-size photo costed ₹3.”

Charles says theirs was the first studio in the city to introduce colour photographs in 1985 and they went fully digital by 2003. “Initially, I struggled to learn Adobe Photoshop, that has altered the world of photography to unprecedented levels,” he says. During Indira Gandhi’s visit to Madurai in 1979, his father was appointed to click her photographs. And his grandfather was the photographer during Mahatma Gandhi’s first visit to Madurai in 1919! Nathaniel also feels proud about photographing the late M G Ramachandran, actor and former Tamil Nadu CM, when he came to Madurai for his election campaign in 1972.

Models of some of the precious old cameras, still in working condition, have been preserved by the family. Charles’s son, I Joshua Delight, is now readying himself to take on the family baton. Trained in photography from childhood, he is familiar with Photoshop and other modern techniques.

‘Poo Thaithal’, meaning ‘Stitching of flowers’ on the hair, was a popular ritual back then. Nathaniel recalls the many photo sessions with young girls who wore an elaborate arrangement of flowers on their braid. “The classic pose was to stand with her back to the mirror so that her braid was captured in full glory,” he smiles.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/bw4vdg/article30881857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Old-Cover-Studio1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/g-r-mani-studio-whose-history-is-entwined-with-the-citys-is-the-oldest-photo-studio-in-the-region-what-makes-it-tick-we-meet-the-founding-family-to-find-out/article30881863.ece
30,2020/02/21,The butterfly effect in Kochi,"Spot the State butterfly—Malabar Banded Peacock or the Buddha Mayoori— and more at dedicated parks in the city

Maharaja’s College, whose campus sprawls over 25 acres populated with trees, will soon get a butterfly park. The botany and zoology departments together have drawn up a plan to build an aesthetic garden in the “central circle” of the campus to promote public awareness on butterfly species and their conservation. It would also serve as a centre for in situ conservation.

The park is one of the many greening initiatives adopted by the college, which includes a Miyawaki forest in the offing. Miyawaki forests can be made by planting native species trees in the same area, which grow into a dense, native forest. The technique is pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki. Stephen Sequeira, Assistant Professor, Department of Botany, says the proposed park is expected to attract over 50 species of butterflies to the campus. Students have so far recorded only around 20 species over different periods of time.

Maharaja’s is one of the latest to introduce a butterfly park to its campus. A handful of institutions including schools in the city have already set up butterfly gardens.

As part of an initiative launched by the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), along with the State Government, biodiversity parks were set up in government schools about two-and-a-half years ago. “The idea was to help children get introduced to butterflies, but we realised it helped them learn about a number of plant and tree species too,” says Soumya Anil, an entomologist who had formerly worked with KFRI for 10 years and helped set up butterfly parks in about 70-100 schools across the State.

A BUTTERFLY TOUR Kalypso Adventures, an adventure, nature, and eco-tourism company, conducts butterfly tours for those who enjoy spending quiet time watching the winged creatures. The package is a part of the larger bird-watching and dragon-fly tour, which the company undertakes. The tour along the Western Ghats would have a field guide. The tours are planned according to the season. December to May is considered to be a good time to watch butterflies in Kerala.

“Butterfly parks are miniature biodiversity spheres. Extremely sensitive to changes in the environment, they can serve as indicators of climate change,” says Soumya, who has authored a number of articles on butterflies for journals and contemporary publications.

For most children whose lives are far removed from nature, watching the life cycle of a butterfly in close quarters is fascinating, says Teresa Fernandez, a teacher at Nava Nirman Public School, which set up a butterfly garden as part of a project last year. The park now attracts a number of butterfly species. Vidyodaya School at Thevakkal too had set up a park in 2018. A gelatine factory in Koratty has developed a garden of medicinal plants, which began attracting butterflies, leading to the formation of a butterfly garden.

SUMMER WALK with sammilan shetty Wildlife conservationist Sammilan Shetty, who has set up a butterfly park at Belvai in Moodabidri (Dakshina Kannada District), will organise a “Summer Walk with Butterflies”, on February 22 and 23 in the Western Ghats. The participants will watch “mud-puddling”, a social activity of butterflies where hundreds of them gather on river banks to feed on minerals. Some of the species that can be spotted at the summer walk are the Five-bar Swordtail, Malabar Raven, Painted Saw Tooth, Chocolate Albatross, Common Jay, Common Blue Bottle and the Great Orange Tip to name a few. For more information call 9845993292

All it needs to create a butterfly park is an open space, which should include a sunny area, a water-body, a shady area and host plants. Each butterfly species has host plants, on which they depend for subsistence. “Many may not be aware that the plants we find in plenty in our surroundings could be hosts to some of the prettiest of butterflies,” says Soumya. For instance, the curry leaf plant acts as a host to the Common Mormon, a brightly-coloured butterfly species; the kanikkonna attracts the Common Emigrant.

Kerala has about 326 species of butterflies; but the numbers keep fluctuating, says Soumya. The Malabar Banded Peacock or the Buddha Mayoori, which was recently declared the ‘State Butterfly’, is decreasing in numbers owing largely to the decline of its host, the mullilam tree (Indian Prickly Ash), which is a raw material for the matchbox industry.

“While conserving a butterfly species, an entire eco-system is being conserved,” says Soumya.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/educational-institutions-and-organisations-in-kochi-are-setting-up-butterfly-parks/article30881338.ece
31,2020/02/21,Let’s hear it for New York,"What’s good for the American is not good for the Indian

IHeartNY Uncle is visiting. He opens his suitcase. “Here, my boy, IHeartNY cap for you.” He gives me the same cap every year. By now, Mummy’s bonsai and lampshades also wear IHeartNY caps, or else what to do with so many? He pulls out treasure for my other cousins: “Snickers for you and Mars for you.” I tell IHeartNY Uncle that our corner shop, too, sells Buy2KnickersGet1Free. He mutters, “This is the trouble with free trade. Free to have all things cheaper here. Devaluing brands.”

As we sit to eat, IHateFree Uncle opens the foreign liquor bottle which he gave Papa. He announces, “I only eat trans fat-free, gluten-free, lactose-free, please.” Mummy looks frantically at ILikeSomeThingsFree Uncle. Now what to do with the paneer masala floating in oil? Uncle pacifies her, “If it is olive oil, it is OK. Or even coconut oil. Now the West is adopting all things Indian, like yoga and coconut oil.” Mummy looks at my sister’s oily plaits and sends her to get the coconut oil from the bathroom to make parathas with. “Don’t worry,” Uncle says sweetly, “I can make do with quinoa.” I am sent to the corner shop to get quinoa and watercress. After checking Google Translate, the shopkeeper asks, “Why seeds and leaves? For feeding pigeons?”

When I return, they are talking politics. Uncle is saying Trump is racist. He doesn’t want immigrants. “How dare he? I too am immigrant and I am American,” IHeartImmigrant Uncle says. His son is protesting on the streets because multiculturalism and diversity and tolerance will strengthen the country. “I agree, same here,” says Papa. IHeartTolerance Uncle roars with rage. “Here? Here, we have no place for multiculturalism and diversity and tolerance. Jail those immigrants and students protesting on the streets!”

Now Uncle is in full flow, the foreign bottle is over and Papa has opened Old Monk. Uncle is shouting, “India is the greatest in the world.” I ask Uncle why he swore allegiance to America (even though swearing is not allowed at home), when he thinks India is greatest. “Because my heart is Indian,” he thumps his chest with his IHeartNY cap.

I say, “But Papa said you heart your foreign passport more and will never come back.” ILoveOldMonk Uncle points at me. “No respect! Indian children now are spoilt by western values. Schools should return to ancient times – ancient Indian values, culture.” I ask him why his son is struggling to get into those Ivy Leagues then instead of returning to study in ancient times.

Papa quickly sends me out to buy sparkling water. The fresh, pure foreign air has weakened poor Uncle’s immunity and he cannot drink our water or breathe our air without getting sick now. “It is for my IAmFromForeign Uncle,” I explain. The shopkeeper smiles, “I have Made-in-Foreign chocolates. Take these Buy2KnickersGet1Free.”

32,2020/02/21,A cup of coffee costs one kilogram of plastic here,"Plastic parlour in Visakhapatnam will serve you a hot beverage, cookies and even breakfast at a never-before cost

Joggers and walkers on Beach Road can’t miss the makeshift stall with a table covered with cookie jars, flasks of coffee and paper cups. This is the Plastic Parlour, recently launched as an initiative of the India Youth for Society with the blessings of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation. The stall is set up every morning at 6 am and dispenses coffee and cookies till 8 am. What does the cup of coffee cost? A kilogram of plastic waste!

“We consider one kilogram of plastic equivalent to ₹ 20. So a kilo will fetch you a cup of coffee, two kilos will fetch you a cloth bag and four kilos, a jute bag,” says Appala Reddy, president of the society. If you are flush with three kilos of plastic, then you can treat yourself to a breakfast of a cup of milk, two biscuits, a banana and an egg.

Slipping performance Adjudged the third cleanest in India in 2017, by the Swacch Survekshan Survey, Visakhapatnam has squandered that rank since. In 2018, the city slid down to seventh position and in 2019 it stands at 23rd position. This year has begun on a good note for the city as the official handle of Swachh Bharat Urban recently tweeted about the city’s clean roads and appreciated GVMC and the citizens for their efforts.

I go there to see for myself. I lug along my own plastic waste of two kilos and reach at 7 am. I can’t spot it right away amidst the many other tea and ragi malt stalls that are set up every morning on the Beach Road. Then I catch sight of a green banner with ‘Plastic Parlour’ painted in white, tied to the fence of Park for Children with All Abilities. There is the stall all right, but where are the people queueing up? I am disappointed to see just two volunteers waiting for people and their plastic waste to show up. One or two joggers do slow down long enough to enquire about the initiative, but that is all. I leave my plastic containers there, drink a lonely cup of coffee and head home, crestfallen.

Guilt-free coffee When 24-year-old Sudixa Majumdar learnt about the initiative, she was delighted because now she could do something about all the plastic that she couldn’t bring herself to throw out for several months. “I moved to the city recently and since wet and dry waste are not collected separately, I began keeping aside PET bottles and takeaway containers. I am relieved that I can deposit my plastic discards at this Parlour and need not feel guilty of adding to the waste in the landfill. Oh yes, the coffee at Plastic Parlour is very good!” says the resident of Siripuram.

While the proximity of the collection point to her residence made it possible for Sudixa to dispose her waste responsibly, it would be a long way for V Kalpana, a resident of Allipuram to travel six kilometres to dispose a few kilograms of plastic. “It is not possible for everyone to travel so far especially on weekdays as we are expected to reach office by 9 am. It would have been helpful if the organisation offered door-to-door collection or at least set up two or three more collection points across the city,” she says. Currently, Kalpana tries to upcycle her plastic bottles by converting them into planters or pen stands.

When I asked Appala, he said that the initial day or two had seen an overwhelming response. The parlour earned 43 kilograms of waste all of it from only nine people. Sadly, the enthusiasm is less hearty now and so far only 110 kilograms of plastic waste has been deposited with them. Source segregation is a problem, admits Appala. “People need to realise that mixing dry and wet waste will just make garbage pile up in the landfills. The authorities too, need to educate people in a better way so that they understand the hazards of reckless dumping.”

The society hopes to encourage people to also deposit low-density plastic waste that is generally not accepted by the kaadiwalas. “Plastic waste is not just bottles and containers. The plastic that is used for packaging, milk packets, wrappers and plastic bags, are all welcome. At our unit, we break the low-density plastic into small chips that are then sold to cement or tar-making industries that use them for making roads or buildings,” he clarifies. The collected waste is sent to a plastic waste reprocessing unit in Kapuluppada which is almost 30 kilometres from the city. The collected waste is recycled and then sold as raw material to several other industries.

Apart from plastic, the parlour also collects old clothes and e-waste. Anyone wanting to donate clothes will have to pay ₹ 2 per piece of clothing they deposit. The money collected this way covers the cost of transporting the clothes to areas such as Madhurawada where they are distributed to the people who need them. In a month’s time the organisation is planning to open 14 more centres across the city. “We are planning to have one collection centre in each of the Rythu Bazaar. We are in talks with the authorities for setting up these parlours,” adds Reddy.

33,2020/02/21,Fixing maintenance charges,"Your property-related legal queries answered by S.C. RAGHURAM, Partner, RANK Associates, a Chennai-based law firm

In 1988, my mother sold her immovable property to Mr A. The sale deed clearly mentioned 1 ground and 215 sq.ft., (i.e., 2615 sq.ft.) and stated the common way of 372 sq.ft., giving permission to use it as a pathway (as easement right). The encumbrance certificate also shows the same. But Mr A is sold to his property to Mr B in 2018 and that sale deed shows 2,987 sq.ft. instead of 2,615 sq.ft. — which means he is including the common way in the sale deed, and that Mr A’s patta is incorrect. Please clarify.

V.Govindaram

Chennai

The recitals in both the documents have to be looked into to answer your query comprehensively. In any case, A can sell only what he holds and any additional extent sold by him will not form part of a valid conveyance.

The Patta for the passage portion has to be issued in the joint names of both the owners if the right over passage was conveyed under the 1988 Sale Deed. If Patta is erroneously issued to the present adjacent owner, you can make an application to the Tahsildar concerned by enclosing copies of the relevant documents seeking necessary corrections in the revenue records and reissue the Patta in the proper form.

I have purchased a piece of land measuring 2,400 sq.ft. at OMR that holds 409 plots of different sizes (600,1200,1800 and 2,400 sq.ft.). About 70 owners have constructed 6BHK, 5BHK,2BHK homes. I recently constructed four 2BHK units and I have decided to lease them out. The Association formed by 40 residents is charging monthly maintenance of ₹1 per sq.ft. and ₹1,000 per kitchen. In my case, the kitchen will not be of much use as the homes are being rented out to bachelors, and I feel it is unfair for me to pay additional maintenance towards the kitchen charges. The Association continues to pass invalid resolutions; adding to which, of the 409 owners, only 40-50 attend the meeting. How do I proceed?

42,2020/02/21,Ram temple construction will begin in six months: Trust chief,"Structure’s height to increase

The map prepared by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) around three decades ago for building a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya could be altered to raise the height of the proposed structure from 125 feet to 160 feet, and an additional third floor added, temple trust sources said.

On Thursday, members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra Trust, including general secretary Champat Rai, Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra and Anil Mishra, met Nripendra Mishra, head of the temple construction committee, to discuss various issues related to the construction of the proposed temple.

However, sources said the VHP wants the temple to be built on the basis of the old map itself to avoid delay in the construction process.

“The temple will be built on the basis of the VHP’s map. There can be changes to its proposed shape and scale,” Swami Govind Dev Giri, a member of the Trust, told PTI.

Another member of the Trust said, “We have received suggestions to make changes to the old map in order to give an ever grander form to the proposed temple. Now, we are brainstorming on building a three-storey structure instead of the two stories proposed earlier, as well as adding a pavilion and detailing to the 35-feet-high shikhar.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked members of the newly constituted Ram temple trust to ensure that construction work on the temple is conducted harmoniously and without any bitterness, the trust’s general secretary Champat Rai said on Friday. President of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Nritya Gopal Das and three other members called on the prime minister at his residence here on Thursday and invited him to visit Ayodhya for the ‘bhoomi pujan’, or ground-breaking ceremony.

A date for the ceremony is yet to be finalised.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modiji suggested it should be ensured that work for temple construction should be conducted peacefully without creating any disharmony or bitterness,” Mr. Rai told reporters.

Describing it as a courtesy meeting, Mr. Rai said the prime minister also said nothing should be done to disturb the atmosphere of the country.

44,2020/02/21,Giriraj Singh makes yet another controversial comment,"‘We paid heavy price as our forefathers did not send Muslims to Pakistan’

Giriraj Singh, Union Minister and BJP MP from Begusarai, has made yet another controversial statement. The BJP allies — the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party — have urged him not to make such comments.

“Our forefathers committed a mistake. Had they ensured that all our Muslim brothers were sent to Pakistan during Partition in 1947 and the Hindus were brought here [from Pakistan], the need for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would not have arisen. But this did not happen, and we paid a heavy price for it. When our forefathers were fighting for independence, Jinnah was pushing for the creation of an Islamic state,” Mr. Giriraj Singh told journalists in Purnea on Thursday. He is touring the Muslim-dominated areas in northeast Bihar to canvass support for the CAA.

He reached Forbesganj and Madhubani on Friday. Sharing a video of the controversial comments of Akbaruddin Owaisi and Waris Pathan, of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Mr. Singh asked the Congress, the RJD and the “Tukde-Tukde gang” whether or not they wanted to make India a Pakistan.

Recently, Mr. Singh called Deoband, an Islamic seminary in Uttar Pradesh, a “fountain-head of terrorism, which produces terrorists like Hafiz Saeed”. He had also said, “Shaheen Bagh is conspiring against the nation, and suicide bombers are being trained there.”

“Mr. Giriraj Singh should learn a lesson from the Delhi Assembly election and desist from making such statements hurting others…I’ll never support any statement that divides society,” LJP leader Chirag Paswan told journalists in Patna before starting on his ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ yatra.

JD(U) spokesperson Arvind Nishad said, “It seems Mr. Giriraj Singh has been ignoring directives from BJP president J.P. Nadda who had asked him to desist from controversial statements and comments.”

Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar whether or not he agreed with Mr. Giriraj Singh’s comments.

45,2020/02/21,Scientists oppose government research into ‘indigenous cows’,"Online petition says the proposal has been ‘drafted unscientifically from start to finish’

At least 400 scientists have petitioned the Department of Science & Technology (DST) to withdraw a proposal that solicits research into indigenous cows.

As The Hindu reported on February 17, SUTRA-PIC or ‘Scientific Utilisation Through Research Augmentation-Prime Products from Indigenous Cows’, has five themes: “Uniqueness of Indigenous Cows, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows for Medicine and Health, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows for Agricultural Applications, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows for Food and Nutrition, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows-based Utility Items”, according to a concept note on the DST website.

‘Extremely perturbed’

In an online petition to Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST, and K. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Advisor to the government, the scientists write that as “.. concerned scientists and science communicators of the country, [they] are extremely perturbed by the recent call for research proposals”.

Their key concerns were that the research programme appeared to endorse the belief that indigenous cows had “special” and “unique” qualities and that this opened the possibility of money being “wasted to investigate imaginary qualities derived from religious scriptures”.

The programme did not encourage fair comparison with other breeds of cows around the world or other bovine species within India, and that the proposal was “drafted unscientifically from start to finish”. Finally, given that scientific funding for several research programmes was wanting and researchers were not getting their fellowships on time, it was “infuriating” that the DST was ready to fund such a “dubious scheme”, the petitioners note.

The proposal ought to be withdrawn and restated to encourage open inquiry and encumbering investigators to also “cross check” if effects were seen in indigenous breeds alone or were also visible in “other cow breeds, bovine species or other mammals”, the petition said.

‘Worth pursuing’

Dr. Sharma told The Hindu that he had not received the petition but was aware of “news reports” that had reported scientists’ concerns. He said that all research proposals by scientists under the programme would be vetted by qualified scientists and each one of them accepted — or rejected — on merit. “Concerns on apparent bias or widening the ambit to include more bovines could be passed on to the scientist committee evaluating the proposals. However, this is a programme that could unearth new information and new ideas and was certainly worth pursuing,” he said.

Jayanth Murthy, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and a signatory to the petition, told The Hindu that the petition was likely to be formally sent once it garnered 500 signatories. “One of my concerns is that once it’s formulated as a research programme, it [the DST] will be forced to fund at least a few research proposals, even if substandard. Secondly, the programme presupposes that cows are special,” he said.

Dr. VijayRaghavan did not respond to a text message for immediate comment.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/41v4p4/article30882524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22INDIANCOWBREEDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/scientists-oppose-government-research-into-indigenous-cows/article30882525.ece
46,2020/02/21,Trump event should not become an extension of U.S. Presidential campaign: Congress,"‘Extravagant welcome goes against the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi’

The Namaste Trump mega event planned to welcome United States President Donald Trump in Ahmedabad should not become an extension of the U.S. Presidential campaign, the Congress said on Friday.

Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma described the visit as an important step in Indo-U.S. strategic partnership but maintained that the outcomes would determine its success.

Speaking to reporters at the party headquarters, Mr. Sharma raised concerns over the U.S.’s withdrawal of the General System of Preference (GSP) status to India; reduction in H1B visas; and settlement of social security deposits made by Indian professionals in the US.

‘Wrong precedents’

“This visit should not become an extension of the U.S. Presidential campaign for the Indian diaspora. We do not become an active party in the elections in another country. This mistake was made in Texas at the ‘Howdy Modi’ event and the Prime Minister ought to be careful as these are setting wrong precedents,” he said.

“We hope... our country will hear [of] enhancement of H1-B visas; restoration of GSP for India, which provides preferential market access for Indian produce to America; and also reversing the present association and recognising India as a developing country,” Mr. Sharma said.

He added, “There should be an agreement on the refund of the social security contributions that are regularly being made by Indian IT professionals over the years and they run into billions of dollars. These are outstanding issues.”

‘Arbitrary decisions’

“There have already been many arbitrary decisions which have affected our engagement with other strategic partners. We are a sovereign country and have the right to engage with our other partner countries on our terms,” he said.

The “extravagant and unprecedented welcome” that is being planned for Mr. Trump, said the Congress, goes against the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150 birth anniversary is being celebrated in the country.

Also Read A Trump India visit, in campaign mode

Mr. Sharma also raised questions on the organisers of the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. “Is the U.S. President coming on the invite of the Nagrik Abhinandan Samiti? The government should desist from being hypocritical... The Prime Minister should openly say that Trump is his friend and he is making grand arrangements,” the Congress leader said.

Asked if the Congress had received an invitation for a meeting with the U.S. President, he said, “We have not received any invitation from the government’s side and neither from the U.S. If any invitation will come, then we will take a view on it.”

Box on Congress leadership question

A day after Shashi Tharoor tweeted to press for a “leadership election”, Congress leader Anand Sharma said the party has a President. In what appeared to be a snub to Mr. Thaoor without taking his name, Mr. Sharma said it was only the Congress Working Committee that could decide on such issues.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k7y8ei/article30882334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANANDSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trump-event-should-not-become-an-extension-of-us-presidential-campaign-congress/article30882335.ece
47,2020/02/21,Larger SC bench to revisit its 2010 verdict in Lalu Prasad DA case,"The issue cropped up as the Chhattisgarh government had to rush to the apex court in 2011 challenging the acquittal of Amit Jogi, the son of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, in a 2003 murder case

The Supreme Court has decided to revisit its 2010 verdict in the disproportionate assets case of former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in which it had held that the State government has no authority to file an appeal against acquittal in cases probed by central agencies.

The issue cropped up as the Chhattisgarh government had to rush to the apex court in 2011 challenging the acquittal of Amit Jogi, the son of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, in a 2003 murder case as the CBI had not filed the appeal within the stipulated period.

However, during the interregnum, the apex court’s three-judge bench in 2010 had delivered a verdict in the Yadav DA case that the CBI, which was the prosecuting agency in the fodder scam, had the right to challenge the orders of the subordinate court and the State government had no locus standi.

When Mr. Jogi’s matter came up last week in the apex court, the Chhattisgarh government doubted the correctness of the 2010 verdict in Mr. Yadav’s case and a bench of Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph directed that the matter be referred to a larger bench.

“Counsel for the State of Chhattisgarh seeks to doubt the judgment of this Court in Lalu Prasad Yadav and others versus State of Bihar and others, which is of a three-judge bench,” the bench said.

“We are thus of the view that it may be appropriate that the matters be placed before a three-judge bench itself so as to avoid further duplication of the hearing. The matters be thus, placed before Chief Justice of India for appropriate directions,” it said.

Advocate Sumeer Sodhi, appearing for the Chhattisgarh government, said that the apex court’s judgement in the Lalu Prasad Yadav case is per incuriam (bad in law).

He said the 2010 judgment needs to be reconsidered as it affects the substantial rights of all states to file an appeal against acquittal of an accused in a case investigated and prosecuted by the Central Bureau of Investigation or any other central agency.

On April 1, 2010, the top court had held that the Bihar government did not have the authority to file an appeal in the Patna High Court against the acquittal of Lalu Prasad Yadav and his wife and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi in a disproportionate assets case which was prosecuted by the CBI.

It had held that the Centre and the CBI alone are the competent authorities to file the appeal against acquittal of an accused and the State government is excluded to challenge the trial court’s order under the law.

The Chhattisgarh government and the CBI had challenged the acquittal of Amit Jogi by the trial court in 2007 in the NCP leader Ram Avtar Jaggi murder case.

The State government had filed the appeal before the high court in 2007 challenging his acquittal but the petition was dismissed in 2011 on the ground that only the CBI, being a prosecuting agency, had the jurisdiction to file the appeal.

After three-and-a-half years, the CBI filed an appeal against the acquittal order of the trial court but it was dismissed by the high court on the ground of delay of over 1,300 days.

On December 6, 2016, the top court had asked the CBI to come up with strong grounds for seeking condonation of delay on filing the appeal against the acquittal of Amit Jogi.

The CBI had earlier contended before the apex court that it was not granted permission to file the appeal by the competent authority and when it got the permission, the appeal was filed.

The Chhattisgarh government had argued that when CBI did not file the appeal before the high court, the state had filed the appeal but it was dismissed following the 2010 apex court verdict.

It had said that the verdict in Mr. Yadav’s case was erroneous and the CBI could not be allowed to have unbridled power of resorting to “pick and choose strategy” for filing appeal.

“The decision of this court in Lalu Prasad Yadav’s case, it is submitted, requires reconsideration for not only it is flawed in the manner in which it is construed in the statute, but unwittingly upset the delicate balance between the union and the state in relation to administration of justice,” the State government’s appeal said.

Mr. Jaggi was shot dead on June 4, 2003 and five persons were arrested by the state police and a charge sheet was filed against them holding that motive of the murder was robbery.

The case was handed over to the CBI in January 2004 and the agency filed a charge sheet stating that Jaggi was shot dead by convict Chiman Singh for political reasons as a rally was being organised by him in Raipur on June 10, 2003, which posed a political threat to then chief minister Ajit Jogi and his son Amit Jogi.

The CBI had alleged the murder was committed after a criminal conspiracy between Amit Jogi and others.

The trial court had on May 31, 2007, acquitted Amit Jogi and convicted all other 28 accused persons in the murder case.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ryh0ii/article30881934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LALUPRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/larger-sc-bench-to-revisit-its-2010-verdict-in-lalu-prasad-da-case/article30881935.ece
48,2020/02/21,Sedition case against Karnataka school management for ‘anti-CAA play’ challenged in SC,"In the petition filed on Thursday, social activist Yogita Bhayana has also sought an apex court direction for a proper mechanism to deal with alleged government misuse of the sedition law

A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the sedition case registered against a Karnataka school management for allegedly allowing students to stage an anti-CAA, anti-NRC drama that ‘portrayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in poor light’

The petition seeks quashing of the FIR against the principal and other staff of the Shaheen School at Bidar who have been booked under sections 124-A (sedition) and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) of the Indian Penal Code.

In the petition filed on Thursday, social activist Yogita Bhayana has also sought an apex court direction for a proper mechanism to deal with alleged government misuse of the sedition law.

Section 124A of the IPC says that “whoever brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards... the Government shall be punished with imprisonment for life...”.

Ms. Bhayana, in the plea, has sought a direction to the Centre and the Karnataka government “to quash the FIR registered in connection of seditious charges against the school management, teacher and a widowed parent of a student for staging a play criticizing CAA, NRC, and NPR.”

The petition claimed the police “also questioned students, and videos and screenshots of CCTV footage showing them speaking to the students were shared widely on social media, prompting criticism.”

It further quoted the school principal, alleging that “on one occasion, police in uniform questioned students, with no child welfare officials present“.

The plea said that the “proceedings were violative of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and abuse of process of law.”

“Issue an order directing the Centre to constitute a committee to scrutinise complaints under 124-A IPC and adhere to judgments by the apex court before registering the FIR under the section 124-A IPC,” the petition said.

The drama was staged on January 21 by students of fourth, fifth and sixth standard.

The sedition case was filed based on a complaint from social worker Neelesh Rakshyal on January 26.

The complainant has alleged that the school authorities “used” the students to perform a drama where they “abused” Modi in the context of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2mmqv3/article30881490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAHEENSCHOOLPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anti-caa-play-sedition-case-against-karnataka-school-management-challenged-in-sc/article30881491.ece

Delhi and Ahmedabad topped the list of seven metro cities in daily average consumption of ‘added fat’ in dishes such as dal fry, stuffed paratha and mutton biryani, while Hyderabad was at the bottom of the list according to a recent survey.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) survey also revealed that men consume more fat at 34.1 gram per person daily, than women who consume 31.1 gram per day across the seven cities — Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.

Also read | Added sugar intake is highest in Mumbai, Ahmedabad: ICMR study

Added fat was high in dishes such as dal fry, rice, stuffed paratha, chuduva, bisi bele bath — a rice-based dish with origins in Karnataka — and puliyodharai also known as tamarind rice. Mutton Birynai has more fat than chicken biryani or cereal-based and non-vegetarian recipes, it found.

According to the study, those who eat deep-fried food consumed more added fat than those who ate boiled and shallow-fried food.

Also, almost all non-vegetarian foods, mostly consumed in urban areas, has high amounts of added fat, the study revealed.

The survey was carried out by Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN) from the database of National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau study (2015-16), ICMR-NIN-Hyderabad. The analysis was supported by International Life Sciences Institute-India (ILSI-India).

Professor P.K. Seth, chairman of ILSI India, said added fat consumption levels were significantly higher in Delhi and Ahmedabad at 44.4 gram per person daily and 43.9 gram each day respectively.

The average intake of added fat in Mumbai and Hyderabad were the lowest at 28.8 gram per person daily and 25.1 gram per person each day respectively, he said.

The average intake of added fat in all the seven metro cities pooled together was 32.6 gram per person each day, which was higher than ICMR-recommended levels at 20g/person/day. Overall, 18% of the total intake of energy was obtained from visible fat, the survey found.

About the methodology used for assessing added fat intake, Dr.A. Laxmaiah, the head of the division of Public Health Nutrition in NIN, said they evaluated the intake of an assortment of food such as regular home-made food, packaged food, sweet-based preparations, bakery and biscuits, and milk products to come out with the quantum of added fat across a fairly large sample of 5,123 individuals from 1,293 households.

The data was collected by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) and analysed by the Division of Public Health Nutrition, NIN. The collated data was also used to measure gender-wise consumption of added fat.

The highest intake of added fat was observed in the age group of 36 to 59 (36.1 gram/person/day), followed by 18-35 age group (34.8 g/person/day) and adolescents (32.8 g/person/day). The least intake of added fat was noticed in children under the age of five (15.7/g/person/day).

The researchers noted that contrary to general belief, vegetarians consumed more fat (40.7 gram) than non-vegetarians (30.2 gram) in these seven metro cities.

“It is important that people are motivated to have a balanced diet, adopt healthy lifestyle, undertake physical activity, including Yoga,” Prof. Seth said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bizwn4/article30881032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUTTONBIRIYANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-ahmedabad-tops-list-of-seven-cities-in-daily-average-consumption-of-added-fat-icmr-survey/article30881033.ece

Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled computer systems to create synthetic videos, a.k.a. deepfakes.

A deepfake video can show a person saying or doing something that they never said or did. An AI algorithm is taught, using deep learning, to manipulate actual video and audio to mislead viewers.

Deepfake online videos are burgeoning as tools and applications to make fictional content gets cheaper, lowering barriers for non-experts to make them.

One of the ways to make deepfake videos involve encoding, decoding, and face-swapping. First, an AI encoder runs several face shots of two persons. Then, the encoder learns of similarities in the faces and compresses the images.

As the faces are different, one AI decoder picks the first person’s face, and another decoder picks the second person’s face. Then, the encoded images are fed into the ""wrong"" decoder to perform the face swap. This process is done on every frame to make a convincing video.

In certain other cases, the AI is trained to create new images and videos from scratch using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

GAN, with the help of Machine Learning, makes two neural networks to contest against each other in a game with a given training set. This helps generate new data and output related to the training set.

Has Deepfake been used in politics before Delhi elections?

Since its inception in late 2017, deepfake images and videos have largely been used in pornography. 96% of all deepfakes online are non-consensual pornographic videos, according to Deep Trace Labs, a deepfake detection technology firm.

In the political sphere, an allegedly deepfake video of Gabon's President Ali Bongo led to a coup d'état, which was later crushed.

Apart from this, a deepfake video by Future Advocacy showed UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other. The think-tank's video was posted in an attempt to show the potential of deepfakes in undermining democracy.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/pe5pqw/article26568140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgm-deepfakes,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/deepfakes-enter-indian-election-campaigns/article30880638.ece
54,2020/02/21,India paying price for not sending Muslims to Pakistan: Giriraj Singh,"NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party’s chief Chirag Paswan expressed strong disapproval of Singh’s remarks

The country is paying the price for its failure to send Muslims to Pakistan and bring Hindus to India after the Islamic state came into being at the time of Independence, Union minister Giriraj Singh has said, triggering a fresh controversy.

The BJP leader made the remark in Purnea district in the Seemanchal region of Bihar which has a sizeable Muslim population and where the Begusarai MP was canvassing in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Highlighting the need for such a legislation, he told reporters late Thursday “when our forefathers were fighting for Independence from British rule, Jinnah was pushing for the creation of an Islamic state”.

“Our forefathers, however, committed a mistake. Had they ensured that all our Muslim brothers were sent to Pakistan and Hindus brought here, the need for such a move (CAA) would not have arisen. This did not happen and we have paid a heavy price for it,” the BJP leader said.

The CAA, which seeks to fast-track granting citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who might have fled their home countries because of religious persecution, has become a major bone of contention since it is feared that a country-wide National Register for Citizens (NRC) may follow.

The Narendra Modi government, which had formerly hinted that a country-wide NRC was on the anvil, seems to have put it on the back-burner though a section of citizens across the country, especially Muslims, have been organising protests out of fear that, if implemented, the NRC may result in a large number of people becoming Stateless.

Singh has often been in the crosshairs of the opposition for placing his foot in the mouth. This time, however, his words were frowned upon even by NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party, founded by his cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswan and now headed by his son Chirag Paswan.

‘Coalition suffers due to BJP leaders’ divisive remarks’

The young LJP chief, who kicked off a state-wide “Bihar First-Bihari First” yatra here Friday morning, to project the NDAs progressive face ahead of the assembly polls due later this year, expressed strong disapproval of Singh’s utterance and noted the coalition had to suffer in the Delhi polls because of “divisive” remarks by BJP leaders.

“We are an NDA constituent but many times our coalition partners say things which the LJP does not at all agree with. This one (Giriraj Singh’s statement) is such an example. Had a person of my party spoken in this fashion, I would have taken responsibility and acted,” Paswan said.

He said he had placed his view repeatedly on record that the coalition had to suffer on account of divisive remarks, Paswan said in apparent reference to inflammatory speeches by BJP leaders like Union minister Anurag Thakur and BJP MP Parvesh Verma, among others.

“The people of Delhi voted on the basis of performance. We wish they do so again in Bihar and real issues don’t get drowned in political cacophony.

“The Nitish Kumar government has accomplished a lot, though much more needs to be achieved. We wish to reach out to people with our vision for the future, said Paswan, before he embarked on the yatra on a customised bus decorated like a chariot in front of which he offered prayers and smashed a coconut.

Meanwhile, Giriraj Singh who loves to wear his Hindu nationalism on the sleeves was busy joining issue with Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM which has been under attack for controversial remarks by its leader Waris Pathan.

Sharing a video of an old speech by Owaisi’s brother Akbaruddin which had landed him in jail, besides Pathan’s recent remark, Singh asked the opposition RJD-Congress combine in Bihar and the “tukde tukde gang” whether they wanted to “convert India into Pakistan”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h9pv6o/article30880228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GIRIRAJSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-paying-price-for-not-sending-muslims-to-pakistan-giriraj-singh/article30880229.ece

Pilots, cabin crew and air traffic controllers may have to undergo tests for drug use, according to a proposal announced by the DGCA(Directorate General of Civil Aviation) on Friday.

The DGCA has invited comments from stakeholders for a period of 45 days on the proposal, following which it will amend its rules.

It has proposed conducting random tests on all aviation personnel such that 10% employees of each organisation are covered in a year's time. In the initial stage, only pilots, cabin crew and air traffic controllers at Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad airports may be subjected to these checks. If a person tests positive, he or she will have to undergo rehabilitation. A repeat offence may result in the licence being cancelled.

Airlines will also be asked to conduct tests on their employees before hiring a person, following an accident as well as conduct surprise checks and follow-up tests on those who had tested positive and undergone treatment.

The DGCA's move is line with the policy laid down by UN aviation watchdog, International Civil Aviation Organisation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/drlepb/article30879915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DRUGFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dgca-proposes-testing-of-aviation-personnel-for-psychoactive-substances/article30879916.ece
56,2020/02/21,Daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared to accompany Donald Trump to India,"Bilateral agreements on counter-terrorism, IPR, space, and medical cooperation on the cards

U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump will be accompanied by his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior government officials confirmed, making his India visit beginning Monday, one of the few times that Mr. Trump has travelled officially with so many members of his family. According to the officials, Mr. Kushner was already scheduled to travel as he is an advisor on international relations and Ms. Trump was a “welcome” addition, given her dual role as a presidential advisor as well as a member of the family.

The accompanying family members are expected to make an appearance on stage at the Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, then travel with President Trump to Agra on Monday evening, and would also be present during delegation-level bilateral talks on Tuesday. A series of agreements and MoUs would be exchanged after talks between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including an accord on Homeland Security that would cover the setting up of a “counter-terrorism training centre” and a research centre for cyber-security, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. An agreement on space cooperation, a medical cooperation and information sharing pact, which will be particularly relevant in light of the current Chinese coronavirus pandemic, and an accord on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), which has long been an area of discord for the U.S. and India, are also on the anvil, the officials added.

Also Read Namaste Trump: POTUS visit to India

On strategic issues, the two sides are expected to upgrade their 2015 Joint Vision statement for the Indian Ocean Region and Asia-Pacific, which is now referred to as the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Trump’s visit will come days before the signing of a U.S.-Taliban agreement on February 29, and the two sides are expected to discuss future plans for Afghanistan. However, officials said they did not expect an American request for India to be involved militarily, a suggestion that Mr. Trump has made in the past. However, India is expected to press the U.S. to not make a complete pullout of troops from Afghanistan.

Separately, several defence purchase deals, totalling about $3 billion, are expected to be inked. Officials also said that the third defence logistical agreement BECA, which has been delayed, was likely to be taken forward in March at a meeting in Washington.

In addition, several major energy agreements are likely to be signed as India has stepped up purchases of American oil and LNG. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette is expected to be part of the entourage along with senior officials like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and National Security Agency (NSA) Director Gen. Paul Nakasone. In addition to an agreement by Petronet to invest $2.5 billion in U.S. LNG company Tellurian, for which two MoUs were signed last year, an MoU between Exxon and Indian Oil for LNG pipeline infrastructure is also likely to be highlighted during the visit. Officials said they hope to see Westinghouse close its MoU that dates back to 2009 to construct six nuclear power reactors in Andhra Pradesh as well, but there may be changes in the “responsibility” structure given the U.S. company’s issues with the liability for nuclear risks.

Officials conceded that there was some disappointment that the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was now not expected to travel to India, and that a trade deal was not expected, but said that a “limited trade deal is ready”, even if it wasn’t likely to be announced during the visit.

“There is a definite change in the interest from Mr. Trump since Mr. Modi’s re-election,” one official said. “He is investing heavily in this relationship, and there is a recognition of India’s importance. [The joint rally in] Houston also changed his perspective when it came to seeing the power of the Indian population, it has clearly caught his imagination,” the official added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pik1ic/article30879557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21JARED-IVANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/daughter-ivanka-and-son-in-law-jared-to-accompany-donald-trump-to-india/article30879558.ece
57,2020/02/21,Army establishments to come under one roof at ‘Thal Sena Bhawan’,"Building under construction will integrate various pockets of Army headquarters

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday performed the stone-laying ceremony for the proposed ‘Thal Sena Bhawan’ of the Army in Delhi cantonment, which will bring together various pockets of the Army headquarters spread across Delhi under one roof.

Observing that there was movement of about 3,000-4,000 vehicles every day from the various Army establishments in the city, Mr. Singh said this would be not required once the ‘Thal Sena Bhawan’ comes up and would significantly reduce fuel consumption, expenses and pollution. “The new building will ensure they can work under one roof,” he stated.

Mr. Singh also stated that the newly created Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) will work from here. “This will help in jointness,” he added.

Also read: Proposal on structure of Department of Military Affairs sent to Defence Ministry

“The proposed Thal Sena Bhawan will bring all Army HQ offices under one roof thereby improving the working efficiency, while reducing the carbon footprint and logistics requirements,” Army chief Gen. Manoj Naravane said, adding it would also allow more family time for all personnel at peace posting in Delhi.

The building spread over 39 acres opposite Manekshaw centre in Delhi cantonment will bring together Army headquarters split in eight pockets across Delhi. Presently, the Army Headquarters is split into eight pockets across South Block, Sena Bhawan, Hutments Area, R.K. Puram, Shankar Vihar and other places, the Army said. The work was sanctioned to make up the existing deficiency of 44% and also to accommodate the Army Headquarters in one place.

The ‘Thal Sena Bhawan’ is conceptualised as a multi-storey green building adopting Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) norms and will house offices, residential area for security personnel and basic amenities. “Approximately 7.5 lakh sq.m. of area will be constructed to house the office complex and parking. A total of 6,014 offices will be constructed, which will house offices for 1,684 officers — both military and civilian — and 4,330 sub staff,” the Army said.

Stating that the proposed work will generate minimum 2 lakh hours of skilled and unskilled work, one Army officer added, “It is proposed to construct this structure in five years.”

The Army chief would continue to sit in South Block in close proximity to the Defence Minister and the present Army HQ ‘Sena Bhawan’ will continue to exist, though some functions would be shifted to the new complex.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cc9t3u/article30879168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THALSENABHAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-establishments-to-come-under-one-roof-at-thal-sena-bhawan/article30879105.ece
58,2020/02/21,A.R. Rahman Foundation among more than 20 NGOs that get Union Home Ministry nod,"After Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, FCRA licences of more than 16,000 NGOs were cancelled for various violations.

The Union government has granted Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) licence to more than 20 NGOs this year and it includes the A.R. Rahman Foundation, run by the Academy award-winning composer and his family.

Any NGO or association that intends to receive foreign funds has to compulsorily register under the FCRA, monitored by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

After the Modi government came to power in 2014, the FCRA licences of more than 16,000 NGOs were cancelled on account of various violations.

The Rahman Foundation had run into trouble with the authorities when it allegedly received money from a U.K based mobile phone company in 2015. The income tax authorities had accused Mr. Rahman of evading tax and getting the money transferred to a bank account linked to the Trust that was not registered under the FCRA. Mr. Rahman and his auditor had contested the claims.

As per the MHA, the Foundation had been registered for “cultural, social and educational” purposes under the FCRA.

According to the 2010 Act, registered NGOs can receive foreign contribution for five purposes — social, educational, religious, economic and cultural.

This year, only one NGO — Madrasa Muhammadiyah Baccho ka Ghar — based at Vadodara has been registered under the “Religious (Muslim), Cultural, Educational” category.

A total of 21 other associations were also registered under the FCRA this year, most in the “social and economic” category. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the number of new FCRA registrations stood at 1012, 521 and 683.

The MHA had informed Parliament last year that more than 5,804 NGOs were registered for “religious purpose” under the Act.

In all, there are 22,497 NGOs registered under the FCRA and licences of 20,674 NGOs were cancelled from 2012 onward, out of which 10,002 were cancelled in 2015 alone.

Before 2011, the number of FCRA registrations stood at 40,376.

In a notification issued last year, the MHA warned NGOs with penal action if they changed their office-bearers and key functionaries without informing it within a month of doing so.

The Ministry also amended the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011 in September 2019 that all the members and office bearers of an NGO will have to file an affidavit making it mandatory for it to report “any violation” of the FCRA provisions by the applicant organisation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6wybs2/article30874767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARRahmanFoundationjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ar-rahmans-among-over-20-ngos-that-get-mha-nod/article30873524.ece
59,2020/02/21,Congress slams Centre for reducing govt.’s share in crop insurance scheme,"The Congress on Thursday accused the Centre of surreptitiously trying to shut down the crop insurance scheme by reducing the government’s share of premium and putting the burden on farmers.

Speaking at a press conference, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asserted that the BJP-led government was running the crop insurance scheme ‘only to benefit its crony capitalist friends and their insurance companies’.

“From an earlier cap of 2% on premiums, the farmers will have to have to pay 27% premium as the Centre has reduced its share by half on crop insurance,” Mr. Surjewala said. “Instead of making the scheme more farmer-friendly, the government is shutting it down in a surreptitious manner by making it completely unviable for the farmer,” he contended.

The Congress was reacting to the decision of the Union Cabinet, taken on Wednesday, to reduce the Centre’s share in paying the crop insurance premium from 50% to 25%.

“Yesterday’s decision is a conspiracy of the BJP to shut down the Bima Fasal Yojna (crop insurance scheme). This is the Modi government’s business model of promoting crony capitalism,” the Congress spokesperson alleged.

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram slammed the government’s decision on Twitter. “Nothing can be more anti-farmer than the central government’s decision to reduce its contribution to the Crop Insurance Scheme. Making crop insurance voluntary for loanee farmers is another retrograde step,” he tweeted.

The Congress also alleged that out of ₹77,801 crore premium paid on crop insurance schemes so far, insurance companies had made a profit of ₹19,202 crore after paying compensation to the farmers.

“The central government is so broke, they are taking money from the farmers to give to their crony capitalist friends,” Mr. Surjewala contended. “By reducing their own contribution, the BJP has laid most of the burden on the farmer and the State government. Hence, the so called decision to make it ‘voluntary’ is bogus. The farmers will be forced to give up insurance as a result of the huge cost,” he added.

“How will India’s farmers face the consequences of the wrath of nature. These are the questions to be answered and the government has the audacity to say that they have taken the scheme forward. This is shameful,” Mr. Surjewala said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jkgknq/article28022737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-crop-insurance-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-slams-centre-for-reducing-govts-share-in-crop-insurance-scheme/article30873819.ece
60,2020/02/21,‘Justice Muralidhar had agreed to his transfer’,"Source says it’s a needless controversy

The Supreme Court Collegium recommended the transfer of Delhi High Court judge Justice S. Muralidhar to the Punjab and Haryana High Court only after taking his consent.

A highly placed source said a controversy over the transfer was “unnecessary” and damaged the judicial institution.

“His consent was taken before transferring him. It is a routine one,” the source said.

Besides, a transfer out of the Delhi High Court, his parent court, is considered a step closer towards his future elevation as the Chief Justice of a High Court, the source said.

A judge normally cannot be the Chief Justice in his parent court.

Pradeep Nandrajog and Gita Mittal are due to retire as Chief Justices of High Courts in 2020.

The Delhi High Court Bar Association called an emergency meeting on Wednesday to decry the transfer. The association had even asked its members to restrain from work on Thursday as a token sign of protest.

Key decisions

Justice Muralidhar, who was elevated as a judge of the Delhi High Court in May 2006, has delivered many decisions of impact.

He had revoked the transit remand of activist Gautam Navlakha in the Bhima Koregaon case. He had also convicted politician Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

In 2009, he was part of the Delhi High Court Bench which decriminalised homosexuality.

Collector A. Md. Imtiaz on Friday said a total of 2.71 lakh beneficiaries had been identified for the government’s housing scheme in Krishna district so far.

Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Imtiaz said works were in progress to hand over the house pattas and houses to the beneficiaries by Ugadi (March 25). Nearly 24,000 volunteers were engaged to carry out the task of identifying the beneficiaries since August last year.

The beneficiaries were from 53 mandals, two municipal corporations, Vijayawada and Machilipatnam, and seven municipalities. The beneficiaries in cities will be given one cent of land and their counterparts in villages will get one- and-a-half cent land. He said some of the houses would be allocated from the G+3 buildings constructed by Andhra Pradesh Township and Infrastructure Development Corporation.

Of the total requirement of 4,570 acres of land to be distributed, 2,498 acres was government land while another 2,000 acres had been procured from other sources. The identified lands were being groomed taking up levelling works, drawing of layouts and construction of roads.

He said of the 1,409 layouts prepared in the district, jungle-clearance had been completed in 1,120 of them and demarcation of 310 layouts had been done.

Conveyance Deed

In an important development, the Collector said Conveyance Deed was being executed which would enable the beneficiaries to sell the property after five years.

Mr. Imtiaz said since the housing scheme was very important for the government, officials and staff of the Revenue, Panchayat Raj, MGNREGA and Municipal Administration had been consistently working for its success.

An elderly man from Kadapa is back to doing what he loves best, thanks to a hip replacement surgery that he underwent recently.

Manohar Konkar (90), an ex-serviceman-turned-nature cure doctor from Kadapa, used to lead a healthy lifestyle until recently, when he was diagnosed with arthritis. Symptoms of joint degeneration began showing up, and took a toll on his mobility. Mr. Konkar later suffered a fall, which further aggravated the pain in his right hip.

As the pain and swelling increased, Mr. Konkar found it increasingly difficult to go about his daily routines, and was admitted to Vidya Sagar Hospital in November last year. A medical team comprising orthopaedic surgeon C. Vidya Sagar Reddy, physician N. Sreelakshmi, cardiologist A. Vamsidhar, urologist M. Naga Prasanth and anaesthetist K. Hariprasad was formed to carry out the surgery.

The operation was conducted successfully, Mr. Konkar said, adding that he was back on his feet after five days. “In view of his age, we went for epidural anaesthesia during the surgery and continued the infusion even during recovery phase. The recovery is fantastic, given his age,” Dr. Reddy told The Hindu.

“The speedy recovery process is due to his firm resolve, coupled with his involvement in naturopathy, spiritual healing, yoga and meditation,” the patient’s grandson Prakash Konkar, a mechanical engineering graduate, said.

More than 1,000 junior doctors pursuing post-graduation courses in the State are in a quandary due to a massive hike in the tuition fee by private medical colleges that came into place in 2017.

A group of students from a private medical college here said that they were not in a position to complete the course and get the certificates after the fee was hiked for three years, till 2019-20.

Fees for category A seats had been increased from ₹3.05 lakh to ₹6.9 lakh and for the category B seats, it was increased from ₹5.51 lakh to ₹24.20 lakh , they explained, alleging that the Admissions and Fee Regulation Committee (AFRC) had been bypassed in the process. The students faced a bleak future as the hike came in the middle of the course. “My parents are clueless on raising the huge amount for payment of fees,” said a student, K. Ramani, who will finish his course in April 2020. “We can either pay the fee or drop out of the course,” added another student, Swathi.

The Diploma students who finished their course in 2019 April were yet to receive their certificates, they said, adding their counterparts in Telangana had got relief as the High Court held the hike unlawful.

Adding to their woes was non-payment of stipend of ₹30,000 per month by a majority of private medical colleges, they complained.

Aiming to make its presence widely felt, the Tirupati-based Indian Culinary Institute (ICI) plans to get into customisation of preparing delicacies for premier institutes and organisations, apart from offering consultancy services.

An autonomous institute under the Union Ministry of Tourism, ICI has only two campuses — at Tirupati and Noida in the entire country. The Tirupati campus, the bigger one, is in touch with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to customise lunch being served at the Tirupati airport, following the Noida institute’s tie-up on similar lines with the Navy.

“We have plans to provide consultancy services in future, as the hospitality industry is all set to make a mark,” says its administrative officer George Alexander. The institute shot to fame after it conducted cookery contest recently for students of IIT Tirupati.

Nurturing ambitious plans after moving into its sprawling permanent campus located behind the Renigunta airport, the institute has announced MBA (Culinary Arts) from the next academic year. A chunk of the students who completed the three-year BBA programme have secured placement in premier star properties, one of them in a seven-star hotel in Dubai with a starting salary of ₹87,000.

“Our students have career opportunities as chefs, kitchen managers, train/flight/navy services, institutional caterers and shipping and cruise lines, apart from becoming entrepreneurs, nutrition experts and consultants,” asserts its academic in-charge M. Thirulogachander.

Entrance test

ICI expects good patronage for the BBA and MBA entrance test to be held on May 16, the last date for applying online being April 27. The exam will be held simultaneously in Bengaluru, Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Gandhinagar, Guwahati, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Noida, Patna, Tirupati and Thiruvananthapuram. Information can be downloaded from www.ici.nic.in or www.thims.gov.in.

Anyone with a minimum of 50% in Plus Two can apply for BBA, but options for admission into MBA are quite narrow as it requires one to be a graduate in hospitality, hotel management or culinary arts.

67,2020/02/21,People’s effort to build road in Agency moves officials,"ITDA official promised to enrol our efforts under MNREGA Scheme, says a tribal youth

Taking cognizance of the efforts put up by over 300 people from nine villages in Anantagiri mandal in Visakha Agency to build a 15-km road, the authorities concerned have now jumped into action.

A report was published in The Hindu on February 12 under the headline ‘The ‘mountain men and women’ of Visakha agency’, which highlighted how the villagers have taken up the onus to build the road from Bonneru to Chedimetta, so that they get connected to Devarapalli.

Speaking to The Hindu, Madala Venkata Rao, an adivasi from Bonneru village, who is leading the ‘shramadhan,’ said that based on the reports, Assistant Project Officer of ITDA (MNREGA) Siva Prasad visited our villages and assured to enrol our efforts under MNREGA Scheme. “He (APO) informed us there is funds under the MNREGA and it will be utilised for this purpose. He also informed us that a proposal for a permanent BT Road has been sent and works will start, once it was sanctioned,” he said.

Mr. Venkat Rao, who is one among the few tribal youth who is pursuing engineering, is in his third year of civil engineering, and has taken up the initiative to mobilise men and material to build the road.

Araku town is about 80 km from Bonneru village and Devarapalli, the nearest town is around 30 km, and the villages have never been connected.

Since there was no road connectivity, the adivasis did not have access to medical and health care, education and other basic amenities.

About 16 months after the ground breaking ceremony, IT services major HCL Technologies started operations at its Kesarapalli global development centre, near Vijayawada.

The full-fledged operations and a formal announcement will be made in this regard in April, according to a top official at HCL.

Responding to an email from The Hindu, HCL Technologies executive vice-president Srimathi Shivashankar said: “We had a small puja ceremony and event for our employees and families last week on HCL campus.

72,2020/02/21,Town Planning officials face action over function hall built sans plan approval,"Four floors built after taking permission for two, says ACB report; Endowments Dept. too faulted

The Anti-Corruption Bureau Vizianagram wing on Thursday recommended stern action against the officials of the Town Planning department who reportedly allowed construction of a function hall in 1,355 square metres of land without any plan approval. The function hall on Ring Road was allowed to violate rules on the pretext of a court case over the piece of land, an ACB report said.

As part of State-wide surprise checks, ACB teams began inspections in the town on Tuesday which continued till Thursday morning.

In this case related to ‘Lee Paradise Function Hall’, the ACB team also found fault with the Endowments Department for not going for an appeal after losing a court case with the function hall owners. Getting permissions from the municipal authorities for the construction of a building was a must and court cases could not be shown as an excuse to ignore plan approval norms, the report said.

ACB circle inspectors M. Maheswara Rao and Satish Kumar recommended to the Secretary of Municipal Administration and Urban Development to initiate action on Town Planning officials K. Madhusudana Rao, Venkateswara Rao and others who reportedly ignored violations and failed to take action on the management of the function hall.

According to ACB officials, a person named Srinivas Gupta had obtained permission for two floors but constructed another two floors on the Vizianagaram-Srikakulam road.

BPS pleas rejected

The ACB report further said that many applications submitted under the Building Penalisation Scheme (BPS) were rejected without any valid reason although the scheme was introduced to generate more income for the municipal bodies and provide relief to property owners.

The Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation had failed to display a Citizens’ Charter explaining the rules and regulations and the stipulated time-frame for each work. Many buildings had come up with violations as Town Planning officials had issued permissions without any field visit. Some officials of the department had given building plan permissions after they were transferred to other places, the ACB report said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/town-planning-officials-face-action-over-function-hall-built-sans-plan-approval/article30874555.ece

The State Government has taken several initiatives to enhance the skills of students, Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) Chairperson R.K. Roja said here on Thursday.

Some of the initiatives are introduction of skill development centres in colleges, making all degrees a four-year course, and introducing English medium at all government-run schools, Ms. Roja said, claiming that these steps would revolutionise the way students learn.

Ms. Roja was addressing an Industry Academia summit in association with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at SRM University.

The summit was held to provide a platform for bridging the gap between industrial needs and academic research.

Chancellor Narayana Rao said SRM-A.P. is a multidisciplinary research intensive institute and explained the significance of translating research for the improvement of daily life.

Chairman of CII-A.P., Vijay Naidu Galla, said that the gap between knowledge creation and utilisation was proving to be a tough problem and offered solutions to bridge the gap.

“Post liberalization in 1991, more private universities have emerged as important players in education and a significant number of women students are excelling at academics. India is eyeing to become a $5 trillion economy for which we require a 9-10% growth in GDP,” he said.

75,2020/02/21,"Post VRS, BSNL’s cost-cutting spree continues","Jobs to be outsourced, properties rented out

After extending the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) for a chunk of its employees, the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is keen to continue the cost-cutting spree by exploring various options, including outsourcing of jobs and renting out vacant landed properties.

As many as 336 out of 691 employees opted for the VRS in Chittoor district alone, putting a question mark on continuity in customer services. As the manpower is now halved, the company is all set to outsource a number of jobs to not let consumers feel the impact. Already, the maintenance of network-related external assets have been outsourced. Similarly, renting out vacant buildings in Tirupati and Chittoor cities is another option being seriously contemplated.

The BSNL is directly running only seven out of the 20 customer care centres spread across Chittoor district, as the rest are franchisee outlets. Tender process is on to hand over all the centres to franchisees to be run in retail mode. “After this arrangement takes effect, even telephone bills can be paid in the outsourced customer care centres,” says A. Gopala Krishna Rao, General Manager of BSNL Tirupati Telecom District.

Another proposal on the anvil is to invite partners to offer fibre net services in specific areas, say a colony. “We are scouting for localised franchisees to offer our fibre net,” Mr. Rao said, indicating that the tie-up would be on a revenue-sharing basis.

Eye on 4G

Mr. Rao announced that 4G service would be made available across the district in the first quarter of the next financial year, as the government was set to allocate spectrum in April. At present, 4G service was available in Chittoor, Palamaner, Madanapalli, Pakala, Kalikiri, Piler and Puttur.

80,2020/02/21,ITDA bridges the communication gap,"It has installed 19 cellphone towers benefiting 35,000 tribal people

The efforts to provide mobile communication network in the Rampa Agency area has paid off with the provision of uninterrupted telecommunication signals to nearly 35,000 tribal population living in the six mandals in East Godavari district.

Nineteen cellphone towers had been commissioned since mid-2018, and two of them on Thursday at Peda Geddada and Rampachodavaram.

Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA)-Rampachodavaram Project Officer Nishant Kumar had launched the mission in April 2018 aiming at providing telecommunication network to the tribal population.

“Scores of tribal families living in the forest and hilly terrains had no access to medical services during an emergency in the absence of telecommunication signals. The plight of pregnant women was worse. Such conditions propelled us to launch the mission of ensuring telecommunication network. Now, such tales of woe will not be heard in the areas that are brought under the communication network,” said Mr. Nishant.

With the communication network in place, it would be easy for the government staff on the field to report incidents such as road blockade because of felling of trees.

Since the launch of the mission, 34,843 tribal people in the six mandals have been provided access to the telecommunication network — Rampachodavaram (17,834); Addateegala (10,413), Raja Vommangi (3,107); Gangavaram (781); Devipatnam (1,531); and Maredumilli (1,187).

‘Joint efforts’

“The success is the result of the joint efforts of the Tribal Cooperative Finance Corporation Limited (TRICOR), the Forest and Revenue departments, and the ITDA. The Jio group has come forward to provide the communication network though it is not viable commercially due to low population density,” said Mr. Nishant.

“Nearly 20,000 people who travel by the highway between Bhadrachalam and Rajamahendravaram daily directly benefit from the mobile network,” he said.

The ITDA authorities hope the students in the Agency areas would use the mobile network for their academic needs.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/itda-bridges-the-communication-gap/article30874310.ece

Official Language Commission Yarlagadda Lakshmi Prasad has said that the government will establish at least one ‘Telugu Pathasala’ in every mandal from the next academic year.

“The proposal has been cleared by the Chief Minister. It has also been decided to provide transport facility to those who intend to study in these schools but face difficulty in reaching them due to long distance,” Dr. Lakshmi Prasad said while addressing the media here on Thursday.

“Telugu language will not be ignored. From the next academic year, every school in the State, irrespective of the syllabus it follows, will have to make Telugu as a compulsory language paper from Std. I to Std. X,” he said.

He pointed out that 97% of the parent committees in over 48,000 schools across the State opted for converting the Telugu medium schools into English medium, he said.

‘Level-playing field’

“Going by the present global trend and keeping in mind the demographic dividend factor, it is necessary that all children, irrespective of their socio-economic background, be taught in the English medium. Only then we can create a level-playing field for all,” he observed.

84,2020/02/21,Mahashivaratri celebrated with fervour in Mysuru region,"Mahashivaratri was celebrated in the region with traditional zeal and fervour, with the devout making a beeline for temples, keeping night vigil and observing fast on Friday.

Mysuru and surrounding areas are replete with famous shrines and temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, including the Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud, Trinayaneshwara temple on the palace premises, the five famous shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva at Talakadu in T. Narsipur taluk, Chamarajeshwara temple in Chamarajanagar, and Male Mahadeshwaraswamy temple at M.M. Hills.

Braving the searing heat and mounting temperature, devotees queued up from morning for darshan at Trinayaneshwara temple. The temple itself is of historic importance and was brought within the ambit of the fort by extending the former’s boundary. The prakara of the temple has a gopura, or tower, built in 1753 AD as per the Mysore Gazetteer, and hence the main structure could be much older.

A significant aspect of Trinayaneshwara temple is the golden mask (Chinnada Kolaga) which adorns the Shivalinga only on the day of Mahashivaratri. It was a gifted by the last maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar in the 1950s and is kept under lock and key for the rest of the year.

Heavy rush

Other temples in the city which witnessed heavy rush included the Chandramouleshwara temple at Vontikoppal and Maruti temple in T.K. Layout.

One of the oldest temples in the region is Mahabala temple atop Chamundi Hills, where a Shivalinga is worshipped. There is evidence that it was in existence during the Ganga period from around 4th century to 10th century. The temple can be dated back to at least the 10th century, according to N.S. Rangaraju, retired professor of Ancient History and Archaeology, University of Mysore. The hillock was called Mahabala Betta before the temple of Chamundeshwari gained in popularity from the 16th or 17th century, seeing the name change to Chamundi Betta. Though the Mahabala temple is among the more ancient ones, it does not attract a very large crowd. But special prayers are conducted to mark Mahashivaratri.

Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud was a beehive of activity from dawn as the temple town is popular as ‘Daskhina Kashi’ and attracts devotees from all over the State. Special arrangements were made to facilitate the visiting pilgrims to have early darshan. The entire car street surrounding the temple was packed with devotees, and chants and hymns in praise of Lord Shiva reverberated in the temple. Volunteers served water and buttermilk to the devotees. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operated additional services in Nanjangud.

The Shiva temples in Talakadu region — Sri Vaidyanatheshwara, Sri Pathaleshwara, Sri Maruleshwara, Sri Arakeshwara, and Sri Mudukuthore Mallikarjuneshwara — also witnessed heavy rush.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8bmm3e/article30883593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGMYSSHIVARATRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahashivaratri-celebrated-with-fervour-in-mysuru-region/article30883594.ece
85,2020/02/21,"Ahead of Karnataka Budget, tribals submit wish list","Taking a cue from business and industrial leaders, who prepare wish lists and lobby with the government for incentives, the tribals of Hunsur have demanded budgetary allocations for their welfare.

This comes ahead of the tabling of the State Budget scheduled next month. Based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the tribals have arrived at ₹4,923 crore as the allocation required to meet their demands in the coming financial year.

Development Through Education (DEED), an organisation working for tribal welfare in Hunsur, said the amount would be enough to meet the minimum requirements of nearly 70,000 tribal families spread across nine districts in the State and living in around 1,500 hamlets or hadis.

Despite 70 years of independence, tribals continue to be marginalised as successive governments have turned a blind eye to their welfare, said S. Sreekanth of DEED. “It was imperative to make sufficient budgetary grants and allocations to bring them into the mainstream.”

Reviving the demand for creating Hunsur taluk from Mysuru and creating a new district by incorporating other taluks, Mr. Sreekanth said it would help in the focussed development of nearly 200 gram panchayats that could be brought under the proposed district. The issue was raised by former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, who had made it his poll plank, but has received a burial following his defeat in the December 2019 byelection. Demanding a budgetary allocation of ₹1,000 crore for creating a new district, Mr. Sreekanth said it would be required to upgrade the infrastructure in the town.

A memorandum to the Chief Minister, containing the wish list, underlines the imperatives of cleaning the highly polluted Lakshmanthirtha river which flows through the town. Calling for measures to divert the polluted water and treat it instead of allowing it to drain into the river, the tribal organisations have urged the government to allocate adequate funds for this in the budget.

A sum of ₹500 crore has been sought for the comprehensive rehabilitation of primitive tribals or adivasis. The memorandum has highlighted the Karnataka High Court directives of 2009 in this connection. In all, 3,418 adivasis have to be rehabilitated as per the recommendations of the Muzaffar Assadi Committee report.

In addition to this, the tribals have sought the implementation of the Forest Rights Act and demanded ₹1,000 crore to construct residential dwellings for at least 20,000 tribal families in phase one. Some of the demands have been pending for years, including creating necessary infrastructure for the study of tribal culture and folklore, including a tribal university, the constitution of a tribal development and welfare board for the comprehensive development of adivasis, and grant of seed money to establish tribal self-help groups.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e2y6vh/article30883549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MYSTRIBALS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ahead-of-karnataka-budget-tribals-submit-wish-list/article30883550.ece
86,2020/02/21,Will strive to make agriculture more profitable: Yediyurappa,"The State government is committed to making agriculture a profitable venture and encouraging organic and natural farming to reduce the detrimental impacts of the use of chemicals, said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the city on Friday. He was speaking after inaugurating Krishi Mela 2020, organised by private organisations.

Referring to the forthcoming State Budget, which he will present on March 5, Mr. Yediyurappa said he would accord importance to agriculture and take up the construction of the Kalasa Banduri project to provide drinking water in northern Karnataka.

He said it was necessary to reclaim pride of agriculture as a profession and this would require government support. “This can happen only if farmers receive fair and remunerative price for their crops,” he said.

Noting the practice of the increase in use of pesticides and insecticides, Mr. Yediyurappa said this was poisoning the food produced and causing soil to lose fertility. Besides, there is the practice of artificial ripening of fruits by using chemicals, and this should stop, said the Chief Minister.

He also noted the tendency of the present generation of abandoning agriculture and migrating to urban areas in search of jobs. He urged youth to take pride in agricultural activities and reiterated government support to making the agriculture sector more profitable.

Mixed cropping

Mr. Yediyurappa also urged farmers to take up mixed cropping as it would be more profitable and would be an insurance against price collapse of one crop. This requires relatively less water and the government is supportive of this practice, he added. Drawing attention to the Union Budget, which was presented on February 1, Mr. Yediyurappa said the Modi government had allotted 9.5% of the total budget to the agriculture sector and this showed its concern for farmers.

Minister in charge of Mysuru V. Somanna, Agriculture Minister B.C. Pail, Minister for Horticulture and Sericulture K.C. Narayana Gowda, and UoM Vice-Chancellor G.

To a query, he said Mr. Yediyurappa has been apprised on the need to earmark funds in the State Budget for the establishment of an Ayurveda university in Shivamogga, for which land acquisition has already been completed.

Long queues of devotees were seen at Kote Bheemeshwara temple on Kote Road, Kashi Visheshwara temple adjacent to Veerashaiva Kalyana Mandir, Arakeshwara temple near Tunga bridge, and Mallikarjuna temple at Basavangudi.

89,2020/02/21,‘Karnataka Kusti Habba’ to enthral enthusiasts from today,"The four-day State-level mega wrestling competitions will be held at Karnatak College grounds

‘Karnataka Kusti Habba’, the four-day State-level mega wrestling competitions, will be held at Karnatak College grounds on Saturday.

The tradition of sprinkling turmeric water and other ingredients on the mud wrestling arena was performed on Friday, signalling that the preparations are over and the arena is ready for the sport. Senior and junior wrestlers participated in the event.

The second edition of the wrestling competition is being held in the district for the first time. Over 1,200 native wrestlers will combat for various titles at the event organised by the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports in association with the district administration and Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will inaugurate the event at 4 p.m. Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Deputy Chief Ministers Govind Karjol, C.N. Ashwath Narayan, and Laxman Savadi, Youth Empowerment and Sports Minister C.T. Ravi, Minister in-charge of the district Jagadish Shettar and others will be chief guests. Dharwad MLA Amrut Desai will preside over the inaugural session.

For sports lovers, it will be a rare opportunity to enjoy the indigenous varieties of wrestling that is still popular in rural and semi-urban areas. The North Karnataka region stills hosts a large number of indigenous wrestlers and gymnasiums known as Garadi Mane. Three mud-wrestling arenas have been prepared for the competitions.

Mr. Desai, who is supervising the arrangements, said as tribute to the legendary wrestlers of this region, the wrestling arenas and entrances of the venue will be named after Hind Kesari awardee Chumbanna Mutnal, Jyoti Ustad, Maruti Ustad, Parishappa Narasingannavar, Mudukappa Kusugal, Manappa Amaragol, and Santosh Hosamani of Chikkamalligwad.

90,2020/02/21,Anti-CAA protests are ‘strong voices of motherland’: G.N. Devy,"He said the country was now becoming ‘Shaheen Bagh’ with anti-CAA protests being held continuously across.

Linguist and activist Ganesh N. Devy has termed the agitations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) as the ‘strong voice of the motherland’ and emphasised the need for strengthening the fight against fascism.

He was inaugurating an awareness programme on ‘NPR, NRC: Questions before the public’ organised as part of Bharat Jodo-Samvidhan Bachao campaign by Samvidhan Suraksha Samiti in Hubballi on Thursday evening.

‘Boycott NPR’

Mr. Devy said the country was now becoming ‘Shaheen Bagh’ with anti-CAA protests being held continuously across. He gave a call for boycotting the National Population Register (NPR) survey not by taking to the streets but by pasting ‘No CAA, No NRC, No NPR’ stickers on the doors of houses.

Maintaining that India was not the only country where the fight against fascism was underway, he said there was a dire need to fight against ideologies to which Donald Trump and Narendra Modi were in power.

Mr. Devy said it was regretful that the strong voice was not raised after the abolition of Article 370 of Constitution and after the Ayodhya verdict. “The mistake should not recur. Through a unified fight, we can win,” he said.

He said there would be no future, if people did not unite to protest against disgrace to the Constitution and national flag. He also accused the ruling dispensation of trying to divide people on the lines of religion, which was very harmful to the nation.

‘Counter acts’

Activist Aradhana Bhargav from Madhya Pradesh said the ruling disposition was sending activists to prison for raising rightful questions pertaining to the problems of country. However, such acts could be countered through Shaheen Bagh-type protests, Mr. Bhargav said.

91,2020/02/21,Chief Secretary: Proposal to shift offices to North Karnataka remains on paper,"‘As many as 11 offices were to be shifted to Bombay Karnataka, Kalyana Karnataka districts by 2019-end’

Two years ago, the State government announced that senior officers of some departments would be shifted to North Karnataka cities to ensure effective decentralisation. But the plans have mostly remained on paper, the Chief Secretary noted in a recent order.

“As many as 11 offices were to be shifted to Bombay Karnataka and Kalyana Karnataka districts before the end of 2019. Noting that not much work had been done on this front, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar extended the date till February 17. Initial orders are being prepared,” said a senior officer in the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms.

The Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board was to be divided into North Karnataka and south Karnataka units. The North Karnataka unit was to be set up in Hubballi.

One of the Upalokayuktas was to be seated in Dharwad, the Krishna Bhagya Jal Nigam was to be shifted to Alamatti dam site in Bagalkot district and Karnataka Niravari Nigam office to Davangere, The Karnataka Textile Infrastructure Development Corporation was to function from Belagavi, the sugar director and sugarcane commissioner was to function out of Belagavi, and the heritage commissionerate was to start working from Hampi. One of the information commissioner was to sit in the revenue headquarters of Kalaburgi and Belagavi, and a human rights commissioner was to set up office in Dharwad. Apart from these, a North Karnataka development board was to be set up in Hubballi.

A promise to shift some offices to northern Karnataka was made by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in 2017. It was renewed by former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in 2018. B.S. Yediyurappa, who was Opposition leader joined a team of Lingayat seers who were protesting for shifting of offices to Suvarna Soudha, and said he would shift the office when the BJP came to power.

The State Cabinet cleared the proposals in September 2019, giving a three-month window for completion of the process. But that did not happen and the last date had to be extended to February 17. However, even after the fresh orders, very little work is being done on the ground, say officers.

As for Belagavi, efforts are on to shift only two of the three offices planned earlier, say officials. What is more, they are not being shifted to Suvarna Soudha.

The sugar director and sugarcane commissioner visited the S. Nijalingappa Sugar institute earlier this week and announced that the offices would be shifted here. Junior officers and support staff would be shifted before March 31 and the office should start working from April 1, said a senior officer in the regional commissionerate.

Work on shifting the Information Commissioner’s office is also in progress. A building has been selected and a team is working on finalising the furniture and interiors. It should be shifted in a month or so, said a officer. However, there is no word on shifting the Karnataka Textile Infrastructure Development Corporation office to the Suvarna Soudha till now.

Political observers say this is not the first time such ideas have been floated. “A similar assurance was given by the S.M. Krishna government too. Nine offices were to be shifted by 2002. But that never happened. In 2006, a sugar director was posted to Belagavi, who went back to Bengaluru in a year. The post of education commissioners for Dharwad and Kalaburgi was degraded after senior officers refused to be posted. It is difficult to convince them to relocate,” says a BJP member in the legislative council.

Officers argue that announcements of shifting offices to the districts are not backed by preparations. “This needs serious cadre planning and readjustment. It is impractical to expect officers of the cadre of additional chief secretary or principal secretary to move out of Bengaluru. If the government wants decentralised offices, it should ask officers above the grade of Deputy Commissioner to spend three to five years in the districts before they head to Bengaluru. Officers of higher grade would not like to go to the districts or divisions,” said a DPAR officer. DPAR has suggested some changes to be made to the detailed orders to be issued for shifting of offices to the divisions, he informed.

The idea of shifting some offices is only symbolic, says Ashok Chandaragi, convenor of Kannada organisations in Belagavi. He felt that effective decentralisation of funds and powers to officers at village, taluk, district and division-level officers would resolve the issue, rather than shifting some offices for temporary periods to Belagavi, Dharwad or Kalaburgi.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/umgwak/article30883082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGSUVARNASOUDHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chief-secretary-proposal-to-shift-offices-to-north-karnataka-remains-on-paper/article30883083.ece

93,2020/02/21,Moorusavir Mutt succession row escalates,"Seer accuses vested interests of not being interested in development of mutt

The succession row that rocked the Moorusavir Mutt five years ago, which has been raked up now, further escalated on Friday with one of the claimants, Sri Dingaleshwar Swami, making charges against the high-power core committee of the mutt and members of the committee signalling that they would not allow a scheduled event planned by the seer on Sunday.

The seer, who has been going around the twin cities holding meeting of the community members, has declared that he would enter the mutt on Sunday [February 23] to hold ‘Satya Darshan Sabhe’ [meeting to reveal truth] about the succession issue.

This development has been opposed strongly by a section of the devotees of the mutt, including members of the core committee, and a few even questioned the authority of the seer on holding such a meeting at the mutt.

The core committee, that includes Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar, former Minister Basavaraj Horatti, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and others, has some differences with some choosing to remain aloof, while others, like Vijay Sankeshwar, former MP, who has since resigned from the committee, openly supporting the seer’s claim.

To further add to the confusion, another claimant for the successor’s post, the seer of Gubbalagudda Kempayya Swami Mutt Mallikarjun Swami, too has sought permission from the Police Commissionerate to allow him to hold a meeting of devotees as per their wishes at the mutt on Sunday.

He has even claimed that he was appointed successor to the mutt in 1998 itself and now some were creating confusion about the issue.

On Thursday, Chief Minister’s Legal Adviser and member of core committee Mohan Limbikai made a clear statement against holding the meeting on the mutt premises and categorically ruled out allowing any such meeting.

Mr. Shettar, on the other hand, told presspersons that the question of choosing a successor to the peetha did not arise as the issue was yet to be decided by the court.

He categorically stated that neither he had not been invited to any such meeting at the mutt nor he would participate in any such meeting.

“What I can do if Dingaleshwar Swami has convened a meeting,” he asked adding that the seers were supposed to guide them [politicians], but it was sad that they had reached such a situation where they had to guide the seers.

Meanwhile, Dingaleshwar Swami, who is keen on holding the meeting at the mutt on Sunday and who was denied a meeting with the present seer on Thursday, held a press conference on Friday accusing some vested interests of systematically keeping the present seer under confinement.

The seer, who did not take any names, said that vested interests were not interested in the development of mutt and accused them of grabbing the mutt property. He even said that he had helped the Moorusavir Mutt seer when the mutt was in dire straits and now the now the seer should help him in return.

Although core committee member Shankranna Munavalli had mentioned the likelihood of the committee holding a meeting on Friday, it did not happen.

Amid all these developments, the police have further tightened security around the mutt and anyone entering the mutt, particularly those wanting to meet the present seer, are being let in after enquiries.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/moorusavir-mutt-succession-row-escalates/article30881743.ece
94,2020/02/21,Kalasa Banduri project will get priority in the budget: CM,"Adequate provisions will be made in the forthcoming State budget for the implementation of the Kalasa Banduri project on a priority basis.

This was stated by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa during his visit to the city on Friday. He said the project was beset with problems for years, but they have been resolved and it will be accorded priority in the budget along with other development works.

The Supreme Court on Thursday issued directives to the Centre for notification of the final award of the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal. This paves way for the implementation of the Kalasa Banduri project to be taken up by the State by utilising 7.56 tmc ft of water from Mahadayi river to shore up drinking water supply to Hubballi-Dharwad and Haveri, Gadag, Belagavi and Bagalkot districts.

The Chief Minister said the budget will be presented on March 5 and all preparations pertaining to were underway and it will take final shape by March 3. “The government has just completed 7 months in office and it will take at least another 6 months for the people to realise and know the development works taken up by us,’ he added.

In reply to a question on providing additional relief to the flood-affected victims of the State, Mr. Yediyurappa said the government has undertaken all that was possible in that connection. In case there are any lacunae it will be sorted out, he added.

Responding to the statements of the former Chief Minister and leader of the Opposition Mr. Siddaramaiah that the State government will have to face public wrath for not providing proper governance, Mr. Yediyurappa shot back saying: “What did he do in 5 years? Let him be patient and wait for another six months. He was the Chief Minister for 5 years and H.D. Kumaraswamy was at the helm of affairs for one year and both did nothing. So how can they question me on this issue when I have just completed 7 months in office?”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kalasa-banduri-project-will-get-priority-in-the-budget-cm/article30881171.ece

Participating in a debate in the Assembly on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address, Mr. Patil maintained that it would take a minimum of five years for the government to clear such a huge pendency of files.

Seeking to remind the BJP government of the file-clearance campaign taken up for the first time by the then Chief Minister R. Gundu Rao in the 1980s, the Congress leader urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to take up a similar campaign to fast track the file-clearance process.

“Taking up a campaign to clear the files on a war footing will reduce corruption,” Mr. Patil said, while alleging that “presently, without corruption, no files are moving ahead. Either you need political influence or money to move the files.”

He also sought to dispute the claims made in the Governor’s address to the legislative Houses in which there is a reference to the State finances being good. Pointing out that Mr. Yediyurappa had cited the tough financial situation as the main reason for withdrawing funds allocated to constituencies of some of the Congress and JD(S) MLAs, he wondered how could the government say, in the Governor’s speech, that the finances are good.

Ramaswamy critical of releasing development funds in the name of BJP workers

Senior Janata Dal (S) member A.T. Ramaswamy on Thursday took serious exception to the new trend of the BJP government releasing development funds in the name of party workers. Raising the issue in the Assembly, Mr. Ramaswamy referred to the instances in which grants for various development works had been issued in the name of party workers. He wondered if it had any sanctity as those workers were not accountable to government institutions.

It was nothing but misuse of pubic funds, he alleged.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/107-lakh-files-pending-in-state-alleges-hk-patil/article30874877.ece

98,2020/02/21,A musical tribute to Jayachamaraja Wadiyar,"The third segment of the birth centenary of the last maharaja of Mysore, Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, was held in the city on Thursday. Tributes were paid to him for his contribution to the field of classical music, wildlife and biodiversity conservation.

The programme was organised by the H.H. Sri Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar Foundation.

Renowned classical musician Sukanya Prabhakar rendered compositions of the last maharaja in a musical feature titled ‘Gaanarajendra Sri Jayachamarajendra, a Sangeetha Roopaka’. Jairam Ramesh, MP, delivered a lecture on Wadiyar’s contribution to wildlife and environmental conservation. Musicologist the late R. Satyanarayana (posthumous), T.S. Satyavathi and Sukanya Prabhakar were conferred the Sri Jayachamaraja Prashasthi on the occasion.

The two daughters of the last maharaja spoke about their father. Kamakshi Devi said that though he was a maharaja to the rest of the world, to them his attitude was the same as that of any parent. “We used to have breakfast together and he would make inquiries about our progress in studies and at school,” she recalled.

“He was genial, full of humour and well-read, and would always encourage us to read books,” she said. He also used to write letters to his family members during his tours, and the address used to be ‘The Palace, Mysore, South India’. The letters would all be promptly delivered.

That he was philosophical and down to earth manifested when the Government of India abolished the privy purse. “He was least affected and decided to downsize his lifestyle with ease though he was overnight reduced from a maharaja to an ordinary citizen. This was because he was a true philosopher,” Ms. Kamakshi Devi said.

His other daughter, Indrakshi Devi, paid similar tributes and also recalled the contribution of her brother, the late Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, whose birth anniversary fell on Thursday. “He underwent many tribulations in life but had fortitude, and despite all adversities my brother continued to observe the family traditions of conducting rituals and celebrations. Without his efforts, Dasara as it is celebrated today would not have existed,” she said.

Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar and others were present at the programme.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-musical-tribute-to-jayachamaraja-wadiyar/article30874442.ece
99,2020/02/21,Jairam Ramesh recalls Jayachamaraja Wadiyar’s contribution to wildlife conservation,"Little-known facets of the last maharaja of Mysuru, the late Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, and his concern and love for wildlife and environment came to light during his birth centenary celebrations in the city on Thursday.

Congress MP and former Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh brought up these nuggets, gleaned from various sources, including official records and archives not easily accessible to the public.

Not many are aware that when the Central Board for Wildlife was constituted in March 1952, Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, who was then the Rajapramukh of Mysore, was appointed as its first chairman. Mr. Ramesh said his name was suggested by the then Minister of Food and Agriculture K.M. Munshi and it was “enthusiastically accepted” by Jawaharlal Nehru.

Mr. Ramesh said one reason Wadiyar was selected for the post was the conservation records established by the Mysore State. He pointed out that the Venugopal Wildlife Park within Bandipur was closed to all timber operations from around 1940 and the Mysore Game Rules put limits on tiger hunting as early as 1931.

The Mysuru zoo had a record among Indian zoos of captive breeding of elephants, and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary was established in 1943 following the suggestions of ornithologist Salim Ali, said Mr. Ramesh.

The first meeting of the board was held in Mysuru from November 24 to December 1, 1952, at Lalitha Mahal Palace. This, Mr. Ramesh said, was a landmark conclave in the history of India’s wildlife protection and deserves to be resurrected from the oblivion to which it has been consigned, he added.

Two speeches

Wadiyar not only actively participated in and conducted deliberations with great erudition and sensitivity, but also made two major speeches — the first on the opening day and the second on the closing day. Both were described as striking and demonstrating his profound knowledge of ancient scriptures in the original Sanskrit, according to Mr. Ramesh.

Highlighting the salient features of one of the speeches, drawn from records, Mr. Ramesh said the former ruler had made out a strong case for protection of wildlife and made a special mention of the lion as it adorns the Ashoka Pillar. Subsequently, Wadiyar recalled various references to the lion in the scriptures and spoke about how wildlife was connected with the cultural life of Indians for centuries. Apart from calling for special status for the lion, which materialised five years later at Gir Sanctuary in Gujarat, the Lalitha Mahal Palace meeting saw the passage of a resolution calling for the lion’s protection.

Another 12 species were added to the list of animals that needed special protection, including the snow leopard, clouded leopard, rhinoceros, Indian wild ass, Kashmir stag, and Great Indian Bustard, but strangely the tiger, which went on to become India’s national animal, was not in the list. However, the list was not exhaustive and was expanded periodically, according to Mr. Ramesh.

He said Wadiyar continued to be the chairman of the wildlife board through the 1950s and 1960s, but could not devote much time to it because of illness. But there was one important meeting in February 1961, which saw the recommendation of making the peacock the national bird, said Mr. Ramesh.

100,2020/02/21,"It’ll be a 90-min. drive between Mysuru, Bengaluru: Simha","Work on widening expressway expected to be over by early 2022

Travel time between Mysuru and Bengaluru by road is expected to reduce from three hours to ninety minutes by early 2022 when the work on widening the expressway is slated to be completed.

The work on the 118 km-long expressway between Columbia Asia junction in Mysuru and Panchamukhi Temple near NICE Road junction in Bengaluru began in two packages in May and December 2019. While 34 per cent physical progress has been recorded in the work on the first package between Bengaluru and Nidaghatta, the physical progress in the second package between Nidaghatta and Mysuru is 5.2 per cent. The highway when widened will comprise 10 lanes, including six-lane access controlled expressway for through traffic and a two-lane service road on either side of the expressway to segregate rural traffic.

Elevated corridor

The widened expressway will also comprise an elevated corridor of about 8 km on the outskirts of Bengaluru and six bypasses for Bidadi, Ramanagaram, Channapatna, Maddur, Mandya, and Srirangapatna with an aggregate length of 51.5 km.

Addressing a press conference here along with NHAI Superintending Engineer Sridhar, Mysuru MP Pratap Pratap Simha said the contractor for the project M/s Dilip Buildcon Ltd. has been given 30 months for completing the project. But the contractor is expected to complete the work two to four months ahead of the deadline.

“The widened expressway will be ready by January-February 2020,” said Mr. Simha. While the six-lane expressway will be a tolled road with toll plazas coming up at Kumbalgodu and near Srirangapatna, use of service roads will be free.

Two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and tractors would not be permitted on the expressway, said Mr. Sridhar.

To a question, Mr. Simha ruled out the possibility of further expanding the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway beyond the ongoing widening project.

While the highway could be further expanded, Mr. Simha said the capacity could be increased by other modes, including monorail. However, the MP favoured increasing the rail capacity to facilitate travel of more people between Mysuru and Bengaluru. Promoting travel by train would also help reduce carbon footprint, he said.

Mr. Simha said there was no proposal before the government to revive the NICE, which was envisaged more than 20 years ago.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/k312jt/article30874322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MYSSIMHANHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/itll-be-a-90-min-drive-between-mysuru-bengaluru-simha/article30874324.ece
101,2020/02/21,New highway between Mysuru and Kushalnagar,"Project to be taken up by National Highways Authority of India

Land acquisition will soon begin for a new Mysuru-Kushalnagar highway project to be taken up by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).

The alignment of the proposed 93-km long four-lane highway project, which has received in principle-approval from the authorities, will be part of the 376-km long National Highway 275 between Bengaluru and Bantwal.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said this highway, which would start with a deviation at Paschimavahini, near Srirangapatna, on Mysuru-Bengaluru highway, would actually skip Mysuru.

Once the new highway was ready, road travellers between Bengaluru and Madikeri need not enter Mysuru, but could take a deviation near Paschimavahini. This would not only reduce the travel time, but also spare Mysuru of the congestion, noise and air pollution, he reasoned.

The new alignment of the four-lane national highway will pass through Gungral Chatra, Hale Unduwadi and Hosa Ramanahalli before bypassing Hunsur, Periyapatna, and Kushalnagar. Three bypasses had been proposed having an aggregate length of 84 km. While the combined bypass for Mysuru, Bilikere, and Hunsur would be 51.43 km, the bypasses for Kushalnagar and Periyapatna would be 12.34 km and 20.22 km respectively.

The 93-km-long highway project taken up by NHAI would cost ₹3,120 crore, including land acquisition and civil works.

“Since, the alignment passes through agricultural/dry land, the level of social and environmental impact is less,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-highway-between-mysuru-and-kushalnagar/article30874309.ece
102,2020/02/21,Mahadayi: SC passes interim order allowing State’s plea to notify award,"Yediyurappa describes it as victory; Jarkiholi says it was ‘realisation of the dreams of farmers of NK’

The Supreme Court on Thursday passed an interim order allowing an application by Karnataka to notify the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal award.

The implementation of the award would, however, be subject to the final judgment of the Supreme Court in the civil appeals filed by Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra challenging the allocation of the water from Mahadayi river among them.

Neither of the two States, Goa and Maharashtra, opposed the plea made by Karnataka to publish the August 2018 tribunal award in the official gazette. A Bench, led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, listed the petitions for final arguments in July.

While Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa described it as a victory, Minister for Major and Medium Irrigation Ramesh Jarkiholi said that it was “realisation of the dreams of the farmers of North Karnataka”.

He said that a total 13.42 tmcft of water, which is the State’s share, would be used in the right way. “The final hearing for decision is on July 15, 2020, We will provide all necessary/additional documents to the Supreme Court and ensure that the water is received lawfully,” he said.

The tribunal had allocated 13.42 tmcft of water (including 3.9 tmcft for diversion into the depleted Malaprabha river basin) from the Mahadayi river basin to Karnataka.

Maharashtra was allotted 1.33 tmcft of water while Goa was given 24 tmcft in the final decision of the tribunal. The UPA-II government had constituted Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal in 2010.

The Karnataka government had petitioned the tribunal seeking release of 7.56 tmcft of water for the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project. The Kalasa-Banduri Nala (diversion) project, which will utilise 7.56 tmcft from Mahadayi river, is being undertaken by Karnataka to improve drinking water supply to Hubballi-Dharwad and the districts of Belagavi and Gadag.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahadayi-sc-passes-interim-order-allowing-states-plea-to-notify-award/article30874302.ece
103,2020/02/21,Tribal school in Kerala brings out a Muthuvan dictionary,"Work by Edamalakkudy school features around 2,500 words used by tribespeople

The Muthuvan tribal community of Edamalakkudy, the first tribal grama panchayat in the State, has come out with a dictionary, Malayalam Muthuvan Bhasha Nikhandu. Muthuvans speak a different dialect of Malayalam, but they have a language of their own, used exclusively within the community. This language is Greek to Malayalis.

It was with an aim of keeping the Muthuvan language alive that a dictionary was brought out after prolonged research.

Around 2,500 exclusive words used by the Muthuvan community find a place in the dictionary, released under the auspices of the Government Tribal Lower Primary School, Edamalakkudy.

Language barrier

The dictionary was prepared by a team led by a Kozhikode resident and teacher Sudheesh V. The publishers say the effort was made to overcome the community’s language barrier and help them with their education.

Beneficiaries

Teachers at the lower primary school have been finding it hard to communicate with the children who learn Malayalam only when they join school. Also, in 2018-19, the textbook of Class 1 was completely switched to the tribal language. Many teachers opted to go on leave when posted in Edamalakkudy. The language posed a problem for the newly transferred officials too. The new dictionary is expected to solve such problems to a large extent.

Georgekutty, who had served for long at the Edamalakkudy grama panchayat and is familiar with the tribal language, said the dictionary would help tribespeople to be proficient in their own language. It would not only serve the Muthuvans of Edamalakkudy but also those in other forest settlements spread over the Munnar region of the Western Ghats.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/w4s5kk/article30883819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200221-WA0141,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tribal-school-brings-out-a-muthuvan-dictionary/article30883821.ece

106,2020/02/21,"Soon, enjoy a solar-powered mini-train ride at Veli","₹9-crore project is part of ₹30-crore development work at tourist village

Soon, a visit to the Veli tourist village, the landscaped picnic spot where Veli Lake meets the Arabian Sea, will be incomplete without a ride in the solar-powered mini-train. The mini-train, with an engine modelled on the exterior of a yesteryear steam engine, will chug along the idyllic village and the beach for 1.6 km. Artificial fumes as in the steam locomotive, a traditionally modelled railway station, tunnel, and railway bridge await the riders.

Track-changing points, additional tracks for facilitating train crossings, and old-fashioned ‘arm signals’ provided along the route add aestheticism with safety to the 25-minute ride.

Side protection to the tracks using wood meshing and steel frame and fibreglass partition to ensure safety of the riders and other visitors will also be built. Turntables at one end to turn the engines around the old-fashioned way will also be provided.

To be operated by the Kerala State Cooperative Tourism Federation (Tourfed), the 10-ft locomotive is of international design. Its three coaches will accommodate 48 passengers. Each sleekly designed coach will have rooftop solar panels to draw power directly.

The route

The train will begin its journey from the mini-railway station, named Veli Village, near the main entrance of the tourist village, traverse the artificial lake. It will cross over to the other side of the village over a 60-m new railway bridge constructed parallel to the present floating bridge and go around the artificial mound, tunnel, and stop at the Pozhikara station, before returning.

Locopilots will double as guards and food and drink stalls attached to the railway stations will make the ride joyful. The track- changing points will be electrically controlled and manually operated. The technical assistance for the maiden narrow gauge project in this part of the country has been extended by Quilon Miniature Railway. Although the maximum speed is 15 kmph, the train will cruise at less than 10 kmph, offering a scenic ride for the travellers.

Laying of the rail is expected to be completed in two weeks with the work on the 60-m bridge that will link the village and Pozhikkara. The authorities will begin trial in the second week of March and fine-tune the operations.

“It will be thrown open to the public during the first week of April and it is going to be one of the biggest attractions for the young and old alike,” Tourfed managing director Shaji Madhavan said.

108,2020/02/21,A could-have-been mesmerising film,"Trance becomes a half-baked attempt after interval

The irony of spiritual leaders who preach a ‘higher’ life free from worldly pleasures, while themselves revelling in a high-flying life complete with private islands and super cars, is often lost on their legion of followers. Entranced by their shallow preachings, targeted at the myriad vulnerabilities of the listeners, many blindly fall into the trap. Trance, directed by Anwar Rasheed, is partly about the careful corporate strategies that goes into the making of one such god figure — Pastor Joshua Carlton (Fahadh Fazil), an atheist who happens to be full of vulnerabilities, which are exploited by two shadowy businessmen (Gautham Menon and Chemban Vinod). Before being catapulted into the spotlight in this new avatar, the pastor used to be Viju Prasad, an aspiring motivational speaker struggling to make his way up.

Mental journey

Beyond the surface, the film is also about his mental journey, which oscillates from emotional troughs to drug-induced highs and to manic extremes, similar to what the pastor’s naive followers are often caught in.

The first half of the film, which captures this transformation, is gripping, owing much to Fahadh’s performance that convinces even the otherwise sceptic viewer who looks down upon such charlatans to partly root for him. The film attains its high by the interval point, almost having the viewer in a trance. That moment was pregnant with possibilities, enough to hold the audience in a rapture till the end.

Unfortunately, from this point, the script goes downhill. One gets to see the writer taking the easy way out at crucial points, bumping off key characters in a tame manner and depending on the usual television newsbreaks to untangle tricky situations.

It loses its plot in trying to say too many things, on everything from depression to drug addiction. Though juxtaposing all this opens the doors to some more intriguing possibilities, it only serves to drag down the plot. The pastor’s sequences with his new secretary Esther Lopez (Nazriya Nazim) only adds to the runtime.

Trance might still manage to ruffle quite a lot of feathers across various religious cults and the among their wide fan base, but as a serious critique of corporate spirituality and as a piece of cinema, it is a half-baked attempt. Having experienced its potency at half-bake, one can only wonder what they would have achieved with a little more patience and ingenuity.

The Southern Railway is gearing up to operate a Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) in the Mangaluru-Shoranur sector, possibly in April.

The advanced 3-phase MEMU rake which works with highly advanced technology with passenger-friendly features, has been the long-pending demand of the rail users in north Kerala. The Railway had rolled out three-phase MEMU (Mainline Electric Multiple Unit) trains in September last in other sectors in the division.

Now, Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas has assured a delegation of the Confederation of All India Rail Users’ Association in Chennai that the MEMU services would be rolled out when the Palakkad division completed the works for this purpose.

The Ministry of Railways has allocated ₹15 crore to establish the MEMU service in the Palakkad division. Currently, the division operates MEMU services in the Palakkad-Ernakulam, Shoranur-Erode and Palakkad-Salem sections. However, the proposal was to introduce the services linking Mangaluru, Kannur, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Coimbatore.

The advanced 3-phase AC MEMU will replace the existing single phase DC MEMU.

111,2020/02/21,Kadakkal grama panchayat goes hi-tech,"First geoinformatics local body in Kollam district

With all its important records in digital format, the Kadakkal grama panchayat has become the first geoinformatics local body in the district.

The data has been collected using geomapping and the panchayat’s geoinformatics portal currently has all details of roads, walkways and buildings in the panchayat along with information related to agriculture and irrigation.

Personal details

Through the portal the authorities can access the personal details of residents and these will be analysed while making policies and implementing development projects.

This Geographic Information System-based software will help the panchayat administration to mange and monitor different projects by providing all required data.

Several local bodies in the State, including block panchayts and municipalities, have already switched to this system.

Apart from accession the database, the portal has provision to add additional details and make corrections.

Extensive survey

The panchayat had conducted an extensive survey for the project spending ₹12 lakh from its fund.

All infrastructural details of the panchayat, including its assets and amenities, have been recorded as part of the project.

The socio-economic indicators of each household in the panchayat have been entered in the software, but the public will have no access to such information.

Panchayat officials, who are trained on how to use the data effectively, will be handling it.

They can share it with other government departments for the effective implementation of projects and ensuring that various government schemes reach the right beneficiaries.

The project is implemented with the help of Grameena Patana Kendram, a registered society under the Travancore-Cochin Charitable Societies Act, based in Karakulam, Tiruvananthapuram, which provided the technical assistance and conducted geomapping for the project.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kadakkal-grama-panchayat-goes-hi-tech/article30883412.ece

Sivaratri was celebrated with devotion and religious fervour on Friday.

Ceremonial processions to the accompaniments of caparisoned elephants, traditional temple orchestra and Kavadiyattom marked the celebrations in the district.

Devotees, dressed in red, rose and yellow costumes, performed Kavadiyattom as a votive offering to the presiding deity at various Siva temples.

The Kavadiyattom at the Thirmalida Mahadevar temple at Mallappally was a major Sivaratri event in the district and hundreds of devotees took part in the ceremonial procession.

Devotees carrying richly decorated wooden arches (kavadi) on their shoulders performed the ritualistic dance (kavadiyattom) from the Pariyaram Sree Krishna temple to the Thirumalida Mahadevar temple.

Frenzied dance

Hundreds of devotees thronged the dry sandbed of the Manimala tiver at Mallappally to witness the Kavadiyattom procession to the temple in the forenoon.

Devotees, with ornate Kavadi on their shoulder, a few of them with slender arrows pierced through their cheeks, danced in a divine frenzy in tune with the rhythmic beatings of chenda and nagawarom in the ceremonial processions.

Sivaratri is celebrated to commemorate the legendary wedding day of Lord Siva and Goddess Parvathi. Devout Hindus observed fasting and offered prayers at various Siva temples where special rituals were performed on the auspicious day.

114,2020/02/21,Paddy harvest begins in Kuttanad,"Farmers worried over shortage of combined harvesters in district

The harvest of the ‘puncha’ crop (first crop) has begun in Kuttanad.

A 190-hectare paddy field in Chithira Kayal was the first to go under the harvester on Friday. It was inaugurated by District Collector M. Anjana. The Valiya Pattathanam paddy field in Edathua will be the next, on February 23.

From March

According to officials, large-scale paddy harvest will commence from March. Earlier, sowing was delayed in several areas due to rain and shortage of seeds.

Although the harvesting has started, farmers are worried over the shortage of combined harvesters in the district. The government has announced that the procurement price will be given to farmers within a week. However, not many farmers are ready to take the promise at face value. For, several farmers are yet to receive the price for their second crop in 2019.

According to the Agriculture Department, the farmers have undertaken paddy farming in more than 27,500 hectares in the district, a major portion of which is in Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala.

In the previous puncha crop season (2018-19), the farmers cultivated paddy in around 31,000 hectares. Supplyco had procured 1.93 lakh tonnes of paddy worth ₹490.57 crore from 34,662 farmers in Alappuzha in the last season. However, the farmers suffered huge losses in the second crop season due to torrential downpour and widespread bund breaches in Kuttanad.

Senior paddy marketing officer A.V. Suresh Kumar said 34,000 farmers in the district had so far registered online with the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) for selling their produce this season. Supplyco has extended the deadline for online registration to February 25. They were expecting another bumper crop this season.

Procurement price

The procurement price offered this season is ₹26.95 a kg. This includes the minimum support price of ₹18.15 and the State incentive bonus of ₹8.80.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ft54ss/article30883373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv22alppucha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/paddy-harvest-begins-in-kuttanad/article30883368.ece
115,2020/02/21,Tiruppur accident | RTO finds fault with truck driver,"Report to be sent to State Transport Commissioner today

The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has confirmed that the gruesome bus accident that claimed 19 lives at Tiruppur on Thursday was a result of the truck driver’s fault.

A preliminary investigation conducted by Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement) P. Sivakumar has found that the truck driver might have either dozed off or been careless. Mr. Sivakumar will send his report to the Transport Commissioner on Saturday.

The investigation has ruled out any mechanical failure as the cause of the accident. The braking system and ABS (anti-lock braking system) of the truck and the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation Volvo bus were found perfect.

The container truck had burst its back tyres after they rubbed up against the kerb stones of the divider. The truck had hauled itself along the divider for about 60 metres before jumping over to the opposite track and colliding with the speeding KSRTC bus.

The transport authorities have found no reason to accept the claim made by the truck driver that the bursting of the tyres had caused the accident.

Mr. Sivakumar has found that the trailed container carrying a heavy load of marble slabs had slid off the median on to the opposite lane and rammed the bus and destroyed it, even when the truck’s cabin was safe.

The accident had occurred soon after a curve and a slope. The road, according to transport authorities, was not technically perfect.

Lorry bays

Mr. Sivakumar said he would strongly recommend setting up of lorry bays as a measure to prevent such accidents. Lack of lorry bays has claimed many lives on National Highways in Kerala. There is no lorry bay in Palakkad, the biggest district in the State through which National Highways 544 and 966 cross.

Although the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has earmarked some land for construction of a lorry bay at Chithali, near Palakkad, on National Highway 544, it is yet to be developed.

“I am recommending that lorry bays be developed on a stretch of 50-60 km. The lorry bay at Chithali should be constructed without delay,” Mr. Sivakumar said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/v8lbaf/article30886854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVBUSTRAGEDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rto-finds-fault-with-truck-driver/article30882648.ece
116,2020/02/21,KAS preliminary exams today,"Measures in place to check malpractices

The first-ever preliminary examinations for recruitment to the Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) will be held on Saturday across 1,535 centres amid heightened security to prevent malpractices.

Approximately four lakh candidates have submitted their confirmation to the PSC for appearing for the KAS Officer (Junior Time Scale) examination, PSC officials said on Friday. The Commission has put in place a slew of measures to discourage malpractices including the misuse of technology to cheat.

No electronic devices

Electronic devices are strictly banned inside the exam halls. Candidates will be allowed to carry only the admission card, identity proof and ball-point pen inside the halls.

Mobile phones, watches, wallets/purses will have to be placed in cloak rooms specially provided for the purpose, officials said.

Exam supervisors have also been asked to examine objects such as spectacles for hidden devices in case if suspicion.

In the run-up to KAS 2020, the Cyber Cell had conducted sessions for officials in January on what to watch out for in the age of smart devices to prevent malpractices.

Similar sessions were held in all districts for senior Education Department officials/teachers who would be helping the PSC to conduct the exam.

“All arrangements are in place for the smooth conduct of the examination. We have also taken all possible precautions to prevent cheating,” PSC Chairman M.K. Sakeer said.

Two parts

The preliminary exams come in two parts. The first paper (general studies) carries 100 marks while the second paper will have general knowledge questions for 50 marks, questions for 30 marks on language proficiency (Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada) plus questions for 20 marks on proficiency in English.

Paper one will be held from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and paper two from 1.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. on Saturday.

Officials have asked candidates to be present at the centres by 9.45 a.m. and by 1.15 p.m. for the afternoon session. Candidates will not be allowed inside the halls after 10 a.m. and 1.30 p.m.

KAS recruitment is through three separate streams: 1: direct recruitment; 2: direct recruitment from among full members or approved probationers of any government department, and 3: direct recruitment from among candidates holding gazetted post or above in departments in schedule-1 and equivalent posts in common categories listed in scheduled-1.

117,2020/02/21,"Coalition issues, Kuttanad bypoll to figure in UDF meet","Brainstorming session here on February 25

A sense of urgency appears to pervade the United Democratic Front (UDF) as it liaison committee prepares to convene for a crucial meeting here on February 25.

The split in the Kerala Congress (Jacob) and the festering internecine feud in the Kerala Congress (M) put the coalition in the peril of looking shaky in the run-up to the Assembly byelection in Kuttanad and the local body polls later.

The referendums are widely perceived as a bellwether of the State’s voting pattern in the Assembly elections in 2021. However, electoral choices can fluctuate given that neighbourhood level issues often matter more in local body polls than in Assembly elections.

The split in the Kerala Congress (Jacob) comes at a time when the UDF has reportedly discerned a growing affinity in the numerically strong Jacobite faction in the Malankara Church with the Left Democratic Front (LDF).

The recent law allowing Christians to bury their dead in their parish cemetery irrespective of their canonical grouping is deemed to have benefited the community, which has outsize political influence in Piravam, Kunnathunadu, Muvattupuzha, Permbavoor, Angamaly and Kothamangalam constituencies, according to a UDF estimate.

Moreover, the LDF has also dangled the promise of introducing a law or promulgating an ordinance that would give elected parish councils a say in the administration of the church, a demand moved by various Christian denominations.

Members of the laity had held a massive demonstration in the capital in November to press for the enactment of the law. By some accounts, the Congress might make a bid for the Kuttanad Assembly seat in the UDF meeting, which is currently vested with the Kerala Congress (M).

The UDF is also concerned about the LDF’s overtures towards its traditional support base in the Muslim community. The coalition is likely to discuss the succession of corruption and criminal cases against its top leaders and ensure that it does not cede the initiative in the anti-citizenship law agitation against the Centre to the LDF.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coalition-issues-kuttanad-bypoll-to-figure-in-udf-meet/article30882344.ece
118,2020/02/21,Kerala Congress (Jacob) split complete,"Johnny Nellore goes with P.J. Joseph faction of KC(M)

Staying true to its reputation of ‘growing by mutation,’ the Kerala Congress witnessed yet another split here on Friday when one of its splinter groups, Kerala Congress (Jacob), further divided into two groups.

The vertical split, which marks the culmination of a protracted power struggle between the party chairman Johnny Nellore and party leader Anoop Jacob, MLA, is expected to trigger a major realignment of forces within the broad platform of the regional party.

Among the two groups that took shape on Friday, the faction led by Mr. Nellore is slated to merge with the KC(M) group led by P.J. Joseph. The group led by Mr. Jacob, will stay as an independent party, at least for the time being.

Announcing the decision to merge with the Joseph group at a joint meeting to be held in Ernakulam on February 29, Mr. Nellore accused Mr. Jacob of attempting to weaken the party from within for the interest of a few. “I prefer to remain as an ordinary worker of the Kerala Congress led by Mr. Joseph than staying as the chairman of a much smaller outfit,” he said, while addressing the party workers in Kottayam.

Earlier in the day, the high-power committee and state committee meetings convened by Mr. Joseph formally accorded permission to proceed with the merger plan. The State committee meeting convened by Mr. Jacob at the KC(Jacob) office here, meanwhile, reported an earlier decision by the high power committee to wind up the merger plans and resolved to go ahead as KC(Jacob).

Speaking on the occasion, he accused Mr. Nellore of initiating anti-party activities and that a three-member commission had been appointed to initiate further action. “Mr. Nellore has just left the party and not split it vertically. You cannot really call it a split if only a handful of people are leaving an organiastion,” Mr. Jacob said.

While Mr. Jacob had claimed the support of 11 district committees and majority of State leaders, Mr. Nellore had held that two out of three vice presidents, the office-charge general secretary and eight district committees were with him.

According to observers, the latest round of split is expected to set off a series of legal battles as in the case of KC(M). While the KC (Jacob) party constitution envisages equal division of power between the chairman and the party leader, it stipulates the chairman to function in concurrence with the party leader.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-congress-jacob-split-complete/article30882068.ece
119,2020/02/21,DGE recommends changes in Kerala Education Rules,"‘Additional teacher post only if there are six more students’

The Director of General Education (DGE) has recommended that the Kerala Education Rules be so amended that a second teacher post is created only if there is an increase of six students. It has also been recommended that the government take over the sanctioning of posts from Assistant Education Officers/District Education Officers. This follows an announcement in the Budget that the practice of creating an additional division and post even if the student strength increases by one should change.

Strength and divisions

The DGE has recommended that instead of creating an additional post if the number of students increases by one from 30 in lower primary classes, there should be 35 students in one division. If the strength is between 36 and 65, two divisions will be allowed, and three if the total number of students is between 66 and 95. Four divisions will be sanctioned if the strength is between 96 and 125, five if it is between 126 and 205 and so on.

In classes 6 to 8, there will be one division for up to 40 students, two for students between 41 and 75, three if its between 75 and 110, and four between 11 and 145. Now, an additional division is created if the total number of students touches 36.

In lower primary schools where the student strength is over 1,500 and in upper primary schools where it is 100, the DGE has also recommended against changing the practice of sanctioning additional posts of LP/UP school teacher by removing head teachers from the responsibility of class charge.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dge-recommends-changes-in-kerala-education-rules/article30877478.ece

121,2020/02/21,Gothra Sree project to empower tribal youths in sports sector,"Kudumbashree takes up mission to wean tribespeople away from alcohol addiction

The Kudumbashree Mission, Wayanad, is gearing up to set up a district level football team titled Gothra Sree to empower the tribal youths in the sports sector.

“The first such tribal youth club in the district was constituted in Meenangadi grama panchayat last year as a part of the mission’s intervention among tribal youths to empower them in the sports sector and tackle the increasing alcohol addiction among tribal people in the district,” says district mission coordinator P. Sajitha.

The pilot project was envisaged to curb the increasing alcohol addiction among tribal people and to tackle school drop-out by channelising the potential of the youth. The project is also aimed at nurturing their innate skills, conserving the social and cultural uniqueness of tribespersons, and bringing the marginal section of people to the mainstream, she said. The initiative was a huge success as it could tackle alcohol addiction among youths to a certain extent, and they started to engage in sports activities in the evenings after work.

“The success of the pilot project inspired us to expand the programme to other parts of the district by providing sports equipment to the youths. Now, the mission has set up 126 such clubs in various parts of the district and each club consists of 20 to 25 youths,” Ms. Sajtha said. “Alcohol consumption among tribal people, especially tribal youths in Paniya, Adiya and Kattunayakka tribal sects, is a major social issue in the district,” she said. “Many a time, the daily earnings of the majority of them are spent in liquor shops in the evenings, owing to a dearth of entertainments in tribal settlements. Though several initiatives have been taken to address the issue, the trend is going up at an alarming rate,” she said. The mission organised block level and district level football matches for the club members a few months ago and 60 good players were selected as a part of constituting a tribal football team. They were provided the services of expert football coaches and 30 from among them were selected for the district team, Ms. Sajitha said.

The team has been well trained to take part in any football matches at the State level, she said. The mission has spent nearly ₹7 lakh for the project so far, she said.

“The project has evoked a good response from tribal youths, and we are now planning to set up such clubs for tribal girls also,” she said.

The new initiative would be announced by State Sports Council president Olympian Mercy Kuttan at the municipal town hall here at 2 p.m. on Saturday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gothra-sree-project-to-empower-tribal-youths-in-sports-sector/article30875216.ece

It was a ‘black Thursday’ for the State-owned Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) with the ghastly accident in Coimbatore claiming the lives of 19 people.

The accident, one of the worst in the history of KSRTC, took place on the 82nd anniversary of the launch of the State motor service. The ruler of the erstwhile Travancore, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma had launched the service on February 20, 1938, soon after setting up the Travancore State Transport Department (TSTD).

Consequent on the enactment of Road Transports Corporation Act in 1950, the government formulated KSRTC rules in 1965 and the TSTD was converted into an autonomous Corporation on April 1, 1965.

The KSRTC will also miss the services of the driver and conductor who died in the accident.

The commuters and the KSRTC personnel fondly remember the services of Gireesh and Baiju, especially their heart warming efforts to save the life of a patient on board the bus that was coming from Bengalaru.

In July 2018, the KSRTC’s then Chairman and Managing Director Tomin Thachankery issued a special commendation letter to V.D. Gireesh from Perumbavoor and V.R. Baiju from Piravom after they proactively intervened to save the life of a woman passenger. Kavitha Warrier, a passenger, had seizures while the KSRTC Garuda Volvo bus was passing through Hosur.

The driver took a U-turn and drove 3 km to the nearest hospital. With the hospital insisting that there had to be a bystander, they contacted the KSRTC officials, who suggested that Baiju stay back at the hospital, till her relatives arrived. The commendation letter issued by the KSRTC spoke of their proactive intervention raising KSRTC’s image before the public. On Thursday, Dr. Warrier noted on Facebook that she lost a father figure who saved her life.

Friendly demeanour

Their friendly demeanour endeared them to passengers on the Bengaluru route, where the KSRTC faced stiff competition from private luxury buses, said Aliyar, an office-bearer of Kerala State Transport Workers Union. Baiju was the Ernakulam unit president of the union, which is affiliated to the INTUC.

Mr. Aliyar spoke of how the duo also helped rush a child, who suffered from epileptic fit while travelling to Bengaluru, to a hospital. “They also ensured that no passenger who had reserved a seat missed their bus, by even waiting for a few minutes till they made it to the bus stands/stops.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lsi63g/article30874292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvByju,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rtc-loses-a-friendly-pair/article30874286.ece

We have concluded that two of the 10 rear wheels of the 12-wheeler lorry burst on the impact of the lorry ramming the median. Its right-side wheels continued running about 60 metres over the median, during which time the tyres gave away and the wheel drums bore the weight of the heavy consignment of floor tiles. The trail is evident on the median,” said Sivakumar P., Enforcement RTO, Palakkad.

The lorry’s trailer section rammed the right side of the bus coming from the opposite direction, causing this heavy casualty. The lorry driver’s antecedents are being probed. It is not yet clear whether there was a cleaner on board, he said.

MVD officials are also probing whether the lorry was speeding, analysing its GPS.

A senior MVD official, on condition of anonymity, said the impact of the collision pointed to a combination of the driver dozing off, speeding, and an overloaded lorry. The ‘corner post’ of the trailer rammed the side of the bus. The impact of the corner post, where the weight of the cargo and the trailer is focussed, tore the right side of the bus.

Overloading the norm

“As per its registration data, the lorry’s unladen weight was about 10 tonnes, while it could carry a load of up to 35 tonnes. Most lorry operators load five to 10 tonnes extra in such 12-wheeled lorries. This additional burden often results in narrowing of the gap between the wheels and sometimes the rear wheels may rub against each other,” he said.

He blamed the Centre for waiving off in 2018 arule that made a spare cleaner-cum-driver mandatory for long-distance lorries. It was obviously heeding to pressure from fleet operators . They could save a few lakh rupees each day, by not earmarking ₹600 or so as wages for a cleaner.

President of the Cochin Container Carrier Owners Welfare Association Chandrasekhara Menon said a cleaner-cum-driver would be of considerable help to lorry drivers.

Admitting that overloading is often the norm in container lorries, he said most multi-axle lorries coped with such overload.

President of the Kerala State Lorry Owners Welfare Federation K.K. Hamsa too said presence of a cleaner would have prevented the accident. “We ask drivers to sleep well before embarking on a trip. Some drivers do not pay heed to this.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qt3alz/article30874249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVBUSACCIDENT3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mvd-points-to-overload-speeding-and-lack-of-cleaner/article30874239.ece
126,2020/02/21,The greener glass of The Neighbours’ Window,"In this year’s Oscar-winning short film, The Neighbours’ Window, an exhausted New Yorker in her late 30s discovers a curious mode of entertainment. What starts as a brief respite from her laidback husband and three teething kids turns into a part-time addiction. Living in the apartment building directly opposite hers is an attractive couple in their early 20s. They don’t believe in curtained windows. Consequently, the naked glass doubles up as a television screen broadcasting the feverish youth of fresh companionship.

She can see them – loving, living, partying, drinking, dancing, fornicating, fornicating some more. As the seasons pass, she is hooked. She can’t look, but she can’t look away. She rises at the dead of night to observe them. She is envious of their stamina, raw desire and flexible fondness. While she cleans baby poop and struggles to hide her wrinkles, they seem to be nurturing the boundless hope she once had.

Untold tales

Great films are revealed not by the story they choose to tell but by the promise of stories they leave untold. For instance, Lulu Wang’s award-winning The Farewell is filmed from the perspective of its most unassuming character: A second-generation Chinese immigrant from Manhattan, who visits her ancestral town to aid the charade of protecting her grandmother from bad news. The family stages her cousin’s ‘wedding’ to congregate at home one last time, while keeping the old lady in the dark about her own cancer. Most filmmakers might have fashioned a crowd-pleasing romcom based on the outsider: the cousin’s Japanese girlfriend who gamely fakes her marriage into the Chinese family. But Wang opts for a more rooted stance to examine the cultural oddities of her land.

Similarly, there are several cinematic options offered by the tale of an unsatisfied “middle-aged” wife spying on her neighbours. For starters, there’s an intense film in how her intrusive habit affects her marriage. At one point, her husband wakes up to an empty bed and strolls into the living room to find her fixated on the glass castle opposite them. Yet, writer-director Marshall Curry does not pursue this easy sub-narrative. He doesn’t pursue a genre angle either: What if she witnesses something dangerous? An assault, a murder?

Impending loss

Instead, The Neighbours’ Window is at once simple and profound: She sees in window-shaped frames, which is why everything looks like a symmetrical portrait of perfection to her. When she soon notices the boy’s clean-shaven head and frail body, the frame comes undone. It is the tangible equivalent of a couple sharing their most private moment – of impending loss – with the world in an emotional Facebook status message. And a poignant display picture.

The downturn reveals what this 20-minute film really is: A charmingly constructed critique of an age in which social media has yanked away the curtains from the windows of carefully curated homes. She isn’t invading their space as much as inviting herself to imagine the air they breathe. It’s not voyeurism as much as it is the innate human hunger to live vicariously through unreachable faces.

Yearning the opposite

Most of us grow up learning to want what others have. But in the process of admiring the exotic paint-jobs of faraway rooms, we forget that our walls bear windows too. When I recently bumped into an old acquaintance, he couldn’t stop expressing his envy for my ‘bachelor’ lifestyle: The relationships, the writing, the travelling, the freedom. There was nothing he didn’t know. It felt nice to be seen. So I didn’t tell him that I had forever craved for the stability he so grudgingly advertised on his timelines. I didn’t tell him that I was jealous of his lovely house, his well-paying job, his family dinners, his handsome dog, his parents’ 40-year anniversary party. I didn’t even tell him that I knew the precise date he had proposed to his childhood sweetheart. Who was I to remind him that his drapes were transparent too?

The penultimate scene of the film unites the watcher and the watched: two sets of eyes that don’t have the heart to un-know one another in person. When the grieving girl confesses that she had in fact been watching – and bashfully appreciating – the family all along, I couldn’t help but wonder if the famous stars I admire, secretly long for the isolation in my words. Maybe they want my ordinariness. My Neighbours’ Window concludes with a shot of the window that the girl would glimpse from corners of her fragile home. The frame is perfect: Parents, three kids, a future, the classical portrait of hope itself. We are left with this image of “the neighbour’s window”. And a hint of how the story might have looked from the other viewpoint. After all, great films are revealed not by what they choose to say but by the promise of what they leave unsaid.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/im3ks1/article30882658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Film-column,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-greener-glass-of-the-neighbours-window/article30882659.ece
127,2020/02/21,‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan’ review: Ayushmann Khurrana’s delightful comedy is a giant leap for LGBTQI+ representation in Bollywood,"Hitesh Kewalya makes canny use of popular culture and brings a queer romance into mainstream Hindi cinema

From the first Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge inspired scene to the last, the “Ja Simran, jee le apni zindagi” dialogue uttered by an equally stern Bauji (patriarch) and an Aashiqui-inspired image of young love thrown in the middle. It’s evident what Hitesh Kewalya is doing with what could, perhaps, be the first unabashed same-sex love story in commercial, star-driven Bollywood. He places Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan (SMZS) squarely in the aesthetics of popular culture. SMZS could have been about Raj and Simran, Raj and Bobby or Raj and Rashmi with class, caste and religious differences coming in the way of true love. But it turns out to be about Kartik Singh (Ayushmann Khurrana) and Aman Tripathi (Jitendra Kumar) and the enemy that the lovers have to fight here are the prejudices against an individual’s sexual preferences. Kewalya’s effective strategy turns out to be a canny tool to bring a queer romance into the mainstream. That is, normalise the LGBTQIA+ narrative in a commercial cinema space that has traditionally thrived on stereotyping the queer community.

Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan Director: Hitesh Kewalya

Cast: Ayushmann Khurrana, Jitendra Kumar, Gajraj Rao, Neena Gupta, Manurishi Chaddha, Sunita Rajwar, Maanvi Gagroo

Run time: 119.37 minutes

Storyline: The love story of Kartik Singh and Aman Tripathi. Need we say more?

Jai and Veeru could have been gay. A nursery rhyme about Jack and Jill could be reinterpreted to suit Jack and Johnny. There’s even a clever reference to actor Arjun Mathur, who is often said to have been typecast as gay. It’s these challenges that the film throws at our popular imagination and consciousness that make it extremely interesting. SMZS takes a huge leap ahead of a film like Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To Aisa Laga that, despite being the first off the mark, didn’t go the whole hog. And in fact, was too dainty to even show the two women together in the same frame.

On the flip side is the familiarity of the customary elements—the primacy of family, a garish, loud wedding for the setting, drama, kitsch, colour, much song and dance and bordering on slapstick humour. Kewalya is pushing the envelope without quite tearing it apart. Parents, relations, and family are seen as the biggest battleground for gay couples but they are simultaneously held on to, negotiations are done, successfully at that, despite questioning them. Kewalya isn’t judgmental about those who are in denial or intolerant. As one character says, prejudices take time in getting demolished, a change of heart and mind can’t be expected overnight. And such minds are spread across the societal divides. A scientist growing the atypical black cauliflower (a persistent metaphor through the film) could well be as homophobic as a poor and illiterate ironsmith. The hope is that they will eventually get to realise that the real sickness of mind that needs to be cured is not homosexuality but a condition called homophobia.

In his first directorial venture, Kewalya continues to be great (like he was as a writer in Shubh Mangal Saavdhan) with little details of the heartland life—like the sly alcohol consumption in steel tumblers in the boot of a car at the wedding—and the fantastic use of lingo and wordplay. Just to hear Hindi words and phrases like utpeedan (persecution), arth-vyavastha (economy) and vyavhaarik chumban (pragmatic kiss) is music to the ears. It’s the reason why Kewalya’s evocation of small town North India feels more lived-in and grounded than several other such films traversing the same zone. All the tropes succeed: the quirky family, its spontaneous quarrels and brawls, the wonderfully realised characters played by a delightful ensemble of actors. It’s interesting to see a star like Khurrana get adventurous at the peak of his popularity. But what is of greater note, is the scope and space the film grants to a relatively little known actor like Kumar. Khurrana’s character may have the bluster and be more attractive in his disruptiveness but it’s Kumar who gets the best “dopamine”, “oxytocin” inspired lines about the nature of true love.

On the downside, somewhere midway the script tends to go round in circles and get messy even as the messaging gets heavy-handed. But the organic humour keeps surfacing to save the day. Kewalya’s call for our collective change of heart is irreverent and playful with a touch of warmth. It’s hard to resist that!",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ym8eb2/article30882181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ayush,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan-review-ayushmann-khurranas-delightful-comedy-is-a-giant-leap-for-lgbtqi-representation-in-bollywood/article30882182.ece
128,2020/02/21,"Amyra Dastur joins cast of web series ‘Dongri to Dubai’, that traces life of Dawood Ibrahim","Adapted from Hussain Zaidi’s book, the show revolves around the underworld don, and captures the story of his early life and his gang

Amyra Dastur has been roped in to star in Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani’s next production venture Dongri To Dubai.

The web series, adapted from Hussain Zaidi’s book Dongri to Dubai: Six Decades of the Mumbai Mafia, will be directed by Shujaat Saudagar of Rock On 2 fame.

“They just gave me a character brief and dialogues to memorise. I did my best and after a few days I was called back for a second audition because they wanted to check if I could do the scenes in a different way to show my versatility. Everyone seemed happy with my performance and Shujaat called me to the office for a narration. I loved what I heard and then requested the team to send me all the episodes to read before I gave them an official confirmation,” Amyra said in a statement.

The show revolves around the life of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and captures his early life, the big mob bosses at the time and his gang.

Amyra said she has read the book and has loved the world of gangsters that is created by the writers.

“This show is adapted from a gripping book which I’ve read and loved. The power crazed gangsters and world of crime is what interested me the most.It’s set in the 70s and 80s so you get to see a different side to Mumbai, the birth of Mumbai in a way. I have never done a period based project and the fact that we get to go back in time with this one was magic to my ears. The fact the Excel Entertainment is producing it was the cherry on the cake.”

Dongri To Dubai will have a ten-episode season one.

She will also be seen in a prominent part in Ali Abbas Zafar’s next web series on Amazon Prime, starring Saif Ali Khan in the lead.

The actor is happy to be doing work on the digital platform as she believes it has a wider reach.

“At the end of the day, Web or OTT has a much further reach than anything today. It doesn’t matter when or where you watch it because it’s going to be there forever. That’s the beauty of web,” she added.

Film wise, she will be seen in T-Series’ murder mystery Koi Jaane Na co-starring Kunal Kapoor.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yvuy8y/article30881484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/amyra,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/amyra-dastur-joins-cast-of-web-series-dongri-to-dubai-that-traces-life-of-dawood-ibrahim/article30881485.ece
129,2020/02/21,‘Fresh Juice’ looks at what happens when romance takes a dark turn,"Binoy Nalanda’s short film, which tells the story of schoolmates Shameer and Hasna, sends a message to parents

Love, they say, is blind. But would that make people in a relationship go to the extent of harming their parents? Fresh Juice, a short film written and directed by Binoy Nalanda, raises this question.

The film tells the story of schoolmates Shameer and Hasna. Although Hasna had ignored Shameer altogether in school, she gets in touch with him a few years later and a romance blooms between them.

Their families are kept in the dark as they spend hours talking to each other on the phone. But there comes a point when the duo takes a drastic step to avoid interference from Hasna’s mother and that has far-reaching consequences.

About the running time (51 minutes), which is perhaps long for a short film, Binoy says it was meant to prepare the viewers for the intense climax. The film also has songs.

“This is based on the life of a couple I know. Many of my friends have also narrated similar instances. The film is not against romance. But it has a word of caution for parents who blindly trust their children,” says Binoy, who had assisted several directors in Malayalam before he started working with Sathyan Anthikkad.

In the cast are Balaji Jayarajan, Thanuja Kartik and Maala Parvathi. Music is by Sanal Vasudev and Sameer Haq is the cinematographer. Editing is by Arun Raghav.

“This is my step towards turning film director. And it was my friends and my brother who stepped in as producers to roll out the project,” Binoy adds.

130,2020/02/21,Singer Anne Amie on dubbing for Kalyani Priyadarshan in ‘Varane Avashyamundu’,"The musician is on cloud nine with appreciation coming in from within and outside the industry

Anne Amie can’t thank enough a college for which she had made a selfie video, sending them greetings for their cultural festival. It was that video that caught the attention of Anoop Sathyan, director of Varane Avashyamundu (VA), who later offered her the chance to dub for his film’s leading lady, Kalyani Priyadarshan. “I can’t remember the name of the college. It was only a few days ago that Anoop told me the reason for calling me. Till then he kept telling me that he had taken a chance with my voice because as a singer, he expected me to be able to modulate my voice and emote properly. Someone like singer Chinmayi who is an amazing voice-over artiste as well,” says Anne with a laugh, adding that she was already part of VA as a singer when the dubbing offer came.

Now Anne is over the moon with appreciation coming in from several quarters. “Anoop had “auditioned” me through voice notes. Although I started out on a nervous note, the sessions gradually turned out to be fun,” she says.

However, dubbing is not new for her. She has done voice-overs for a series of ads for Jos Alukkas. “I was looking forward to working in movies someday. But VA was unexpected. It had its challenges. Kalyani was making her début in Malayalam and I had to ensure that I did a good job. Emotional scenes were not easy but things panned out well. On the whole, it felt good to be part of a project that has so many experienced artistes and crew members. Kalyani was also happy,” she says. Anne also received appreciation from Anoop’s father, filmmaker Sathyan Anthikkad, and Priyadarsan.

Game for more

Meanwhile, she is looking forward to dubbing in more movies. “The best part of being a dubbing artiste was that I was part of a film’s entire post-production process for the first time. Usually, singers have to interact with just the composer and a few members of the crew. But while dubbing, I was exposed to several aspects of filmmaking. I have sung in the background score as well and so I was completely involved in the film,” Anee says, adding that it was her first project with composer Alphons Joseph.

The singer, who debuted with Kochavva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho, shot to fame with her track ‘Aararo’ from Koode, which also won her the Filmfare Award for the best singer.

Last year, she made a mark with her songs in June, Kumbalangi Nights and 9. Currently, she is dividing her time among singing, stage shows and her band, Noor. “We have already brought out two of our own Hindi compositions and plan to come out with more original tracks,” Anne says.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ug09a5/article30880734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvmanne1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/singer-anne-amie-on-dubbing-for-kalyani-priyadarshan-in-varane-avashyamundu/article30880735.ece
131,2020/02/21,‘Mafia: Chapter 1’ movie review: A wonderfully ordinary movie with a great presentation,"Arun Vijay and Prasanna struggle hard to keep the tension alive in an adequate thriller that abuses its own substance

Only a sizeable proportion of our filmmakers understand the visual aesthetics of Western cinema. And there have been few very cases where a filmmaker tried to border the gap between Western and Indian cinema, without diluting the emotions that Kodambakkam screams for. Karthick Naren comes across as someone who belongs to the category of filmmakers who are heavily influenced by Western sensibilities and that’s just it. The presentation is beautiful, but of very little substance. His movies seem to flirt with the idea of ‘slow-burn’ narrative: an approach that paid off when he made the tightly-written Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru. But in Mafia, there seems to be some sort of reluctance to extend the universe that Karthick was trying to build in the first place.

The jungle is used as a metaphor to describe the world of Mafia, inhabited by animals and vultures. There is a lion in the form of Aryan (Arun Vijay) and a fox, Diwakar Kumaran (Prasanna), and the story is a tug-of-war between them. Oh, Priya Bhavani Shankar also exists here, by the way. The movie, however, offers very little scope to show friction between the two central characters, who are also extremely good-looking (costumes are by Ashok Kumar). It is sad that Arun Vijay and Prasanna — two of our really good actors — are fed cornflakes instead of raw meat. Part of the problem is the time — little under two hours — Mafia dedicates for the characters to develop and breathe in. What Karthick expects his actors to do is: sport colourful clothes with matching shades, and walk in slow motion. This would have been a minor grouse, had the movie had a sturdy foundation — how marvellous was Arivazhagan’s Kuttram 23, which had a similar premise?

Mafia Cast: Arjun Vijay, Prasanna and Priya Bhavani Shankar

Director: Karthick Naren

Storyline: Aryan is a Narcotics Bureau Officer, who is on a hunt to track down the most wanted drug lord. In the due process, he discovers a significant piece of information about his past

Given Karthick’s fascination for Nolan’s movies, you could find a heady flavour of The Dark Knight lying underneath. Early on, a character describes Diwakar as someone who hides “behind a mask”. Even if you approach Mafia as a proper origins story for the second chapter — with an absurd but partly effective twist — it doesn’t take away the fact that it is still a weak movie. You could sense the weakness in dialogues; in the screen construction and even in the performance.

But Karthick shows tremendous commitment to his craft; there’s innovation in shot composition, in editing, in the way he lights his frames (Gokul Benoy is the cinematographer), the way he exploits slow-mo shots and more. But all these filmmaking merits add up to nothing. For, the world of Mafia — which follows a reverse narrative, like Christopher Nolan’s Memento (a movie that became a formidable part of Karthick’s filmmaking process) — is exceptionally ordinary. Consider how weakly-constructed the first act is, for instance. The primary characters; their relationships, issues and the equations they share are established in a hurry. Everything is cold, even the treatment. What it lacked was that one proper scene that would later act as an escalation point between the hero and villain, in the second act. T​hat does happen here. But in the most basic fashion. By the time the narration arrives to the final act, you can’t help but think, “Yeah, alright.”

Karthick is a good filmmaker. He has the vision to execute ideas. But all he needs, at the moment, is a writer to collaborate.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/efld89/article30881231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG4067,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mafia-chapter-1-movie-review-a-wonderfully-ordinary-movie-with-a-great-presentation/article30881232.ece
132,2020/02/21,Baahubali’s Kiliki language evolves online,"Lyricist Madhan Karky starts website

Remember Kiliki, the language of the Kaalakeya tribe in Rajamouli’s superhit film Baahubali? Now, an effort is on to popularise it.

Marking International Mother Language Day on February 21, the filmmaker and Madhan Karky, the man behind the language, launched a website to help anyone learn the “world’s easiest language”. The website (www.kiliki.in) has a 3,000-word English-Kiliki-English dictionary, a tool to convert names, videos and vocabulary games.

“After the release of Baahubali, a lot of people appreciated the language we developed for the film,” Mr. Karky told The Hindu.

A press release states that the Karky Research Foundation is also working towards creating job opportunities for those who learn Kiliki and hopes that the Kiliki language will spread across, connecting the world as one beyond barriers of caste, religion, race or country.

“In schools and colleges, students would ask me to speak a few lines in Kiliki. I saw that as an opportunity to develop it,” he said. Part of the project was challenging himself: could he develop the world’s easiest language? “I wanted this to be as simple as possible, without any complications. We dread learning new languages because of the many complications that come along with it, in terms of writing style and pronunciation,” he says.

22 symbols

The lyricist-dialogue writer created symbols for numerals and alphabets. After two years of work, he had a system to learn the entire alphabet in an hour through 22 easy-to-recall symbols.

Explaining the rationale behind a new language, Mr. Karky says, “It expands your thinking ability. Also, all languages in the world are associated with a race, community or caste. I want Kiliki to be a language that has the potential to connect the world without any barriers.”

Mr. Karky, who is now working on the dialogues of Rajamouli’s upcoming RRR and director Vijay’s Thalaivi, also plans to create job opportunities and evolve new art forms based on Kiliki. Plans to release new songs, comics and grammar books are in the works. “We want to create a new world around this language. Someday in the future, we might even see an entire film in which characters speak only Kiliki.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/660dxa/article30880972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kilkili-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/baahubalis-kiliki-language-evolves-online/article30880974.ece
133,2020/02/21,‘Brahms: The Boy II’ movie review: The dolls must be crazy,"Short on scares or classical music, this horror flick has nothing going for it, apart from Katie Holmes

What is it with dolls and horror movies? There is Annabelle, Chucky and now Brahms who dresses neatly in suit and tie or colourful jumpers with nary a frown to cross his spotless porcelain face while doing all manner of unspeakable things.

Actually he does not do much apart from set down house-rules that kind of sound okay — no guests and to keep food in the freezer (a carryover from the 2016 movie, The Boy). If Brahms had added no looking at phone during meal times, he could have been called a good influence.

Liza (Katie Holmes) is a victim of a home invasion when her husband, Sean, (Owain Yeoman) is at work. The couple’s son, Jude, (Christopher Convery) is deeply traumatised and does not speak after the incident. Liza and Sean decide to move into the country in the hope that Jude will recover.

Of all the stately manors in the world, they naturally had to pick one with a grisly past, where an old couple committed suicide while their deranged son hid in the walls. Jude finds a doll in a shallow grave and things begin happening soon after. There is a strange gamekeeper with a sweet dog who you know will die, because it is a horror movie.

Brahms: The Boy II is thankfully short on gore but is also short on genuine thrills. It is nice to see Holmes after an age and more. The house looks lovely and so does the well-accessorized Brahms. Wonder what film production companies do with all the demented dolls — now that would be an interesting horror movie.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/p94osm/article30880530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/the-boy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/brahms-the-boy-ii-movie-review-the-dolls-must-be-crazy/article30880531.ece

136,2020/02/21,Pakistan’s Oscar entry ‘Laal Kabootar’ is Karachi noir par excellence,"Kamal Khan’s heady concoction of crime and class ties up well with South Korean actioners

There is a sense of verticality that stands out in the evocation of class divides in Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite. A sprawling, rich home and its hidden basement and a suffocating semi-basement at a distance become spatial attributes of the incipient hierarchies. Then there are the staircases that constantly take the characters, and in turn the viewer, up and down the high and low life, seemingly offering mobility that eventually proves to be nothing more than an illusion.

Like the Seoul of Bong, class conflicts define the Karachi of Kamal Khan’s Laal Kabootar, Pakistan’s official entry for the Oscars this year. Only, here the societal cracks are spread horizontally, like a blanket across the city’s expanse. It becomes the defining backdrop against which characters and their stories intersect and link up or collide and disconnect.

There is the upper crust, for whom going to the U.S. is as easy as picking up vegetables in the market. Juxtaposed against them are those unable to make it in life, for whom Dubai is the promised land where their dreams could turn real. “Aukaat kabhi ek jaisi nahin rehti (Stature doesn’t always stay the same),” says a character. As in Parasite, hope lies in the possibility of mobility but what truly binds the extremes together is the precariousness underlying their lives, a shared thirst for revenge and money and materialism.

The working title of the crime thriller was Signal, Khan tells me on a WhatsApp call: “Because it’s at the red light that people from all strata of life seem to come together.” Just like in Mumbai, I tell him, leading him to rue that co-existence is becoming more and more rare in urban societies. “We are in each other’s spaces yet not together, we have stopped sympathising, the divides are getting wider and wider, leading to crime,” he says.

A still from ‘Laal Kabootar’.

His film kicks off with one such transgression at the traffic signal — a journalist digging out the dirt on a builder is shot in broad daylight. Meanwhile, other petty crimes carry on unabated. Passengers get robbed of their mobile phones by thieves on bikes as they wait in cabs for the light to turn green. The cops have copped out. There is no rule of law, rather the upholders of law have become the law-breakers. It’s the wild, wild west. “It’s what Karachi used to be when we were growing up. We were paranoid about getting stuck at the red light. But it’s not so any more. The builder, water mafia might still be there, but things have watered down a lot,” he says.

Mumbai connection

Khan’s heady concoction of crime and class ties up well with South Korean actioners. He professes to be a huge fan, reeling out names — Na Hong-jin’s The Chaser, Jung Byung-gil’s The Villainess, Lee Jeong-beom’s The Man from Nowhere... “They are so relatable for us — the severely flawed protagonists, the amazing arcs,” he says.

But it’s Bollywood he grew up watching — the Govinda, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan films picked up from the video store — and he even doffs a hat to it, playing Major Saab’s ‘Pyaar Kiya Toh Nibhana’ in the background in one scene. What truly drives his ‘Karachi noir’ is ‘Mumbai noir’, Ram Gopal Varma’s Satya and Company but most of all, Anurag Kashyap’s Ugly, which, he feels, deserved more plaudits than it got.

Back in India, even if one has identified Pakistan for its well-crafted television serials, films haven’t quite made the cut. Even within Pakistan, Lollywood has played second fiddle to Bollywood. After Asim Abbasi’s understated, measured, women-centric family drama, Cake, set a new bar in 2018, Laal Kabootar comes across as a surprisingly slick and gripping thriller. It’s a good mix of swag, stunts and sentiments with a great soundtrack to boot, with Taha Malik’s music, and Danial Hyatt, son of music composer and producer Rohail Hyatt, providing the background score. A consummate set of actors keeps one engrossed, most so Rashid Farooqui, who swings effortlessly between a corrupt cop at work and a loving father and family man at home. And towering above them all is the gritty and spirited Karachi itself, the most significant of all the characters.

137,2020/02/21,"From Wuhan, without virus: Diao Yi’nan's 'The Wild Goose Lake'","The dark side of the city is captured effectively in a noir film, that is is supremely stylish and punctuated by Kitano Takeshi-style bursts of ultra-violence

Wuhan, China, is nowadays best known as the epicentre of the Coronavirus, or Covid-19, to call it by its official name, but a film, made before these bleak times, effectively captures the dark side of the city. Like his contemporary Jia Zhangke, Diao Yi’nan is from China’s Shaanxi province, and also like him, he began his directing career as a chronicler of the region. Diao debuted with Uniform (2003), where, in a Shaanxi roiling with economic unrest, a young man leads a double life. The film won awards at Rotterdam and Vancouver.

Diao’s next film was Night Train (2007) about a widowed executioner in a prison who unwittingly strikes up a relationship with the husband of one of the executed prisoners. The film debuted at Cannes and went on to win awards at Buenos Aires, Warsaw and IndieLisboa. Unlike the prolific Jia, who has directed 26 features and shorts, Diao evidently likes to take his time. His next film arrived a good seven years later, in 2014. But what a film it is. Black Coal, Thin Ice, set in Heilongjiang province, is a pitch black, ice-cold, neon-lit detective thriller that reinvigorated the noir genre. The film won the Golden Bear at Berlin.

Pausing only to perform a key role in Jia’s Ash is Purest White (2018), Diao returned to noir with The Wild Goose Lake (2019), set in 2012. The titular, fictitious lake in Wuhan is the backdrop for a deliciously twisty plot where no one can be trusted. There is no snow like in Black Coal, Thin Ice, but there is plenty of neon and a lot of the film unspools in dim, poetic nights. The dialogue is entirely in the Wuhan dialect. Ge Hu plays Zhou Zenong, a motorcycle thief who is in deep trouble after killing a cop. Determined to make an example of Zhou, the Wuhan police offer a reward of 300,000 Yuan (approximately ₹31 lakh) towards his arrest. The local gangsters also covet the reward money and Zhou is a marked man. His aim is to secure the reward money for his estranged wife and son, and in this he seeks the help of Aiai (Kwei Lun-Mei), a ‘bathing beauty’ (a euphemism for sex worker) by the lake.

The film is supremely stylish and punctuated by Kitano Takeshi style bursts of ultra-violence. Think Sonatine (1993) and drench it in neon noir and you’ll begin to get an idea of what Diao has achieved. The Wuhan that Diao depicts in the film is a far cry from the glittering ghost town you’ve seen in endless Coronavirus drone shots. What we see instead is a ramshackle, grubby sprawl, where, remarkably, Diao and his regular cinematographer Dong Jingsong find beauty. Black Coal, Thin Ice is a superior film as it isn’t as much of a slave to style as The Wild Goose Lake is, but I’m not complaining.

The Wild Goose Lake also debuted at Cannes, in competition for the Palme d’Or, and has been on an extended festival run since. It is now on its global theatrical release schedule. Diao says that his next film will be out in ‘two to three years’. Let’s hope he doesn’t make us wait longer.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/px3mju/article30879569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22wkwildgooselake3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/from-wuhan-without-virus-diao-yinans-the-wild-goose-lake/article30879570.ece
138,2020/02/21,‘Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship’ review: That sinking feeling,"Vicky Kaushal and jump scares manage to hold things together well till the Dharma vessel derails in the second half

It seems like ghosts are also prone to getting jinxed. Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship floats along swimmingly and perches promisingly well at the interval till the curse of the second half gets to afflict it severely.

An abandoned ship sails into Mumbai and it’s for shipping personnel led by Prithvi(Vicky Kaushal) to uncover its deep, dark secrets. And, in the process, confront ghosts from his own past.

Bhoot Part On: The Haunted Ship Director: Bhanu Pratap Singh

Starring: Vicky Kaushal, Ashutosh Rana, Bhumi Pednekar, Akash Dhar

Run time: 1 hour 54 minutes

Storyline: An abandoned ship sails into Mumbai and it’s for a shipping personnel to uncover its deep, dark secrets

Well mounted, with a pervasive sense of corrosiveness in its frames, in keeping with the rusty vessel it largely plays out in, Bhoot gets the eerie mood right. For a brief while. The gloom and doom get extended to even a Parsi restaurant in Mumbai. The hackneyed but ever reliable tools of ghost stories — jump scares — also play out well, to the accompaniment of persistent clicking sounds and children’s rhyme, not to forget the ominous rag tag doll. Fear hangs heavy, there is a rightful oppressiveness about it, more so in the uneasy anticipation of the scary lobs.

What’s more compelling is the grounding of horror in Prithvi’s own mind games and hallucinations. He is cast adrift, unmoored much like the abandoned ship. While the ship is unforgiving and vengeful, Prithvi is wrecked by his own loss and grief and demons of guilt. Just like the stuck ship, he is clinging to the memories. Both need to move on.

Kaushal evokes the inner torment with requisite gravitas. All other characters, however, are there to serve the plot than getting individualised in any manner. The most problematic is the explicatory second half which takes the film back a full circle to the conventional, tacky horror films and TV shows we have been used to watching complete with “Hreem Kleem” Chamunda mantra like solution to tackle malicious spirits. Our ghosts are still much in need of a compelling update.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/uiuldb/article30878423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vickykaushal,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bhoot-part-one-the-haunted-ship-review-that-sinking-feeling/article30878424.ece
139,2020/02/21,Trump blasts best-picture Oscar for South Korean film ‘Parasite’,"The U.S President also expressed his disapproval of actor Brad Pitt

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ridiculed the historic best-picture Oscar win for South Korean film Parasite, telling a campaign rally he wished for the return of Hollywood classics like 1939's Gone with the Wind.

Parasite, a dark social satire about the gap between rich and poor in modern Seoul, earlier this month became the first non-English-language film to take Hollywood's top prize. It also won three other Oscars - best director and original screenplay for Bong Joon Ho and best international feature film.

“How bad were the Academy Awards this year?” asked Mr. Trump at the rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Imitating an Academy Awards presenter, he said: “And the winner is a movie from South Korea.

“What the hell was that all about? We’ve got enough problems with South Korea, with trade. And after all that, they give them best movie of the year?” Mr. Trump added.

“Can we get 'Gone With the Wind' back, please?” he said to thousands of supporters, referring to the film about the Civil War-era South that won the best-picture Oscar 80 years ago.

Mr. Trump also dismissed actor Brad Pitt, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Pitt said while accepting the award that he got more time to speak, 45 seconds, than former national security adviser John Bolton received at Mr. Trump's Senate impeachment trial.

“I was never a big fan of his. He's a little wise guy,”Mr. Trump said of Brad Pitt.

Mr. Trump, who is on a four-day Western U.S. swing, gave a harsh review as well of Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, particularly the performance of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who the president said had a ragged night.

“I was going to send him a note saying: 'Its not easy doing what I do, is it?' It's not easy, Mike. It's not easy for any of them,” he said of the contenders for the Democratic nomination to face him in November's election.

140,2020/02/21,Vaiko picks holes in legislation to protect agriculture in Cauvery delta,"MDMK founder Vaiko on Friday asked why only few districts in the region have been covered under the legislation

A day after the AIADMK government passed a Bill in the Assembly seeking to protect agriculture in the Cauvery delta region, MDMK founder Vaiko on Friday askedwhy only a few districts in the region have been covered under the legislation.

Mr. Vaiko, in a statement, referred to a Memorandum of Understanding signed in October 2018 between Vedanta and ONGC for hydrocarbon projects in the Cauvery delta region and asked why the State government has not spelt out its stand on this project.

“What is the use of merely declaring the region a Protected Special Agriculture Zone without cancelling those MoUs,” he asked. The Rajya Sabha MP asked why petroleum, petrochemicals and refineries have not been included in the Bill in the list of non-farming activities that are prohibited in the region.

Referring to the notification issued by the State government in July 2017 to establish a Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) in the State, Mr. Vaiko asked why the Chief Minister had not announced that this initiative would be withdrawn. “Will the Tamil Nadu government answers these pressing questions? The people in the Cauvery delta want to know,” Mr. Vaiko added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tbqkxc/article30880461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FEBTH-VAIKO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vaiko-picks-holes-in-legislation-to-protect-agriculture-in-cauvery-delta/article30880462.ece
141,2020/02/21,Agreement signed for developing Ponneri node of Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor,"The agreement was signed at a diplomatic outreach event inaugurated by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday

The Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) and the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) have joined hands to develop the Ponneri Node of the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. An agreement was signed between them at a diplomatic outreach event inaugurated by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in Chennai on Friday.

Along with the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the State government has organised the event that showcased economic and investment opportunities in the State to diplomats from other countries.

The CM also laid the foundation stone for Tamil Nadu Polymer Park, a project of TIDCO and SIPCOT on 257 acres of land in Puzhuthivakkam in Tiruvallur district. With an investment of ₹217 crore, the Tamil Nadu Polymer Park is expected to attract investments to the tune of ₹3,000 crore and generate over 7,000 new jobs.

Mr. Palaniswami also inaugurated various projects with a total investment of ₹1,254 crore and that could generate over 10,330 jobs, and agreements for these investments were exchanged in his presence. Hanon Automotive from Korea is to invest ₹500 crore at Malrosapuram in Kancheepuram district. Jogo Health, USA, which initially signed an MoU for ₹15 crore has increased its investment to the tune of ₹250 crore. It is expected to provide jobs for about 10,000 persons.

Mitsuba Sical would be investing ₹504 crore in SIPCOT Industrial Complex in Gummidipoondi. A facilitation MoU was signed between Guidance Tamil Nadu and Developers Park – Japan for an investment of ₹800 crore creating 2,500 new jobs. The CM also released a handbook ‘Doing Business in Tamil Nadu’, a guide for investors.

During his speech, Mr. Palaniswami listed out the investment potential of Tamil Nadu in the manufacturing sector, IT & ITeS, R&D, food processing and infrastructure, among others. He also explained about the State’s export potential across sectors, including agriculture, dairy and fisheries.

The event saw the participation of diplomats from about 36 countries, including Denmark, France, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

142,2020/02/21,Woman set on fire by stalker in Cuddalore district,"The mother of two has been referred to the Cuddalore Government General Hospital; locals nabbed the suspect and handed him over to the police

In a horrific incident, a 26-year-old married woman was set on fire allegedly by a stalker at a private construction firm in Vadalur near here on Friday. The victim, Salomi, wife of John Victor, 30, serving in the Indian Army, sustained critical burn injuries and was rushed to the Kurunjipadi General Hospital and later referred to the Cuddalore Government General Hospital.

Locals overpowered the accused, Sundaramoorthy, a private bus conductor and handed him over to the police.

Police sources said Salomi, a mother of two children and a resident of Block 21 in Neyveli was working in a private construction firm in Vadalur. She used to travel for work on the private bus, and both the victim and the accused knew each other. Police said Salomi stopped talking to Sundaramoorthy after he proposed to her.

Police said Salomi got down from the bus and went for work as usual on Friday. Sundaramoorthy followed her to office with a bottle of petrol and poured it on her and set her on fire. Hearing her screams, locals rushed to her help. Sundaramoorthy tried to flee but he was nabbed and handed over to the Vadalur police.

143,2020/02/21,Chola-period sluice pillars with inscriptions found in Pudukottai district,"An expert said that pillars with Chola records are a rarity and two inscriptions of the same period in a single sluice unit are even rarer

A research scholar of history has stumbled upon two Chola-period sluice pillars with inscriptions during a field study in Thimmayampatti in Pudukottai district

M. Paramasivam, the research student of the Department of History at Arignar Anna Government Arts College, Musiri, while exploring the area, found two inscribed stone pillars and informed his guide R. Akila, an assistant professor at his college.

Dr. Akila, along with M. Nalini, Head, Department of History, Seethalakshmi Ramasami College, Tiruchi, and Selvi, a research scholar from Srirangam, studied the inscriptions with the help of R. Muttandi, a higher secondary student and P. Loganathan, a history enthusiast.

R. Kalaikkovan, Director, Dr. M. Rajamanikkanar Centre for Historical Research, after examining the two granite pillars, said that the stones are erected on the inner side of the village tank locally known as kurunkulam (small pond) near its eastern bund. They were found erected on either side of a sluice known as madai. The structure helps to regulate or divert water that is collected in the pond for agricultural needs and is usually a box-like structure supported on the sides by a pair of such pillars.

Among the two sluice pillars of the Thimmayampatti pond, the northern one is rectangular in shape with a circular top. Three strips are carved in between the two sections. The pillar measures 1.43m in height and 25 cm in breadth. “The deeply planted sluice pillar has a Tamil inscription of the Chola period (10th century C.E.) that runs to 9 lines carved on the lower half of its northern face. Two lamp stands are depicted below the inscription. The record identifies the pillar as Neerazhikkal (stone that lets out water) but the locals call it as aanaiyadikkal. The inscription records that the first right for water from the pond was assigned to a certain Kilavan Pavalakkunru alias Kandankusa Velan,” Dr. Kalaikkovan said.

The southern pillar which is chiselled into an octagonal shape, has a rectangular base of 43 cm height and measures 28 cm in breadth. The height of the pillar from the top of the base is 1. 48 m. The upper part of the pillar is round, giving it an appearance of a tall Linga. As in the first case, here also three bold strips differentiate the two portions. A seven-line inscription of the same period (10th century C.E.) on the southern face of the base also refers to the pillar as Neerazhikkal. The inscription records that the first water right of the pond was assigned to Vaikai Churri alias Uttamacholan, the head man of Urattur Nadu, according to Dr. Kalaikkovan..

Dr. Nalini added that while such sluice pillars with inscriptions are found in many of the districts of Tamil Nadu, pillars with Chola records are a rarity and two inscriptions of the same period in a single sluice unit are even rarer.

The historians have advised the village residents and the authorities that proper safety measures be taken to preserve the structure for posterity.

Repairs are currently underway to fix large pipes at the outlet of the pond very close to the Chola structure and may cause damage to the existing old sluice, she said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bh02o1/article30878645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FEBTH-Sluicejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chola-period-sluice-pillars-with-inscriptions-found-in-pudukottai-district/article30878646.ece
144,2020/02/21,7 pilgrims from Nepal killed in Salem crash,"A private omni bus crashed into the vehicle carrying the nationals as the driver made a U-turn

Seven pilgrims from Nepal died in a road accident near Omalur on the Salem-Bengaluru National Highway in the early hours of Thursday. As many as 17 people are undergoing treatment at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital.

Amarnath Chowdhri, one of the pilgrims, said they were a group of 34, all hailing from Sunsari district in Nepal. They came to India on February 6 for a 35-day tour.

According to the police a private omnibus, heading for Kerala from Bengaluru, crashed into the minibus carrying the Nepalese nationals while the driver was making a U-turn.

Three persons — Beer Bahadur, 55, Teka Ram, 55, and Pulhari Chowdhri — succumbed to their injuries on the spot.

145,2020/02/21,Tracing the history of Tamil Nadu’s mid-day meal scheme,"A school tiffin programme costing just one anna per student per day was brought in as early as 1920

The ongoing controversy over the breakfast scheme in Chennai Corporation schools has brought to the fore Tamil Nadu’s track record in showing the way to the rest of the country when it comes to implementing the widely praised mid-day meal scheme.

A perusal of The Hindu Archives reveals that on November 17, 1920, the publication reported the adoption of a resolution by the Chennai Corporation Council, approving a proposal for providing tiffin to the students of a Corporation School at Thousand Lights at a cost not exceeding one anna per student per day.

Explaining the rationale behind the move, P. Theagaraya Chetty, the then President of the Corporation (the modern-day equivalent of which is Mayor) and one of the stalwarts of the Justice Party, said the boys studying at the school were poor, which affected the strength of the institution ‘greatly’. At the time, there were only 165 students in the school.

With the subsequent inclusion of four more schools into the scheme, the enrolment in all five schools showed dramatic improvement — from a combined strength of 811 in 1922-23 to 1,671 in 1924-25. But since the British government disallowed the expenditure on the supply of mid-day meals to students from the Elementary Education Fund, the scheme came to an end on April 1, 1925. It was revived two years later, benefitting around 1,000 poor students in 25 schools.

In 1956, then Chief Minister K. Kamaraj decided to extend the free meals scheme to poor children in all primary schools across the State. The Budget for 1956-57 contained a provision for supplying mid-day meals to schoolchildren from poor families for 200 days a year, initially covering 65,000 students in 1,300 feeding centres.

One-and-a-half annas

The government’s contribution amounted to one-and-a-half annas per meal, and the rest was borne by the local people, according to a report published by The Hindu on December 7, 1982, when a controversy erupted over who the author of the noon meal scheme was — Theagaraya Chetty or Kamaraj.

The controversy was triggered by then Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran, who himself had improved upon the programme by extending its coverage to children in the age group of 2-5 years in Anganwadis and those aged 5-9 years in primary schools in rural areas in July 1982. Subsequently, the scheme — now named after him — was extended to urban areas as well. Since September 1984, students in the age group of 10-15 years have been covered under the scheme.

M. Karunanidhi, as Chief Minister during the short-lived DMK Ministry (1989-91), introduced the provision of boiled eggs once every fortnight, starting June 1989. The scheme was modified by Jayalalithaa in 2013, with the inclusion of variety meals along with masala eggs as per the children’s choice. According to the Budget document for 2020-21, the Puratchi Thalaivar MGR – Nutritious Meal Programme is being implemented in 43,243 noon meal centres, with 48.57 lakh students being fed every day.

As much as ₹1,863.32 crore has been provided for the programme in the Budget Estimates for 2020-21.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ic2h63/article30874857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THNOONMEAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tracing-the-history-of-tamil-nadus-mid-day-meal-scheme/article30874858.ece
146,2020/02/21,"Rajiv case convicts: Tamil Nadu Cabinet advice has zero value, says Centre","‘Home Ministry had decided not to release any of them and informed Governor’

The Union Home Ministry on Thursday asserted before the Madras High Court that its approval was absolutely essential for releasing the seven life convicts in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and since it had already decided not to grant remission to any of them, the effect of a recommendation made by the State Cabinet to the Governor on September 9, 2018 to set them free was nothing but “zero.”

Additional Solicitor General (ASG) G. Rajagopalan told a bench of Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan that the Centre had also communicated to Governor Banwarilal Purohit a decision taken by it in April 2018 against releasing the seven convicts. On his part, State Public Prosecutor (SPP) A. Natarajan told the court that the Council of Ministers had only made a recommendation and it was up to the Governor to take a call.

Expressing shock over such a stand taken by the Centre and the State, M. Radhakrishnan, counsel for one of the convicts S. Nalini who had filed a habeas corpus petition seeking her immediate release, said, “There is a difference between an executive power and a sovereign power. The Union of India cannot even be allowed to speak in this matter because it relates to advice given by the council of ministers in the State to the Governor.

“It is unfortunate that such submissions are being made by the Additional Solicitor General. The State Public Prosecutor too is wrong in submitting that the Governor is the final authority. Ours is a quasi federal country where the Governors act as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers in every State but the submissions made now probably show the State government here is being run on the aid and advice of the Union Home Ministry.”

Verdict reserved

After hearing all of them, the judges reserved their verdict on the petition filed by Nalini who had sought her release on the ground of long delay on the part of the Governor in taking a decision on the Cabinet’s recommendation. Stating that the advice given by the council of ministers was binding upon the Governor and he would have no option but to accept it, the petitioner said, her detention since the date of recommendation should be considered illegal.

Further, contending that the Governor’s signature was not mandatory for her release, the petitioner’s counsel relied upon a 1980 Supreme Court verdict in the famous Maru Ramu case wherein a Constitutional Bench had held: “The State Government, whether the Governor likes it or not, can advise and act under Article 161 (power of Governor to grant pardon) of the Constitution, the Governor being bound by that advice.

“The action of commutation and release can thus be pursuant to a governmental decision and the order may be issued even without the Governor’s approval although, under the Rules of Business and as a matter of constitutional courtesy, it is obligatory that the signature of the Governor should authorize the pardon, commutation or release.” Therefore, obtaining Governor’s assent was only a matter of courtesy and not mandatory, he argued.

On his part, the ASG relied upon Section 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and stated that Centre’s concurrence was essential before a State government decides to remit the punishment imposed on those convicted for offences under the Central Acts and in cases investigated by a central agency. The Tamil Nadu government sought for such concurrence for the seven convicts in March 2, 2016 and the Centre rejected it in April 18, 2018, he pointed out.

The SPP said the petitioner’s detention since September 2018 could not be termed illegal since she had been lodged in prison as per orders passed judicial forums.

Stating that the Council of Ministers had only made a recommendation to the Governor for releasing the seven convicts, he said: “The government’s duty ends with making a recommendation. Unless the Governor passes an order on the recommendation, there is no question of illegal detention.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e7idvn/article30874846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajiv-case-convicts-tamil-nadu-cabinet-advice-has-zero-value-says-centre/article30874847.ece
147,2020/02/21,High Court stays police constable recruitment process,"Judge expresses displeasure over complaints levelled against every other public service selection in State

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board to keep in abeyance till March 5 the entire selection process under way for filling up 8,888 vacancies for the posts of Grade II police constables, jail warders and firemen following a notification issued on March 3, 2019.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh passed the interim order on a joint writ petition filed by 15 candidates alleging various irregularities in the selection process and apprehending a scam similar to those that had been detected recently in various examinations conducted by Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC).

During the course of hearing of the case, the judge expressed his displeasure over complaints of irregularities being made against almost every other recruitment process undertaken by the State government for public services. “I have read the entire affidavit. If all selections are going to be like this, people will lose confidence. “This is a police selection. What will happen to the police force if you allow these kind of people? People in villages think government job is something very big. How can you conduct selections like this? I hope you, on your own, take some action,” the judge told a government counsel and adjourned the case by two weeks.

In his affidavit, lead petitioner R. Anbarasan, 25, stated that the written examination for the vacancies was held across the State on August 25 and the physical measurement as well as endurance tests were conducted in November.

However, the marks secured by the candidates were not declared immediately after the tests.

It was only on February 4 this year that the individual marks were declared and the petitioners were shocked to note that their names were not in the list.

They also found that as many as 1,019 candidates from Vellore district had made their way into the selection list though only 500 had got selected even from Chennai.

Most of the candidates from Vellore had undergone coaching at a particular institute and their enrolment numbers were in a sequence. All of them had also scored between 72 to 75 marks though even the meritorious could not secure anywhere above 69. Similarly, 763 had been selected from the “rewarding coaching centres” in Villupuram, the petitioner alleged.

Insisting upon a court monitored Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the issue, the petitioner claimed some names found in the selection list could not be spotted in the list of candidates who wrote the written examinations.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-stays-police-constable-recruitment-process/article30874840.ece
148,2020/02/21,Tumour removed from boy’s spine and neck after a twelve-hour surgery,"Doctors at Gleneagles Global Health City performed the delicate procedure with a multidisciplinary team of doctors, which included a vascular surgeon and a spine surgeon.

Doctors at the Gleneagles Global Health City (GGHC) performed a 12-hour surgery on a boy from Bangladesh to remove a nerve sheath tumour that developed in the spinal cord and had extended to the left side of his neck.

Addressing the media on the procedure, Nigel Symss, senior consultant neurosurgeon at the hospital, said the boy had visible symptoms, with swelling on the left side of his neck above the collar bone, for at least two-and-a-half years.

“The tumour, which was a benign schwannoma and not cancer, had destroyed the bones in the lower neck. The major blood vessels on the left side of the neck were encased by this large tumour,” he said.

Dr. Symss added that the team at GGHC decided to perform a single-stage surgery, with the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of doctors, which included a vascular surgeon and a spine surgeon. “The advantage of a single-stage surgery is less blood loss, less chances of inspection and shorter hospital stay,” he said. It also brought down costs.

Phani Kiran, senior consultant spine surgeon at the hospital, said the tumour was removed from behind first, followed by fixing the damaged parts of the upper part of the spine with rods. Then the boy was turned over and the tumour was removed from around the neck. “The surgery was so challenging that any damage to the blood vessels or nerves during the procedure could have permanently paralysed the boy,” said Raj Kumar, senior consultant vascular surgeon at the hospital.

“The tumour was removed completely and the destroyed part of the cervical spine has been stabilised with a titanium cage, which has bone graft that will grow into bones, and a plate with screws. The boy has been recovering well and is undergoing physiotherapy,” Dr. Phani Kiram said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tumour-removed-from-boys-spine-and-neck-after-a-twelve-hour-surgery/article30874833.ece

150,2020/02/21,Chances of light rainfall in State till Sunday,"Showers expected to bring down temperature: official

Chennai may have a respite from warm days. The Meteorological Department forecast that there is a chance of light rains in some areas over the weekend in the city.

A trough in easterlies runs from interior Tamil Nadu to north interior Karnataka at 0.9 km above mean sea level. This is set to bring some control over the rising maximum temperature this month, according to officials of the Meteorological Department.

Close to normal

On Thursday, the weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded maximum temperature of 31.4 degree Celsius and 31.5 degree Celsius, which is close to normal for the period.

It may be recalled that there was a steady rise in day temperature owing to dry weather for the past few days. Meenambakkam recorded one of the warm days for the season on Sunday with the maximum temperature rising to 34.4 degree Celsius, which is nearly three degree Celsius above normal.

However, the presence of the weather system may help the day temperature to stay around 31 degree Celsius till Sunday in Chennai.

Moreover, officials said a few places over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal may receive light to moderate rainfall till February 23 due to the influence of the trough.

It is normal for the State to experience light rains during February. The same weather trend may continue till Monday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e7fjyl/article30874754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FEBTHLIGHTRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chances-of-light-rainfall-in-state-till-sunday/article30874755.ece

152,2020/02/21,Students from University of Madras uncover neolithic site in Valasai,"Artefacts including engraved potsherds, grindstones and tools have been unearthed

It was a rare experience for students of University of Madras when they uncovered ‘neolithic ash mounds’ at an archaeological excavation at Valasai, near Modikuppam in Gudiyatham.

Twenty-one students pursuing Masters in Ancient History and Archaeology were involved in the undertaking as part of their project work for the past three weeks at the village.

Their findings included a neolithic polished axe, grindstones of different dimensions, iron-age potsherds with different engraved letters and handmade pottery.

First in T.N.

According to research, neolithic ash mounds have been dated to 3,000 to 1,200 BCE. Earlier they were found in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and this is the first time they were found in Tamil Nadu.

The findings shed insight on the lifestyle of people who lived in the region during the Neolithic period.

Detailing the project, Jinu Koshy, excavation in-charge, said, “It was based on a brochure issued by the Archaeological Survey of India and research work by K. Kumar, who has a Ph.D in Archaeology of Vellore.”

Initially, the students created a trench of 7 m and 6 m and ended up with a few potsherds, which made them push the excavation further.

They created a step-trench which led to them unearthing an immense amount of ancient artefacts that had belonged to the regions erstwhile inhabitants.

Swetha, a student, said they would conduct further studies to identify the objects and their ages. It was the first time she had worked on a project like this and it had helped developed her skills as an archaeologist, she said.

Scope for research

Another student, Dhanushya said the findings proved that people who lived in this region reared cattle in neolithic ages and the work provided them scope for further research on the subject.

Black and redware pottery items including potsherds with colouring and engravings shows that people were involved in pot-making and used them in their lifetime, she added.

The finds would be used by archaeological experts to ascertain the age of these materials, Mr. Jinu said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/csm7cj/article30874742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FEBTHEXCAVATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/students-from-university-of-madras-uncover-neolithic-site-in-valasai/article30874743.ece
153,2020/02/21,Farmers see red over exemption to ongoing projects,"The Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Bill, 2020, which was passed in the Assembly on Thursday, evoked a mixed response from the delta farmers and activists, with many of them raising concerns over the exemption provided to the existing hydrocarbon projects.

Describing the adoption of the Bill in the Assembly as a good starting point, T. Jayaraman, Chief Coordinator of the Anti-Methane Project Federation, said there were, however, many shortcomings in it. “We welcome the government’s initiative as it is the first attempt towards protecting the delta. At the same time, we have reservations. Offshore areas cannot be excluded. Allowing the existing projects to continue essentially means that the destruction [of the delta] will continue,” he said.

Demanding that the entire Cauvery delta region be brought under the ambit of the protected zone, Mr. Jayaraman said the federation’s fight to close down existing projects will continue.

Calling upon the State government to ensure that all the existing or proposed petrochemical projects in the delta region are wound up, the general secretary of the Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam, P.R. Pandian, urged farmers and political parties to extend their support to the Tamil Nadu government in its efforts to drive hydrocarbon projects out of the State.

The Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association’s general secretary, Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, said declaring the delta a protected agricultural zone was fraught with legal implications and “the issues have to be discussed threadbare with Constitutional experts to make the move pucca.”

Important delta areas such as Lalgudi and Pullampadi in Tiruchi district, Kulithalai in Karur, Thirumanur in Ariyalur and Chidambaram in Cuddalore have been excluded. “ Given the haste and the inadequacies in the Bill, we fear that it could meet the same fate as the anti-NEET Bill adopted in the Assembly,” Mr.Maniarasan felt and urged the Chief Minister to make necessary changes to strengthen the Bill before sending it to the Governor.

The All India Kisan Mahasabha, Tamil Nadu, condemned the Bill as “betrayal of the delta farmers” for allowing the ongoing projects. The Bill seems to be an attempt to deceive the farmers and an election gimmick, said A.Chandramohan, State Secretary, AIKM, pointing out the announcement by the Chief Minister had come in the wake of protests from farmers against the Centre’s move to do away with the need for environmental clearance and public hearings for hydrocarbon exploration projects.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/farmers-see-red-over-exemption-to-ongoing-projects/article30874741.ece

155,2020/02/21,Parvathamalai to get infrastructure boost,"District administration plans to set up drinking water and sanitary facilities for visitors to the shrine

Parvathamalai, a shrine meant for Lord Mallikarjunar, is all set to get a facelift to ensure the comfort and safety of devotees. It is located at a height of 4,560 feet at Kalasapakkam union in Tiruvannamalai district.

Thanks to social media groups like ‘Save Parvathamalai’, the district administration has initiated an action plan to restore the hilltop temple.

The weekend cleaning work started on February 2. The call given by the District Collector and other social media groups resulted in over 1,500 volunteers pouring in from Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, Villupuram, Cuddalore and even Andhra Pradesh.

They were placed into groups headed by officials from the police, Fire and Rescue Services, Health, Forest and Revenue Departments. The initiative was led by District Collector K.S. Kandasamy. The teams removed a total of 2.5 tonnes of plastic waste with around 90% of the waste being water bottles. The Collector said, “As we had already announced the drive, the collected trash was immediately taken away for recycling.”

Mr. Kandasamy said, “As there are no water sources in the pathway leading to the top, visitors are forced to buy water bottles which they discard after use. This results in plastic waste accumulating on the mountain. Moreover, they get washed away by rain and end up clogging nearby water sources.”

Temporary solution

The Collector held a series of discussions with volunteers and brainstormed several short term measures to reduce the accumulation of plastic waste on Parvathamalai. It was decided that temporary trash bins along with posters would be set up to direct climbers to the nearest ones. This would ensure that plastic bottles were not discarded out in the open.

It was an uphill task for volunteers to clear bushes along the mountain which were filled with plastic cups, plates and water bottles. They were assisted by individuals from nearby localities trained in climbing rocky surfaces.

“If we provide water points en route to the hill top and place noticeboards indicating their location, we feel visitors will not be forced to opt for plastic bottles and this will hopefully reduce plastic waste considerably,” Mr. Kandasamy said.

The district administration has chalked out a plan to provide water and sanitary facilities for devotees with help from the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board, non-governmental organisations and corporate houses. “A detailed project report has been formalised at an estimated cost of ₹1.28 crore, which will be taken up in the coming months,” he added.

About ₹24.20 lakh will be spent by the HR&CE Department to provide drinking water and sanitary facilities in the Karaikandeeswarar and Mallikarjuna temples on the hilltop. Nearly ₹90 lakh will be spent on borewells at the ground-level to ensure water supply to the hilltop. An additional ₹14 lakh will be spent to replace lightning conductors, according to the estimates prepared by district administration.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xo52du/article30874735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FEBTHCLEANUPCAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/parvathamalai-to-get-infrastructure-boost/article30874736.ece
156,2020/02/21,T.N. has sought clarifications on NPR questionnaire: Minister,"The Tamil Nadu government has sought clarifications from the Centre on three questions contained in the handbook for National Population Register (NPR), Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar informed in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. After failing to extract an assurance from the government that it would not implement the NPR in Tamil Nadu, the members of the DMK, Congress and IUML walked out of the House in protest. AIADMK MLA M Thamimum Ansari also staged a walkout.

Responding to concerns on the NPR raised by DMK president M K Stalin, the Minister conceded that there are some apprehensions among the people over three questions - 10, 13 and 14 contained in the handbook for enumerators. These questions seek details of the resident’s mother tongue, father, mother and spouse, their respective dates of birth, place of birth, and the resident’s Aadhaar number, mobile phone number, voter ID card number and driving license number, if any.

“In case they [residents] do not want to answer these questions, if the enumerator marks ‘doubtful’ against these columns, it would create apprehensions. We have sought clarifications from the Centre on how to deal with this during enumeration. We have not received any reply yet,” the Minister said.

Mr Udhayakumar, assisted with inputs by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, said that the details provided by a resident would be recorded without demanding any document. “For instance, if a resident declared himself as Indian national, the same would be recorded without seeking any proof,” he said.

However, Mr Stalin pointed out that the NPR handbook did not have Islamic festivals as options. This would affect Muslim respondents. Mr Udhayakumar said a clarification on this too had been sought from the Centre.

DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan pointed out how family members of former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed and a Kargil veteran were excluded from the NRC in Assam. To this, Mr Udhayakumar claimed that the situation in Tamil Nadu was different.

When Mr. Stalin argued that the NPR was a precursor to the NRC and that the CAA and NRC were against Muslims, Tamils and the Constitution, the Minister accused the opposition to creating confusion on NPR and NRC with an “ulterior motive” and misleading Muslims for “vote bank” politics.

The Minister went on to say that had he been born a Muslim, he would have participated in the anti-CAA protests “misled” by the opposition parties.

Countering Mr Duraimurugan charged that the Minister was “belittling” the sentiments of Muslims.

However, Mr Udhayakumar said the NPR was brought by the erstwhile Congress-led UPA regime.

Panneerselvam joined said his party celebrated all religious festivals.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-has-sought-clarifications-on-npr-questionnaire-minister/article30874718.ece
157,2020/02/21,DMK walks out as plea to send Bill to select committee is turned down,"Stalin raises apprehensions over wording in certain sections

Legislators of the DMK and its allies staged a walkout when the Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Bill came up for a vote in the Assembly on Thursday, as the government did not accede to the DMK’s request to refer the Bill to a select committee before tabling it for a vote.

The DMK raised several apprehensions about the contents of the Bill, including the issue of three districts being left out and doubts over the wording of certain sections. Party president M.K. Stalin, while welcoming the announcement on the creation of a protected agricultural zone, raised a few concerns over the Bill.

“Under 4(1)(2) of the Act, you have said new projects and new developments are prohibited in the zone, but in 4(2)(1)(a), you have said existing projects will not be affected, and that the Act won’t affect harbour, pipeline, telecommunications, power and other utilities. What is the guarantee that under the category of other utilities, gas, petrol and related projects won’t be implemented?” Mr. Stalin asked during the debate on the Bill.

The DMK leader asked why there were two “contradictory points” in the Bill.

Further, the Leader of the Opposition asked why the government had not prohibited the conversion of agricultural land into real estate. Raising a few other points, Mr. Stalin demanded that the government send the Bill to a select committee before it is passed, in order to address the issues raised by the DMK.

Deputy Leader of the Opposition Duraimurugan too raised the same demand, as did the DMK’s allies, the Congress and the IUML.

But their demand was turned down.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-walks-out-as-plea-to-send-bill-to-select-committee-is-turned-down/article30874717.ece
158,2020/02/21,Only industrial districts omitted from Bill: CM,"State govt. can take final call on projects, says Palaniswami

Certain delta districts were not included in the Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Bill as they were largely industrial districts, and hence, were not as affected as the ones mentioned in the Bill, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Thursday.

Replying to DMK president M.K. Stalin, who sought to know why Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Karur districts were left out of the scope of the Bill, the Chief Minister said, “Tiruchi and Karur are largely industrial districts. Hence, we have not included them. They are not as affected as the other districts. In the delta region, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur are fully delta districts (those with fertile areas). We have mentioned one region each in Cuddalore and Pudukottai as well,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

Incidentally, when Mr. Palaniswami announced his decision to declare the delta region a Protected Special Agricultural Zone a fortnight ago, he had mentioned Tiruchi and Ariyalur among the districts that would fall under its ambit. He did not mention Karur.

Responding to another point raised by Mr. Stalin, as to why the Bill did not prohibit the conversion of agricultural land in the designated zone into real estate land, Mr. Palaniswami said farmers had a right to sell their land, and will be adversely affected if they are prohibited from doing so.

The CM said the Centre had informed the T.N. government that the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) can take a final call on projects and on whether to allow any particular project in a specific region. He said Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had, in reply to his letter, said: “Any project proponent will, in the present scheme of things, have to apply to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, which is an organ of the State government, and SEIAA will take a final call.”

Striking a balance

Later, Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam said Ariyalur and Karur were well-industrialised districts. He said Tamil Nadu was the second largest industrial economy in the country, and the government had to take care of both industries and agriculture. When DMK MLA Thangam Thennarasu sought to know if petrochemical, chemical and fertilizer industries would be allowed in the protected zone since they were not mentioned in the Bill, Mr. Shanmugam said the Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Authority had the power to decide on each project. He said hydrocarbon projects won't be allowed in the State.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/only-industrial-districts-omitted-from-bill-cm/article30874715.ece
159,2020/02/21,No work on Palamuru-RR first-stage pump house for last 6 months,"₹120 cr is spent on tunnel work as part of drawing water to pump house already

Lack of clarity on the drawal of water from the foreshores of Srisailam reservoir — either through open channel or tunnel — for the first stage (head) of pumping has halted works pertaining to the head pump house of Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Project for about six months now.

Works on the package-one taken up with a cost of ₹3,200 crore includes construction of an approach channel from Srisailam reservoir foreshores to the underground pump house and construction of underground surge pool and pump house near Yellur of Kollapur mandal in Nagarkurnool district. Although the work was taken up in March 2017 it has made very little progress till the work came to a halt in August last week last year, mainly due to the delay in securing forest clearances.

“It was initially planned to draw water through an open canal from Srisailam reservoir foreshores to the pump house planned near Vepalacheruvu and also to have an on-ground pump house. However, the delay occurred in getting the forest clearances, particularly due to a petition filed against it by a politician in the Opposition party then, forced us to go for tunnel which required lesser forest land only for the approach channel,” a senior engineer working for the project explained.

Forest approval

Work on the access tunnel and the main tunnel began after securing the first stage forest approval in April 2018 and it could be speeded up in February 2019 after securing the second stage approval. The approach channel would run for 2.2 km and there would be three tunnels running for a length of 876 meters.

The work has been stalled after spending ₹120 crore on the tunnel work with the instructions from higher-up to consider open channel drawal of water again. “The amount spent so far would go waste and the tunnels excavated so far have to be filled with soil again to prevent caving-in in future with more expenditure. Besides, clarity on the number of pumps to be installed in the pump house is also lacking now,” the engineer stated.

Work halted

During a visit to the work site recently, it was found that the access tunnel is being guarded by a few personnel of the contract firm and no machinery is kept there except a generator for lighting purpose. As per the project report, the head pump house would have eight pump with a capacity of 145 MW each for lifting 3,000 cusecs water each for 104 meters height and also a stand-by pump to lift 2 tmc ft water a day.

“We are puzzled about the pump house works as we have been told to plan for only four pumps besides a stand-by pump to lift only one-tmc ft a day in the recent months,” another engineer of the project said, unwilling to be quoted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9vibye/article30883198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22PALAMURU-RANGAREDDYPROJECT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/no-work-on-palamuru-rr-first-stage-pump-house-for-last-6-months/article30883199.ece

163,2020/02/21,Sand sculptor wins accolades for creating a bust of Lord Siva at Vemulawada temple,"Ravalli Shankar, the creator, says it is his way of paying devotion

It’s a labour of devotion. A sand sculptor from Peddapalli district had won accolades for creating a sculpture of Lord Siva at the Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada of Rajanna-Sircilla district on the occasion of Mahasivarathri festivities on Friday.

Ravalli Shankar, a native of Kukkalagudur village of Peddapalli district, came to the Vemulawada shrine to participate in the Sivarathri jatara celebrations, and exhibit his creativity.

A beatific creation

He created a bust of Lord Siva with a beatific expression. The nearly 2.5 ft tall figure appeared as if the Lord was bestowing a gentle smile on his devotees. Mr. Shankar brought sand from his native village for the sculpture. Devotees at the shrine were awestruck at the sculpture of Lord Siva and were seen appreciating its creator.

Mr. Shankar said he came during the jatara only to showcase his talent in sand art before a huge gathering of devotees at Vemulawada. “My sculpture was appreciated by all the visitors at the shrine. It’s my way of paying devotion to Lord Siva on the occasion of Mahasivarathri,” he stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2s5fnb/article30882480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22SIVA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sand-sculptor-wins-accolades-at-vemulawada-temple/article30881429.ece

165,2020/02/21,Mahasivarathri being celebrated with religious fervour at Vemulawada,"Thousands of devotees stand in serpentine queues for the presiding deities’ darshan since the early hours of Friday.

Devotees chanting “Om namah Sivaya”, “Hara hara Mahadeva”, “Sambho Sankara”, reverberated at the ancient and historic Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam on the occasion of Mahasivarathri festival in Vemulawada in Rajanna-Sircilla district on Friday.

Mahasivarathri celebrations started on a grand religious note with several thousand devotees thronging the temple shrine, and standing in serpentine queues for the darshan of the presiding deities since the early hours of Friday. The devotees took a dip in the holy tank (Dharmagundam) before offering prayers.

Only maha laghu darshan

In view of the heavy rush, devasthanam authorities had cancelled the Arjitha seva rituals, and allowed only Maha laghu darshan for the benefit of devotees. Serpentine queues were formed for the traditional Kode mokku (tying of an ox) ritual at the temple shrine. Temple authorities had made all arrangements for the devotees in the queues by providing drinking water facilities and distribution of buttermilk sachets.

As per tradition, the TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam) authorities presented silk robes to the Vemulawada deities on Friday. TTD deputy EO Harindranath presented the robes brought from Tirumala. On behalf of the State government, Minister for Health Etala Rajender, and Minister for Endowments A. Indrakaran Reddy presented silk robes separately to the presiding deities, and offered prayers.

All measures for devotees’ convenience

Vemulawada legislator Ch. Ramesh Babu, Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar, Endowments Commissioner Anil Kumar and others were overseeing the arrangements at the shrine and taking all measures to avoid any inconvenience to the pilgrims. MLC Naradasu Laxman Rao, MLA Rasamayi Balakishan, ZP chairperson Aruna, and others also visited the temple and offered prayers.

Police had made unprecedented security arrangements by deploying additional forces and regulating the pilgrims in the queues.

Pilgrim rush at other temples

166,2020/02/21,Spring spark awaited to set the Flame of the Forest aglow in Adilabad woods,"The unusually longer period of rainfall, and the equally abnormal warm winter are the causes for spring’s delay, aver botanists

“O, wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind?” exclaimed the great English romantic poet, P.B. Shelley. That was almost 150 years ago when nature and weather were unspoilt, and seasons changed in time. Global warming and climate change were yet to happen.

It is high time the Moduga or Palash (Butea monosperma) trees bore the resplendent reddish or orange coloured flowers, commonly known as the Flame of the Forest, indicating the arrival of spring. The season associated with romance, however, has been delayed at least by a month as is evident from the delay in flowering of the Moduga and other trees in the forests.

Late blooming

The unusually longer period of rainfall and the equally unusual warm winter have delayed the spring season in the State, especially in northern parts this year, according to experts. “The monsoon extended till November, and the span of winter was shorter,” opined S. Ram Reddy, Professor Emeritus, Department of Botany, Kakatiya University, Warangal, as he pointed out the phenomena which possibly impacted the arrival of spring.

“Yes, it is photoperiodism, or the response of plants to seasonal changes in the length of the day,” E.N. Murthy Associate Professor, Department of Botany, Satavahana University, Karimnagar, concurred as he talked of the unsual delay in flowering of trees like Moduga. “Sporadic rains, long period of cloudy weather and higher temperature during winter are responsible for Moduga trees still not flowering,” he added.

Honey due

The delay in arrival of spring will also result in delay in collection of honey by tribal hunters. Honey bees depend mainly on the Palash flowers for extraction of nectar.

“There could be a delay in production of honey owing to weather changes but we are expecting a bumper yield of the forest produce this season,” the Divisional manager of Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) at Utnoor, L.K. Ramanandam predicted. “We have planned to start supplying honey in the shape of narrow elongated satches called twigs to Ashram School children in old undivided Adilabad district,” he revealed of the plan that depends on collection of the minor forest produce.

The arrival of honey at the GCC purchase centres at Adilabad, Utnoor, Ichoda, Asifabad, Kagaznagar, Jannaram, and Kamareddy has been steadily declining over the last few years. From the 515 quintals purchased by GCC in 2017-18 it had gone down to 338 quintals in 2018-19 and 160 quintals in 2019-20, according to the GCC DM.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/l2ost2/article30882994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22MODUGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/spring-spark-awaited-to-set-the-flame-of-the-forest-aglow-in-adilabad-woods/article30878740.ece

168,2020/02/21,Bihar Opposition leaders meet Prashant Kishor,"Manjhi, Kushwaha and Sahni hold talks with the poll strategist in New Delhi

Opposition leaders, barring those of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress, met poll strategist Prashant Kishor in Delhi on Thursday night, fuelling speculation on a third front taking shape ahead of the Bihar Assembly election due in October-November.

Mr. Kishor has announced that he would not support any party, but will reach out to 10 lakh youths in 100 days to support his ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ campaign aimed at the development of the State.

Jitan Ram Manjhi of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Upendra Kushwaha of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Mukesh Sahni of the Vikasil Insaan Party met Mr. Kishor at a hotel. They did not reveal what transpired at the meeting, but party sources told The Hindu that they urged Mr. Kishor to launch a third front, taking the Congress on board. “But Mr. Kishor told them that he was not going to launch or support any party, but if they want to join his campaign for the development of Bihar, they are welcome,” a party leader close to Mr. Kushwaha said. The leaders discussed the current political situation and the emerging possibilities, he said.

Senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari said he failed to understand the urgency for these leaders to meet Mr. Kishor and others when the election was months away. Instead, they should focus on strengthening their parties.

However, the other leaders of the Mahagathbandhan said Mr. Manjhi, Mr. Kushwaha and Mr. Sahni were meeting Mr. Kishor, Mr. Sharad Yadav and Pappu Yadav to keep the pressure on the RJD and the Congress for a larger share of the seats.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vngrc4/article30883287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-KISHOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bihar-opposition-leaders-meet-prashant-kishor/article30883288.ece

171,2020/02/21,"Clampdown on Kashmir social media users, 2 held","The police have started a clampdown on social media users in Kashmir and arrested two persons in the Valley.

A police official said Waseem Majeed Dar, a resident of Handwara's Waskura area, was arrested after “strenuous efforts for posting objectionable content” on social media platforms.

“The police acted after it came to know that some youth were circulating fake news, spreading rumours and hatred on social media platforms”, the police said.

Dar was arrested under Section 153-153A of the Ranbir Penal Code, dealing with those who resort to vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc.

In a separate case, another youth, Imtiyaz Ahmad Kawa, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly posting fake pictures of vandalism by security forces in Kupwara district.

According to the police, Kawa, a driver by profession from Srinagar's Saida Kadal locality, was booked under Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code.

Also read: We’re in the stone age, say Kashmir students on Internet shut down

Kawa's Facebook post is three months old. “The post was aimed to incite violence. The accused was absconding”, the police said.

The Kupwara police said the youth was “maligning the image of the forces in public and the action is part of an exercise to act tough against ‘online miscreants’.”

Police sources said the Cyber Police Station, Kashmir Zone, had questioned and tracked many locals who kept posting political content on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

However, the police failed to establish any links of these social media users with militants or any handlers across the border so far.

The clampdown comes just four days after the police lodged an open First Information Report (FIR) under Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act; Section 188, 505 of Indian Penal Code and 66-A(b) of the Information Technology Act.

The J&K government banned all the social media sites on January 14, fearing “misuse by Pakistan to foment trouble and upsurge militancy in J&K”.

Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh has warned of strict action against use of social media through the virtual private networks (VPNs). “We are aware of the loopholes being exploited. We are keeping an eye if the VPN use is within the tolerable limits. In case of any misuse, the government will be forced to take action”, he has said.

172,2020/02/21,M.P. rescinds sterilisation target order for health workers,"State’s directive had warned of job loss if at least one man was not mobilised for sterilisation

The Madhya Pradesh government on Friday rescinded an order warning male multi-purpose health workers (MPHWs) of no pay and compulsory retirement if they failed to mobilise at least one man for sterilisation in 2019-2020. The government also removed the National Health Mission’s (NHM) State Director Chhavi Bhardwaj for issuing the controversial order.

“As soon as the order relating to setting targets for sterilisations and pay cuts by the National Health Mission came to Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s notice, the order was cancelled,” said Tulsiram Silawat, Health Minister, sharing the cancellation order issued by the interim Director J. Vijaykumar.

In the now rescinded order dated February 11, the NHM had asked district officials to identify workers having “zero work output” and apply the ‘no work, no pay principle’ unless they mobilised at least one “willing” man for sterilisation in the financial year ending in March. According to the National Family Health Survey - 4 (2015-2016), just 0.5% of men opted for the procedure in the State.

In case no progress was observed by February 20, proposals recommending retirement of the workers would be forwarded through district Collectors to the NHM office, which would take it forward with the State Health Directorate for action, the NHM’s then State Director had said in the order. The directive had further stated that the workers must ensure that at least 5 to 10 males sought sterilisation at camps in the districts.

The order had drawn the ire of former chief minister and BJP national vice president Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who wondered in a post on Twitter if there was an undeclared emergency in the State. “Is this emergency part-2 of the Congress? If there is a lack of effort by MPHWs, then the government may take action; however, the decision to cut pay and terminate service in case targets are not met is dictatorial,” he tweeted.

While 1.35 lakh women underwent sterilisation in eight months in the State until December, just 1,254 men opted for the birth control surgery, despite being offered a higher standard incentive, according to the NHM.

Ms. Bhardwaj had earlier told The Hindu, “Family planning in the non-tribal region of Chambal-Gwalior has been a challenge owing to the prevailing feudal order there. It is difficult to break deep-set biases there. As a result, the responsibility for family planning falls more on women.”

An NHM official, requesting anonymity, said unfounded anxieties among men about a perceived loss of virility and a decline in the capacity to undertake hard work post-sterilisation tended to discourage them from undergoing the procedure.

“Every year, various programmes are held to spread awareness on the benefits of sterilisation and encourage people to opt for it,” said Narendra Saluja, State Congress spokesman. “However, no targets have been set for workers to fulfil,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2wcnmc/article30884888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TulsiramSilawatjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-rescinds-sterilisation-target-order-for-health-workers/article30882681.ece
173,2020/02/21,M.P. court acquits 8 Christians of forced conversion charges,"The acquitted Christians had also been charged with abducting 60 children from Jhabua in 2017

A sessions court in Ratlam has acquitted eight Christians accused of kidnapping and forcibly converting 60 children from Jhabua district in May 2017.

Additional District and Sessions Judge Vivek Kumar Shrivastava acquitted them recently after none of the 20 witnesses, including parents, supported the prosecution version.

As the six men and two women escorted the children to a Bible camp near Nagpur, on May 23, 2017, the railway police, tipped off by right-wing Hindu outfits, detained them at the Ratlam railway station. A case was registered under the Indian Penal Code and the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act.

“Justice has finally been done,” said Tehmina Arora, Director, ADF India, which represented the accused. “But we must not forget the toll that such false cases take on families. No one should be targeted for their faith. The anti-conversion laws are tools to harass and target Christians and should be repealed since they restrict the freedom of religion guaranteed under the Constitution of India.”

When the children and parents were Christians, and the children were being taken to a Christian camp, where was the issue, she told The Hindu. “There was no question of kidnapping as the father of one of the children told the police then they were being sent willingly,” she said.

The police had claimed the elders didn’t have documents, and couldn’t explain why the children were being taken to Maharashtra. After the separation, while 28 girls had to spend the night at the waiting room, boys were shifted to a shelter home.

The accused were only granted bail after three months. In court, none of the witnesses had supported the prosecution version. Meanwhile, ADF India had had to approach the High Court to reunite the children with their parents.

Three more Christians, who were booked in connected cases in Indore and Ratlam, are now hopeful of being similarly acquitted, ADF India said in a press release.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1nhs8e/article30882604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ratlam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-court-acquits-8-christians-of-forced-conversion-charges/article30882605.ece
174,2020/02/21,Bengal Governor says ‘rapport’ with State govt. has improved,"The Constitution only allows Governor and State govt. to work in tandem, says Jagdeep Dhankar

After an over-six-month long duel, the West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has said that his issues with the State government have been addressed and their “rapport” has improved. Mr. Dhankhar spoke to journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Jalpaiguri in north Bengal on Friday.

“My rapport with the State government has picked up. I had been saying so for a long time [that] we need dialogue, we need deliberation, we need to engage, we cannot be adversaries, we cannot be fighting with each other,” he said.

The Governor added that the Constitution “does not allow” the Governor and the State government to fight and “only allows [them] to work in tandem, in togetherness, for the betterment of the people” of the State.

War of words

Mr. Dhankhar and the State government were engaged in one of the most bitter war of words over the past months. It often was not limited just to acrimonious word-battles but more. The Governor argued that the State was restricting his movement by not providing helicopters, while the government pulled no punches in saying that the Governor was working on behalf of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal Opposition in Bengal. The relationship fuelled social media, and social media groups with names like “Governor felt insulted” were getting traction.

‘Never as bitter’

In the past, there were quite a few occasions over which the West Bengal government and the State’s Governor had a major face-off, starting in the late 1960s, during the time of the Left-leaning United Front Government’s rule. But observers said that the relationship between the Centre’s envoy and the State was never “as bitter as it was during the past six months”.

This came to an apparent end on Friday evening, as the Governor said he was happy with his successive meetings with the State government’s representatives, starting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

“The Honourable Chief Minister has met before [earlier] for an hour. The Chief Secretary has met before for more than two hours, and several times. Finance Minister had met me. Partha Chatterjee [the Education Minister and Trinamool Congress’ secretary general] had met me; we had a good, productive discussion,” Mr. Dhankhar said.

It now remains to be seen how long the truce will continue in the run up to the Assembly poll of 2021.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/44is24/article30845684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THPTIMAMATABANERJEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bengal-governor-says-rapport-with-state-govt-has-improved/article30882266.ece

In his first trip to Delhi after taking over as the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Thackeray also called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi as the Congress is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the State.

He also paid a courtesy visit to BJP patriarch L.K. Advani at his house.

“I had a good discussion with the Prime Minister over issues concerning Maharashtra. I also discussed the CAA, NPR and NRC with the Prime Minister. No one need to fear about the CAA. The NPR is not going to throw anyone out of the country,” he told reporters after meeting Mr. Modi.

The Chief Minister also said the Prime Minister had assured him of extending all cooperation to the Maharashtra government. His son and a Minister in his Cabinet, Aaditya Thackeray, was also part of his meetings.

Accompanied by Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut, and his son, the Maharashtra Chief Minister also made a ‘courtesy call’ on Ms. Gandhi at her residence.

Congress’ Maharashtra in-charge Mallikarjun Kharge was present in the meeting that went on for more than 45 minutes.

No statement

However, neither the Maharashtra Chief Minister nor the Congress issued any statement on what was discussed with Ms. Gandhi.

The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party are reported to be upset with Mr. Thackeray over his stand on the NPR and the CAA.

But at the press conference that was held before his meeting with the Congress chief, Mr. Thackeray denied any friction among the constituents of the “Maha Aghadi” and asserted that the Maharashtra government would complete its five-year term.

“There is no friction among the allies. We are going to run the government for five years,” the Chief Minister said.

When asked about the Congress supporting the anti-CAA protests in Delhi, Mr. Thackeray said he didn’t know about them as he was not in Delhi.

He claimed that people were protesting against the citizenship law and the NPR after being ‘provoked’ but stopped short of naming those behind such provocation.

On NRC, the Maharashtra Chief Minister said the Centre had already ‘clarified’ that the National Register of Citizens was only limited to Assam and will not be a pan India exercise.

Keeping some room for flexibility on the NPR, the Chief Minister said that as of now there was no reason to doubt the process of the NPR and the Census but could review it if they encounter some problems in the future.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cdb59q/article30882041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI2212020000121B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-one-needs-to-fear-about-caa-npr-says-uddhav-thackeray-after-meeting-pm-modi/article30882042.ece

“Pray for all those whose loved ones have died due to coronavirus that they may be comforted and that many of those suffering, in China as well as in other countries, may find a path to recovery as soon as possible,” the NBCC said.

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) authority has indicated at an erroneous updating exercise by asking the district heads in Assam to provide details of “ineligible persons” in the final list of citizens published on August 31, 2019.

Referring to the raising of the matter in a video conference on October 31 last, Mr Sarma wrote: “...it has come to the knowledge of the undersigned that after publication of final NRC on 31st August, 2019, few names of ineligible persons are found present in the final NRC…”

The ineligible persons were specified as DV (doubtful voters), DF (declared foreigners), PFT (cases pending in Foreigners’ Tribunal), DVD (descendants of DV), DFD and PFTD.

“A list of such persons has already been shared from your end... you are requested to share the details of such persons who are ineligible for inclusion in the NRC but whose names got included in the NRC in addition to the list shared earlier…,” the memo read.

182,2020/02/21,Car of Bodoland council chief’s wife attacked in Assam,"Stone-pelting believed to be linked to the Bodoland Territorial Council polls scheduled for April

Unidentified miscreants on Thursday pelted stones at the vehicle of Seuli Brahma Mohilary, the wife of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) chairperson Hagrama Mohilary, also the chief of Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ally in Assam.

The police said they were investigating the case to find out who attacked the BTC chief’s wife and why. But the stone-pelting is believed to be linked to the BTC polls scheduled for April.

The incident happened around 6 p.m. when Ms. Mohilary was returning from a Shiva temple at Ultapani on the India-Bhutan border in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district. The occupants of the SUV escaped unhurt but the vehicle was damaged.

Ms. Mohilary said the miscreants had attacked the car from both sides in a forested area immediately after the escort vehicle passed by.

“The incident took place in a dark jungle area. We have examined some suspects but have not been able to establish their involvement,” said Anurag Agarwal, Inspector General of Police for the Bodoland areas.

The BPF has been wielding power in the BTC since its creation in 2003 and is expected to face a stiff challenge in the upcoming polls.

183,2020/02/21,"Female trainee clerks of Surat Municipal Corporation made to stand naked for test, probe ordered","Female trainee clerks of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) were allegedly made to stand naked together in a room for a medical test at a civic body-run hospital in Surat, prompting authorities to order a probe.

Surat Municipal Commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani on Friday ordered a probe into allegations that around 10 female trainee clerks of the civic body were made to stand naked for a medical test in the gynaecology ward of the hospital.

The shocking incident comes days after students of a girls’ college in Gujarat’s Bhuj town were allegedly forced by hostel authorities to remove their undergarments to prove they were not menstruating.

In its complaint to the commissioner on Thursday, the SMC Employees Union alleged even unmarried women were checked for pregnancy by female doctors.

The alleged incident took place in the Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) hospital, run by the SMC, on February 20.

Acting on the complaint, Mr. Pani on Friday formed a three-member committee to probe the allegations and submit a report in 15 days.

The committee comprises former dean of the medical college Dr. Kalpana Desai, Assistant Municipal Commissioner Gayatri Jariwala and executive engineer Trupti Kalathia.

As per rules, all trainee employees need to undergo a physical test to prove their fitness for the job upon the completion of their training period, said officials.

The union said though they are not against the mandatory test, the method adopted for women staff in the gynecology ward was not proper.

“Instead of calling the women one after another in the room for the test, lady doctors made them stand naked in group of 10. This act of compelling them to stand naked with others is highly deplorable.

“This method is illegal and against humanity. It is necessary that each woman is checked separately,” said the union in its complaint.

According to the general secretary of the union, Ahmed Shaikh, women staff were put in an embarrassing situation by lady doctors with their absurd questions about pregnancy during the test.

“Doctors should stop asking private questions about pregnancy. Moreover, even unmarried women in that group were subjected to a physical test meant for checking if they were pregnant or not.

“They were put in an embarrassing situation in front of other women. Women’s respect must be maintained during medical tests,” said Mr. Shaikh.

Surat Mayor Jagdish Patel assured stern action against the culprits.

“This issue is very serious. Such physical tests are conducted on all those employees who are getting permanent after finishing their training period.

“We will take strict action against the culprits if the allegations levelled by the women staffers are found to be true,” said Mr. Patel.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8neuhz/article23897333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-minor-rape-rep,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/women-trainees-made-to-stand-naked-for-physical-test-in-surat-probe-ordered/article30879830.ece

185,2020/02/21,HC allows Bhim Army to hold meeting at ground near RSS headquarters,"The court has imposed a condition that there should be no inflammatory speeches at the venue

The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Friday allowed the Bhim Army to hold a meeting of its workers at Reshimbagh Ground here on February 22, but imposed certain conditions.

A division bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Madhav Jamdar said the petition of the Dalit outfit, seeking permission for the conclave, is allowed with conditions.

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad is scheduled to address the meeting.

On Tuesday, the HC had issued notices to the Maharashtra government and the Nagpur police commissioner on the petition filed by a Bhim Army functionary.

The sprawling ground is close to the headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Kotwali police had earlier denied permission for the gathering, citing law and order issues.

After denial of permission, the Dalit group moved the high court here.

The petition, filed by Bhim Army Nagpur district chief Praful Shende through his lawyer Firdos Mirza, said the outfit had obtained permission from the CP and Berar Education Society, which controls the Nagpur Improvement Trusted-owned ground, for the meeting.

However, the Kotwali police station, under whose jurisdiction the ground falls, denied permission for the meet, citing law and order issues, the petition said.

The plea sought direction from the HC to the State government and the police commissioner to grant permission to the Bhim Army to hold its workers’ meeting.

“Permission granted with conditions. It will be a workers’ meet only. It shall not be converted into a demonstration or protest.

“There should be no inflammatory speeches and the atmosphere should be peaceful. Besides, Chandrashekhar Azad should give an undertaking on the above conditions,” the court said in its operative order on Friday.

Any violation of the conditions will invite criminal action and contempt of court proceeding, the Bench warned.

The Police Department, in its affidavit filed in the court on Thursday, said the organisation is seeking permission to stage a protest against the Citizen (Amendment) Act and the National Register of citizens at a location which is near the RSS headquarters.

“The organisation of the petitioner holds an ideology which is different, contrary and diverse to the ideology being professed by the RSS,” the affidavit said.

In such a scenario, the possibility of law and order situation being created at the centre of the protest cannot be ruled out, the police said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/esc3j2/article30879593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AZADFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hc-allows-bhim-army-to-hold-meeting-at-ground-near-rss-headquarters/article30879594.ece

187,2020/02/21,BJP slams govt. for restoring excess water supply to Baramati,"It is an equitable distribution of water, says minister

The Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday criticised the Maharashtra government’s decision to restore supply of water from a dam in Pune district to NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s home turf Baramati, saying the water meant for farmers “will now be in Pawar’s farm”.

However, a State minister defended the government’s decision, saying it will benefit the farmers.

In June last year, the Fadnavis government had cleared a proposal to cut off the supply of “unused” water from the left bank canal of Nira Deoghar dam to parts of Baramati, Indapur and Purandar in Pune, arguing that these areas were located outside the notified command area of the dam.

Baramati is the family stronghold of Mr. Pawar, whose daughter Supriya Sule is a Lok Sabha member from there.

His nephew and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar represents Baramati Assembly seat.

Hitting out at the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government over reversing the previous regime’s decision, the BJP on its Twitter handle @BJP4Maharashtra said, “Water meant for common farmers will now be in Pawar’s farm. The government is now helping Supriya to reap Rs 113 crore from her brinjal farming on 10 acre land.”

The State Cabinet under Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday decided to equally distribute water from the left and the right bank canals of the Nira Deoghar dam to the command areas, according to an official release.

As per the decision, 55 % water will be released in the left bank canal which will benefit Purander, Baramati and Indapur talukas while the right bank canal will get 45 % water, which will be utilised for the talukas of Pandharpur, Sangola, Malshiras (all coming under rain-fed areas in Solapur), and Khandala and Phaltan (in Satara).

The water will be made available for the purpose of drinking, industrial use and agriculture.

Minister of State for Water Conservation Dattatray Bharne welcomed the government’s decision, saying farmers from Indapur, Baramati and neighbouring villages will benefit from it.

“We are not diverting water, it is an equitable distribution of water,” he said.

However, BJP Lok Sabha member from Madha (Solapur) Ranjit Naik Nimbalkar and alleged that “Pawars have been diverting water for their own benefits“.

Mr. Nimbalkar said it is a matter of livelihood of nearly 10 lakh people from Malshiras, Sangola, Pandharpur, Mangalvedha and Mohol talukas of Solapur.

“We are not happy with this water diversion as Pawars have been diverting the water for their own benefits for last so many decades. The BJP government had stopped it, but the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government has reversed it. We will face scarcity once again,” he said.

Targeting the NCP patriarch’s family, Mr. Nimbalkar said, “This is is not the government’s decision but that of Pawars. We are going to protest against it in coming days,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nipsdp/article30877443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BM--SHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-slams-govt-for-restoring-excess-water-supply-to-baramati/article30877444.ece

To avoid any controversy over the appointment of Shiv Sena MLA Ravindra Waikar and party MP Arvind Sawant to key posts with Cabinet rank, the Uddhav Thackeray-led government may issue a notification saying they may not get perks and allowances for the posts.

The government has appointed Mr. Waikar as the chief coordinator in the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) and Mr. Sawant as the head of the State parliamentary coordination committee. “A notification or a revised government resolution will be issued as per which they may not get perks and allowances for the posts. This is to avoid any allegations of office of profit,” an official said on Thursday.

Mr. Waikar, an MLA from Jogeshwari, was appointed chief coordinator in CMO and also allotted the rank of Cabinet minister. His responsibility is to coordinate with public representatives and the Chief Minister on fast-tracking projects and fund allocations.

Mr. Sawant, the Mumbai South MP, was last week appointed the chairman of a State-level parliamentary committee set up to follow up pending proposals related to Maharashtra with the Central government. He was also given the rank of a Cabinet minister.

However, the government thinks the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may try to corner it during the upcoming Budget session of the legislature over these appointments citing the office of profit.

Talking to PTI, Mr. Sawant said there will be no issue of an office of profit if he and Mr. Waikar do not avail allowances and perks that come with the post. Mr. Waikar said, “How can the government give us perks and allowances as elected representatives and in our new posts together? We have not yet taken charge.

191,2020/02/21,Nagaland Lokayukta orders probe against Deputy Chief Minister Yanthungo Patton,"He is accused of rampant abuse of administrative discretion and favouritism

The Lokayukta of Nagaland has ordered a “preliminary enquiry” into charges that Deputy Chief Minister Yanthungo Patton, had offered to help the candidates of the Nagaland Public Service Commission (NPSC) get through the interview stage.

Lokayukta Justice Uma Nath Singh, a former Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court, said his order on Thursday was based on a complaint received by the Nagaland Lokayukta Police Establishment. Vicca S. Aye, a former president of the Sumi (tribe) Students’ Union, had on Wednesday lodged the complaint against Mr. Patton’s alleged offer.

Mr. Aye complained that Mr. Patton, serving as Nagaland Home Minister for seven years now, had indulged in “rampant abuse of administrative discretion and favouritism and interfered in the normal administrative functioning of the Police department”. He also said 1,135 appointments were made in the Police department without the posts being advertised for.

The Lokayukta found the complaint “procedurally in order” and advised proper verification of the facts as the allegations relate to “a high public functionary” and any gap “may have a cascading effect on the existence of the State government”.

His order read: “I think it appropriate to exercise my powers under Section 11 of Nagaland Lokayukta Act and thus, I direct the coordinating officer/inspector, Nagaland Lokayukta Police Establishment), to register a preliminary enquiry to be conducted by the higher authority/functionary, namely the Chief Minister of Nagaland, who shall submit his report on affidavit before the next date of hearing. I also direct Deputy Chief Minister Y. Patton to file his reply on affidavit to the allegations in the complaint.”

The Lokayukta also directed the Commissioner of Police in Dimapur to ensure the protection of the complainant “who comes in the category of whistleblower”, and warned that failing to do so would invite legal consequences against the authority responsible for such protection.

Prior to the complaint, Mr. Aye had written to Governor R.N. Ravi with reference to an audio recording of Mr. Patton’s speech at a conference of the Lotha Students’ Union on January 28, in which he was heard asking all civil services aspirants to approach him after getting through the written examination of the NPSC.

“He [Mr. Patton] said he will be able to manage the interview and help the aspirants get through as he has always been practising the give-and-take policy of exchanging jobs between various authorities,” Mr. Aye said.

“I will fight such blatant misuse of power that compromises the quality of administration and threatens national security through backdoor appointments. Why were 1,135 candidates selected for 208 vacancies in the police? I don’t mind if members of a particular tribe or party affiliation get the job, but they should be academically eligible and physically fit, selected through open recruitment so that everyone gets an opportunity without political backing,” Mr. Aye told The Hindu.

192,2020/02/21,"₹50,000 crore due, Mamata writes to PM","Funds due to West Bengal not received from Centre, says CM

While the earnings of the Central government are increasing through the collection of “cesses and surcharges”, the “receivables of the State” from the Centre are only falling since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government came to power in 2014, noted West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Ms. Banerjee wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming that the State government had been deprived of an outstanding amount of nearly ₹50,000 crore under several heads.

One of the key factors was that the Centre was increasingly relying on “cesses and surcharges”, which had gone up from 6.17% of the Gross Tax Revenue in 2014-15 to 18.4% in 2019-20. “Since these do not form a part of the kitty of Central taxes, their devolution to States does not happen” thus reducing the “receivables of the State”. But more fundamental challenges were evolving out of the delay in paying GST (Goods and Services Tax) compensation to the States, the CM stated.

‘Negative impact’

GST compensation of November 2019 was cleared in February 2020, “having a serious negative impact on the management” of the States’ finances, the letter noted. In addition, “Bengal is being denied of ₹11,212 crore of devolution funds from the Centre during the financial year 2019-20,” as estimated in the previous Budget. Devolution of Central taxes had fallen over the last two years as well. An amount of ₹2,330.01 crore Special Backward Regions Grant Fund had also not arrived, the letter noted.

Altogether, the State had been “deprived” of an amount of nearly ₹50,000 crore, Ms. Banerjee noted. However, over the last decade, the State had “repaid a staggering loan of ₹3 lakh crore towards debts and interest…left behind by the previous Left Front Government”.

Despite working against odds, the State GDP (Gross Domestic Product) was 10.4%, higher than the national GDP and Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was 3.1% (April-November) as compared to national IIP of 0.6%. The State was also significantly ahead of the Centre in the services sector, Ms. Banerjee noted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/o7a4nk/article30789507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11MAMATA-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/50000-crore-due-mamata-writes-to-pm/article30874686.ece
193,2020/02/21,Muslims set up stalls as Pandits celebrate ‘Herath’ in Valley,"“The festival used to be equally celebrated by the majority community in Kashmir”

Muslims set up special stalls of fish as a miniscule population of Kashmiri Pandits, who stayed in the Valley despite the raging militancy in the 1990s, on Thursday celebrated the community’s most important festival Sivaratri, locally called ‘Herath’ — the first such festival since J&K was reduced to a Union Territory (UT) last year.

Several temples, including the traditional temples located in the old city like the Shri Ganesh temple, the Purshyar Mandir, the Durgeshwari temple etc. saw local Pandits performing important rituals. The major congregation was held at the Shankaracharya temple, where devotees offered day-long special prayers.

“I decided not to leave the Valley in the 1990s despite most of my relatives deciding to shift. Shops run by Muslims provided me all the paraphernalia for puja,” said Santoshji, who lives on a rented accommodation in Srinagar’s Zainakadal area in a Muslim house.

Hajira Jigar, a fisherwoman, set up a special stall on the Amira Kadal bridge near the Hanuman Temple. “Pandits prefer local fish and trout on the occasion. I got extra stocks for them. They are regular buyers for many decades on Herath,” she said.

Walnuts and fish dishes are central to the festival. In fact, the weather gods also kept their tryst with the festival. Rain, yearned for the day, did come in the first half of the day.

On the directions of Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Ahmad Khan, who had held meetings with all deputy commissioners of the Valley, several fish counters, stocks of lotus stems (Nadru), vegetables, walnut and flowers were made available in areas where the Pandits reside.

“The Fisheries department was asked to deploy mobile fish vans at various places in the city. Besides, local fishermen installed vending shops at Habba Kadal and Ganpatyar localities,” said Mr. Khan. The power department was directed to ensure uninterrupted supply.

Herath is one of the biggest festivals of the community. “The festival used to be equally celebrated by the majority community in Kashmir. The fact is that at the end of the religious ceremonies, a day is observed as ‘Salaam’, which entailed celebrations with the Muslim brethren in Kashmir. There is no other festival in which a day is dedicated to feasting with our Muslim brethren besides relatives,” said Satish Mahaldar, chairman of the Reconciliations, Return & Rehabilitations of Kashmiri Migrants.

According to the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), an organisation of those Pandits who stayed back, around 1,200 had decided against migration. The Pandits constituted around 2% of the population of the Valley in 1990 and witnessed a mass migration in the face of the 1989 armed rebellion. The KPSS, with the help of locals, was able to reopen and restore over 40 temples.

The Pandits oppose any move by the government to set up separate colonies for displaced migrants claiming it may further sour the relations between the two communities.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/icf4iv/article30874524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21SHIVARATRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/muslims-set-up-stalls-as-pandits-celebrate-herath-in-valley/article30874525.ece
194,2020/02/21,Drug racket busted: payment trail leads ATS to mephedrone factory in Pune,"A record of a payment made by one of the two people arrested by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) in a drug trafficking case led the agency to a factory in Pune, where mephedrone was allegedly being manufactured on a massive scale.

In December this year, the Juhu unit of the ATS arrested Mahendra Patil and Santosh Adke for allegedly manufacturing mephedrone and supplying it to drug peddlers in Mumbai and nearby cities. The ATS had at the time seized 14.3 kilogram of the drug, worth ₹5.60 crore.

Mr. Patil and Mr. Adke were first remanded in police custody for nine days and later sent to judicial custody. ATS officers said neither mentioned a second factory despite sustained interrogation. However, they got their first clue when ATS teams searched the houses of both the accused.

“We found documents pertaining to three bank accounts in Mr. Adke’s name and were scanning their records for any evidence in the case. We noticed that Mr. Adke had paid for some laboratory equipment in July last year. As the mephedrone seized earlier was also synthesised using laboratory equipment, we decided to explore the angle further,” an ATS officer said.

The investigating team contacted the supplier from whom Mr. Adke had bought the equipment. However, he said that a separate agency installs the equipment for his clients, and he had only handed it over to them.

“We then used the supplier’s call records to identify the agency that picked up the equipment and made inquiries with them. Based on the information they provided, we conducted a raid on Alpha Chemicals factory in the Purandar taluka in Pune on Wednesday. The factory had a sophisticated set up where mephedrone was being manufactured on a daily basis,” the officer said.

The ATS team, led by Police Inspector Daya Nayak, seized 10 kg of mephedrone worth ₹4.20 crore, along with a large quantity of chemicals used in its synthesis.

“Forensic experts who accompanied us on the raid have said that there was enough material to produce another 200 kilogram of the drug. We are now on the lookout for some others who were running the factory after Mr. Patil and Mr. Adke were arrested,” the officer said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wl7d2/article30875375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BM-mephedrone-factory,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/drug-racket-busted-payment-trail-leads-ats-to-mephedrone-factory-in-pune/article30875376.ece
195,2020/02/21,COVID-19 scare: poultry sector in Maharashtra lose ₹150 cr. in a fortnight,"Animal Husbandry Department, scientists appeal to ignore rumours, wrong propaganda

Maharashtra’s poultry industry has suffered an estimated loss of at least ₹150 crore in the past fortnight ever since rumours linking COVID-19 (coronavirus) to poultry have surfaced, authorities said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the State Animal Husbandry Department, along with scientists from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), jointly appealed to people to not believe unscientific propaganda.

Experts said the rumours have also taken a toll on farmers cultivating maize and soybean who are dependent on poultry, as they were enduring heavy losses.

“The State’s daily chicken requirement is 3400-3500 metric tonnes. When these rumours started surfacing on social media early this month, the requirement of chicken in the State declined precipitously from an average 3,000 metric tonnes to 2,000 metric tonnes in less than two weeks,” said Dr. Prasanna Pedgaonkar, general manager at Venky's, India's biggest poultry producer.

He said the poultry farmers and the industry in the State were enduring daily losses of ₹10-11 crore for the past fortnight.

“While the month is not yet over, we estimate losses at ₹150 crore. But the financial toll apart, we are worried about consumer confidence in chicken consumption at the moment,” Dr. Pedgaonkar said.

However, following corrective measures to rein in the rumours, with explanations from scientists and the Centre’s notification that COVID has no relation to chicken consumption, the poultry consumption figure in the State, which had declined to 2,000 metric tonnes, has risen to 2,400 metric tonnes in the past few days.

Maharashtra has 50 lakh maize and 57 lakh soybean farmers dependent on the poultry industry. “They constitute 12% of the country’s farmer population. Thus, whenever the poultry industry faces a calamity of this sort, it has a cascading effect on the agriculture sector as well,” Dr. Pedgaonkar said.

He said the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of maize had crashed to ₹1300 per quintal from ₹1,700 per quintal since the rumours linking chicken consumption to COVID-19 began surfacing. “The livelihood of several farmers depends of poultry including those cultivating maize and soybean as the poultry industry constitutes one of the processing industries of Indian agriculture. The question of financial losses apart, the need of the hour is to regain the confidence of the customer in poultry meat,” he said.

The impact of the rumours would vary across States, depending on the food habits in each region, he said. “Maharashtra has 60% non-vegetarians while some southern states have more than 90% non-vegetarians. So, the impact on the poultry industry will naturally differ from place to place,” he said.

Meanwhile, Sachindra Pratap Singh, Commissioner, Animal Husbandry, said poultry products were safe for consumption and urged people not to believe in wrong propaganda.

“Chicken consumption was safe yesterday, is safe today and will continue to be so. The moment we came to know of such rumours, we registered a case with the Pune cyber police and began awareness campaigns. The novel coronavirus (nCOV) is transmitted from person to person and poultry species has no role in it,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/asxnv4/article30875333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-scare-poultry-sector-in-maharashtra-lose-150-cr-in-a-fortnight/article30875334.ece

197,2020/02/21,"Govind Pansare murder: on fifth death anniversary, protesters rue delay in justice","Will carry on fight through democratic means until the murderers are caught: Megha Pansare

On the fifth death anniversary of slain Communist leader Govind Pansare, his kin, along with several activists from Left parties and citizens of Kolhapur city who were admirers of Mr. Pansare’s work, held a march condemning the State government’s delay in bringing the conspirators of the murder to justice.

“The criticism during the past five years is not only anger directed at Mr. Pansare’s murder but also at the ineptness of the State government and the probe agencies who have been dragging their feet over this case,” said writer-translator Dr. Megha Pansare, the late Pansare’s daughter-in-law.

Early on Thursday morning, the protesters held a Nirbhay Morning Walk at the spot where Mr. Pansare was shot by two assailants while he was on his morning stroll.

“All like-minded citizens, as custodians of Mr. Pansare’s progressive ideals, will carry on the fight through democratic means until the murderers are caught,” said Dr. Megha Pansare.

The protesters rent the morning air with cries of ‘Long live Govind Pansare, Dr. Narendra Dabholkar, scholar M.M. Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh’ and ‘Lal Salaam (red salute)’, while carrying photos of the slain intellectuals.

“Even after five long years, there seems to be no indication that the State government is serious in bringing the masterminds of Mr. Pansare’s murder to book. Till the real perpetrators of the murder are arrested, we will continue to protest on the streets,” said veteran socialist activist Dr. N.D. Patil.

Mr. Pansare, along with his wife Uma, were repeatedly shot at close range in Kolhapur’s Sagar Mal locality on February 16, 2015.

While Ms. Pansare survived the murderous attack, her husband succumbed to his wounds in Mumbai’s Breach Candy Hospital on February 20.

Nine people have been named in Mr. Pansare’s murder so far including Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar, two absconding activists of the Sanatan Sanstha, who the agencies earlier alleged to have carried out the actual shooting of Mr. Pansare.

In June 2017, a Kolhapur court, after three rejections, had finally accorded conditional bail to Sanatan Sanstha activist Sameer Gaikwad, who was picked up from Sangli district in western Maharashtra in September 2015 — the first arrest in the Pansare case.

In January 2018, the Kolhapur sessions court had granted conditional bail to radical Hindutva activist and ENT specialist Dr. Virendra Tawde — named as the ‘mastermind’ in Dr Dabholkar’s murder — in connection with his suspected role in the killing of the veteran Communist leader.

According to probe agencies, Dr. Tawde is a crucial link to the murders of Pansare and Dr. Dabholkar. The SIT’s supplementary charge sheet even names Dr. Tawde as ‘mastermind’ in the Pansare murder, suspecting him of conducting the reconnaissance before the murder.

In November 2018, Amol Kale, a key accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, was arrested by the SIT in connection with Mr. Pansare’s murder. Amit Degwekar, another co-accused in the Gauri Lankesh case, too, had been arrested by the SIT probing the Pansare murder.

In June last year, the SIT had arrested and interrogated Sharad Kalaskar, alleged to be the second sharpshooter who shot Dr. Dabholkar, in connection with Mr. Pansare’s murder. In September 2019, Sachin Andure, the second assailant in the Dabholkar case, was also questioned regarding the Pansare murder before being sent to judicial custody.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sdf3n7/article30875254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BM--GOVINDPANSARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/govind-pansare-murder-on-fifth-death-anniversary-protesters-rue-delay-in-justice/article30875255.ece
198,2020/02/21,75 free bone marrow transplants in six years in Odisha hospital,"The SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack on Thursday achieved a major milestone by performing its 75th bone marrow transplant – the highest in any State government-run hospital in the country.

The Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Unit of the hospital extends the treatment free of cost – a pioneering effort in the country. Of the 75 cancer patients who have undergone the complex transplant procedure, 70 have been found to be healthy while five have passed away.

“The bone marrow transplant, which a poor patient cannot dream of availing, is extended free of cost in our facility. The Health and Family Welfare Department of Odisha bears the cost of the treatment. Probably no government-run hospital in eastern India has performed so many BMTs,” said R.K. Jena, head of Clinical Haematology Department in S.C.B. Medical College and Hospital and the man behind this unique endeavour.

A BMT unit started functioning in the hospital on February 26, 2014. In the last six years, Dr. Jena and his team have been conscientiously trying make life better for cancer patients.

Expensive procedure

BMT is a procedure to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells. In private sector hospitals, a patient has to cough up about ₹10 lakh for a BMT. In the SCB facility, the cost incurred on each BMT ranges between ₹70,000 and ₹1 lakh. Of the 75 patients, 65 belong to below poverty line. Now, around 30 patients are waiting to avail of BMT at SCB.

Dr. Jena, who was also former president of Indian Society of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, said only private hospital Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, had done higher number of BMTs than SCB Medical College.

All BMTs have been carried out through Stem Cell Apheresis procedure. “In all cases we have successfully mobilised and collected adequate stem cells by a single procedure, unlike other centres needing one to three procedures. Restricting to one procedure reduces cost,” he observed.

Of the 75 cancer patients, five were above 65 years and conducting BMT on them was no mean achievement. As per Indian Journal of Cancer, very few hospitals in the country have attempted BMT involving elderly persons. Dr. Jena said, “We conducted BMT on one patient who was 74 years old.”

The Lokayukta of Nagaland has ordered a “preliminary enquiry” into charges that Deputy Chief Minister Yanthungo Patton had offered to help the candidates of Nagaland Public Service Commission (NPSC) get through the interview stage.

Lokayukta Justice Uma Nath Singh, a former Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court, said that his order on Thursday was based on a complaint received by the Nagaland Lokayukta Police Establishment. Vicca S. Aye, a former president of the Sumi (tribe) Students’ Union, had on Wednesday lodged the complaint against Mr. Patton’s alleged offer.

Mr. Aye complained that Mr. Patton, serving as Nagaland’s Home Minister for seven years now, had indulged in “rampant abuse of administrative discretion and favouritism and interfered in the normal administrative functioning of the police department”. He also alleged that 1,135 appointments were made in the police department without the posts being advertised for.

The Lokayukta found the complaint “procedurally in order” and advised proper verification of the facts as the allegations relate to “a high public functionary” and any gap “may have a cascading effect on the existence of the State government”.

His order read: “I think it appropriate to exercise my powers under Section 11 of Nagaland Lokayukta Act and thus, I direct the coordinating officer/inspector, Nagaland Lokayukta Police Establishment), to register a preliminary enquiry to be conducted by the higher authority/functionary, namely the Chief Minister of Nagaland, who shall submit his report on affidavit before the next date of hearing. I also direct the Deputy Chief Minister Y. Patton to file his reply on affidavit to the allegations in the complaint.”

The Lokayukta also directed the Commissioner of Police in Dimapur to ensure the protection of the complainant “who comes in the category of whistleblower”, and warned that failing to do so would invite necessary legal consequences against the authority responsible for such protection.

Prior to the complaint, Mr. Aye had written to State Governor R.N.

201,2020/02/21,28 anti-CAA protesters issued recovery notices of ₹64 lakh,"They include Darapuri and Sadaf who intend to move court

Twenty-eight persons in Lucknow have been asked to pay around ₹64 lakh as recovery for damage to private and public property during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at the Parivartan Chowk on December 19.

Several vehicles, including a State bus and police motorcycles, were damaged in the arson and vandalism. Those served notices include retired IPS officer S.R. Darapuri, lawyer and activist Mohammad Shoaib, Congress member Sadaf Jafar, teacher Robin Verma and cultural activist Deepak Kabir.

The order issued by K.P. Singh, Additional District Magistrate (East), earlier this week asks the 28 persons to pay the amount within 30 days or face confiscation of their properties. The ADM found them responsible for illegal assembly and fixed the damages under “joint and several liability”.

The accused are out on bail in the arson and vandalism case slapped against them. Mr. Darapuri and Ms. Jafar said on Thursday that they intend to move court against the recovery notices. They stated they have not yet received any official communication seeking recovery. “I am hearing news that I’ve been issued recovery notices by the district administration, though I have not received any such notice till now. I will challenge it in the High Court if I get any,” said the retired IPS officer.

“The State government is sending recovery notices unconstitutionally to people. There is no proof against me of inciting violence but instead of arresting antisocial elements, they arrested and tortured me,” said Ms. Jafar, also a social activist.

The court of the Additional District Magistrate in Lucknow had earlier this month issued notices to recover ₹21.76 lakh from 13 persons accused of damaging public and private property in the vandalism and arson that took place in the Khadra area of Lucknow on December 19.

Our efforts will focus both on demand reduction and choking supplies. Anti-narcotic cells have been established in every district while at the State-level the Special Task Force will function as an anti-narcotics wing of the police,” the Governor said.

Mr. Arya, who was addressing the budget session of State Assembly here, said the government accords high priority to ensuring equitable distribution of water to every farmer.

“Every possible effort would be made to bring to Haryana our legitimate share of surplus Ravi-Beas waters through the Sutlej Yamuna Link canal at the earliest,” he said.

He said the State government has decided to celebrate the year 2020 as “Sushashan Sankalp Varsh”. “Under this, focus would be given on launching several new good governance initiatives and on improving service delivery to citizens by every department and across the State throughout the year,” Mr. Arya said.

“I believe that increase in the ease of obtaining government services by using technology and streamlining processes will help to improve ‘ease of living’ as well,” he said.

The Governor added that on the occasion of the next ‘Good Governance Day’ on December 25, 2020, the State Government would submit its report card on such initiatives and reward officers, employees and departments that would have performed exemplary work.

Land records

Mr. Arya added that the vision of the State government is to complete digitisation of land records so that owners could access details of their properties and their land records online any time. “For this, an Integrated Haryana Land Records Information System has been developed,” he said.

The Governor said the government has streamlined the mining activities in the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6l0gyf/article30874818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE2-HARYANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryana-govt-determined-to-tackle-drug-abuse-governor/article30874819.ece
204,2020/02/21,‘Punjab to probe sacrilege cases’,"SC has rejected CBI plea to investigate them, says CM

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said the State’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) will now investigate the Behbal Kalan and Bargari sacrilege cases as the Supreme Court has rejected the CBI plea to investigate them.

He was making a statement during the budget session of the State Assembly here.

The Chief Minister informed the House that the Supreme Court had on Thursday morning allowed the State to carry on its investigations into the sacrilege cases and the subsequent police firing in these cases, which were handed over to the CBI by the previous SAD-BJP regime.

“These cases will now be probed only by Punjab. The modalities will be announced later,” he said. The government had announced in the House last year that the cases would be taken back from the central agency and would be investigated by the State government.

Two persons were killed in the police firing in Behbal Kalan of Faridkot district in 2015, which followed the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari.

AAP welcomes decision

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Aman Arora welcomed the decision and said that now the Punjab government should ensure time-bound investigations into the cases so that the guilty could be punished.

Before the session started, the Shiromani Akali Dal staged a protest outside the Assembly and demanded a rollback of the power tariff hike in the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1lhvtr/article30874787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-to-probe-sacrilege-cases/article30874788.ece
205,2020/02/21,‘Scindia must revive his father’s party’,"Madhya Pradesh Mahila Congress general secretary Ruchi Thakur has said Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia should revive his father’s party as he was being ignored by the State leadership. “Lakhs of supporters” will back the decision, she added.

“If you conduct a survey now, everyone will want maharaj [Mr. Jyotiraditya] to launch a new party. We request him to revive the party of his father Madhavrao Scindia that had the rising sun as its symbol,” she said, drumming up support for the beleaguered leader, a scion of the Gwalior royal family.

Last Thursday, Mr. Jyotiraditya threatened to hit the streets if promises made by the Congress before the 2018 Vidhan Sabha election were not kept, to which Chief Minister Kamal Nath retorted: “Toh utar jaaye” (Then hit the streets).

The remarks foregrounded yet again cleavages within the State Congress, with different power centres jostling for power. Later, the Chief Minister clarified he was not angry with him.

206,2020/02/21,‘Proposal against CAA in M.P. Assembly session’,"Law brought in to distract public attention: Digvijaya

Congress MP and former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh on Thursday said the Madhya Pradesh government would table a proposal against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) in the upcoming Assembly session beginning March 16.

Stating that the law was brought in to distract public attention from the deteriorating economy and spiralling unemployment, Mr. Singh told reporters in Gwalior that he’d spoken to Chief Minister Kamal Nath about the proposal.

“The Congress Working Committee has already opposed the CAA, the NRC and the NPR nationwide. That’s why even Madhya Pradesh is against it,” he said, while taking part in a rally against the law.

Moreover, he claimed that new questions were added to the NPR update exercise, scheduled in the State from May.

“For instance, the birthplace and date of birth of parents. Whoever is unable to answer such questions will be deemed doubtful,” he said.

On February 5, the State government had passed a resolution calling upon the Centre to abrogate the law, and begin the NPR update only after withdrawing the proposal to add new queries.

However, when a December 9 notification issued by the State government scheduling the NPR update surfaced recently, Congress MLA Arif Masood threatened an agitation if the government went ahead with it.

Quelling apprehensions, Mr. Nath on Monday said the NPR would not be implemented in the State “at present”.

“The notification being talked about was issued on December 9. After this, the Centre implemented the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Therefore the NPR notification has not been issued under the CAA, 2019,” he had said, adding that in any case the notification was issued under rule 3 of the 2003 rules of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and not the new one.

Speaking at the rally, former MP and Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav said, “The Central government is going against the Constitution by implementing all the three. Not just Muslims, but Dalits, tribals and others from backward communities are being targeted.”

Meanwhile, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the protests were similar to the non-cooperation movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi against the British.

‘There is misconception’

“There is a misconception that the NPR is like census. Those against whom D (doubtful) would be written, would be included in the NRC. Even under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre failed at implementing it. That’s why 13 States have taken a stand against it now,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ck444j/article30874771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20-DIG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/proposal-against-caa-in-mp-assembly-session/article30874772.ece
207,2020/02/21,Rasasvada brought together diverse dance forms,"Rasasvada was a unique festival of classical dance

Rasasvada, organised by Nrityantar, was a topical and unique festival of classical dance that brought together diverse dance forms of both senior and young artistes in solo and group choreographies. In its fourth year, Rasasvada, held at Seva Sadan auditorium, lined up some excellent performances in Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi and contemporary dance.

A protégé of Mysore Nagaraj, Laxminarayan Jena was all grace in his Kathak performance and brought in two splendid choreographies of his guru. The first was a Dhrupad in dhamaar taal 'Damru Har kar baaje' which describes the attributes of Shiva. Jena's mastery over the dance idiom showed in his presentation of rhythmic intricacies and grammar of Kathak. The next choreography borrowed from the vachana sahitya of Akka Mahadevi. A highly emotive piece, this saw the dancer give expression to the angst of the devotee who asks the swans, peacocks et al about her lost lover, Channamallikarjuna.

A seasoned Bharatanantyam dancer, Kshitija Barve selected abhinaya pieces that fully validated her potential for mime and expression. In the famed Sahana padam, 'Mogaduchi Pilachedu', she poured life into a parakiya nayika, who goes to Krishna before she is escorted to her husband’s home. She says, his feet are still her refuge though they, as lovers, are distant like the sun and the lotus. The expression is not one of intimate familiarity but of reverential devotion hence the heroine says 'nee dhyanamu veruleka neeve daivamuni dalachi' (Realizing that you are god, I meditate upon you). She did not take the usual route in presenting 'Madhurashtakam' with dominance to Vatsalya. She mentioned the magnified form of the Lord and also the episode of the Gita.

Recent Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar awardee and disciple of Aruna Mohanty, Madhulita Mohapatra presented an emotionally charged Odissi abhinaya item, 'Shoonya Swaroopa'. This expressed the advaitic concept of an all pervading divine spirit . She started with the famous verse from Shwetaswatara Upanishad, 'Apanipado javano grahita' that describes the cosmic self and its nature. Madhulita magnetically depicted this omnipresence as seen by the devotee in elements of nature ; yet the devotee still craves for the universal spirit's physical presence. An enticing nritta sequence followed the description of 'naada'. The Ektaali Malhar Pallavi by Nrityantar ensemble was graceful and incorporated many variations of Odissi nritta.

STEM Dance Kampni of Madhu Nataraj and her team were the crowd favourites and they pulled off a stupendous feat which took heavily from traditional Kathak, Kalaripayattu, Chau and contemporary styles. The five elements Panchabhootas were presented as mandalas in a piece that borrowed mainly from Kathak. 'Rhapsody' that paid tribute to the painting of S. G. Vasudev saw agile and articulate dancers in full vibrance, making effective and balanced use of dance space. 'Sports' was a light hearted take on the competitive world of sports. Cricket and Kabaddi came alive on stage with all thrill and drama, heightened by slow motion and loud theatrics.

Young Bharatnatyam dancer, Anagha Gauri, disciple and daughter of Anuradha and Shridhar, was the opening dancer on the second day. She presented a neat jatiswaram by Veene Seshanna in Khanda Ata tala. Muthuswamy Dikshitar's Bowli composition 'Sree Parvati Parameswarau Vande' was danced more as an expressive item and the possibilities of pure dance was kept to a minimum.

An elaborately done 'Sreeramachandra Kripalu' from 'Ramacharitmanas' was the mainstay in Naveen Hegde and Rohini Prabhath's Kathak peformance. Though this item left much to be desired in abhinaya, the next piece 'Parampara' vouched for the young dancers' aesthetics and technique. Complete with complex laykaari, energetic footwork, thrilling jugalbandis, and two full cycle swift swirls in an extensive teentaal composition, these students and dancers of Abhinava Dance Company of Nirupama and Rajendra, drew heavy applause from the audience.

Veteran Odissi dancer and central Sangeet Natak Academy awardee Aloka Kanungo made a dramatic entry and justified her portrayal of a mischievous Krishna in a group choreography 'Are re Nandara Sutho' in which she portrayed the pranks of Krishna but only to be outwitted this time by the gopis.

An alarippu in Chaturashram and Oothukadu Venkata Kavi's 'Vishamakara kannan' were the main items performed by Raadha Kalpa Dance Company. Dancers of varying calibre put together a show that was inconsistent in parts.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/uz6bn3/article30879279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bgfpic11jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/celebrating-rasa/article30879280.ece

209,2020/02/21,Athimugam Road awaits repair,"Stone quarries in the vicinity are largely responsible for the damage, say locals

Riddled with potholes and giant boulders, the road to Athimugam in Perandapalli here is in dire need of repair.

Heavy vehicles, smaller utility vehicles and normal commuters hobble down precariously on the stretch, carefully avoiding the random boulders and the potholes dotting the stretch. The road has been this way forever, says a passer-by.

Athimugam Road branches off from the service road of Krishnagiri-Hosur national highway. The road lies on the side overlooking the road to Thorapalli, the birth place of C. Rajagopalachari. The stone quarries in the vicinity are largely responsible for the load on the road that had caused damage.

Heavy vehicles laden with stone and gravel from the adjoining stone quarries trudge through the stretch causing damage to an already dented road.

According to the local shopkeepers, the road has been like this for long, yet the visible and the urgent need for repair is hardly pushed for. When the dent and the pothole on the stretch got worse, all that was done was to dump some more gravel and sand to keep vehicles plying.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/msgawu/article30883705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KA22ATHIMUGAMROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/athimugam-road-awaits-repair/article30883707.ece
210,2020/02/21,"Wages not paid regularly,claim MGNREGS workers","They want job days increased from 100 to 200 a year

Workers involved in desilting and restoration of water bodies under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in Gundri Hills here have claimed that they were not paid wages regularly.

Located about 17 km from Kadambur, Gundri panchayat has 22 villages and a population of 5,700. Ragi, maize and tapioca are the major crops in the rain-fed area. While farmers store a portion of the harvested produce for their own use, the remaining is sold for meagre price.

The villagers depend on jobs under MGNREGS scheme for their main source of income. Though the Central government had fixed a wage of ₹ 224 a day, the villagers claim that they were paid only ₹ 100 to ₹ 160 a day, for which they begin work at 9 a.m. and wind up by 5 p.m.

Jeyarani (40) of Kovilur in Gundri said that she worked for 69 days and was paid only ₹ 1,000.

“Money was credited in my bank account on September 9, 2019 after which I did not receive any money,” she said.

Over 120 workers, mostly women, are involved in various restoration works in the panchayat.

Chinnappan (65), a worker, wanted the number of job days increased to 200 a year. “There is no agricultural activity or other job options here. Hence, the job days should be increased and reasonable wage should be paid,” he added. “For 20 days’ work, I was given ₹ 2,000 as wages,” said another worker.

Most of the workers want the average wage hiked over ₹ 180 a day so that they could meet their needs. “Availability of work will prevent people from migrating to other places for work,” said Kaliappan, a villager.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wo2hg0/article30883701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER22GUNDRIHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wages-not-paid-regularlyclaim-mgnregs-workers/article30883702.ece

The issue was taken up with the District Coordinating Committee chairman and Collector C. Kathiravan who ordered disconnection of power supply to the units. Based on Collector’s direction, officials disconnected the power supply to the three units and stopped their operations. Officials said that many dyeing, printing and tannery units were functioning in the region and many units had established zero liquid discharge effluent treatment plants and were reusing the water. However, a few units continued to function without treatment plants. The officials warned of action against such units.

213,2020/02/21,"It’s the fashion among a few countries to comment on the internal affairs of India, says VP Venkaiah Naidu","The Vice President was addressing a gathering of students at the PSG College of Arts and Science in Coimbatore

It has become the fashion among a few countries to comment on the internal affairs of India, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said, addressing a gathering of students at the PSG College of Arts and Science, here on Friday.

“It has become a fashion to comment on our affairs. But we tell these countries that you manage yours and we will manage ours. We are capable of managing our affairs. We also tell these countries that comment from there.”

His comments came days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raked up the Kashmir issue in the Pakistan Parliament.

The Vice President further said, “And, this is truer of a few Western countries that are never tired of talking of Kashmir or the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. I asked the representatives of those few countries how they would feel if India were to Brexit or exit.”

Urging the students to read, be well-informed and then take a decision one way or the other, he said they would do well to understand that the Act had nothing to do with Indian citizens. It was for granting citizenship to the persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries.

Likewise, Article 370 that the Parliament recently abrogated was a temporary provision. “It is a temporary provision that has been there for 72 years. The Parliament has debated and discussed it. And, after a thorough debate, it abrogated it. But some people are trying to create a wrong impression about it.”

Mr. Naidu said a neighbouring country funded, trained, aided and abetted terrorism and tried using every available opportunity attempted to rake up the Kashmir issue. “I say that Kashmir is an integral part of India and the neighbour will not get even an inch of Kashmir land. And, we will not allow outside interference,” he said.

Urging the students to speak only in their mother tongue at home and with neighbours, he said one’s mother tongue was like eyesight and any other language was like spectacles. If one lost one’s eyesight, there was no use for spectacles.

It was for this reason that he wanted primary and secondary education to be conducted in students’ mother tongues. This would help the students better understand the subjects they were taught and also teach them to communicate properly. If not, they spend half their energy and time trying to learn a foreign language, a subject on which he agreed with former Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

In a reference to on-going protests against CAA, NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens) in educational institutions, he said while there was room for debate and discussion in a democracy, there was no room for destruction or violence. Even for dissent there was space in a democracy but people should be patient. But students appeared to be impatient as he was getting news about a few universities in the country. “But I’m happy that only five out of 936 universities are in the news for the wrong reasons,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/xvdc90/article30880519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FEBTH-NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/its-the-fashion-among-a-few-countries-to-comment-on-the-internal-affairs-of-india-says-vp-venkaiah-naidu/article30880520.ece

The PHC, which serves as an important and most accessible medical facility for more than 15,000 people living in the reserve, had been lacking essential medical equipment and needed to be upgraded, said R. Maadhu, a member of the Masunagudi Natpani Mandram, the group which purchased the equipment by raising funds through donations from local residents.

“We had been told that the PHC needed an ECG machine, so we purchased a machine for around ₹ 70,000. We also purchased a water purifier, a backup power system and a nebuliser,” said Mr. Maadhu.

Ten members of the Mandram collected the donations from the residents.

“The PHC is the only accessible medical facility for people living in MTR.

The Mandram called upon the Health Department to upgrade the PHC and to also depute qualified doctors and more nurses. “We will continue to support the PHC, as there is more equipment required to keep it continuing to function.

219,2020/02/21,Tea Room opened to popularise specialty Nilgiris teas,"Steps being taken to increase tea consumption among people

To popularise specialty teas from the Nilgiris, the Tea Board has opened a ‘Tea Room/ Tea Boutique,’ near the Government Botanical Garden here on Thursday.

In a release, the Tea Board said that the Tea Room was being opened at the Resource Centre for Tribal Culture (RCTC) building to popularise Nilgiri teas among the public.

The Tea Room would exhibit high-quality specialty teas produced in the Nilgiris, where tourists and visitors could also taste the unique teas from the district.

The Tea Board also said that they were taking steps to increase tea consumption among the public, especially the youth. It was hoped that the Tea Room would help popularise tea consumption among the youth.

The Tea Board was also imparting training to young farmers in the art of tea tasting.

Quality of teas

They said that such initiatives would help provide livelihood for youngsters who were involved in tea cultivation and would also improve the quality of teas produced in the Nilgiris.

The Tea Room was inaugurated by the Executive Director of the Tea Board (Coonoor), M. Balaji.

221,2020/02/21,Police cracking the whip on vehicles with high beam headlamps,"Traffic police conduct special drives at night; violators fined

Replacing original headlights of vehicles with high power LED headlamps has become a trend in Coimbatore like in other cities. In addition to installing such headlamps that blind the view of motorists coming from the opposite side, many also fit additional lights in vehicles, mostly LEDs, that distract the view.

But use of such headlights will land the rider in trouble if caught in vehicle checks conducted by the Coimbatore City Police.

Knowing the danger these lights can pose to other motorists, City Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan directed traffic police personnel to conduct special dives at night to check the use improper headlamps and use of LED lights for decorative purpose in vehicles.

According to Mr. Sharan, 450 persons have been fined for using improper LED headlights and for fitting additional LED lights, during the special drives held between January 1 and Wednesday (February 19).

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu said that the crack down on LED headlights would continue along with seizure of pressure horns, use of which was very high in heavy vehicles and mini goods carriers.

“The police had received complaints that use of such LED headlights was not only distracting the vision of other motorists, but also pedestrians. The high beam light emitted from such lights blinds the view of pedestrians, who use narrow roads, and can cause accidents,” he said. During the same period from January 1 to Wednesday, the traffic police personnel also fined 1,400 persons for the use of pressure horns, which is a violation of motor vehicle rules as they generate high decibel deafening sound.

Mr. Mutharasu said that pressure horns were used in most of the buses conducting routine services through city roads. He said that the police would also conduct drives at night to check the use of pressure horns and LED headlights in buses that conducted long distance services at night.

While a fine of ₹ 1,000 is imposed for the use of pressure horns, the use of high beam LED headlights attracts a fine of ₹ 10,000 that has to be remitted in court where the police file charge-sheet for the violation.

Mr. Mutharasu said that the police also had plans to check other alterations made in vehicles.

But use of pressure horns and LED headlights would be the prime focus as they directly affected other motorists.

K. Kathirmathiyon, member of District Road Safety Committee and Secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause (CCC), said that the newly launched Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation buses were also fitted with LED decorative lights which also need to be checked.

“Some of the vehicles are coming with in-built high power LED headlights which seem to be not suitable for Indian conditions. CCC had asked the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) whether such headlamps were suitable for Indian conditions.

ARAI replied that that no studies were done on the front in India and such in-built headlights were permitted in India citing their use in developed foreign countries. Even though roads are far better with lane systems in those countries, they are also rethinking about the use of LED headlights which pose danger to other motorists,” he said.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon also wanted the Coimbatore Rural Police to conduct similar drives as rural parts had narrow roads more.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/t2z4pu/article30874660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB21LEDLIGHTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/police-cracking-the-whip-on-vehicles-with-high-beam-headlamps/article30874662.ece

“We decided to get married at the dharna venue as our dear and near ones are here,” said Mr. Kalam to journalists.

According to him, the marriage date was fixed three months ago and both families did not expect anti-CAA stir escalating to this level.

“We wanted everyone to be around us for the marriage. Hence the marriage was shifted from the auditorium to the dharna venue,” said Mr. Kalam urging that CAA be repealed. “We think our marriage was revolutionary. We have got married amidst [thousands of protesting] people,” said Ms. Sherin.

They posed for wedding photos with placards opposing CAA, NPR and NRC with thousands of protesters in the background. The newly wed said that they wish no one had to spend the happiest moment of their life at a protest venue.

223,2020/02/21,NHAI to carry out works to prevent accidents,"Once tender is finalised, works will begin within a month

The National Highways Authority of India will be carrying out various development works between Selanaikenpatti and Kondalampatti junctions to prevent accidents and reduce traffic congestions in the route.

Both the junctions are located on the busy Salem-Kochi Highway and thousands of vehicles pass through these stretches every day to access Salem city. Salem- Namakkal road and Salem- Ulundurpet Highway also meet at Selanaikenpatti junctions.

Most of the omni buses to Chennai pass through this route.

Since the stretch between the junctions passes through the towns, the department has noticed that for easy access and to cross the highway easily, residents on both sides of the road between Selanaikenpatti and Kondalampatti have made unauthorised cuts on the centre median here.

According to officials, this has often led to multiple accidents on the route. To prevent such accidents, highway authorities have planned to construct a raised concrete centre median here.

A senior highways official said that to reduce congestion, service road would be put at places wherever required between the junctions.

Officials have also planned to extend the service road from Nilavarapatti to Erumapalayam, a distance of 300 metres on the Salem- Namakkal Road.

According to the department officials, ₹14 crore has been estimated for these works and once the tender is finalised, the works would begin within a month.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/nhai-to-carry-out-works-to-prevent-accidents/article30874222.ece

225,2020/02/21,Why you need to keep an eye on Sophie Devine this T20 World Cup,"The New Zealand captain enters the event on a streak of four 50-plus scores this month, including a 65-ball 105. At least one expert thinks she can break the record for the fastest Twenty20 hundred

At the Women’s T20 Challenge in Jaipur last May, there was this interesting moment. Smriti Mandhana, the Trailblazers captain who was batting with her usual flourish, needed help with her shoelaces.

Supernovas fielder Anuja Patil went up to her Indian teammate to help. But fellow-fielder Sophie Devine had a tongue-in-cheek suggestion for Anuja: “One way of getting her out would be to tie both the shoes together.”

These days, fielding sides may be tempted to do something like that to Devine herself when she is at the wicket. There is no guarantee, though, that that would stop her from hitting those massive sixes.

Devine has arrived in Australia for the Women’s T20 World Cup in — pardon the pun — divine form. Earlier this month, at Wellington, she smashed 105 off 65 balls, the latest of four consecutive fifty-plus scores, in New Zealand’s 69-run win over South Africa.

Before that, she had lit up the Women’s Big Bash League. Playing for Adelaide Strikers, she scored 769 runs at an average of 76.90 and a strike rate of 130.33. And she hit 29 sixes (10 more than the second player on the list).

Devine loves to say it with sixes. The only woman to average more than a six an innings in T20Is (minimum: 30 innings), she has, since 2017, been hitting it even harder, averaging 1.81 sixes per innings.

Little wonder that the expectations from Devine are huge at the T20 World Cup, which opened in Sydney on Friday. Australian cricketer-turned-commentator Melanie Jones, in fact, made a prediction a few days ago: “Deandra Dottin’s 38-ball hundred might just go at this World Cup and if it does, I think it will be Sophie Devine.”

Reema Malhotra could not have agreed more. “Devine could beat even more records,” says the former India all-rounder, who has played against her on several occasions. “I feel she is probably the cleanest, biggest hitter in women’s cricket at the moment. She gives New Zealand a fair chance at the World Cup.”

As captain, Devine will want to lead from the front and inspire her team to perform at its best. “We haven’t done as well as we should have, given the world class talents we have in the side,” the 30-year-old had told The Hindu when she was in Jaipur for the T20 Challenge. “We want to showcase those skills at the World Cup.”

With players like Suzie Bates, Lea Tahuhu, Amelia Kerr and Rachel Priest, New Zealand could go far in the tournament. In Devine, it has a player who can turn a match around all by herself. This is an aspect of cricket she relishes: it is an individual game within a team sport.

She also enjoys playing hockey, though; she has represented her country in major events such as the Champions Trophy. “I was a defender,” she says. “I have no regrets that I decided to concentrate on cricket.”

The sport should be grateful. She is one of those stars whose compelling strokeplay draws people to the game.

But as a child, her idol was no batsman. “I admired Brett Lee, and wanted to bowl like him,” she says, smiling. “I had the same long run-up and action, but not quite the pace.” She still has 71 wickets from 105 ODIs and 84 wickets from 87 T20Is. The batting figures are more impressive: 2,570 ODI runs (with five hundreds and 12 fifties); 2,252 T20I runs (one hundred and 13 fifties).

One of those fifties came off just 18 balls, against India at Bengaluru in 2015. That remains the fastest in women’s T20Is. “Everything I planned that day seemed to come out of the middle of the bat,” she recalls.

She is glad that the women’s game has come a long way in India since that tour. “Five years ago, if you had told me that I would come to play a women’s tournament similar to the IPL, I would not have believed you,” she says. “The Indian team has improved quite a lot too, especially in fielding. I respect Indian players like Jhulan Goswami, Mithali Raj, Smriti, Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, Poonam Yadav and Mansi Joshi.”

Among India’s male cricketers, she admires Virat Kohli. “He is the ultimate when it comes to class, composure and constructing an innings,” she says. “I also like to watch Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan bat.”

But the biggest influence on her batting has been compatriot Brendon McCullum. “He is aggressive from ball one, regardless of the situation,” she says. “He has been an inspiration not just for me, but for entire New Zealand.”

Devine has also served as an inspiration for many — she has been diabetic since the age of 15. “It has been a challenge, yes,” she says. “But I want to tell people: Even when you are fighting with diseases like diabetes or asthma, you can be socially active.”

You can also be a world-beater, as she has shown.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/y3zvea/article30883714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GettyImages-1206405362d,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/why-you-need-to-keep-an-eye-on-sophie-devine-this-t20-world-cup/article30883715.ece
226,2020/02/21,Pragyan Ojha announces retirement,"Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha announced retirement from international and First Class cricket on Friday.

The 33-year-old, who played his last Test in November 2013 in Mumbai which was also Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell match, said in a statement that representing the country at the highest level was a dream he had cherished as a youngster.

“I am at a loss for words to describe how fortunate I have been to have lived my dream and earned the love and respect of my fellow countrymen.

“For a sportsperson there cannot be a better reward,” he said.

Ojha thanked the Hyderabad Cricket Association and the BCCI for giving him the platform to “showcase my talent”.

He also expressed special thanks to several players, including V.V.S. Laxman, Venkatapathi Raju, M.S. Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwary and Saurav Ganguly to name a few who were “so supportive to my cause,” he told The Hindu on Friday.

“I feel the most memorable moments were when I got the India Test cap for I believe Test cricket is the ultimate format,” he said.

“And, in terms of winning for the country the other moment was when I returned a seven-wicket haul in the Test against Sri Lanka there when I played because Harbhajan Singh was taken ill,” Ojha recalled.

“Another unforgettable moment was the farewell Test for the great Sachin Tendulkar.

“It was a truly emotional match for many reasons and I am fortunate to have soaked in that kind of atmosphere,” he said.

Interestingly, Sachin tweeted on Ojha’s retirement “it was always great to see your big heart & skill at work. You made my last Test special by picking up 10 wickets. Welcome to the second innings club, my friend!”

IPL stints

“The IPL stints with Deccan Chargers and Mumbai Indians have always been special and again all these things would not have been possible but for Vijaya Paul’s coaching,” Ojha said.

Any regrets? “Frankly, none. I always enjoyed the way things have gone for me. Right now, I am doing TV commentary and see how things shape up.

“But, I look back with a lot of contentment for sure,” he concluded.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/y9q9ah/article30883284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22OJHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pragyan-ojha-announces-retirement/article30883286.ece
227,2020/02/21,Ranji Trophy | A complete washout on day two,"Wet patches on the outfield rule out play, leaving KSCA concerned

The Gandhi Memorial Science College ground was bathed in blazing sunshine on Friday, but not a single ball was bowled. After bad light had allowed only half an hour of play on day one, Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir endured more frustration on the second day of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal here.

Heavy overnight rain left wet patches on the outfield, and although most of the ground had dried by lunch, the umpires were distinctly unhappy with the run-up area from one end. Play was finally called off at 4 p.m. after multiple inspections.

Frustrating

“We have come here for a quarterfinal and the match not happening is really frustrating,” said Karnataka off-spinner K. Gowtham. “But the ground-staff are doing their best. We still have three good days left, so we are hopeful.”

Only six overs have now been bowled on the first two days of this contest.

If both teams cannot complete their first innings, J & K will go through by virtue of having won more games outright in the group stages. The KSCA is concerned, and disappointed that a knockout game was not held at a venue where such risks could have been avoided.

“We were very apprehensive about the facilities there. We were aware of the limitations. The BCCI should have taken a call. Unfortunately, for now, we are at the receiving end.

“Till Saturday, we tried to keep the game in Bengaluru. We told the J & K team that it will be an opportunity for their players to be seen on TV,” said KSCA secretary Santosh Menon.

The JKCA was understandably not keen on giving up the chance to host such a high-profile fixture.

The association had only three days to prepare for this game, and JKCA staff have toiled hard to put on a show, but the fact that not a single ball was bowled on day two despite bright sunshine raises serious questions. Water seeped in under the covers, and the teams could do nothing but wait.

Limited equipment

“The infrastructure we have is temporary. We have limited equipment here. We are doing our best with that. We had started a tendering process for more ground machinery but that got delayed because of the blockade,” said a JKCA official.

BCCI General Manager (Cricket Operations) Saba Karim said: “Barring the venues which host international matches, most others don't have a structured drainage system, yet we conduct First Class matches at those venues without any issue.”

The forecast for the next three days is good but the onus is now on Karnataka to drive the game forward. The KSCA is understandably unhappy with the regulations, which equate results in Group C with those in the top-tier.

Vague rule

Further, teams in Group C play nine matches in the group stages, as opposed to the eight that those in Groups A and B do. “We had raised this issue with the BCCI during the Vijay Hazare Trophy,” said Menon. “We had written to the BCCI that this is a vague rule. Because, any team can face the situation that we are in now.”

But all that the Karnataka team can do now is hope there are no further interruptions.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bevx1q/article30883277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22JAMMU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-a-complete-washout-on-day-two/article30883278.ece
228,2020/02/21,A helping hand for Poonam’s feet,"There’s a joke in the India women’s dressing room that when the ball is in Poonam Yadav’s hand only the ball can be seen, not her palm.

But such is her wrist-work that she flummoxes the batters as frequently as she struggles to buy shoes for her little feet.

Even as she trained to bowl under lights with the dew, Poonam kept wondering whether she would get size-5 shoes.

The chirpy girl told The Hindu during India’s home series against South Africa last year that joggers were not much of a problem since she could wear “5.5 size with three pairs of socks”, but when it comes to spikes she cannot get anything even remotely close to her size in India.

“Alyssa Healy (Australia’s wicketkeeper-batter) gave me these spikes. When she was here for the women’s IPL (in Jaipur in May), she just walked up to me and asked what size I wear. Since we have the same size, she gave me a pair of spikes.”

As a result, she has been looking forward to the trip down under.

229,2020/02/21,"India vs. New Zealand | Tough conditions, says Mayank","Credits the Kiwi bowlers for keeping it tight

Mayank Agarwal got his eye in, in tough conditions, but was lured into the trap set by the Kiwis.

He ended up hooking against the wind and was soon walking back. “It [how to make best use of the wind while striking the ball] was something we discussed after I came back. You definitely want to be aware of the conditions,” he said.

Tricky

Still on the wind, Mayank said, “I think it is quite tricky since the wind blows at more than a decent speed. And you just have to make adjustments right there on the field.”

The conditions, he said, were such that a batsman never felt ‘in’.

“It’s not easy, especially on the first day, on this track. I thought they bowled good areas and they kept testing us. They didn’t give us anything loose. As a batsman, you never felt that you were completely ‘in’ because even after lunch it was doing a little bit.”

Pat for Jamieson

Talking about debutant paceman Kyle Jamieson, Mayank said, “I thought he bowled exceedingly well. He hit good areas and he got good bounce. The way he used the new ball was fantastic and he kept probing us. Since the wicket was soft, he was getting the extra kick as well.”

The Indian opener did not have a target total in mind.

He said: “To be honest, as much as we can make and as long as we can bat, it will be good.

231,2020/02/21,India vs. New Zealand | Jamieson’s strikes put India on the back-foot,"Williamson’s attack fields and bowling changes catch batsmen off-guard

There was laughter all around when Kane Williamson chased his cap, blown away by the blustery wind, around the park.

But then, for most part the Kiwi skipper, with attacking field placements and smart bowling changes, had his finger on the pulse of the game at the Basin Reserve on Friday.

Rain stops play

Before rain intervened after tea to end the opening day’s play before a goodly crowd, New Zealand had pushed India, 122 for five, onto the back-foot after winning the toss.

Debutant paceman Kyle Jamieson scalped three with his speed, relentless off-stump line and bounce.

For India, Ajinkya Rahane (38 batting) showed some resistance. He shortened his back-lift and held the bat firm while playing against the wind; a straight-drive off Jamieson was the pick.

The batsmen’s footwork was bound to be tested in these conditions — greenish pitch and cloud cover. When the ball was fuller in length, the batsmen had to get onto the front-foot to get to the sphere’s pitch. And when the ball was short or just short of a good length, back-foot play became essential.

The good length deliveries, hitting the top of off-stump, were the hardest to negotiate. The batsman had to make a judgement call moving either forward or backwards, and not get caught out at the crease.

And the guard had to be aligned with the stance for the batsmen to judge deliveries on or around the off-stump. Apart from a fighting Rahane and, to some extent Mayank Agarwal, the Indian batsmen were found wanting.

Living dangerously

Prithvi Shaw lived dangerously, edging past the slips and flashing an uppish cut to the fence.

He succumbed to a mean delivery from Tim Southee, pitched up, and leaving the batsman, to hit off. Shaw was lured into a drive by the length, leaving his defence open.

At the other end, left-armer Trent Boult, striving for rhythm, got the ball to shape away from the right-hander but could not quite move it into the batsman.

Jamieson was always going to be a threat with his height, lift and line. The Kiwi took out Cheteshwar Pujara with a delivery that straightened and gained in height to find the outside edge.

A contest was surely on when a charged-up Jamieson bounded in against Virat Kohli. Perhaps, the India captain expected the delivery to hit good length and rise around off.

However, Jamieson drew Kohli into a false stroke with a well pitched up delivery rather wide of off-stump. Kohli got the fatal nick and Ross Taylor, making his 100th Test more memorable, snaffled a fine catch in the cordon.

Although beaten by the movement on a few occasions, opener Mayank was sound in defence, stroked in the straightfield for runs.

On a surface such as the one at Basin Reserve, a batsman has to play close to his body, keep the good deliveries away by covering for the swing, look for pushes down the ground rather than go for big drives and essay the cut and the pull if the delivery was lacking in length.

The fourth-wicket pair added 48 before Mayank (34) fell, caught at fine-leg, unable to keep a hook off Boult down. Earlier in the over, Mayank had offered Boult a sharp return catch.

Lost in the crowd

Williamson did not have anybody deep from third-man to long-off and just a mid-wicket and fine-leg on the leg-side. It is possible that amidst the cordon of close catchers, Mayank could have missed the fielder at fine-leg.

232,2020/02/21,No chance of missing match: Kalaria,"Pacer joined his teams immediately after his wedding

When Roosh Kalaria joined his teammates at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel stadium on the eve of Gujarat’s Ranji Trophy match, he got a congratulatory hug from the Gujarat camp. Not for having finished as Gujarat’s highest wicket-taker despite missing the last league game but for having entered into the most important partnership off the field.

With Gujarat assured of a place in the quarterfinals, the team management had given Kalaria a break from the last league round that finished on February 15, since he was to get married in Ahmedabad the very next day.

On Friday, the second day of the match, Kalaria gave a wedding gift that most wives in sports arena would appreciate. He registered his personal best with the bat, with the pace-bowing all-rounder’s third First Class hundred helping Gujarat put one foot in the semifinals.

Extremely important

Was he tempted to skip the quarterfinal and take his newly-wed on a customary holiday? “Never,” pat comes the reply. “It was a quarterfinal and it’s an extremely important match for us. It’s a big stage for us, so celebrations can wait, it was time to join my teammates and keep our quest of regaining the Ranji Trophy alive.”

Kalaria insists Megha, his wife, had no problem with him leaving home for a match hours after they tied the knot. “She is very practical about it and she even told me that I could play the last game too if I wanted to but thankfully I got a break. Since we had already qualified, the management gave me a break so I could attend the pre-wedding ceremonies.”

Spelling change

Kalaria, who has recently changed the spelling of his name from Rush to Roosh to avoid confusion over pronunciation, shot to fame for his left-arm pace bowling during India’s victorious Under-19 World Cup campaign. Since then, he has cemented his place in Gujarat’s Ranji side and has now emerged as the lead pacer. He is happy with his sojourn so far, which has seen him scalping more than 160-plus wickets at less than 24 and scoring 1700-plus runs, including three hundreds, in 52 games.

“It’s been good. I am getting better and better. I am learning how to deal with various situations, how to create opportunities, even with the bat, so today also I thought that if we can raise a big total on the board, we can put them under pressure,” he concluded.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-chance-of-missing-match-kalaria/article30882348.ece
233,2020/02/21,Women’s T20 World Cup: India beat Australia by 17 runs in opening match,"Shafali Verma took India to 41 for no loss in four overs.

Wrist spinner Poonam Yadav returned with a four-wicket haul as India outwitted Australia by 17 runs in the opening match to make a resounding start to the Women’s T20 World Cup on Friday.

Put into bat, India posted a below-par 132 for four in their stipulated 20 overs, riding on Shafali Verma’s 15-ball 29 and an unbeaten 46-ball 49 from Deepti Sharma. The visitors then returned to bowl out the hosts for 115 in 19.5 overs.

Australia were off to a good start to their chase with opener Alyssa Healy (51) making a 35-ball 51 laced with six boundaries and a six to anchor the chase initially. However, Indian spinners led by Poonam triggered a collapse as Australia suddenly slipped to 82 for six.

Poonam (4/19) snapped four wickets, two in successive deliveries of the 12th over to break the backbone of Australia’s chase.

Ashleigh Gardner (34 off 36) tried her bit but didn’t get any support from the other end. Earlier, India frittered away a flying start to post 132 for 4 against defending champions Australia at the Sydney Showground stadium here on Friday.

Sent into bat, opener Shafali blasted 29 off 15 balls studded with five fours and a six but Jess Jonassen (2/24) took two wickets to reduce India to 47 for three. Deepti (49 not out) and Jemimah Rodrigues (26) then added 53 runs to bring up the hundred. India will next take on Bangladesh at Perth on February 24.

Brief Score:

India: 132 for 4 in 20 overs (Deepti Sharma 49, Shafali 29; Jess Jonaseen 2/24).

Australia: 115 in 19.5 overs (Alyssa Healy 51; Poonam Yadav 4/19).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/je3bn3/article30880386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJESHWARIGAYAKWAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-india-beat-australia-by-17-runs/article30880389.ece
234,2020/02/21,Taylor becomes first player to play 100 matches in all three formats,"The ongoing match at the Basin Reserve is his 100th Test.

Veteran New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor on Friday made history when he took the field against India in the opening Test here as he became the first player to play 100 matches in all three formats of the game.

The ongoing match at the Basin Reserve is his 100th Test. Taylor was presented his 100th Test cap by former New Zealand wicketkeeper Ian Smith before the match.

“Really excited about the occasion. It’s very nice for the team and the family to experience something they might never do again,” he said.

“I’ll need some help drinking (the hundred bottles of wine), but they can be stored for a while. It keeps the tradition from Fleming, Brendon (McCullum) and Dan (Daniel Vettori) who all played over a hundred Tests each and hopefully we can celebrate this one with a win.”

The 35-year-old played his 100th T20 International against India last month. He has also played 231 ODIs for New Zealand. The right-handed batsman is already his country’s leading run-scorer in Test and ODI with 7174 and 8570 runs respectively to his name.

In T20 Internationals, he has scored 1909 runs and former captain Brendon McCullum (2140 from 71 matches) and opener Martin Guptill (2536 from 88 matches) are the only two Kiwi players above him on the list.

235,2020/02/21,Rain n’ Ruins: Indian batsmen falter on challenging track,"Friday’s play was called off after tea due to a heavy downpour, the gloomy conditions typifying India’s batting blues.

India’s top-order batsmen performed woefully on a challenging track as the side crawled to 122 for 5 with New Zealand’s towering pacer Kyle Jamieson rattling the visiting big guns on his debut on a rain-hit opening day of the first Test here.

Friday’s play was called off after tea due to a heavy downpour, the gloomy conditions typifying India’s batting blues with only Ajinkya Rahane (38 batting off 122 balls) matching wares when it came to winning the mental battle.

The 6’8” Jamieson could not have asked for a better start, picking up 3 for 38 in 14 overs. Two of these were prized scalps — India’s best long-form batsmen — skipper Virat Kohli (2) and the dogged Cheteshwar Pujara (14 off 42 balls).

He also took a lovely catch in the deep to cap off a day he will remember forever. What Jamieson did wonderfully well was mix up the back-of-the-length stuff with fuller deliveries in between.

He bowled the natural back-of-the-length deliveries that climbed on the batsmen, pegging them back on the backfoot.

He also mixed it up with fuller deliveries when the batsmen were a little unsure of their footwork.

Bowling at barely 130 kmph, he troubled the visitors, making it easier for senior pros Tim Southee (1/27 in 14 overs) and Trent Boult (1/44 in 14 overs) to bowl a more probing line.

Such was the disciplined effort from the Black Caps bowlers that India managed only 43 runs in the second session. Rahane played 122 balls, hitting four boundaries on a heavy outfield. Rishabh Pant was at the other end on 10.

Mayank Agarwal (34 off 84 balls), who did the hard work of surviving the first session, was out after lunch as he tried a pull shot off Boult just after surviving a tough caught-and-bowled chance.

Hanuma Vihari (7) was Jamieson’s third victim when he edged a pitched-up delivery. Once Kane Williamson called it right under the overcast conditions, it was a challenge for the Indian batsmen.

Prithvi Shaw (16 off 18 balls), Pujara and skipper Kohli were back in the pavilion with debutant Jamieson keeping up the pressure.

Young Shaw clipped one off Boult and also hit an uppish square-cut to get two quick boundaries. But loose technique and a tendency to close the bat face was always going to cost him. Southee bowled one that looked like it was angling in and Shaw closed the bat face as the ball moved a shade away after pitching, brushing his pad and then the off-stump, sending him off to the pavillion with a dazed look.

Pujara was ready to show a lot of patience as he started leaving deliveries outside the off-stump. However, Jamieson, coming in as the second change, bowled his back-of-length delivery on the off-and-middle channel.

Pujara had no option but to jab at the rising delivery which kissed the outside edge of his bat and was taken by BJ Watling. Lot of hopes were pinned on skipper Kohli but a smart ploy by Jamieson brought about his downfall.

Kohli was playing Jamieson for the disconcerting bounce that he generated from back of the length but in between, he decided to slip one fuller delivery on the fourth stump channel.

Kohli lunged into the drive and the thick edge was taken by the ‘100-Test man’ Ross Taylor, standing at the first slip, compounding India’s troubles.

Rahane will have a lot of responsibility going into the second day’s play. The under-fire Pant is also defending well which is the need of the hour.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vfsg08/article30880247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21AJINKYA-RAHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rain-n-ruins-indian-batsmen-falter-on-challenging-track/article30880248.ece
236,2020/02/21,"Getting Kohli was massive, last couple of weeks have been surreal: Jamieson","Jamieson, who made an impact on his white ball debut during New Zealand’s 3-0 ODI series win, picked three for 38 on his Test debut.

Getting Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara out on his first day in Test cricket is the stuff dreams are made of and no wonder Kyle Jamieson thinks events of the past couple of weeks have been “surreal”.

Jamieson, who made an impact on his white ball debut during New Zealand’s 3-0 ODI series win, picked three for 38 on his Test debut and also took a fine catch in the deep to leave India struggling at 122 for 5 on the first day of the opening Test.

Is he able to believe what’s happening?

“Not really. It’s still sinking in. The last couple of weeks have been pretty surreal as well. Pretty pleased and from a team perspective we’re in a pretty good position as well,” said the Auckland-born pacer, who is currently tallest, among international cricketers.

“He’s a pretty good batter and such a key to their line-up. To get him early was massive for us. To get a couple (including Pujara) early was where the emotion came from, certainly pretty special,” said Jamieson.

While Kohli’s problems outside the off-stump has been talked about, Jamieson feels that “nitpicking” wasn’t the smartest thing to do.

“He’s scored runs all around the world so to try and nitpick that would be not the smartest. With the assistance of the pitch it was how we would try to make him play and he’s so strong on the stump line. I probably missed a little bit but managed to get the edge which was good.”

The extra bounce that he generates has been his go to strategy since he came into the ODI side.

“I tried to keep it simple the last few weeks. My role is to make them play and with that extra bounce bring them forward. There was a lot of assistance with pace and bounce and swing and seam. That simplifies was my gameplan to try to hit a good area. I stayed pretty relaxed which helped,” he said expecting that second day will also be helpful for the seamers.

The height also helps him to bowl slightly more fuller than other seam bowlers, something that got rid of Pujara and Hanuma Vihari.

“With my height, I can afford to go a fraction fuller, especially out here with the extra bounce. I try to make guys commit to play off the front-foot. In that second spell, the first half of it, there were a lot of balls left on length. How do you commit them on the front-foot (is the key) and if it does swing or seam, you’re in with a chance of bringing the edge in.”

The steeper angle can also make life difficult for the batsmen, he opined.

“It just comes from a steeper angle. I’m not as quick as some of the other guys around the world but still my short ball is a weapon from the height that I can bowl it. I try and use it as much as I can as well as keeping it fuller.”

He was happy that skipper Kane Williamson allowed him to bowl with the wind and it also helped him ease his nerves.

“I found out yesterday (that he was playing) and for me Test cricket has always been the pinnacle. There were a few emotions at the ‘Cap Presentation’ and this morning with the anthems. Also I was pretty lucky to get the wind. Not sure how often I’ll get that, but no complaints.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rpiu0/article30880207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21KYLE-JAMIESON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/getting-kohli-was-massive-last-couple-of-weeks-have-been-surreal-jamieson/article30880208.ece
237,2020/02/21,You never feel set as a batsman on Basin Reserve’s tricky track: Agarwal,"“As a batsman, you never felt that you were completely in because even after lunch, it was doing a little bit.”

Indian opener Mayank Agarwal on Friday said the tricky Basin Reserve wicket was very difficult to negotiate for the visiting batsmen and what made it worse was debutant New Zealand seamer Kyle Jamieson’s “terrific” consistency on the opening day of the first Test here.

Agarwal (34) was the only batsman, apart from vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane (38 batting), who was able to counter the New Zealand seamers as India scored 122 for five in the rain-marred first day.

“I think it is quite tricky since the wind blows at more than a decent speed here. And you just have to make adjustments right there on the field. As a batsman, it’s not easy, especially first day, on this track,” said Agarwal, who survived the first session only to get out after lunch.

“As a batsman, you never felt that you were completely in because even after lunch, it was doing a little bit.”

Agarwal praised Jamieson’s effort, saying he was impressed with the way he mixed it up.

“I thought he (Jamieson) bowled exceedingly well. He hit good areas and he got good bounce. The way he used the new ball was fantastic and he kept testing us bowling in the right areas.

“Since the wicket was soft, he was getting extra kick as well. As a batsman, you have to make that little extra adjustment to the bounce, which can be a little tricky,” explained the opener.

The 29-year-old from Karnataka felt it was a combination of both spongy surface and disconcerting bounce which made life miserable for him and his colleagues.

“It is a combination of both. With that height on this wicket, with the areas and the consistency he showed, it was terrific,” he said referring to the 6“8’ Jamieson.

In the post-lunch session, Agarwal didn’t get strike for some time but he didn’t want to attribute his dismissal to lapse of concentration.

“I don’t really think about all of those things while I am batting. If you are playing well and if you are addressing the ball well, it’s fine. It really doesn’t matter, especially in these conditions. It’s alright to be at the non-striker’s end,” he said with a dash of humour.

Awareness of the conditions is also one aspect that Agarwal wanted to focus on as his mode of dismissal had a lot to do with not being able to gauge the speed of the wind while playing the pull shot.

“That is definitely something we spoke about after I came back. You definitely want to be aware of the conditions while playing.”

Four out of five dismissed Indian batsmen were done in by fuller deliveries but Agarwal did not think that it was the pitched up ones which created trouble.

“No, it’s not like only the fuller deliveries will be effective. If you keep pitching it up, it becomes easier for the batsmen. You have to mix up your areas but you still have to be consistent that you attack at the right time,” he said.

“In an over, you can’t attack with all six deliveries. Bowl three to four balls in good areas and then if you feel that you can get the batsman out, then you attack,” he dissected how New Zealand and, especially Jamieson, operated.

In a roundabout manner, he admitted that there was not much help for the spinners and their job will be to bowl tight lines.

“I didn’t play the spinner but I think as a bowler or as a bowling unit, we have to be consistent and very tight on this wicket,” he said.

He didn’t want to predict a good first innings score that will give confidence to his bowlers but hoped that Ajinkya Rahane can bat as long as possible with Rishabh Pant giving him support.

“To be honest, as many runs that we can make and as long as we can bat, it will be good for us. The way Ajinkya is batting is very good (for us). He is looking solid and I really hope that him and Rishabh can get a big partnership and take us to a big score,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/20rybq/article30880172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21MAYANK-AGARWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/you-never-feel-set-as-a-batsman-on-basin-reserves-tricky-track-agarwal/article30880173.ece
238,2020/02/21,Pragyan Ojha retires from international cricket,"The most memorable moment of his career was receiving his Test cap from Tendulkar.

Veteran Indian left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, who snared 10 wickets during Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell Test in 2013, announced retirement from international and first-class cricket with immediate effect on Friday.

Tendulkar’s final Test in Mumbai against the West Indies in November 2013 also became the last of the 33-year-old Ojha’s career. He went out of favour after that but did not give any reasons for his decision to call it quits now.

In all, he played 24 Tests between 2009 and 2013 in which he took 113 wickets.

Ojha, however, did not offer any reason for his retirement.

“I am writing this letter to tender my formal retirement from international and first-class cricket with immediate effect,” Ojha posted on his Twitter account.

“To be an Indian cricketer and represent the country at the highest level was always a dream I cherished as a youngster.”

“I fall short of words to describe how fortunate I have been to have lived my dream and earned the love and respect of my fellow countrymen,” he added.

From 18 ODIs, he grabbed 21 wickets. He also played six T20 Internationals.

He said the most memorable moment of his career was receiving his Test cap from Tendulkar.

“(It was like) ... accomplishing the feat of taking 100 Test wickets. I hope to continue contributing towards the growth of Indian cricket in every capacity possible,” he said.

In the early stage of his career, Ojha had a fruitful spin partnership with R. Ashwin in Tests, taking 20 wickets in the 2011 home Tests against West Indies and 13 the following year against New Zealand.

“My eventful career has witnessed many ups and downs, Over time, I have realised that the legacy of a sportsperson is not just the outcome of his hard work and dedication, but also the faith and guidance bestowed upon by the association (team management), teammates, coaches, trainers and the fans,” he said.

“I am indebted to the BCCI for giving me this extraordinary opportunity and putting their belief in me.”

“It has been an absolute honour to be associated with the Board, an association that has shaped my professional life and also enriched my personal development.”

Ojha, who competed for erstwhile Deccan Chargers and Mumbai Indians in the IPL, was once reported for a suspect action in 2014. He underwent corrective rehabilitation and was cleared in 2015 but was never a very effective bowler after that, leading to his axing from the national team.

“My journey with the Indian Premier League has also been a memorable one and the purple cap win will always be an indelible memory — a special mention of the teams Deccan Chargers and Mumbai Indians for making me a part of their legacy.

“I am thankful to VVS Laxman for mentoring me like an elder brother, Venkatapathy Raju for being the role model I always looked to emulate, Harbhajan Singh for being a constant adviser and MS Dhoni for providing me with the honourable opportunity to wear the Indian cap.

He also thanked his contemporaries Rohit Sharma and Manoj Tiwary “who have shared many eventful moments with me and my Hyderabad teammate Amol Shinde”.

Ojha played first class and List A matches till 2018.

Ojha’s first-class career spanned more than 13 years between 2005 and 2018 during which he played for Hyderabad and also captained Bihar in the Ranji Trophy.

“I have been a part of the Hyderabad Cricket Association for close to 14 years, and the incredible experience I have gained will have an ever lasting impact.

“I am thankful to Cricket Association of Bengal and Sourav Ganguly for extending their unwavering support during a rough patch of my career. I also appreciate the Bihar Cricket Association for allowing me to lead their team for the short duration that I spent with them.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g7ef28/article30878768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRAGYANOJHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pragyan-ojha-retires-from-international-cricket/article30878769.ece
239,2020/02/21,TNPL | Spartans score big in mega draft,"132 players go under the hammer across eight franchises

A total of 132 players were picked by the eight franchises in the mega player draft for the fifth season of Tamil Nadu Premier League here on Thursday. The tournament starts on June 10 in Coimbatore and goes on till July 12.

Salem Spartans, formerly Tuti Patriots, was the big winner on the day as it picked India all-rounder Vijay Shankar, last season’s top wicket-taker G. Periyasamy and leg-spinner M. Ashwin.

Defending champion Super Gillies scooped last season’s top-scorer N. Jagadeesan and veteran R. Sathish.

Veerans, led by B. Aparajith, drafted his twin B. Indrajith and the exciting Pradosh Ranjan Paul. Dr R.N. Baba, former media manager of the Indian team and the father of the twins, has been appointed CEO of the team.

Abhinav Mukund, the only other international player who was available in the draft was picked by iDream Tirupur Tamizhans.

Promising talent

This year too there are some promising players to look out for, like left-arm pacer V. Goutham, picked by Siechem Madurai Panthers. He is the cousin of TN pace spearhead T. Natarajan.

Another player is all-rounder M. Suganesh, who was part of the champion Indian team in the Physical Disability World Series last year. Suganesh has issues in his left-hand which he injured in a bike accident.

TNCA president Rupa Gurunath, who addressed the gathering, revealed the franchises can add two outstation players for which a separate draft will be held in May after the IPL.

The proposal is awaiting final clearance from the BCCI and the eligibility rules state the player must not be part of any IPL side currently and can play only in two such domestic T20 leagues in a year including his home State’s league if any.

The league, which came under the cloud of spot-fixing allegations last year, has decided to approach the BCCI and have one integrity officer per team like it was in the first two years.

Indian batsmen with the exception of Ajinkya Rahane and Mayank Agarwal struggled as they scored 122 for 5 on the rain-curtailed first day of the opening Test against New Zealand here on Friday.

Thunderstorm followed by rain in the middle of the tea break washed out the final session. India were 122 for 5 then after New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson won the toss and elected to field at the Basin Reserve.

The umpires decided to end the day’s play after an inspection.

Ajinkya Rahane and Rishabh Pant were batting on 38 and 10 respectively.

For New Zealand, Kyle Jamieson took 3 wickets for 38 runs while Tim Southee and Trent Boult got one each.

241,2020/02/21,Ranji Trophy | Parthiv dominates the proceedings,"His unbeaten breezy knock puts Gujarat in a strong position against Goa

Parthiv Patel (118 batting, 156b, 15x4) gave Goa a lesson in batting as the Gujarat captain notched up his 27th First Class hundred in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals on Thursday.

Parthiv’s breezy knock, aided by a 139-run partnership for the third wicket with Bhargav Merai (84, 113b, 12x4) and an unbroken 82-run association for the fifth with Chirag Gandhi (40 batting, 79b, 6x4) meant Gujarat ended day one at 330 for four after electing to bat.

Lacking penetration

With the Goa bowling lacking penetration required in the top tier, despite the red-soil strip at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Stadium indicating signs of turn, the signs are ominous for the visitors.

As soon as captain Amit Verma lost the toss, Goa was chasing the game. Despite pacers Lakshay Garg and Vijesh Prabhudesai bowling tight lines early on, seldom did Gujarat openers Priyank Panchal and Samit Gohel look in trouble.

Gifting their wickets

After taking time to get their eye in, the duo started driving fluently.

However, the openers gifted their wickets either side of lunch. While Panchal drove Vijesh straight to covers, Gohel gave catching practice to Snehal Kauthankar in the slips off left-arm spinner Darshan Misal.

That brought Parthiv in and the veteran dominated the proceedings.

With Goa’s bowlers struggling to settle into rhythm, Parthiv and Merai plundered 125 runs in 25 overs to take Gujarat to 230 for two at tea.

While Merai’s wristwork was impressive, Parthiv’s straight punches off pacers earned applause from the gallery.

Landmark

Parthiv went past 11,000 First Class runs with a cut off left-arm spinner Amulya Pandrekar for his second four, but it was his 14th boundary into the last session — a paddled sweep off Verma — that fetched him his maiden hundred of the season.

Before that, he had lost Merai (caught in the slips while driving a flighted ball) and Manprit Juneja (trapped lbw, playing for the turn) off Verma shortly after tea.

Perhaps Verma held himself too long before coming into the attack in the 47th over.

But with Parthiv dealing with him with panache, even Verma’s leg-breaks wouldn’t have stopped him on the day.

The scores:

Gujara —1st innings: Samit Gohel c Kauthankar b Misal 52, Priyank Panchal c Amonkar b Vijesh 28, Bhargav Merai c Misal b Verma 84, Parthiv Patel (batting) 118, Manprit Juneja lbw b Verma 1, Chirag Gandhi (batting) 40; Extras (nb-5, w-2): 7; Total (for four wkts. in 90 overs): 330

242,2020/02/21,Ranji Trophy | Reliable Majumder to Bengal’s rescue,"His unbeaten century helps the visitor recover from an early collapse against Odisha

The experienced Anustup Majumder hit a magnificent century to fashion Bengal’s astonishing recovery in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal match against Odisha at the DRIEMS ground here on Thursday.

Majumder — who last scored a hundred in Bengal’s previous quarterfinal clash (against Gujarat in Jaipur) in 2017-18 — played the role of a rescuer for the third time this season.

He bailed the team out from a precarious 46 for five and helped it close the opening day at an impressive 308 for six.

Disastrous beginning

It was the worst start for Bengal in a season replete with miraculous recoveries as the Odisha medium-pacers extracted good movement on a familiar surface early in the morning. Bengal skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran, asked to bat, nicked Suryakant Pradhan down the leg in the sixth over. It triggered a mini-collapse as half the team was out in a little over an hour. Koushik Ghosh edged one to the slips, Abhishek Raman was lbw, Arnab Nandi — who fell in debutant seamer Preet Chohan’s first over — was held in the slips and Manoj Tiwary got a beauty. However, the dependable duo of Majumder and Shreevats Goswami showed a lot of character and let the pitch ease out.

Prior to lunch, Majumder cracked three crispy boundaries off Basant and after having the meal, he drove, pulled and cut with more confidence.

Good stands

Majumder (136 batting, 194b, 20x4) had two crucial partnerships of 95 and an unbroken 167 with Shreevats Goswami (34, 75b, 5x4) and Shahbaz Ahmed (82 batting, 154b, 13x4) respectively.

Goswami, dropped on 15, played some wristy shots before being caught behind off his hips in the post-lunch session.

Majumder, who stood outside the crease to negate the movement, and an in-form Shahbaz played strokes all around the park to frustrate Odisha, whose field placements defied logic.

It was a satisfying performance for the 35-year-old, who had thrown away his wicket on 99 against Delhi.

“Am used to such situations now. Good to get some support,” said Majumder.

The scores:

Bengal — 1st innings: Koushik Ghosh c Poddar b Basant 9, Abhimanyu Easwaran c Dhuper b Suryakant 7, Abhishek Raman lbw b Suryakant 1, Arnab Nandi c Shantanu b Chohan 24, Manoj Tiwary lbw b Debabrata 4, Anustup Majumder (batting) 136, Shreevats Goswami c Dhuper b Chohan 34, Shahbaz Ahmed (batting) 82; Extras (lb-7, nb-2, w-2): 11; Total (for six wkts. in 86 overs): 308.

243,2020/02/21,Supreme Court must ensure our safety: Shaheen Bagh protesters,"They seek court help in the wake of move to open road parallel to protest site; Delhi Police admit that the protesters had not blocked the parallel road, but they (the police) had barricaded it to provide security to the protest site.

Shaheen Bagh protesters told the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors on Friday that if the road parallel to the protest site was opened, the court should pass an order ensuring their security.

“When several adjoining roads are open, why are they insisting that we move from this road? This is not the only road connecting Delhi to Noida,” a woman, who is on a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, told senior lawyers Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran on the third day of discussions. “We keep hearing about the inconvenience to people but no one asks about our inconvenience here,” said another protester. The interlocutors called the police to the spot to discuss the matter with the protesters.

The police admitted that the protesters hadn’t blocked the parallel road. An officer told the interlocutors and protesters that they had barricaded the parallel road as well as certain other roads adjoining the area as a security measure for the Shaheen Bagh protest site. “If the road is opened for commuters, we will ensure double security to protesters,” the police officer said.

A woman protester told the mediators: “The government thinks women are uneducated. All of us are educated women who know what we are fighting for. The students from Jamia Millia Islamia, who were teaching us more on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and proposed National Register of Citizens, are being beaten up. If the police could not stop the men who fired at us, how are they claiming that they will protect us if the parallel road is opened?” Another protester said, “We want in writing that if there is a single incident of attack or firing, the police officers, from the SHO to the Police Commissioner, should be shunted out.” Home Minister Amit Shah has said the NRC is not coming soon, so ask him to issue a circular saying they are not bringing the NRC now.”

The crowd agreed with the woman, shouting “We don’t trust Delhi Police”.

Road no. 13A, which connects the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and Okhla underpass, is closed since December 15 last year due to the ongoing protests.

245,2020/02/21,SC interlocutors examine alternative routes,"On second day of dialogue, Shaheen Bagh protesters propose traffic solutions

Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors on Thursday examined alternative routes that could be opened to get around the traffic blockade due to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests at Shaheen Bagh in the Capital. On the second day of dialogue, senior lawyers Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran also requested demonstrators to meet them in smaller groups.

The interlocutors sought to make a distinction between the protesters’ objections to the CAA and the roadblock caused by the sit-in. While multiple protesters questioned why the Supreme Court hadn’t heard the challenge to the CAA yet and pronounced its verdict on the Act’s constitutionality, Mr. Hegde and Ms. Ramachandran assured them that all their arguments would be placed during the hearing in court.

Speaking to thousands of people gathered here from the makeshift stage at the protest site, Ms. Ramachandran explained that the court had also upheld their right to protest. “Sanjay and I don’t want you to get up from Shaheen Bagh. Shaheen Bagh will remain intact. But can we together come up with a solution so that demonstrations continue here in the same space but the public may also use the road, if that is possible?” she said.

The crowd voiced scepticism. “We are being heard here after 60-odd days of blocking this road. If we go somewhere else, we won’t be heard even if we sit for two years,” said one protester, which was met with loud applause.

‘Source of inspiration’

Another protester argued that the demonstrations at Shaheen Bagh were a source of inspiration for anti-CAA protests across the country. Mr. Hegde acknowledged the fact but cautioned that if something bad were to happen, it could affect other ongoing protests nationwide. The interlocutors also argued that had the Supreme Court so desired, it could have directed the government to clear the road; instead it chose to reach out through the mediators.

The commotion during the discussions prompted Ms. Ramachandran to propose that groups of 10-20 women meet the mediators one after another for a more meaningful dialogue, but several protesters didn’t warm up to the idea.

90-minute interaction

On the protesters’ suggestion, the mediators, following the 90-minute interaction, decided to examine alternative routes near Kalindi Kunj and Faridabad that could be opened in order to reduce traffic congestion. Two volunteers from the site accompanied Mr. Hegde and Ms. Ramachandran to show them the options.

248,2020/02/21,Centre has no intention to end Shaheen Bagh stir: Sanjay Singh,"AAP leader criticises Yogi Adityanath’s ‘death wish’ remarks on CAA violence

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged on Thursday that the BJP-led dispensation at the Centre did not have any intention to put an end to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Shaheen Bagh here, saying “it suits the government in pursuing its polarising agenda”.

“The Delhi Police is under the Central government and they do not want to solve the Shaheen Bagh protest. They want to polarise the society as it helps their politics,” AAP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh told The Hindu. He also said that the BJP wanted to divert the attention from real issues such as unemployment and poor financial situation of the country using the CAA.

AAP also hit out at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying he should decide whether he stood for justice or in support of rapists.

“If the Narendra Modi government was serious about ending the Shaheen Bagh protest, it would have followed up on the assurance given by its law minister on taking the path of dialogue and honest engagement with the anti-CAA protesters. It suits the Modi government that the protest continues because it indirectly helps it in pursuing its agenda of polarisation,” Mr. Singh said at Aligarh Muslim University here, earlier in the day.

‘Prejudiced mind’

He alleged that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s statements showed “his prejudiced mind” against the AMU. “The Chief Minister seems to be totally unaware of the AMU’s contribution to the country and his outburst is a result of this ignorance,” Mr. Singh said, adding that the utterances of Mr. Adityanath suggested that “he is losing his mental balance”.

Mr. Adityanath defended the State police on Wednesday over the deaths of anti-CAA protesters, saying they were shot by other rioters and nothing could be done to save someone with a “death wish”. Wrapping up the discussion on the Governor’s address in the State Assembly, he said the role of the police in dealing with rioters during the CAA protests should be appreciated.

Mr. Adityanath said his government supported democratic protests but would maintain law and order by dealing strictly with those indulging in violence.

Mr. Singh alleged that instead of focusing on good governance and improving law and order in the State, Mr. Adityanath was trying to divert the attention of the public. Under Mr. Adityanath, U.P. was becoming notorious for “rapists”, he said.. He denied that his party was strategically tilting towards a “soft Hindutva” policy to present itself as a national alternative to the ruling BJP.

Referring to the AAP government’s policy on the NPR, he said, “We are looking into certain additional information that is being sought this time under the revised format.”

254,2020/02/21,Students’ union protests against rise in LPG price,"They use stoves made of cow dung

The National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) on Thursday organised a protest at Delhi University against the rising price of LPG.

‘Can’t fry pakoras’

The students said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mocked them by asking them to “fry pakoras” if they were unemployed but the irony now is that with the increase in the price of LPG cylinders, people would struggle to do even that.

As a mark of protest, the NSUI resorted to using stoves made out of cow dung and wood.

It said: “The economy is facing a slowdown, unemployment is at an all-time high but the government has responded by putting more pressure on the common man, hitting where it hurts the most by increasing the LPG cylinder price.”

“Mr. Modi told us to earn a living by selling pakoras and tea, then he increased prices of the gas cylinders. It is like he wants to crush us and make our lives even more unaffordable,” the NSUI leaders said.

“Today’s youth does not want to sell pakoras and tea after completing their studies but are forced to do so. Now, even that is not possible due to the increase in price of essential commodities,” the NSUI said, demanding a rollback of the LPG rates.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/amijtk/article30877550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21NSUI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-union-protests-against-rise-in-lpg-price/article30874969.ece
255,2020/02/21,Delhi govt. to hold conference with experts to reduce pollution: Gopal Rai,"Will work to make the fight against the issue a mass movement, says Environment Minister

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said the government will hold a conference on February 27 with experts, NGOs and officials to reduce air pollution in the city.

Word to other States

“After the conference, the government will also write letters to Environment Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab for a meeting in March to find solutions to air pollution,” he said.

He also said the government will work to make the fight against air pollution a mass movement. “If air pollution has to be reduced by one-third, it has to be turned into a mass movement. Only efforts from the part of the government will not help to reduce it. Till everyone participates, it will be difficult to control it,” Mr. Rai at a press conference .

The aim to reduce air pollution to one-third in the next five years was mentioned in the 10-point ‘Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card’ released by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the run-up to the 2020 Delhi Assembly election.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Rai, who was given charge of the Environment Ministry, which was earlier under Minister Kailash Gahlot, chaired a meeting of officials of the Environment Department to understand the situation.

Steps taken in last 5 yrs

“The environmental issues pertaining to Delhi have been a subject of concern. When we formed the AAP government five years ago, we had taken various measures to decrease pollution levels. A lot of work has been done in this sector as a result of which the government has been able to reduce around 25% of pollution levels in the city along with the support of various agencies and the people of Delhi,” Mr. Rai said.

He said an action team must be formulated consisting of people from multiple agencies because all of them play an important role in this sector. “Obtaining real-time data is the first and foremost step in this direction. Second, STPs have been created by the Delhi Jal Board to detect and monitor the causes of pollution of the Yamuna. I will also visit the STP plant setup in Delhi Gate to oversee the treatment process and its functioning,” he said.

40 lakh trees/year

The Minister added that a joint meeting of all the agencies, including civic bodies, Public Works Department, Delhi Development Authority, Resident Welfare Associations, among others will be held on February 28, where discussions will be held on how to spearhead the Delhi government’s plan of plantation of 40 lakh trees in the city in a year.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/q592tl/article30877532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20RAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-to-hold-conference-with-experts-to-reduce-pollution-rai/article30874965.ece

The Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) also expressed shock over the transfer of the judge. “All the members of the Bar cooperated in the protest as the said transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar is a rarest of rare case and the majesty of our institution is at stake,” DHCBA executive member, advocate Naginder Benipal, said.

In an emergent executive committee meeting on Wednesday, the Bar association had requested its members to abstain from work on Thursday as a mark of protest.

The Supreme Court collegium, headed by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, in a meeting on February 12, had recommended transfer of Justice Muralidhar to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Justice Muralidhar was number three in the Delhi High Court, his parent HC.

Detrimental effect

In its resolution, the Bar association said, “Such transfers are not only detrimental to our noble institution but also tend to erode and dislodge the faith of the common litigant in the justice dispensation system. Such transfers also impede free and fair delivery of justice by the Bench.”

Justice Muralidhar was also part of the High Court Bench which had first ordered decriminalisation of IPC Section 377 to give freedom of sexual expression to the LGBT community.

A controversy had erupted in 2018 when Justice Muralidhar had quashed the transit remand order by a trial court and directed release of rights activist Gautam Navlakha from house arrest in the Koregaon Bhima violence case.

Besides Justice Muralidhar, the collegium has also recommended transfer of Bombay HC Judge Ranjit V. More to the Meghalaya HC.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lawyers-stay-away-from-work-over-judges-transfer/article30874954.ece

Rare turtles were rescued by the Delhi police in north Delhi’s Mori Gate area on Wednesday, the police said, adding that they have been handed over to officials of the Delhi zoo.

The police said that they received an information that four live turtles had been found in the MCD Parking in Mori Gate area. A police team reached the spot and found that the turtles were kept in a cardboard box.

Workers of online food delivery platform, Swiggy, have been staging a protest in south Delhi’s Madangir area demanding that their old wages be restored.

A worker who did not wish to be identified said that hundreds of them have been gathering outside the Pushp Vihar office for the last two days. Explaining the problem, they said, earlier, they used to get ₹40 per delivery which was subsequently reduced to ₹35.

“However, the company is hiring new people who are paid ₹15 per order. Most of the orders now directly go to them and not us. They have also reduced our extra night charges from ₹20 to ₹10,” he said.

Another worker complained that they have no grievance redressal mechanism in the company. “Who should we speak to in case if there is a problem? If we meet with an accident or we are robbed, there is no one we can contact because everything is online,” he said.

The protesters demanded that the older rates (₹35) be restored for every worker.

260,2020/02/21,Financier-cum-property dealer found dead with 37 bullet wounds,"Police suspect gang war; kin say he was getting extortion calls

A financier-cum-property dealer was shot dead in Rohini’s Kanjhawala on Wednesday night. While his family claimed that he was killed for not paying the extortion money, police suspect it to be a case of gang rivalry.

The victim, Anchil Singh alias Pawan (26), is a resident of Karala village.

Jailed for 6 months

Anchil had an attempt-to-murder case registered against him in April 2019 and was lodged in jail for around six months. He was released on bail in December, his family said.

On Wednesday, the victim’s brother, Sachin (29), said he spoke to Anchil at 8.08 p.m., about half-an-hour before the incident. “I asked him to come home on time. He said he would reach in 15-20 minutes. At 8.44 p.m., I called him again and someone else picked up the phone and told me that my brother had been shot dead,” Mr. Sachin said.

Mr. Sachin and other family members rushed to the spot which was about 2 km from their residence. On reaching there, they spotted his SUV with bullet holes and Anchil was lying dead on the driver’s seat.

‘Over 50 rounds fired’

“More than 50 rounds were fired by the men who had arrived in cars. The doctor who conducted the autopsy told us that there were 37 bullet wounds in his body,” Anchil’s father Rajbir Singh, who runs a dairy shop, said. No passer-by dared to come to his rescue, but some recorded videos later, he said.

The family said that Anchil had been getting “extortion and threat calls” ever since he was released from jail and the latest call was received five days ago. “He had been getting calls from a person who works for a man who is lodged in the jail. The caller demanded ₹50,000-₹1 lakh. My brother had a verbal spat with the caller and he had been holding grudges against him,” Mr. Sachin said.

Mr. Rajbir said that cases of extortion by gangsters are a rampant issue in their village and nearby areas. “There are four-five of them who hold anyone at gunpoint and demand money. The biggest concern is that gangsters are operating even from jails,” he said.

He also said that about a week ago, they were informed by an acquaintance that Anchil was going to be targeted. The victim was taking precautions throughout the week and was constantly changing cars to make sure nobody was aware of his whereabouts, Mr. Rajbir said, adding that he had submitted an application in 2014 at the local police station that he and his family members were scared for their lives.

A senior police officer said that the murder was a result of a “gang war”. “One Deepak alias Teetar is suspected to be behind the mu rder. He is currently lodged in jail. Two sharpshooters from his gang have been identified and raids are being conducted to nab the accused,” the officer said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/financier-cum-property-dealer-found-dead-with-37-bullet-wounds/article30874933.ece
261,2020/02/21,Many detained during demonstrations called by Jamia Coordination Committee at U.P. Bhavan,"They were protesting against imposition of ‘draconian’ laws in State without permission: police

Nearly 100 people were detained by the police for holding demonstrations at Uttar Pradesh Bhavan at Chanakyapuri against the “imposition of draconian laws” in the State.

The demonstrations called by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) were being carried out despite not having received permission, as a consequence of which up to 65 men and 34 women were detained outside U.P. Bhavan, the police said. All the students who were taken to Mandir Marg police station were released by the evening, the JCC said.

Demonstrators demanded the release of Khafell Khan who has been booked under the National Security Act. The protest, meant to be a “gherao” was against various preventive detention laws as well as sedition charges being imposed on political and social activists across U.P.

“The U.P. Chief Minister continues to spread terror in the State openly. Innocent people are being thrown into jails. They are being slapped with draconian laws, such as UAPA, NSA and others. We demand that all political prisoners be released without delay. When the State turns rogue, who is going to protect the rights of the citizens?” a JCC representative said.

Students group KYS, which also participated in the protests, in a statement, attacked the U.P. government, saying that it had a “...complete disregard for people’s civil liberties and rights...” highlighting alleged action against the anti-CAA protesters. The group also stated that it condemned the CAA, the proposed NRC and the atrocities allegedly committed by the State government against protesters.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xm0pps/article30874896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21UPBHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/many-detained-during-protest-at-up-bhavan/article30874897.ece

263,2020/02/21,New passenger terminal station is on track,"Work to be taken up in two phases on the estimated ₹230-crore Charlapalli project

Indian Railways and South Central Railway (SCR) seem to have decided to go ahead with construction of the fourth passenger terminal at Charlapalli on the 50 acres of land owned by the organisation, without waiting for the State government to provide the additional 200 acres.

Railway Minister Piyush Goyal laying the foundation stone for the estimated ₹230-crore fourth major passenger terminal for the twin cities is a clear indicator and tenders too have been finalised to an extent of ₹117.25 crore to take up works in two phases.

Considering the clogged Secunderabad, Kacheguda and Nampally stations, the new terminal was proposed five years ago but it was only last year that the Railway Board cleared the project and, due to the limited land availability, the zonal railway decided to curtail the grand plans of having 10 platforms to a more realistic six platforms besides four pit-lines for maintenance, said senior officials.

This could be sufficient for MMTS trains only whenever phase II works are completed as the station lies on the route towards Ghatkesar and towards Yadadri, another 30 km. But it again depends on availability of funds, considering that the Minister himself had mentioned the ₹450 crore pending from the TS government for expediting the work.

Hence, senior officials indicate that Charlapalli, 12.48 km from Secunderabad, could become the premier terminal station for the proposed private trains as the Railway Board is planning to have daily trains towards Panvel, Shalimar, Chennai, Varanasi and Srikakulam. Future expansion could be made when additional land is available, they said.

The station is just 8 km from the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and is convenient for embarking or disembarking of passengers instead of moving into the city and commuting in the traffic to reach home.

The SCR is planning to take up works in two phases: in the first phase of ₹54.58 crore, two high level platforms, water and sewage provisions, effluent treatment plant, etc.; in the second phase of ₹62.67 crore, station building, approach roads, a couple of foot-overbridges, five escalators, nine lifts, pit lanes, laundry and so on are to be done. These works are to take up to two years, according to senior officials.

The Railways had also sought land near Hi-Tec City/Vattinagulapally for another terminal a decade ago, which did not fructify, and it had spent ₹30 crore to develop the Lingampally station moving some trains as terminal point to de-congest the Secunderabad station.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/6l6t95/article30882983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy22Image-of-proposed-Cherlapalli-railway-terminal-being-built,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fourth-passenger-terminal-station-is-on-track/article30882984.ece
264,2020/02/21,HC awards seven-year jail to three in dowry death case,"Trial court verdict acquitting them set aside

Setting aside a lower court’s judgment that had acquitted three accused in a dowry death case in Medak, the Telangana High Court sentenced them to seven-year rigorous imprisonment.

Delivering the verdict in an appeal filed by the victim’s family, a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy imposed a fine of ₹20,000 each on them. The victim Bhagyalaxmi’s husband, D. Santhosh, and in-laws D. Balamani and D. Narsimulu were also directed to pay a compensation of ₹50,000 to the victim’s mother.

Bhagyalaxmi and Santhosh got married on May 16, 2010, in Narsapur of Medak. Her family received a phone call on September 15, 2011, stating that she had died of self-immolation. Her family lodged a complaint with the Narsapur police, alleging that Santhosh and the in-laws had been demanding additional dowry. The harassment eventually drove her to suicide, they charged.

A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 304-B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against them. After the trial, the Medak III Additional District and Sessions Judge acquitted the three persons. The victim’s family filed an appeal in the HC, challenging the trial court verdict.

Pronouncing the judgment in the appeal petition, the bench said the prosecution successfully established the ingredients required to make out an offence under Section 304-B in the case. Once prosecution established factual foundation, the trial court was required to invoke the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act. In Bhagyalaxmi’s case, the trial court had failed to do so, the bench said.

The trial court had observed that there was no evidence to confirm the dowry demand. However, testimonies by the witnesses proved that there had been dowry demand. By ignoring the evidence available in the form of statements of witnesses, the trial court had erred in not applying the well settled principles for assessing the evidence in a proper perspective, the judgment said.

Counsel for the accused contended that since the dowry demand had been made a month before the death and hence it was not “soon before the death”. The bench said the Supreme Court had observed in a judgment that the phrase ‘soon before her death’ was, no doubt, an elastic expression. It could refer to a period either immediately before her death or within a few days or even a few weeks before it.

The victim’s relatives stated that dowry demand had been made a month before her death. “Therefore, even the element of ‘soon before the death’ exists in Bhagyalaxmi’s case,” the judgment said. The bench noted that the trial court judgment seemed to have been persuaded by minor contradictions in the testimonies of witnesses with regard to the amount of dowry paid at the time of marriage.

The trial court should have realised that minor contradictions with regard to ‘the value of an article” were part of human nature. Such contradictions were so minor that they could never be fatal to the case of the prosecution, the bench said in its judgment.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-awards-seven-year-jail-to-three-in-dowry-death-case/article30882409.ece
265,2020/02/21,Thousands throng Vemulawada on Shivaratri,"Endowments Minister offers silk vastrams to the presiding deities

Chants of ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, ‘Hara Hara Mahadeva’, ‘Shambo Shankara’ reverberated at the ancient Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy devasthanam on the occasion of Mahashivaratri festival in Vemulawada of Rajanna-Sircilla district on Friday.

The Mahashivarathri celebrations started on a grand note at the temple with thousands of devotees forming serpentine queues for the darshan of the presiding deities since the early hours of Friday. The devotees took a holy dip in the Dharmagundam (temple tank) before offering prayers.

In view of heavy rush of pilgrims, the devasthanam authorities had cancelled the ‘arjitha seva’ rituals and allowed only ‘maha laghu’ darshan. Serpentine queues were formed for the traditional ‘kode mokku’ (tying of an ox) ritual at the temple shrine.

The temple authorities had made all arrangements for the devotees in the queue lines by providing drinking water and distributing buttermilk sachets.

As is a ritual, the TTD presented silk vastrams to the Vemulawada deities on Friday. TTD deputy EO Harindranath presented the silk vastrams bought from Tirumala. Endowments Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy and Minister for Health Eatala Rajender presented silk vastrams separately on behalf of the government to the presiding deities and offered prayers. Minister for Finance T Harish Rao visited the temple in the evening and offered prayers.

Arrangements made

Vemulawada Legislator Ch. Ramesh Babu, Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar, Endowments Commissioner Anil Kumar and others were overseeing the arrangements at the temple and took all measures to avoid inconvenience to the pilgrims. MLC Naradasu Laxman Rao, MLA Rasamayi Balakishan, ZP chairperson Aruna, TSCAB chairman K. Ravinder Rao and others also visited the temple and offered prayers. The police under the supervision of SP Rahul Hegde made unprecedented security arrangements by deploying additional forces and regulating the pilgrims in the queue lines.

The non-stop cultural programme ‘Shivaarchana’ was a special attraction for the entertainment of the pilgrims with devotional and cultural programmes highlighting the importance of Mahashivaratri and Lord Shiva.

Other temples

Similarly, the pilgrims rush had swelled at Sri Kaleshwara Muktheeshwara Swamy devasthanam in Kaleshwaram of Mahadevpur mandal in Jayashankar-Bhupalapalli district along the shores of river Godavari and Pranahita. There was heavy pilgrims rush at Kotilingala temple shrine in Velgatoor mandal in Jagtial district also.

The University of Hyderabad has fined three students ₹5,000 each for organising a ‘Shaheen Bagh Night’ event against the Citizenship Amendment Act on the campus after 9 p.m. in violation of varsity regulations.

The students union has condemned the move.

The fine was imposed through an a university order dated February 18 as the students organised the event on January 31 after 9 p.m. at North Shopping Complex and also allegedly defaced the walls at the site, university sources said.

“The students are sternly warned to be cautious and focus on their studies in future. Recurrence of such incidents or indulging in any act of indiscipline would have serious repercussions on their academic career with strong disciplinary action,” the order said.

Condemning the varsity action, the students union in a statement said the order or circular was arbitrary and they would not follow it and demanded that the fine imposed be withdrawn unconditionally.

“HCUSU (Hyderabad Central University Students Union) also assures the student community that we will not bow down to the administration at any cost and will take any and every possible step to safeguard the democratic interests of the students,” the note said.

A spokesperson of the University said the institution recognises the right of recognised student bodies to organise meetings or protests, in designated spaces without disrupting normal academic, administrative and residential life of a large number of teaching and non-teaching staff and their families who live on the campus.

“It is in that context that three students were fined for violating standing regulations of the University that no meetings and protests would be permittedin public spaces of the campus after 9 p.m.,” the varsity official said.

The event which began at 9 p.m. went on till 2.30 a.m..

There was also photographic and video evidence of these students “blatantly refusing” to abide by the regulations on defacing of campus structures, the official said.

He hoped that all students will abide by some basic institutional norms and make the campus a space for healthy, democratic debates and discussions.

267,2020/02/21,"After Telangana, Insurance Medical Services fraud unearthed in Andhra Pradesh","Vigilance and Enforcement sleuths name former Minister, three IMS Directors

After Telangana, it is the turn of Andhra Pradesh to unearth fraud of hundreds of crores of rupees in purchase of drugs, medical equipment, surgical tools and other items by the Director of Insurance Medical Services (IMS).

Sleuths of AP’s Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E) wing stumbled upon evidence suggesting that prima facie at least ₹151.40 crore fraud was committed by the IMS officials and staff in that State.

In a report sent to the State government, the V&E officials stated that embezzlement of funds was committed during the stint of three Directors of IMS during the financial years 2014-15 and 2018-19.

In Telangana’s case, a single Director was accused of playing a key role in misappropriation of funds and eventually landed behind the bars along with other employees and civilians.

In Andhra Pradesh however, the V&E officers found that three Directors of IMS were responsible for purchase of medicines, equipments and other items in violation of procedures and guidelines.

More importantly, they gathered evidence that a former Minister of AP had ensured that a work order of providing Toll Free Services and ECG services be given to a company on nomination basis. Inquiries by the investigators indicated that while the company was paid ₹480 for one ECG, in other hospitals -- it was available for ₹200.

Interestingly, the company claimed bills by providing call logs which were traced to Internet Protocol addresses in Telangana. Close to ₹8 crore was paid to this company in violation of procedures.

Sources said the government is likely to pass on the details dug out by the V&E Department to either the Anti-Corruption Bureau or the Crime Investigation Department for registering criminal cases against the three Directors, former Minister, employees of IMS and private persons.

V&E authorities deduced that the total budget allocation for drugs and medicines during the tenure of three Directors was ₹293.51 crore.

“But they purchased drugs and medicines worth ₹698.36 crore. The differential budget amount is ₹404.85 crore,” an officer associated with the inquiry, unwilling to be named, said.

During inspections, a pharmacist and a senior assistant of the Directorate of IMS admitted to the officials that they fabricated quotations in connivance with the non-rate contract firms.

Medical equipment, surgical items, furniture, computers and other articles, all worth ₹2.32 crore, were found lying without usage for past one year in ESI hospitals and dispensaries.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/business/a6yb71/article29625658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bank-frauds,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/insurance-medical-services-fraud-unearthed-in-ap/article30874551.ece

Ms. Thomas was speaking at the Society for Cyberabad Security Council’s She M Power Women’s Conclave and Awards.

She opined that both men and women should be equal partners at home and work. Women, she said, face challenges as they have to multi-task and juggle work and responsibilities, which is akin to riding a uni-cycle.

269,2020/02/21,Hyderabad Metro Rail e-vehicles go to DMRC,"No clear policy directive, depts firm on treating e-mobility like any other transport

Hyderabad’s loss is Delhi’s gain! The still-born electric mobility policy and dithering by various departments led to the city-based firm to move its fleet of electric autorickshaws to provide the first and last mile connectivity to passengers of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) instead of the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR).

HMR had announced, a few months ago, that it would be facilitating the launch of electric vehicles, including autos from Metro stations, to provide pollution-free transport to passengers.

City firm ETO Motors had announced, earlier this week, that it would be launching 100 e-rickshaws across four DMRC stations leaving the Metro rail authorities here high and dry as they have been unable to convince the related departments about the necessity of having such a green transport.

With launch of Metro rail services across all the three corridors, it is being expected that it is just a matter of time that five lakh passengers would be commuting daily but the lack of efficient and pollution-free connectivity from and to the Metro stations to residential colonies and offices is being acutely felt.

“After waiting in vain for RTC to provide the connectivity to our stations, we allowed private operators to run services through bikes and vans in a low profile manner charging nominal fees without treading on toes of regulatory authorities. We wanted to replace them gradually with 120 electric vehicles to begin with and expand services with better frequency,” explained senior officials, unwilling to be quoted as they are not authorised.

With no clear policy directive and related departments firm on treating e-mobility like any other transport, the few firms ready to roll out their eco-friendly vehicles have decided to shift cities. This development also raises doubts about the viability of having electric vehicle charging facilities launched with fanfare under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode in select stations with six to eight months of free charging.

First EV charging facility was opened at Miyapur depot while battery charging- swapping stations were established in 16 Metro stations including a Finnish firm last year and the number was supposed to have been doubled by now. “The response has been very poor and we were hoping introduction of e-vehicles would give it a fillip,” rue senior officials.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eie8ya/article30874507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21ELECTRICVEHICLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hmr-e-vehicles-go-to-dmrc/article30874485.ece

275,2020/02/21,Shades of a colour,"Jaipur gharana singers Arun Dravid and Dinkar Panshikar demonstrated earlier this month that being rooted in a specific style does not preclude change and innovation says Sumana Ramanan

In the second phase of her musical career, Arun Dravid’s guru, Kishori Amonkar, rebelled against some basic tenets of the Jaipur gharana, in which she had trained since childhood. Among other things, she de-emphasised the specific rhythmic structure that elaborations follow in the Jaipur style of Hindustani classical vocal music.

Dinkar Panshikar’s teacher, Nivruttibua Sarnaik, although not as well known as Amonkar, was also considered by many in the Jaipur gharana as a maverick. But in contrast with Amonkar, Sarnaik, who was also a tabla player, infused the Jaipur vocal style with even more complicated rhythmic patterns borrowed from the percussion instrument’s repertoire.

Excellent exponents

Dravid, 76, and Panshikar, 84, are today probably the oldest stalwarts of the Jaipur gharana, founded by Alladiya Khan (1855-1946). To the detriment of music lovers, they have not been as widely presented and heard as they should have been. This fact, in addition to their musical depth and close association with gurus who were contrasting iconoclasts made them excellent choices for representing the Jaipur gharana in a session involving performances and interviews.

Organised by the Suranjan Trust, the session took place at the Sahayog Mandir in Thane (West) on February 1. Each singer performed two ragas and then answered a set of questions. The programme attracted about a hundred people, including about half a dozen musicians and many music students.

It is the second programme in the organisation’s gharana series. The first one, which took place a year earlier, focused on the Gwalior gharana, showcasing Sharad Sathe and Kedar Bodas. The timing of that session was fortunate, because Sathe, who learnt for more than 30 years from the Gwalior giant Sharadchandra Arolkar and was a storehouse of knowledge, passed away three months later, in his mid-80s.

Standing apart

The Jaipur singers’ twin performances beautifully brought out the commonalities in their styles as well as elements that set them apart. At a time when even students of music, let alone listeners, do not fully appreciate the importance of gharana-based music, these vocalists demonstrated that one could adhere to a tradition’s core principles yet make it more capacious and individualistic.

“Music can be considered classical only insofar as it follows the discipline of a particular gharana,” said Panshikar, in the interview in Marathi that followed his recital. “One must learn in one gharana for a long time before exploring other styles.”

The morning began with Dravid rendering a wonderful Husseini Todi, a rare and complex raga. He sang it, not in the vilambit (slow) sixteen-beat Teen Taal that is standard in Jaipur renditions, but in the less common fourteen-beat Ada Chautaal. He followed this with a gem of a Sukhiya Bilawal, from the Jaipur gharana’s treasury of rare ragas. Weighty and intricate, his elaborations showed the mark of Amonkar’s first, traditional phase, as well as the influence of her mother and guru, Mogubai Kurdikar, who often taught Dravid when Amonkar was on tour.

Mogubai’s influence is natural because Dravid became fascinated with her music as a school boy, especially admiring the power of her gamak taans. He initially wanted to learn from her, but because she already had her hands full with other students and domestic responsibilities, she directed him to her daughter.

Panshikar’s two renditions, of Nat Bhairav and Yamani Bilawal, were rich and mellifluous. Panshikar has a more dramatic musical expression than Dravid, using modulations in volume to enhance his renditions, in a manner that is more commonly seen with Kirana gharana singers. As expected, he rendered some rhythmically patterned taans—those superfast passages of notes—pioneered by his guru.

Sculpting a raga

The interviews, of about half an hour each, were just the right length. Dravid, who spoke first, listed the distinguishing features of the Jaipur gharana. Melody and rhythm are closely bound; the “aakaar”, or open-throated “aa” is a fundamental technique of elaboration, although other gharanas also use it; singers sculpt a raga by moving slowly across the octave; they create typical patterns by hitting each note of a phrase from the note above.

Both musicians said an important distinguishing mark of a gharana was the way in which the words of a composition are distributed across the rhythmic cycle, or avartan. Panshikar said the gharana frowned upon the use of sargams and teehais (melodic patterns that are repeated three times before arriving at the sam, or first beat).

While they emphasised the importance of being rooted in a gharana, they spoke against rigidity and dogmatism. “Change is inevitable,” said Panshikar. “One must move with the times. You have to make audiences enjoy your music.”

“In every gharana, music is sung in a distinct and beautiful manner,” said Dravid. “From the viewpoint of singers and listeners, this offers variety. Moreover, it is perfectly fine to incorporate elements of other gharanas into your music.”

Dravid cited the example of Bhimsen Joshi, who absorbed some Jaipur elements into his Kirana style, while Panshikar revealed that Nivruttibua had had a stint with the Kirana gharana’s Sawai Gandharva before training under the Jaipur gharana’s founder, Alladiya Khan.

Music as a priority

The interviews gave the audience not just insights into the Jaipur gharana, but also a glimpse of the musicians’ personalities and values. Asked how he had juggled music with a high-flying corporate career, Dravid said one needed “a fire in the belly”, because his pursuit of music has clearly called for enormous discipline and sacrifice. “I did not go to the movies and parties. I did not socialise,” he said.

Thoughtfully and tastefully conducted, the roughly three-hour programme yielded high-quality music and insights. The acoustics, which are often a problem, were also good. The organisers should, however, think about running the proceedings in Hindi instead of Marathi, especially because they videotape the sessions and upload them on YouTube. A large proportion of Hindustani music listeners, students and musicians, after all, are not native Marathi-speakers, but will benefit from the wisdom of some our best-trained musicians.

276,2020/02/21,Guess who is talking to Seema Golchha,"Ventriloquist Seema Golchha from Nepal brings over some furry puppet friends for her debut show in Chennai

Seema Golchha’s tryst with ventriloquism came well after marriage and motherhood. “I was married off right after I graduated, and Nepal replaced Mumbai as my home,” she says. After several years, she joined the Everest Toastmasters Club, an international non-profit organisation that teaches public speaking and leadership skills. As part of club activities, she put on small shows, first doing stand-up comedy and then trying her hand at puppets, in 2011. This set her on the path from stage-shy housewife to boisterous performer. This evening, she brings those skills to Chennai for a set at Peekaboo Patterns, a retail store for children’s decor and toys.

Something for everyone

An in-house comic at Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai, Golchha has performed regularly back home in Nepal, as well as on international platforms in Thailand and USA — even sharing the stage with Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. For her maiden performance in the city, the self-christened “entrepunner” plans to charm a young audience with her funny puppets, and original, family-friendly content.

While shows for adults feature her trusty blue sidekick, the furry and irreverent Jack Denials, children’s events call for a tribe of smaller puppets. Golchha concedes that performing for kids is particularly challenging, as she has to create content and engage a host of different age groups, from three to 18. Most importantly, she does not want to come off as preachy. “I don’t really tell stories or give life lessons or morals,” she says firmly. “My intention is purely to entertain the kids and hold their attention and interest for an hour.” And so the sessions are highly interactive, filled with jokes, quizzes and games.

In the beginning

Looking back to when she started, Golchha says, “I had to teach myself everything.” Despite this lack of experience, she had plenty of practice. “I lived in a joint family, and I’d often try out my material on the children at home,” she says. She followed the work of her favourite artistes, ventriloquists Nina Conti and Paul Zerdin, and traveled to the US to watch the world-renowned Jeff Dunham perform. Much self-guided learning later, she found her voice – and her puppets’. Particularly challenging was the absence of audience feedback, as it was uncharted territory for them. “People would ask me where the puppet’s voice came from, or if it was pre-recorded,” she recalls.

When she started performing in Kathmandu, Golchha had to arrange the venue and time, and performances were few and far between. Five years later, she got a gig in an all-women comedy show. And in 2017, her professional career took off, taking her to India and making her a regular at the Canvas Laugh Club in both Gurgaon and Mumbai. Now a TEDx speaker, she conducts improv workshops in Nepal for local comics. Golchha knows she is doing what she was meant to: “Comedy is my superpower!”

Seema Golchha will perform at Peekaboo Patterns on February 22, from 4 pm to 6 pm.

277,2020/02/21,Music between two cultures,"Prof. Ned McGowan is an American composer and flautist based in Amsterdam. His works explore Indian forms from a European perspective

Prof. Ned McGowan of HKU University of The Arts Utrecht, Netherlands, presented a lecdem at the golden jubilee celebrations of the Ganakala Parishath. It was titled, Bridges between Carnatic and European Classical Music.

Prof. Ned McGowan is an American composer and flautist based in Amsterdam. He holds degrees in composition from the Royal Conservatory Den Haag and in Flute from Cleveland Institute of Music and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He is a composer, teacher, flautist, improviser and curator. His specialty is the contrabass flute.

Carnatic music is a huge influence on Prof. Ned. Over the past decade he has collaborated and performed regularly in India and Europe with many renowned musicians. His works exploring Indian forms from a European perspective include Chamundi Hill, for flute and harp, Alap for voice and ensemble, Stone Soup for Jazz ensemble, and Three Amsterdam Scenes for voice, viola and keyboards.

Prof. McGowan began his lec-dem by saying “Carnatic music is really very special to my heart. My first experience of hearing Carnatic music was through the late singer Jahnavi Jayaprakash 21 years ago when she came to Amsterdam. When I heard her I was so enamoured by the music that I became very keen to learn it. In the past 20 years I have visited the Mysore region about 25 times. I collaborate and perform regularly with Mysore Manjunath, Suma Sudhindra, Anoor Ananthkrishna Sharma, B.C. Manjunath and others. I studied the basics of Carnatic flute with guru M.K. Pranesh. I have had the good fortune to consult T. S. Satyavathi, which proved to be very meaningful for me.

“I will present two pieces which are western/European pieces, and although they sound like new music when I play them in Europe, I am using Carnatic elements in the pieces which should allow them to be more easily accepted here.”

Prof. McGowan played a piece called ‘Cleveland Times’ for flute and piano, accompanied by Vinod Shyam on mridangam. He played the piece two times - first time in the way he plays it in Europe with only piano and then again a second time with the mridangam to show the Carnatic elements that he used. The second was a vocal duet which Prof. McGowan had composed last year. It is called Cycle Games (1a) – with vocal percussion.

Excerpts from an interview -

Tell us about yourself as a musician, as a teacher and as a composer.

In Netherlands I have taught Advanced Rhythm and Pulse, based on the Carnatic approach to rhythm for the past 20 years, also in workshops around the world. I teach ‘thakadhimi’, ‘thakadhinathom’ system to westerners as a basic system for rhythm to have an approach to perform and to analyze other rhythms. I use the Carnatic system because it is great - we don’t have a system like that and I always share that with my students in the West.

I am also the founder of the International Rhythm Course in Netherlands started last summer. This summer we will have a course and Mysore Manjunath and B.C. Manjunath will be teaching rhythm lessons. Next year we are looking into bringing those students to India to continue the study at the source.

One main musical goal of mine is to learn the great musical possibilities in Carnatic music and to explore how to use them in my music. I am not a Carnatic musician or teacher, but since I have learnt few important things - like gamaka, raga etc, I understand it from a Western perspective. The question of why I learn and study is a big question; I feel it has a lot of great truths of music. Carnatic music is a great source of ideas and inspiration. It has a wonderful approach to rhythm, to melody, to raga, to form, the combinations, the improvisations. For me, they are the musical possibilities. I translate them into my music.

Tell us about the contrabass flute, it’s history and it’s features and qualities.

In the 70s and 80s contrabass flutes began to be built in Japan and The Netherlands, largely for use in flute ensembles around the world. As the design greatly developed since those early days, and more builders around the world appeared, the contrabass flute has come into its own as a unique instrument to enjoy and explore. Next to a general improvement in standard flute components such as the embouchure, keyworks, scale and the shape of the tubing (combination of conical and cylindrical tubes) recent improvements have seen a larger range, open holes and quarter tone additions. I believe that the instrument has developed , and it has been exciting for me to witness and be a part of its refinement.”

I have been playing the contrabass flute for around 25 years and have come to love its singing, velvety middle octave and fat low bass tones. Despite its large size it is still agile as the normal soprano flute, and has world of new possibilities to express.

Can you please talk about the area of your research ?

My Ph.D. research is on speed in music - fast, medium, slow all the variations. I am trying to understand how it work. From the musical stand point as I am doing artistic research. I ask the question about what is the identity of speed and I answer the possibilities in music, which is different from scientific research where you test people in controlled studies. It is very interesting to read neuro -biological literature about how the brain keeps track of the time. I am looking at few theories about that. They inspire me to do music using that knowledge. Though our brains are similar and work in a similar way with the same mechanism, each person may have a different experience of speed of time.

The world’s first iPad concerto was designed by you – please tell us about it.

I was commissioned by Concert Hall in The Netherlands called the Doelen to compose a concerto with orchestra. I chose to do an iPad concerto - and it has been played ten times already at various venues around the world and achieved much appreciation.

As an artiste wearing many hats, I choose where to wear which hat. When in India, I wear the Indian crossover Western hat, and when I go and play hardcore contemporary music in the West it is a different hat.

This is the interesting thing about mixing ideas from different cultures, ideas of authenticity, context - everything is very interesting.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/s4ouwy/article30879265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bgfrned1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/music-between-two-cultures/article30879270.ece
278,2020/02/21,This Chennai event is a celebration of hiphop,"The Sound Of Revolution, which has been providing a stage for the genre in Chennai for years, is back with its latest edition

Beatboxers. Rappers. B-boys and B-girls. They will all be gathering at one stage this weekend, not only from Chennai but from all across the State. The eighth edition of The Sound of Revolution, a celebration of hiphop culture, will be taking place at Grand Mall this weekend.

There is a lot to look forward to: 50 rap artistes from India (mainly Chennai), Malaysia, Sri Lanka and France will be showing off their talent, as will 35 B-boys and at least four beatboxing squads. “The B-boying championship will be in the form of battles. B-girls will have separate battles,” informs MC Sanna, who is organising the event on behalf of Rap Machines by ADK. Rap Machines and Tupakeys are co-organising the event.

Says Nigavithran K, one of the rappers who will be performing, “We are all underground rappers here. The hiphop scene in Chennai has grown a lot in the past year alone. It will be interesting to see what happens.”

There is certainly a lot to look forward to; the festival has come a long way from its simple 2013 beginnings. MC Sanna reminisces, “That year, we held the event at a small jamming pad in Vadapalani. We had about five artistes, and 15 or 30 people in the audience. Now, our participants number at around 150, and last year’s edition at Alliance Francaise had an audience of more than 200 people.”

Some of the acts to look forward to are MC Sanna and Jack Styles (Rap Machines), Therukural, MC Bhaashi and Tupakeys. Others set to take to stage include MC Valluvar, Asal Kolar, Team Dynamix, Voltage B, Caff3ine, Raka Vee, Underdogz, Peace, Nanda Thara Local Pasanga, Elevated Pride and North Chennai Hiphop. There are also some DJs in the mix, including DJ Flame, DJ Sam Joe and DJ Ken. Another major highlight is a performance by ADK or Aaryan Dinesh Kanagratanam, a Sri Lankan hiphop artiste who has worked with musical greats of our time, such as AR Rahman.

The Sound of Revolution will be held on the roof of Grand Mall, Velachery, on February 22 from 9 am onwards.

281,2020/02/21,MVD launches campaign to tackle juvenile driving,"‘Operation Chunkz’ started amidst growing incidents of accidents involving students

A six-month-long innovative drive against under-age driving by the Motor Vehicles Department in Perumbavoor has started yielding positive results.

Named Operation Chunkz, the initiative was launched amidst growing incidents of accidents and road safety violations involving students under the age of 18 in Ernakulam.

An assessment by the Kochi and Rural police wings had found that juvenile driving was mostly reported from the rural limits as the offenders often used motorbikes under the confidence that surveillance was low compared with the city limits.

“We selected one school for the pilot intervention programme. A meeting of the Parent-Teacher Association was convened. Parents and teachers were educated about the motor vehicle rules that prohibit under-age driving. Parents were told that they will be held accountable whenever their child is caught for under-age driving,” said B. Shefiq, Joint RTO, Perumbavoor.

Forms distributed

The officials distributed forms in which the target students (mostly in Classes 10 to 12) were asked to fill in details related to the number of vehicles in their houses. They were also asked to mention who were using these vehicles regularly. The students were then asked to sign an undertaking stating that under-age driving was illegal as per the Motor Vehicles Rules.

Mr. Shefiq said that they would collect the contact numbers of the parents as part of the data collection drive. “In the second phase, we sought the help of auto-rickshaw drivers nearby the school to alert us whenever they come across instances of under-age driving in the school shortlisted under the Operation Chunkz programme,” he said.

The auto-rickshaw drivers and the nearby residents will click the images of juvenile driving and forward them to the MVD officials. In the third phase of the initiative, these images will be shared with the head of the educational institution. “The parent of the juvenile will be asked to appear before the department for follow-up and corrective measures,” said Mr. Shefiq.

The inspections revealed that the school students were riding motorbikes at high speed. They were not found wearing helmets. Officials said that they had often detected cases of triple driving involving juveniles. Cases are registered against the offenders under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act for not having a valid licence as the rules of the Juvenile Justice Act for under-age driving under the amended Act were yet to come into force, said officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/p48fh/article30877455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/motor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mvd-launches-campaign-to-tackle-juvenile-driving/article30875116.ece

284,2020/02/21,Colleagues fondly remember departed staffers,"V.D. Gireesh and V.R. Baiju took turns to steer the bus that met with the accident

The smell of lit incense sticks and flowers pervaded the KSRTC bus station here on Thursday night, as employees and others waited for the arrival of the mortal remains of Perumbavoor native V.D. Gireesh and Piravom native V.R. Baiju, who used to take turns in steering the Ernakulam-Bengaluru-Ernakulam Garuda Volvo bus.

The ambulances bearing their bodies halted at the stand for a few minutes for people to pay their last respects. Close family members accompanied the bodies.

Among those in the crowd were women bus conductors and employees who stayed back after their shifts to have a last glimpse of their departed colleagues.

Tribute paid

There were also people from the locality like Basheer of Kammattipadam who waited eagerly to pay tribute to the duo who were among the 20 persons who were killed in the accident involving the bus and a container lorry in Coimbatore in the early hours of Thursday.

“I am at a loss for words to describe the two amazing pair of colleagues who will be fondly remembered by us all,” said Ajith, a KSRTC employee. “They were also men of character,” he added.

Another employee, Sudheer, had been posted as conductor in the Mangaluru bus that Gireesh steered for over six months. “It was great working with him. He was an expert driver. He also had no qualms in halting the bus as requested by passengers,” Sudheer recalled.

Among those who turned up to pay tribute were Hibi Eden, MP, and T.J. Vinod, MLA, and District Collector S. Suhas.

287,2020/02/21,Bus tragedy: clamour for more trains to Bengaluru gets louder,"Rail commuters pin hope on new terminal at Byappanahalli in Bengaluru

The KSRTC bus accident on Thursday that claimed 20 lives, the latest in the spree of fatal accidents involving State-run and private luxury buses on the Coimbatore-Bengaluru highway, has led to the clamour for more trains to Bengaluru getting louder.

In the past decade, allegation was rife that the Railways were playing into the hands of luxury bus fleet owners, who operated over 1,000 daily lucrative services from cities in Kerala to Bengaluru and back. Commuters ended up paying much more than train fare for private buses while being forced to commute in rashly-driven vehicles.

The impending completion of a pit line at the Ernakulam Junction railway station and the expected completion of a seven-platform railway terminal at Byappanahalli in Bengaluru have raised hopes of introduction of a daily premium train service from either Thiruvananthapuram or Ernakulam to the Garden City.

Official sources said the availability of a metro rail station at Byappanahalli would enable rail commuters to reach Bengaluru city with ease. Faced with much flak for inadequate services from Kerala cities to Bengaluru despite a whopping demand, the Railways have in principle assured that a new daily train terminating at Byappanahalli would be introduced in early 2020, they added.

Simultaneously, commuters are hopeful that at least one more rake will be allotted to the bi-weekly Kochuveli-Banaswadi Humsafar Express and the tri-weekly Kochuveli-Yeshwantpur Garib Rath Express, so that they increase their operating frequency from Kerala.

“The two existing daily trains — Kanyakumari-Bengaluru Island Express and Kochuveli-Bengaluru Mysore Express — are fully booked within a day of reservation commencing four months ahead. The situation is such that I had to make a reservation in October for a trip slated for February,” said Venkitesh P.G., secretary, Kerala-Bengaluru Train Users’ Forum.

Apart from railway, the only other cost-effective alternative is to travel by the limited number of buses operated by Kerala and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporations. Private inter-State buses which operate in the sector charge anything from ₹1,400 to over ₹3,000, depending on the season. Commuters who opt for buses also have to put up with delays on narrow, busy and ill-maintained national highway corridors, mainly in Kerala, he said.

Even Garib Rath and Humsafar Express trains do not optimally operate during the Friday-Sunday weekend, to the detriment of commuters. Commuters prefer Humsafar Express to Garib Rath since the former has less number of stops and is thus faster. The November-January Sabarimala season makes obtaining tickets for trains in the corridor further cumbersome for families and IT professionals since they are packed with pilgrims from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, sources confided.

“Little has happened despite memoranda having been submitted to the Southern Railway. It must introduce daily special trains, at least during the Sabarimala season since it coincides with Christmas-New Year holidays as well. It did not operate special trains for Deepavali, resulting in many private bus operators fleecing commuters,” Mr. Venkitesh said.

Nithin Nobert, the Ernakulam area manager of the Southern Railway, said the terminal capacity at Ernakulam Junction would improve in early 2020 since work to complete the pit line by then had resumed after a lull. It will lead to the introduction of new trains from Kerala.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ybbzkx/article30874935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-KI-BUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bus-tragedy-clamour-for-more-trains-to-bengaluru-gets-louder/article30874936.ece
288,2020/02/21,Kerala’s pineapple farmers fear the summer,"They fear possible yield losses in the long term

The rising atmospheric temperature has left pineapple farmers fretting over possible yield losses in the long term, while the upcountry demand for the fruit is surging, with the summer setting in in north India. But for now, farmers are contented as the price is ruling around ₹30 a kg for the best quality ripe and raw fruits.

The rising day-time temperature is not a cause for worry now as farmers are getting a remunerative price, and harvests are coming in. But a further rise in temperature can hit the crop badly, said T. Maya, scientist in charge of the Pineapple Research Station at Vazhakkulam. Jose Joe Joseph, secretary, Pineapple Farmers’ Association, said farmers had begun irrigating fields in some places, while the others are looking to begin watering the plants where water availability is an issue. The rising temperature is a big challenge, he said, pointing to the positive market sentiments as the reason for farmers’ contentment.

Farmers take a double hit with the soaring mercury. Fruit yields will be affected in the long term. In the short term, harvested fruits get easily damaged and spoiled in the heat.

The rising heat and the unfolding worries have not prevented farmers from going ahead with organising a cooking and harvest contest on Saturday at Kalloorkkad, in the heart of the pineapple country. Mr. Joseph said farmers coming up with the biggest fruits would be honoured at the contest. Besides, there will be a cookery contest on February 22 to determine the best pineapple-based fare. The contest is open to anyone with a mind for cooking and can prepare curries and pickles, cake and wine, syrups and jams, and halwas and soft drinks, said Mr. Joseph.

The pineapple festival will also see experts in food production leading sessions on value-added pineapple products. There will also be a session each on soil conditions for pineapple farming and the use of MD2 variety of pineapple in place of the currently popular Mauritius variety.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a636uf/article30877948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KRAPINEAPPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rising-heat-gives-the-jitters-to-pineapple-ryots/article30874882.ece

290,2020/02/21,Lending a helping hand to make lives better,"While correct palliative diagnosis is important in providing care, not many doctors are found willing to undergo training

Ever since 32-year-old Rajesh turned paraplegic following an accident three years ago, his life became increasingly lonely, and despite constant care from his mother and sisters, he slipped into depression.

It was then that palliative care and home care made a difference in his life. Now, Rajesh is able to stand with support, get on a wheelchair on his own, watches television, reads, and is generally more positive about life.

For Sathyan, a 50-year-old who cares for his 72-year-old mother paralysed by stroke, palliative care has helped him take much better care of her. Mani, a 67-year-old diabetic patient with 40% of his leg amputated, and wife Sathy, 64, are managing their lives better due to regular palliative care home visits.

Quality of life

Unlike what most people believe, there is more to palliative care than just caring for terminal stage cancer patients or other end-stage disease patients. It is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families. Relief given to any kind of suffering is palliative care. And it is not just by medication alone.

Palliative care is total care, considering the patient and family as a single unit and addressing physical, psychological and spiritual distress, said Athul Manuel Joseph, who leads palliative care at the Ernakulam General Hospital.

Palliative is pain relief in the physical context, but it is also not going for active resuscitation measure, said Dr. Joseph.

Most chronic illnesses have slow progress, hence it is important to identify what matters to the patient. Cases could be as wide ranging as cancer, heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure, lung failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, paraplegia, accident trauma and so on. Palliative care is highly individualised in that sense, he said.

“Resuscitation, if given to a patient, when the reversible cause does not exist, is to give unwanted misery to the patient,” said Dr. Joseph, adding that palliative care helped patients be surrounded by loved ones in a home setting during the last stages.

Identifying what is necessary and what is not is where palliative diagnosis comes in, and it is acquired only through training and subsequent practice. Unfortunately, not many doctors were part of the palliative training programme, perhaps because it was not a lucrative form of clinical practice, he said.

The number of young professionals taking up this mode of medical care is less, keeping away dynamism, professionalism and sustainability of palliative care.

Palliative care does not mean providing medicine to prolong life, but providing medicine to support life as actively as possible until death, helping the family to cope with the situation and providing a positive outlook. And, it required a team approach, said Dr. Joseph.

Number of nurses

However, the number of people involved in palliative care is too low to meet the population’s demands. The State-level ratio has shown a slight improvement - from the earlier one nurse to one lakh people, there is at present a nurse for 30,000 people. Hence, a nurse providing primary care to a patient is able to meet the patient again only after one-and-a-half months.

It is to bridge the gap that nurses were trained in home care services at the Ernakulam General Hospital through a project termed Arike. It is a facility of home care for those who can afford to pay for a nurse either for a few hours or the entire day. The Kudumbashree Mission has now geared up to offer palliative care in the district.

Anil Kumar G., palliative care trainer associated with the Social Justice department, said while there were around 20 centres in the district offering palliative home care services, there was no assessment of their quality. Only big private hospitals providing palliative care managed to have a team led by a doctor, and some of those services were running quite well, he added.

Of the five main aspects of palliative care – social, spiritual, economical, physical, and psychological, only the physical aspect is addressed by most care givers. There are some volunteers who are able to meet some socio-psychological aspects too, but the majority of them withdraw from service when the patient looks for extra help from the care provider, such as help in getting their pension papers in order or assistance in finding another facility.

M.S. Sajeevan, a volunteer in the field for over 11 years, said, “Many people call up just to talk, or they want me to visit them regularly. They share many of their concerns with me, sometimes even those that they have not shared with their own kin.”",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/5yewou/article30874719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21-KI-PALLIATIVE-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lending-a-helping-hand-to-make-lives-better/article30874722.ece
291,2020/02/21,West Bengal Transport Dept to reintroduce double-decker bus,"The new double-decker buses will hit the roads in March, a senior official said.

The West Bengal Transport Department is set to reintroduce the iconic double-decker bus on city roads, a senior official said here.

He said that the new double-decker buses will hit the roads in March.

The bus bodies have been designed in-house by transport department and two of these are being readied for service, West Bengal Transport secretary N.S. Nigam said.the new double-decker buses will hit the roads in March

“These will be open roof and if the design is successful, we can look at the options of making more such buses,” he told PTI.

He said that two open roof double-decker buses will be used for tourist services.

“We have to develop them as there is no standard design, we have developed our own design,” Nigam said when asked whether double-decker buses will be introduced for public transportation on city routes.

Mr. Nigam said that after the introduction of open roof buses, the transport department will try to develop the design of bodies of these buses more to take the project forward for public transportation.

Double-decker buses had made it to the city roads during the Raj era and the red and white-coloured behemoths had been part of Kolkata’s public transportation till the mid- 1990s, before these were phased out owing to high maintenance costs.

The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC), which is now known as WBTC following the merger of three state transport undertakings, also used to run trailer double- deckers in a few routes, with the most popular being the iconic L-9.

The only city in the country that now has double- decker buses in its public transportation fleet is Mumbai, with transporter BEST plying around 50 of these at present.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/x2hb80/article30271227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMBESTBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-transport-dept-to-reintroduce-double-decker-bus/article30878231.ece
292,2020/02/21,"Bayaad-e-Ghalib: nearly 190 years after the poet visited Kolkata, the city pays rich tributes","Week-long celebrations which begin today include a tour of places in Kolkata where Ghalib lived and visited and the release of a commemorative stamp

Almost 190 years after Mirza Ghalib visited Kolkata to find out about his pension, the city is offering rich tributes to the poet in a week-long celebrations beginning Friday titled Bayaad-e-Ghalib (Remembering Ghalib), on the International Mother Language Day. More than two million Muslims whose mother tongue is Urdu reside in West Bengal.

Also read: The afterlives of Mirza Ghalib

The events organised by the West Bengal Urdu Academy, include a tour of places in Kolkata where Ghalib lived and visited, including Shimla Bazar and Kathal Bagan in central Kolkata and the release of a commemorative stamp to mark the poet’s visit to the city. Five different plays with Ghalib as the central theme would also be staged.

Other events include a recitation of Bengali translation of (’Charagh-e dair’) written by Ghalib in Benaras and eight short story writers of Urdu and Bengali presenting their fictionalised version of the poet’s life in the form of short stories.

“I do not remember if Kolkata has ever given a tribute to Mirza Ghalib. From the land of Tagore, we are offering rich tributes to one of the greatest Urdu poets of all time,” chairperson of the West Bengal Urdu Academy Md Nadimul Haque said.

Mr. Haque, also a Rajya Sabha MP from the ruling Trinamool Congress, said that an international seminar on Ghalib would be conducted in which speakers from different countries would participate. The five plays includes ‘Ghalib Aur Kolkata Musharira’, recreating the poetic congregation that was held in the city at Calcutta Madrasah in 1828.

Dabir Ahmed, professor of Urdu at Kolkata’s Maulana Azad College, said that Ghalib’s visit to Kolkata remained a little known aspect of his life. “Ghalib arrived in Kolkata on February 20, 1828 and left the city on October 1, 1829. During his stay he visited a number of places and even read three poetic symposiums (mushiaras) where the Calcutta Madrasah is located,” Prof. Ahmed said. During his stay, Ghalib wrote ‘Qate Burhan’, which is on the literary differences he had with other poets, he said.

Experts such as Prof. Ahmed said that Ghalib visited important landmarks like the Governor’s House, the Writers Building, and also the National Library that used to be the residence of senior British officials.

Syed Md. Shahabuddin Haider, vice-chairman of the West Bengal's Urdu Academy, said that a grand tribute to Ghalib by the people of city was due for a long time. “The five-day celebrations will involve people from all walks of life, from academicians to students and common people,” he said.

Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib was born in Agra on December 27, 1797 and died in Delhi on February 15, 1869.

Reflecting on Ghalib’s love for Kolkata, Mr. Haider quoted the famous lines of the poet.

“Kalkatte ka jo zikr kiya tu ne hum nasheen, Ik teer mere seenay mein mara kay haye haye (Ah me, my friend!

293,2020/02/21,Tribute to Pulwama martyrs at Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh; protest enters 45th day,"Those running the demonstration at the Park Circus Ground have crafted the campaign in a way to reiterate that Muslims are as much a part of the Indian mainstream as Hindus are

Forty tricoloured miniature coffins and almost as many portraits — of martyred men — form a part of the artwork saluting those who died in the Pulwama attack just a year ago. In the background is a slogan that calls for justice for the martyrs.

The installation sits in a corner of the Park Circus Ground, the venue of the ongoing protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) initiated by Muslim women of Kolkata, the idea obviously being to convey that Muslims too are patriotic unlike what the forces of Hindutva would like people to believe.

The protest entered its 45th day on Thursday, with protesters insisting that they wouldn’t budge unless the CAA is withdrawn, even though the attendance of women has considerably thinned because children’s exams have begun. Even the positions of the loudspeakers have been changed so that the slogan-shouting — which goes on almost round the clock — does not reach homes surrounding the ground.

With the weather changing, some of the women — or their children — have also fallen ill, but there are many others who are still staying put, chanting in unison to slogans raised by activists anchoring the protest. From time to time, the activists, who include Hindus as well, urge would-be speakers to not bring politics onto the dais and stick to speaking against the CAA.

“(Home Minister) Amit Shah says he won’t go back an inch on CAA, we say we won’t go back even half an inch. We will continue this protest until CAA is repealed or until we die,” said Mohammed Faiyazuddin, who runs a shop in Park Circus.

His neighbour Shams Ul Haque said: “It’s true that CAA does not affect Indian Muslims, but why introduce a law in the first place that discriminates between people on the basis of religion? Things were just going on fine — they are out to ruin Hindustan.”

Those running this protest have crafted the campaign in a way to reiterate that Muslims are as much a part of the Indian mainstream as Hindus are. To begin with, the ground, which is overlooked by a mosque, is awash with the tricolour. The venerable personalities adorning the posters and banners are mostly national figures — including Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, Chittaranjan Das, Chandrashekhar Azad — and not just Muslim leaders. And now the tribute to Pulwama martyrs.

“In another two days the Centre is expected to give its response in Supreme Court on whether the CAA should be repealed. We hope that good sense prevails, or else we will continue with the protest — it is our right,” said Zeeshan, a local businessman and one of the organisers of the protest.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/4l5l9k/article30877912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG4578,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/tribute-to-pulwama-martyrs-at-kolkatas-shaheen-bagh-protest-enters-45th-day/article30877913.ece

Airport Director K. Srinivasa Rao said that Indigo would launch a daily non-stop flight to Jeddah from March 29. The flight will depart from Kozhikode at 8.55 a.m. and land in Jeddah at 12.20 p.m. The departure flight from Jeddah is at 1.20 p.m.

The airline will also begin the operation of a daily Kozhikode-Riyadh-Kozhikode flight from March 20. The flight will depart from Kozhikode at 7.30 a.m. and from Riyadh at 11.30 p.m. The airline has also announced a daily non-stop flight to Delhi from March 20. The flight would depart from Kozhikode at 8.25 p.m. and from Delhi at 11.30 p.m., Mr. Rao said.

He said that Indigo would introduce a daily non-stop flight between Kozhikode and Dammam from March 10. The flight will depart from Kozhikode at 7.35 a.m. and from Dammam at 12.40 p.m. Spicejet was also starting a Mumbai flight at 7 p.m. from March 29. The new flight, however, was in lieu of the earlier Bengaluru destination, he added.

Early this week, Air India had reintroduced its Boeing 747-400 direct flight twice a week — Monday and Saturday — to Jeddah. The flight will depart from Kozhikode at 5.30 p.m. and from Jeddah, on Fridays and Sundays, at 11.15 p.m.

However, Dubai-based Emirates, which had also got approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, has not yet announced the operation of wide-bodied aircraft from the airport.

Further, Calicut airport authorities are yet to cash in on the partial closure of the Kochi airport. The airport was partially closed from November 30 for mandatory re-carpeting work of its runway.

Previously, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had considered a proposal to divert at least some flights operating from Kochi to Calicut and Kannur airports. But nothing has materialised till now. However, a flight from Agatti, Lakshadweep, has been diverted via Kozhikode to Bengaluru.

Meanwhile, M.K. Raghavan, MP, has urged chairman of Indirect Taxes and Customs Board M.

The agenda seeking the council’s approval to appoint a project advisor for the development of the land was questioned by Palayam councillor P. Usha Devi. “The market is a prime location in the heart of the city. Handing it over to a private party is not going to be beneficial to the Corporation,” she said at the meeting.

It was the proposal for a private investor for the project that irked some of the councillors who asked why the Corporation could not invest directly in the project, so that it would earn revenue in future.

“We need profit-making ventures at this stage considering the depletion of revenue in recent years,” Ms. Usha Devi said, seeking the possibility of taking loans to carry out the project.

“If private parties take up the project, they will expect returns which is probably 25 to 30 years of permission to operate the project. What they would hand over back to the Corporation will be a good for nothing skeleton,” said IUML councillor C. Abdurahman.

However, Corporation Secretary Binu Francis pointed out that the project could cost ₹200 crore to ₹300 crore, which the Corporation might not be able to afford. Loans would take around 30 years to pay back, he added.

The Corporation wants the project advisor to measure the land, which is in its possession, work out possibilities of projects that could be executed there, calculate maximum viable investment, prepare a detailed project report and help the Corporation find a party suitable for investing and implementing the project.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/move-to-seek-private-investment-for-developing-land-draws-flak/article30883516.ece
299,2020/02/21,Customs’ e-clearance facility getting ready at Beypore Port,"Service will facilitate quicker movement of containers by eliminating paperwork

A major portion of the civil works for introducing the Custom’s Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) clearance facility has been completed at the Beypore Port as part of the Union and State governments’ efforts to promote coastal shipping through minor ports and fast-track container movement. It has been a long-awaited service by exporters and importers from the northern Kerala region.

Port officer Ashwini Prathap says about 80% of construction works for the 24x7 clearance service which will reduce the physical interface between Customs, traders and other regulatory agencies has been completed by spending ₹12 lakh. “The trial will be conducted soon by the Customs wing prior to its commissioning within a month. The total project cost is ₹20 lakh,” he says.

Mr. Prathap also says the special incentive declared by the government for coastal shipping promotion projects too will come to the benefit of those who wish to explore the new EDI clearance facility. A government order has been issued explaining the percentage of incentives available for the businessmen in the field.

With the introduction of the EDI facility, the conventional method of using hard copies for manual Customs clearance procedures will come to an end. According to officials, it will be a huge advantage for facilitating quicker movement of containers. Also, those who make use of the EDI service now at the Kochi Port can avail themselves of the service at the Beypore Port. Similarly, the temporary clearance facility provided through the Kozhikode International Airport will be wound up.

Facility since 2015

Port authorities say the leading sea ports and airports in the country have been enjoying round-the-clock clearance facility since 2015. Its extension was recommended by the Union Ministry of Finance to other locations as an administrative reform to stimulate economic growth and give more prominence to minor ports, they add.

According to port authorities, the EDI facility will be a big boost for the growth of business through the Beypore Port, which is now at the doorstep of many innovative projects to woo exporters.

The commissioning of the Kannur Airport and the development of minor ports in the northern Kerala region will attract stakeholders in the business from neighbouring States such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, they hope.

It was in 2018 that container shipping was officially launched at the Beypore Port under the State government’s coastal shipping promotion programmes. Though the port had been remaining open for container movement since 2017, only the unloading of cargo was done here instead of tapping the export potentials. The limited facilities to manage consignments too had been a hurdle, which was promptly attended to by the authorities by developing the storage facilities and introducing modern container reach stacker for safely handling containers.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/g7elci/article30875144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21CTBEYPORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/customs-e-clearance-facility-getting-ready-at-beypore-port/article30875145.ece
300,2020/02/21,Imran Amed: Fashion’s insider,"One of fashion’s most influential people, and the man behind the much-awaited BoF 500 power list, is now making a strong case for sustainability

In the high-wattage fashion industry, one man stands apart. Imran Amed is someone whose dinners are attended by the Kardashians, who quickly puts together a panel with Deepika Padukone and Sabyasachi Mukherjee while on a whirlwind trip to India, and whose persuasive powers can get Tom Ford to pose for the cover of the first edition of his company’s print magazine.

Amed’s The Business of Fashion (BoF) — a personal blog he started in 2007 for friends and family — has today morphed into a virtual bible for the fashion industry. Each morning, a BoF email hits the inboxes of 7,00,000 registered users, with a mix of original stories and links to news and features about the fashion industry. A recent sample: how UK consumer spending is down, how to launch an influencer brand in 2020, and what fashion brands need to know about the coronavirus. The emails are a must-read not just for the industry’s most influential folks (from designers Tory Burch to Anya Hindmarch), but also for anyone with even a cursory interest in fashion. With BoF, of which he is CEO and editor in chief, Amed, 44, has cemented his reputation as the oracle of style. It is no wonder that in 2018 The Guardian called him ‘fashion’s most influential man’.

Front row fixture

Last month, I spent time with him in Davos, where he had come to attend the World Economic Forum. It was his first visit — WEF’s dates overlap with the Paris haute couture shows — but this year he made it a point to attend because of an issue especially close to his heart: fashion and sustainability. BoF recently reported that in 2019, 114 billion clothes were sold globally (amounting to 15 new pieces per person on Earth).

There are other daunting stats, too: according to the UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation, global clothing production has doubled in the past 15 years, and a projection by the Pulse of Fashion Industry report states that by 2030, the apparel and footwear industry is set to grow 81%, while textile waste is set to increase 60%.

Influencer with a twist In an era where Instagram influencers, and digital and traditional media outlets jockey for mind space, BoF brings clarity and sharp analysis to the cluttered world of fashion news. With a team of 100 scattered across New York, London, Paris and Shanghai, Amed describes BoF as a “resource for the global fashion industry”. Its revenue model includes events, online courses and a career database.

In 2016, the company started BoF Professional, charging $240 a year for premium content; it now has 40,000 paid subscribers in 125 countries. Seven years ago, it launched BoF 500, a fashion power list. It was an instant sensation, and to be named one of the 500 is a much-coveted thing today. Then there’s Voices, the annual, by-invitation-only conference attended by fashion’s movers and shakers and innovators. Musician will.i.am describes it as “a hybrid of TED but with the coolest people at TED”. Such is its influence that, last year, the Financial Times inked an investment partnership with BoF.

It is no wonder that sustainability is the topic du jour. Take, for example, this year’s Oscars, what with Margot Robbie and Lily Aldridge wearing vintage and Jane Fonda re-wearing a gown she wore to Cannes in 2013. “It has come up in every conversation I’ve had in Davos, and it is why I am here, because the fashion industry is really trying to take its role in this wider sustainability challenge more seriously,” Amed tells me.

We meet at the sprawling WIPRO lounge on the main Davos Promenade. The former McKinsey consultant and Harvard MBA graduate is nothing if not global. He lives in London, but was born in Canada to East African parents of Indian descent (you can hear traces of a Canadian accent). He comes across as curious, measured and very bright, and he travels incessantly — in early February he has criss-crossed through Brazil, New York, and San Francisco. When we meet he’s wearing many hues of blue: navy striped woollen Pero trousers, a Loewe turtleneck and a printed sweater by the chic Japanese brand, Sacai. He also carries around a small black notebook in which he takes copious notes. For someone at the forefront of a digital media empire, it is oddly quaint.

Voice of reason

“One of the things we’ve been challenging the industry to think about is a new narrative around consumption,” he says. But isn’t fashion all about desiring the new? “There’s this apparent contradiction between sustainability and growth,” he agrees, adding, “When I went to business school, we were taught that healthy companies grow margins, profits and revenues. But this kind of model — focussed on accountability to shareholders alone — may not be entirely compatible with addressing the climate emergency.”

Indeed, BoF has been vocal in unveiling these issues, spotlighting innovators, sustainability pioneers, and activists. “Imran’s commitment towards consistent coverage of issues on sustainability [as demonstrated in BoF] is nothing short of exemplary, and needs to be emulated,” says Bandana Tewari, sustainability activist, former editor-at-large of Vogue India, and a BoF contributor.

Role models and inspirations Karl Lagerfeld: “Karl Lagerfeld was always kind and supportive, even in the early days of BoF. He told me that what I was doing was different. He always took time to meet with me and our editor-at-large after every Chanel show, just to chat, and I learned a lot from him.

Yohji Yamamoto: “One of my favorite interviews was with Japanese design legend, Yohji Yamamoto. He said that to find your own purpose in life, you can copy someone whom you like very much, and copy and copy, until at the end, you find yourself. What I think he meant was that you should find what you really love and study it, immerse yourself in it, and eventually you will find yourself. There's so much out there to inspire, but you have to know yourself to seek it out. That’s what I did. It was really powerful advice.”

As a media platform, Amed believes his role is to spark conversations and create awareness. “We try to be an agent of change.” A case in point: at BoF’s Voices conference in 2018, fashion’s biggest heavyweights listened as sustainability strategist Rachel Lincoln Sarnoff spoke about the need to tackle microplastics found in fabrics that wind up in the ocean. She told the audience that in 10 years, 70% of fabric fibres will come from plastic, and urged them to reconsider the materials they employ.

Amed notes that fast fashion and luxury brands are equally responsible for this grave environmental toll. The two have learned much from each other: while the former has embraced the marketing and aspiration of luxury, the latter has paid attention to speed and supply chain management to produce more collections. The result? “Every year we are creating and selling more and more stuff,” he says.

Vintage for the win

But there are slivers of hope. Thanks to millennials and Gen-Z, the global resale (second-hand) market is set to double to $54 billion by 2024. Amed recalls being an early fan of vintage. As a kid, he would buy vintage Levi’s jeans, much to his parents’ dismay — they couldn’t understand why he was buying old clothes!

These days a growing number of companies are upcyling, attempting to be zero waste, and sourcing locally to minimise their carbon footprint. He points to brands like Patagonia, Eileen Fischer, and Stella McCartney that have integrated sustainable materials into their supply chain and taken positive steps towards minimising their environmental impact. He also cites Kering, the fashion conglomerate, for the environmental profit-and-loss statement it publishes on its performance.

Companies are hiring chief sustainability officers, too. Amed welcomes this, but is cautious. “It is not just a chief sustainability officer issue, this is a C-level executive issue. Because throughout the fashion supply chain, where 90% of waste carbon is created, everyone in the C-suite has a role to play in managing that. Whether it is the fibres used in production or the vendors used to manufacture or the way retail stores are run, each of those touch points has an impact. There’s work to be done throughout the value chain”.

Yet, till consumer behaviour doesn’t change, little else will. When Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, re-wore a 2012 gown to this year’s BAFTA awards, she was applauded. Actor Joaquin Phoenix has been wearing the same Stella McCartney tuxedo to every awards show. Can this save the planet? Unlikely, but Amed says it sends a message, given that celebrities are so important in shaping mindsets and behaviours. “At the end of the day, people are not going to buy fashion because it is sustainable. They are going to purchase products because they are beautiful and well-made. Sustainability has to be a ‘hygiene factor’ in how we create, and buy. It is a step, a journey of a thousand steps.”",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/7wnhod/article30880193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Imran-Amed-by-Thomas-Lohr-at-BoF-Office-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/imran-amed-fashions-insider/article30880194.ece
301,2020/02/21,Voice of Fashion’s Sustainability Report looks at the psyche of Indian consumers,"Fashion’s eco chase: With some serious number tracking, The Voice of Fashion’s recent India Sustainability Report delves into our psyche as consumers

Every year, a new crop of designers gain recognition at our fashion weeks. And with each passing year, their eco-conscious stories get stronger. But are they getting it right? Until now, it has been a murky playing field, and with no numbers to indicate consumer awareness, it is tough to gauge if your favourite brand is greenwashing, or if it is adopting sustainable practices. But change is in the offing with The Voice of Fashion’s (TVF) India Sustainability Report. “It is India’s first consumer and manufacturer study on sustainability in fashion and retail,” says TVF editor Shefalee Vasudev, explaining that the report is aimed at understanding where the country’s fashion industry stands in the global sustainability movement.

Keeping track

Released at Lakme Fashion Week’s UN Circular Design Challenge last week, it delves into the Indian consumer’s psyche. From awareness on recycling, vintage, rented and pre-loved fashion to the willingness to change or minimise consumption, the two-part survey analyses trends from four respondent groups comprising 937 adults across New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Ahmedabad. For the second part of the study, CEOs and/or sustainability officers from 17 top Indian fashion and retail brands were interviewed.

Explaining the rationale behind picking the 17, Vasudev says, “We opted for brands that dominated the retail scenario [Aditya Birla Fashion Retail Limited, Lifestyle, Levi’s]; those part of SU.RE, a charter signed by 16 retail captains with IMG Reliance last year; and labels that promise sustainability as a part of their brand DNA [Rahul Mishra, péro], among other factors.”

Green quotient

Amidst the many findings, it is interesting to note how 82% of those surveyed were not aware that the fashion industry is among the top three contributors to pollution. “Conversion is a slow process and will take a long time to be visible. But its time has come,” says Vasudev, adding, “From Incredible India to bridal couture, and fashion week communication to retail posters, sustainability in different forms, in all languages, must be spoken about.”

But the willingness quotient is high: 49% of respondents are open to adopting sustainable practices, especially where the fabric is sourced from coffee beans, bananas, or wood pulp. Vasudev says this could well be because these ingredients have a quick recall. “The study has also revealed how 23% do not want to use recycled garments [due to fear of skin allergies, etc].”

New avenues

The study can also create new opportunities. For instance, the fact that 4% choose to make mops or bags from old clothes could translate into an idea for a small-scale green enterprise. Vasudev agrees, and suggests fashion designers can also create a collective that sells table, home, kitchen and bed linen from fabric and material leftovers. “It can be branded as ‘designer upcycled’ and sold. With the emphasis on designer weddings, stylists can craft tents or enclosures with leftover fabric [brocade, silks] collected from brands.”

Discarded buttons, zips, hooks and tassels can be crafted into hair accessories or jewellery, and “denim manufacturing companies can explore ideas like forming a sustainable jeans coalition of India — which can look into technological innovations: jeans that don’t need to be washed for a month, distribution of jeans from discarded material to rickshaw pullers and shelter camps, and denim pants or uniforms for government schools,” she concludes.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/30mx05/article30880021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1150921405,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/on-the-voice-of-fashions-recent-india-sustainability-report/article30880022.ece
302,2020/02/21,"Something old, something recycled: Learnings from New York’s Annual Fashion Sustainability Summit","Headlined by the likes of Waris Ahluwalia and Bonnie Wright, the recent Annual Fashion Sustainability Summit brought to the fore innovative solutions like microfibre filters, bio-leather and recyclable shoes

Did you know that by 2030, the global fashion industry is likely to consume about 118 billion cubic metres of water? That’s enough to fill 48 million Olympic-size swimming pools, according to Pulse of Fashion’s 2017 report. Movements supporting sustainable apparel manufacturing and circular economies are now gaining traction, and the recently-concluded Annual Fashion Sustainability Summit in New York (on January 31) is a case in point. Organised by New York-based non-profit Slow Factory Foundation, in partnership with the United Nations, the fifth edition brought together notable climate advocates such as actor Yara Shahidi of Black-ish fame, Bonnie Wright from the Harry Potter series, designer-turned-entrepreneur Waris Ahluwalia, and designer Tina Knowles (mother of Beyoncé), among others. They not only highlighted how the rise of the resale market is a hot topic in the fashion industry, but also looked at experts’ solutions on reversing the damage fashion has caused the planet. Ten percent of our carbon emissions, to be precise. Panelists at the event included scientists, biologists and technology experts who candidly fielded questions from 400 climate enthusiasts about such pressing issues. Here are five learnings from the Summit:

Meet Mylo

Since its entry in 1941, polyester arguably continues to reign in the fashion industry. No innovative textile has been crafted to take over its popularity or reverse the ecological damage, for that matter. At the Summit, San Francisco-based Bolt Threads — which also creates fabrics for Stella McCartney — proposed Mylo as the breakthrough material that is 100% bio-degradable. “It is made from mycelium, which is the root structure of mushrooms, with fine, thread-like cells. This revolutionary material isn’t animal-based or petroleum-based, but it can be used in the same way as leather [traditional and synthetic],” says founder Dan Widmaier, who previously launched microsilk, made from spider silk protein.

Not just textiles

About 300 million pairs of shoes end up in landfills every year. Committed to tackle the issue is French sneaker brand Veja. “When we started in 2004, our goal was to deconstruct the production of the sneaker,” says co-founder Sebastian Kopp, who launched its limited-edition collection last month (in New Delhi) in collaboration with Anand Ahuja’s multi-brand store, Veg-Non-Veg. “We didn’t know a lot about making sneakers then and we chose to go to Brazil and ask questions. The first was, ‘What is canvas?’ It is cotton, a plant that uses almost 2% of the world’s agricultural land.” For Kopp, who also makes sneakers out of fish leather, opting for organic, fairtrade cotton from farmer associations in Brazil and Peru was not an ecological act. “It was normal to try to do something better.”

Embrace circularity

Like most industries, the take-make-waste model or the linear economy is also prevalent in fashion. According to the Ellen McArthur Foundation, which champions circular economy, only 1% of all textiles get recycled every year. Speaking about how adidas is trying to change consumer behaviour, Ayesha Martin, director of Global Purpose at adidas, says, “The test run for the FutureCraft.Loop shoes, made from a form of thermoplastic polyurethane, involved consumers returning used products for recycling. Some didn’t, so we have to work towards shifting mindsets,” she says. To be launched commercially next year, buyers will keep getting a ‘new’ pair if they return the old. By 2024, the sportswear brand is committed to using only eco-friendly elements in their products.

Voices from the Summit Bonnie Wright, actor and advocate: “I love my socks from [Washington-based] Arvin Goods because they use only recycled cotton and next to no water in their production process. Whereas an average pair of socks uses about 50 gallons of water.”

Yara Shahidi, actor and advocate: “Whether it is social justice or racial equity, they are starting points to realise how much more there is to be passionate about. I am intentional about whom I choose to collaborate with. What I love about adidas is that it is one of the only teams where we haven’t had to ask about their plans to be part of the climate conversation.”

Waris Ahluwalia, designer and actor: “If we are not balanced as individuals, then how is the planet going to be balanced? It was one of the reasons why we started House of Waris Botanicals — looking at plants, starting from the source, trying to get ourselves balanced before we can have an impact on the planet.”

Quit wish-cycling

Wish-cycling (when your expectation of recycling a material exceeds the ability of the recycling facility) can start with good intentions but you might be doing more harm than good. “Any sort of paper that has a foil attached to it [like coffee cups] are not recyclable. If you want to recycle a food container, you have to clean it,” says Jay Kaplan, Environmental Manager, at New York-based environmental solutions company, Waste Management. “It rings true especially when most of us are guilty of throwing our stained pizza boxes in the recycling bin thinking it would magically turn into another pizza box.”

Conscious washing

Turns out, your washing machine is where most of the microfibres in the ocean come from. “The tiny particles made of polyester, rayon or other synthetic textiles do not get filtered in the machines, which has led to the textile industry contributing to about 35% of microplastic pollution,” says scientist Marco Tedesco. What happens next? The plastic debris flows into our water stream, and then the ocean, to finally end up in our food chain. While doing less laundry can lessen the number of microfibres flowing out, US-based MojaWorks’ microfiber filters and laundry balls (that catch the lint) are other solutions. ₹4,061 onwards on amazon.in",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/4h3fd3/article30879615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22WKIllustration,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/finds-from-the-annual-fashion-sustainability-summit-in-new-york/article30879618.ece
303,2020/02/21,"How Vasudha Rai said no to excess beauty waste, and why you should too","How and why this writer refused to accept excessively-packaged products, and is encouraging other influencers to do the same

I first started writing on beauty in 2002. Since then, I have unwrapped, opened, twisted, slathered, misted, patted and massaged an exhaustive list of products. In terms of volume, I must have discarded a three-storied mountain of vanity. Triple that number with the added packaging, print outs, invites, empty tubs and tubes of product, and you have a landfill in the making.

I’m not proud of it.

During my time as beauty director of Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan and Women’s Health, I would discard (on a daily basis) a three-foot hillock of glossy press kits and coffrets. Handling three titles meant triple the amount of information and products. I was worried but not alarmed, assuming that India had the best home-grown recycling system, our local raddiwallah. However, even they don’t accept the most superfluous aspect of beauty waste — the decorative boxes that are handouts for the press and bloggers.

Speaking out

It took me years to take action. Like any other beauty journalist, I didn’t want to offend brands or appear ungrateful. But one day, as the boxes stacked taller than me, I decided (with great trepidation) to write a post about these laminated coffrets. It was around Diwali, when gifting was at its peak. Brands had designed their boxes, and elaborate invitations were pouring in. The worst offenders were invites to wedding shows: reams and reams of laminated paper, with half-broken cookies and earrings never worn. It seemed apt to talk about waste in the season it is generated most.

Soultree uses a paper alternative to bubble wrap and cardboard boxes to ship their products Beauty e-tailer Vanity Wagon has a monthly subscription, the Bellebox, which comes with clean beauty products packed in a cardboard box With the aim of making sustainable living “fun, affordable and accessible”, Verth’s monthly subscription box contains products like shampoo bars, organic body butter, bamboo toothbrushes, reusable straws and tote bags, in eco-friendly packaging Delhi-based brand Conscious Chemist uses glass jars, copper lid caps and paper labels. Consumers can also opt out from the plastic pump Treewear’s natural deodorant comes in a paper container

I posted my picture with a stack of boxes, reaching over six feet. All in just one month. ‘Could the brands please focus on the products and not accoutrements?’ I asked. The post was shared multiple times, especially because I had tagged influencers and editors. Everyone wanted to say it, but didn’t know how. We all understood that the products are small compared to the mammoth waste created by boxes, bubble wrap and pamphlets.

According to a study conducted by Zero Waste Europe, we have discarded 142 billion units of beauty products in 2018 alone. Beauty packaging is challenging. Most products are water-based, and therefore, require preservatives. So the jars must be non-reactive. The units must also be durable to withstand transport and reach in an impeccable condition. Even though green beauty is the fastest growing segment within the industry, no one talks about waste. Even the most ‘woke’ customer has old-fashioned expectations. We won’t forgive a chip in the bottle and will return a carton if it is slightly crushed.

Know your responsibility

Do you know that mixed/compound plastics or mixed materials are difficult, if not impossible, to recycle? These would include face wipes and sheet masks made with fibre and plastic, packaged in sachets made with plastic, paper and foil. Additionally, bio-plastic, beauty’s blue-eyed favourite, doesn’t degrade naturally, but requires special facilities, which are only available in a few places around the world.

While there are Extended Producer Responsibility guidelines that expect producers (especially of plastic) to collect and responsibly dispose as much as they manufacture, there is neither clarity and nor action. I don’t even want to hazard a guess about how much paper and plastic is dumped by beauty writers, editors and bloggers every week. At the very least, press releases and coffrets must be refused. When asked, the brands are happy to comply.

Sustainable subscription box, Verth

This January, a friend posted an image on his Insta-story and tagged me. India’s biggest beauty retailer had sent him a package with reams of bubble wrap. When I reposted, it was like the floodgates had opened. DMs flew in, naming names and questioning practices, most notably of the country’s biggest beauty e-tailer. I shared them all. Because of the collective noise, brands are sitting up, taking notice and changing plans. One replaced a box with a cane bag, while another used seed paper for their yearly calendar.

The aftermath

Despite these efforts, beauty companies need to look beyond production and take responsibility for collection. Bio-plastic, glass, seed paper, organic fibre, corrugated cardboard and newspaper packaging may be sustainable options but they’re worth nothing in a landfill. Because landfills are packed tightly with waste, they lack air and soil — two components necessary for biodegradation.

The responsibility for waste disposal extends to customers, too. As people messaged me poor packaging examples on Instagram, I asked them to suggest their favourite waste management services. Out of the 4,000 or so who viewed my story, only five answered with suggestions. While there is no doubt that recycling is a problem in India, a quick Google search for waste management services will throw up many choices in big cities. I signed up with Ecowise, who operates out of 15 cities, including Delhi, Jaipur, Lucknow and Bengaluru.

The good news is that everyone wants to do something but lack initiative. There will never be a perfect solution, so it is imperative to begin somewhere. If you can’t recycle, make better choices, reuse the jars. Instead of buying several mediocre products, invest in one amazing serum. Refuse decorative boxes and return superfluous packaging, pamphlets and leaflets to the store. Call out influencers who do ‘unboxing’ videos. Keep making noise. The brands will deliver eventually, but it all begins with you.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/d2nzi/article30879403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22wkvasudhajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/how-vasudha-rai-said-no-to-excess-beauty-waste-and-why-you-should-too/article30879405.ece
304,2020/02/21,Farmers turn up shirtless for grievance meeting,"They were protesting against a private sugar mill for not paying outstanding due of ₹14 crore

A section of sugarcane farmers on Friday staged an agitation without shirts protesting against a private sugar mill that was not coming forward to pay ₹14 crore arrears due to them.

The farmers, led by Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam president N. Ramachandra Raja, staged the novel protest at the monthly farmers’ grievances redressal meeting chaired by District Collector R. Kannan at the Collectorate.

Mr. Raja said that the sugar mill in Vasudevanallur in Tenkasi district had procured sugarcane from farmers of Rajapalayam, Srivilliputtur and Watrap taluks and the cane were cut in 2018-19.

The money due to the farmers had not been disbursed till date, he complained.

Stating that the farmers had raised the issue with the district administration several times, they charged that no effective measures had been taken to force the mill to pay the outstanding dues to the farmers.

Though the Collector tried to pacify them, the farmers stuck to their ground.

The sugar mill had procured 2,783 tonnes of cane from 173 farmers for the 2018 crushing season.

“Though the mill had sold sugar, molasses and electricity produced through co-generation using the cane procured from the farmers, it was not willing to pay the farmers,” Mr. Raja said.

He added that farmers had taken loans from cooperative and nationalised banks to raise the crop. “Since, the mill had not repaid us, our farmers are not able to repay the loan and the banks are sending notices warning of distraint proceedings against us for defaulting in loan repayment,” he said.

Farmers from Virudhunagar district, along with local farmers of Tenkasi district, have planned to lay siege to the sugarmill in Vasudevanallur on Monday, said Mr. Raja

Later in the day, the Collector convened a tripartite meeting with the farmers and representatives of the sugarmill at the Collectorate.

However, an official said that the Collector had issued a deadline of March 5 for the sugarmill to start disbursal of the outstanding dues to the farmers, failing which another round of meeting would be held on March 6 at Rajapalayam taluk office to decide on further course of action.

The district administration, which had sanctioned 34 Direct Purchase Centres (DPCs) for paddy across the district in the wake of harvesting of ‘pisanam’ paddy, has made arrangements for operating mobile DPCs so as to reach farmers in remote areas.

In his inaugural remarks during the farmers’ monthly grievance redressal meet held here on Friday, District Revenue Officer B. Muthuramalingam said the district, which received surplus rainfall during the north-east monsoon last year had increased the area under paddy cultivation and had been given permission for opening DPCs at 34 places. Of this, DPCs have been opened in 24 places, where 1,224 tonnes of paddy have been procured so far.

Since, farmers in hitherto unserved areas were seeking centres to sell their produce at the right price, the mobile DPCs would be operated in these areas shortly.

Poor quality seeds

On the seed quality certification measures being taken in the district by the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Muthuramalingam said the officials had so far taken 1,445 samples from 232 shops in the district and 54 samples were found to be of poor quality. Hence, 52 traders, who were selling these poor quality seeds had been blacklisted and appropriate action taken against them. Consequently, the Department of Agriculture had banned the sale of 41.40 tonnes of these poor quality seeds, worth about ₹23.04 lakh.

Raising the question pertaining to non-disbursal of insurance benefits to paddy farmers who had suffered crop loss in 2016 – 2017, P. Perumbadaiyar of Communist Party of India said 262 paddy farmers from Kalakkad area, who had insured their crop by paying the premium before the prescribed deadline, were yet to get the insurance benefits despite repeated appeal to the insurance firm.

Responding to it, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, who was presiding over the meet, said the list of affected farmers and the quantum of insurance benefit arrears to be disbursed might be submitted to her so that she could raise the issue with the insurance firm for early disbursal of the compensation.

When farmer P. Sorimuthu of Zamin Singampatti wanted the officials to ensure clear display of norms for paddy procurement and the support price in the DPCs, Ms. Shilpa assured that the farmer’s suggestion would immediately be translated into action by the officials concerned and gave immediate instructions in this connection.

She also assured that the DPCs would be established only in easily accessible common places and not in places belonging to any individual.

Paddy harvesters

Farmers pointed out non-availability of paddy harvesters and said they were being forced to hire private machineries at a higher rental charges as the Department of Agricultural Engineering had only a couple of harvesters.

The Collector instructed the officials to take immediate steps to bring harvesters from other districts where paddy harvest was over.

On the appeal for release of water in Manimuthuar Dam Perunkaal from April 1, Ms. Shilpa said any decision on this appeal could be taken only based on the availability of water in the dam after the ‘pisanam’ paddy season.

“Since we have to provide drinking water to the people of two districts during summer that may extend up to even September-end, we cannot take any decision in this connection right now. Since drinking water requirement is our first priority, we’ll take appropriate decision after the end of this paddy season. If it is found that the dams have surplus storage even after meeting drinking water requirements, the district administration will certainly recommend to the government for release of water for irrigation,” Ms. Shilpa said.

When farmers from Maanur Therkkupatti complained about invasion of wild animals into their farms, the Collector ordered the officials of Department of Forest to inspect the affected ranches immediately and disburse due compensation at the earliest.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/9d92t6/article30883631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA22MEETTVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/mobile-dpcs-to-be-introduced-in-tirunelveli/article30883632.ece

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami would lay the foundation stone for construction of a new government medical college here on March 1, said Health Minister Vijaya Baskar here on Friday.

Speaking to reporters after inspecting the venue, where the CM is expected to address a public gathering, the Minister said that it was a himalayan achievement by the CM who had been instrumental in bringing in 11 medical colleges to the State in a single year.

While, students would benefit, in the long run, the State would be on top of the score board to have state-of-the-art government-run medical institutions in the country.

“The medical college would come up near Anna Poonga and will have six-floors and will be completed in 11 months from now”, Mr. Vijaya Baskar said and added that funds was not at all a constraint as the CM had earmarked a whopping ₹3,000 plus crore for construction of new buildings for all the medical colleges, which were announced recently.

While Tamil Nadu government had the sanction to admit 150 students, the first batch of admissions would commence from the 2021 academic year onwards. Responding to a query, he said that the government proposed to recruit 300 medical professionals and 900 para medical staffs for the institution to come up here in a phased manner and it would have 750 beds.

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Friday reserved orders in the petition that sought a direction to conduct the election to the vacant posts of chairperson and six directors to the Madurai District Cooperative Milk Producers Union alone and not for all posts.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran reserved orders in the petition filed by P. Periya Karuppan of Usilampatti in Madurai district, one of the directors in the union. He said that the election to the vacant posts alone should be conducted.

He said that an election was conducted in 2018 to the milk union and 17 directors were elected. Following the bifurcation of the milk union into Madurai and Theni unions, 11 directors remained with the Madurai union and the remaining six formed part of the newly formed Theni union.

Earlier when the appointment of former AIADMK MLA K. Tamilarasan as Chairman of the Madurai milk union was challenged, the court restrained Tamilarasan from continuing in the post and directed an election be conducted in accordance with the rules.

In compliance with the order of the court, the State Co-operative Election Commission has now issued an election notification for the conduct of election to 14 District Cooperative Milk Producers Union, including that of Madurai, the petitioner said.

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Friday ordered notice to the State on two separate public interest litigation petitions seeking a CBI probe into the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) examination scam.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran ordered notice to the State and adjourned the hearing in the separate petitions filed by advocate B. Stalin and K.K. Ramesh of Madurai. Both sought a CBI probe into the malpractices in the exam.

During the course of the hearing, the State government submitted that the investigation into the matter was on the right track and a counter in this regard would be filed before the court.

The petitioners said that even as early as 2000-2001, the TNPSC examinations were marred by malpractices and subsequently candidates who had played fraud were able to secure government jobs.

Such officials were holding key posts in Tamil Nadu Police and Administrative Departments. The malpractices could not have taken place without the involvement of high ranking officials, the petitioners said and sought a CBI probe.

Many youngsters aspire to clear the competitive examinations. First generation candidates and candidates from rural areas should have confidence that the TNPSC examinations were held in a proper manner and only meritorious candidates were being selected, they said.

315,2020/02/21,Shenbaga Thottam park transforms into an attractive open space,"Makeover was undertaken by Corporation at a cost of ₹52 lakh

Madurai

Till a couple of years back, the park at Shenbaga Thottam near Anna Nagar was in a shambles, recalls C. Suresh, a resident of Shenbaga Thottam’s ‘H’ Block. “There was a wild growth of thorny shrubs all along the park. The play equipment for children was broken and it was littered with plastic bags and household waste. The park was a haven for anti-social elements,” he says.

But, today the park has transformed into an attractive open space for the residents. Thanks to Madurai Corporation, which undertook the renovation of the park under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme in 2016-2017. The makeover was undertaken at a cost of ₹52 lakh.

Today, the park is frequented by residents of all age groups, who can be seen walking or jogging in the evenings and mornings. It has become the recreational spot for children, who throng the park during holidays.

G.Ganesan, a senior citizen from Tahsildar Nagar who frequents the park for his walk, says that the park is a boon for people like him who enjoys peaceful evening walks. “Earlier, due to heavy vehicular movement on streets, it was dangerous for pedestrians to walk along the streets,” he says.

The park has smooth paver block pathways, lawns and a separate play area for children. It also has a sufficient number of benches across the park.

The park is also a major utility for residents of Gomathipuram, Tahsildar Nagar, Shenbaga Thottam and Melamadai, says A. Fatima, a resident of Gomathipuram.

“For the residents of these areas, this is the functional park in the vicinity. To avoid traffic congestion,we prefer this park over Walker's Park at K.K. Nagar along Vandiyur tank,” she says.

However, the maintenance of the park is deteriorating in the last three months, complains Mr. Suresh.

“Only one out of the two watchmen is working at the park for the last few months and this has led to poor upkeep of the park. A few plants and flowers have started withering,” he says.

Toilets that are available at the park always remain locked, complains Ms. Fatima. “It will be highly useful for the diabetic if the toilets are open. Also, drinking water must be regularly supplied at the park,” she says.

S. Prabhakaran, who frequents the park, says that steps need to be taken to ensure that proper upkeep of the park is undertaken.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/3ocy2z/article30882300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MACITY22-PARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/shenbaga-thottam-park-transforms-into-an-attractive-open-space/article30882301.ece

Sixteen goats of a farmer, S. Pandi, were killed when stray dogs bit them at the cattle shed in Bodinaickkanpatti near Vadipatti late on Thursday night.

The police said that Pandi had kept some 80 goats in his shed near his house. A few stray dogs that got into the shed started to fiercely attack the goats at around 10 p.m. Though the farmer managed to chase away the dogs, by then the dogs had bitten several goats.

In the morning, the farmer found that 16 of them had died and five of them were badly injured.

Angered over the incident, the residents of Bodinaickenpatti dumped the carcasses of the animals in front of the Vadipatti town panchayat and staged a protest against the stray dog menace that had led to huge monetary loss to the farmer.

A total of 2,332 students received bicycles for the academic year 2019-2020. Madurai North Member of Legislative Assembly V.V. Rajan Chellappa and Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan were also present.

The MP said that the ‘super classroom’ system, where top-performing government school students were given a special coaching under one roof, was adopted in Perambalur, Kanniyakumari and Ramanathapuram districts.

“These districts are among the top districts in the State, from where a large number of government school students have got admitted to top medical and engineering colleges through merit. Hence, the civic body can adopt such a system for the benefit of our students,” he said.

The Minister said that numerous steps had been taken by the State government in the interest of the school students. The School Education Department has been provided ₹34,181.73 crore — the highest allocation for any department in this year’s State budget. He also said that smart classrooms will be introduced in six Corporation schools in Madurai. He urged the students to work hard and utilise the opportunities to become successful in life.

Mr. Visakan said that the ‘Happy Schooling’ programme, which is being implemented in 24 Corporation schools, has helped in improving the mental well-being of the students. He also said that 16 students, who have performed well in Class 10 board examinations, were given special training for competitive examinations.

318,2020/02/21,15 wards in north Madurai to get underground drainage system,"A ₹400-crore project is on the cards to build UGD system to added wards on south side of the Vaigai

Madurai used to be one of the well-planned cities in the world with a systematic sewage collection and disposal system that did not allow waste water to pollute the Vaigai. But with increasing population and urbanisation, the waste water disposal system is bursting at its seams now. Today, the waterbodies are bearing the brunt due to lack of a well-connected drainage system.

To address the issue, Madurai Corporation is providing underground drainage (UGD) facility at 15 wards in the northern parts of the city under Smart Cities Mission programme of the Central government. Residents of these wards, which were merged with the Corporation in 2011, say it is high time they had an underground drainage system.

For the ₹291.37-crore project, ₹248 crore will be routed through Smart Cities Mission programme. “The rest will be realised through connection deposits collected from users,” says an official.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says once the project is completed, the problem of sewage mixing into the Vaigai will be solved. “The gradient is such that sewage tend to flow from the north towards the south. Hence, channels on the northern parts of the city drain sewage into the Vaigai. Once the underground drainage system is in place, Vaigai river will be spared from carrying sullage even as hygiene standards improve in places north of the river,” he says.

The Area Based Development (ABD) zone under Smart Cities Mission was expanded to include the project in the interest of protecting the Vaigai from contamination. The UGD work will start in a week and will be completed in two years. Under the project, three new lift stations will be set up at Koodal Nagar, Senthur Nagar and Bharath Nagar. New sewage pumping stations will come up at Vandiyur, Vilangudi and Anaiyur. These stations will be connected to the sewage pumping station at Munthirithoppu from where waste water will be directed to the sewage treatment plant at Sakkimangalam.

New status, old woes

In 2011, the number of wards under the Corporation’s purview was expanded from 72 to 100. But the 28 new wards lacked drinking water pipelines and underground drainage systems. Residents often connected their septic tanks and discharged their domestic waste directly into the water and irrigation channels.

G. Mathiapidaran of S. Alangulam, where underground drainage has been proposed, says for the past 15 years untreated sewage from houses flow into the water channel of Alangulam tank. “The stream, which is already choked with plastic waste and garbage, is almost in a solidified state. It causes mosquito breeding, which worsens during rains. People often fell sick as untreated sewage flows in the open,” he says.

The sewage released from households from the northern side of the city ultimately drains into the Vaigai through chains of interconnected tanks and feeder channels.

Even in areas where underground drainage pipelines were laid by the residents under the ‘Nammakku Namey’ scheme, the pipelines were ultimately connected to the waterbodies. For instance, waste water from residences in Gomathipuram, Vandiyur, Tahsildar Nagar and Melamadai are discharged through an irrigation channel that drains into the Vaigai.

Urban flooding

S. Elamuhil, Project Executive with Dhan Foundation’s CURE, says that when sewage released into the channel becomes stagnant due to dumping of garbage by residents, it leads to sedimentation in the channel. “This reduces its carrying capacity. Similarly, when sewage stagnates in water tanks, it reduces storage capacity. So, waterbodies, which are important to control floods, store less water, leading to inundation. It happened in Mahalakshmi Nagar during rainy season two years back,” he says.

These tanks also help in recharging groundwater. Hence, there are probabilities that the groundwater can become contaminated in the long run, he adds.

“But the underground drainage system, a long demand of the residents, will solve all these problems,” says D. Raghavan, president, Gomathipuram and Thendral Nagar Residents Welfare Association.

Another proposal

The Corporation Commissioner says a detailed project report with an estimate of ₹400 crore is being prepared for constructing a underground drainage system to the added wards on the south side of the Vaigai. “This will ensure that underground drainage facility is present throughout the city,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dh8eda/article30877619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MACITY-PKMNAGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/15-wards-in-north-madurai-to-get-underground-drainage-system/article30877623.ece

320,2020/02/21,‘Need to maintain peace among communities’,"‘Praja Bharat’ campaign launched

N.K. Mohammed Shaafi Saadi, a member of the State Wakf Board, said on Thursday that Hindus, Muslims and other communities have lived together in peace and harmony in the country for centuries and need to maintain these good relations.

He was speaking at the launch of the Statewide ‘Praja Bharat’ campaign organised by the Karnataka Muslim Jamaath here. The campaign will culminate after 55 days on April 14.

Mr. Saadi said Hindus, Muslims and other communities had fought together for the independence of the country, but this harmony was now under threat because of the “strategies of some political parties”.

“The Muslim community should not fall prey to such political machinations. Issues such as Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens, AND National Population Register should be fought legally,” he said. “Such issues should not affect the harmonious relations that the Muslim community has had with other communities in the country. Hence, the tagline of the ‘Praja Bharat’ campaign is ‘give up hatred, build the country’,” he said.

Question to Muslims

He said the country should run according to the Constitution drafted by B.R. Ambedkar, not according to the manifesto of a political party. “But Muslims should ask themselves why they are still backward in spite of 70 years of independence, while other communities have progressed in the country,” he said.

Mr. Saadi also said that when asked by the media recently about some students raising pro-Pakistan slogans in Hubballi, he had replied that they should be given maximum punishment.

Mohammed Faazil Razvi, vice-president of Karnataka Muslim Jamaath, said Muslims were proud Indians and were ready to sacrifice for the country. “We love our country as much as we love our parents,” he said.

321,2020/02/21,Fish wastewater spillage leading to accidents in Mangaluru,"A father-daughter duo were on their way to Kendriya Vidyalaya 2 from Hampanakatte via Mangaladevi Road on a scooter on Thursday morning. While the father was negotiating a small curve in front of Rim Zim Apartments, the scooter toppled and they fell on the road.

The rider was neither speeding nor applying brakes while negotiating the curve; the culprit was the wastewater spilled by a fish-transporting vehicle that must have passed by that area a while before. Fortunately, the two were not hurt and left the place after being helped by onlookers.

Despite several drives and warnings by the Mangaluru City Traffic Police, the fish transporters appear not bothered about preventing spillage of wastewater. The menace is more pronounced on two important roads that lead outside the city from the Bunder area. One is the Mangaladevi-Morgan’s Gate-Mahakalipadpu Road and the other is Kulur Ferry Road, passing via Kudroli. The vehicles that leave Bunder early in the morning continue to spill wastewater on their way out of the city, endangering lives.

Though the city police were able to compel fish-transporting vehicles to install wastewater tanks, only large vehicles appear to have followed the practice. Yet, some of them keep the taps of those tanks open so as to drain out wastewater. On the other hand, many light commercial vehicles, including three-wheelers, have not installed tanks at all, leaving wastewater to spill on to the road all along.

322,2020/02/21,"Blue-eared kingfisher, grey-bellied cuckoo seen at Mangalore University","The blue-eared kingfisher and grey-bellied cuckoo were among the more than 100 species of birds sighted on the Mangalore University campus, spread over about 300 acres, during the campus bird count a few days ago.

“Blue-eared kingfisher and grey-bellied cuckoo were rarely sighted on the campus. They are new additions to the avian list here,” said Vivek Hasyagar, a research scholar from the Department of Applied Zoology, and Maxim Rodrigues, a final-year student from the Department of Marine Geology, who coordinated the activity.

The bird count was conducted for four days from February 14. The university has been participating in the campus bird count, a sub-event of ‘Great Backyard Bird Count’ organised by Bird Count India, for the past five years.

Birdwatchers sighted 103 species of birds on the campus this year, they said, adding that yellow-billed babbler sightings were rare on the campus.

Among the other birds spotted were black drongo, black kite, brahminy kite, common iora, green warbler, purple-rumped sunbird, red-whiskered bulbul, white-cheeked barbet, jungle babbler, and plum-headed parakeets.

Birdwatchers sighted house crow with nest and nestlings, Indian robin nests with eggs, and bronzed drongo constructing a nest. Migratory birds such as ashy drongo, barn swallow, booted eagle, grey wagtail, and Indian pitta were also sighted.

Other birds such as grey-headed bulbul (which is a nearly threatened species), rufous babbler, and grey-headed bulbul were endemic to the Western Ghats, and nocturnal birds such as brown wood owl, barn owl, spotted owlet, nightjars (Savanna, Indian and Jerdon’s), and Sri Lanka frogmouth were also sighted.

Survey trails were led by more than 60 students and research scholars from various gepartments of Mangalore University, including Applied Zoology, Biosciences, Microbiology, Botany, Physics, Chemistry, and Material Science. Some birdwatchers from St. Aloysius College were also involved.

Species counted

The campus had recorded 77 species in 2016, 95 in 2017, and 110 in 2018. Last year, 107 species were recorded.

Some of the common species such as rose-ringed parakeets, blue-tailed bee-eater, Nilgiri flowerpecker, and Indian roller sighted last year were not seen this year. “But with two new additions in this year’s bird count, the checklist of Mangalore University campus has been updated with a total of 141 species.”

The birdwatchers also extinguished a fire noticed in the laterite grasslands on campus during the counting.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/xt1kma/article30874395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMANGKINGFIGHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/blue-eared-kingfisher-grey-bellied-cuckoo-seen-at-mangalor-university/article30874396.ece

324,2020/02/21,Govt. may bundle power sources for grid stability,"Plan offers hope for stressed assets

In what may be good news for stranded power assets, the government plans to bundle renewable with conventional power to address the issue of grid stability.

Over 20,000 mega watts (MW) of power assets in Indian have been stranded since the last one year for various reasons, including uneconomic operations, lack of power purchase and fuel supply agreements, according to the Central Electricity Authority data.

Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimates that India’s thermal generation sector alone is carrying $40-60 billion in non-performing, or stranded assets, supported by the troubled banking sector.

With government’s focus on renewables, India is committed to achieve its goal of reaching 175 GW of renewable sources-based installed capacity by 2022, which includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW from small hydro power.

Further, the government has committed to increase this capacity to 450 GW by 2030 so as to achieve 40% of installed power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources and also by 2030, reduce emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 % from the 2005 level.

However, experts have raised serious concerns on the impact by the nature of intermittent power generated from renewable sources and its implications on the grid safety. On the other hand, over 20GW of stranded thermal power assets are lying unutilised which can provide firm power to the grid.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has announced a draft renewable-based, round-the-clock (RTC) hybrid tender by virtue of which conventional and non-conventional resources complement each other and provide sustainable power to the grid.

“This would provide relief to bankers as it would offer opportunity for stressed thermal assets also to participate and thereby reduce NPAs in excess of ₹1 lakh crore,” Kavita Sharma, head, energy, at Assocham told The Hindu.

The solution truly integrates the renewable energy in the energy mix at source itself and is a significant step to make renewable energy as core source and base load. The objective is to provide RTC power to the DISCOMs through bundling of RE power with thermal power.

“[The] scheme will also help with utilisation of untied thermal power capacity, specially since the new super critical coal-based thermal power plants have quite a high ramp rate which can be effectively utilised to provide combined renewable energy blended RTC power,” said Association of Power Producers (APP) in a statement.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-may-bundle-power-sources-for-grid-stability/article30883414.ece
325,2020/02/21,"UBI, OBC want a new name for merged entity","PNB disagrees with the proposal

With Punjab National Bank (PNB), Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and United Bank of India (UBI) set to merge, OBC and UBI have requested the Finance Ministry to consider a new name for the merged entity.

If the Ministry agrees to the request, then this will a departure from the precedent set by the merger of Bank of Baroda (BoB), Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank that took effect this financial year. In that merger, BoB, which was the transferee bank, retained the name. Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank were transferor banks.

Pan-India presence

In the case of PNB, OBC and UBI merger, PNB will be transferee bank. The other two banks are of the view that the name of the merged entity should reflect a pan-India presence and not have a localised name.

Hence, OBC and UBI have requested the Ministry to consider a new name.

However, the idea of a new name does not seem to have gone down well with PNB — the largest bank in the merger. The lender took to social media a few days ago to clarify there was no proposal to change the name of the bank.

Regulatory clearances

In fact, during the BoB-Dena-Vijaya merger, Dena and Vijaya also proposed a name change. However, many regulatory clearances are required for a name change, including from the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Since the process would have been time-consuming, the Ministry refrained from approving a name change.

However, it is not unusual for Indian banks to change their name due to a merger, or otherwise. Most recently, after IDFC Bank and Capital First, an NBFC, merged, the name of the merged entity was IDFC First Bank.

Also, erstwhile Ratnakar Bank was renamed as RBL Bank and Catholic Syrian Bank is now known as CSB Bank.

The government expects all the mergers of public sector banks, which were announced in 2019, to become effective from April 1.

Apart from PNB, UBI and OBC, the government had also announced three other sets of mergers — Union Bank of India, Corporation Bank and Andhra Bank; Allahabad Bank and Indian Bank; and, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.

The government is yet to announce the scheme of amalgamation for these mergers for which Cabinet approval is required. Once the scheme of amalgamation is announced, there will be clarity on the name of the new entities.

In the case of the BoB, Vijaya and Dena merger, the scheme of amalgamation was announced in early January last year and the merger came into effect from 1 April, 2019.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/5nilnl/article30883380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUPNB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ubi-obc-want-a-new-name-for-merged-entity/article30883381.ece
326,2020/02/21,ITC eyes big bite of chocolate market,"FMCG major ropes in top global cocoa suppliers, to work with cocoa farmers

FMCG conglomerate ITC aims to garner a dominant share in the country’s ₹11,000 crore chocolate market.

The company said it was chasing ‘big’ success in the chocolate business, similar to what it had already seen in categories such as atta, noodles and biscuits.

In an exclusive chat with The Hindu, Anuj Rustagi, chief operating officer — Chocolates, Coffee and New Categories — Food Division, ITC Ltd., said, “We did proper due diligence and study of the market before we debuted, with Fabelle. Our view in the near term is to have a dominant market share, similar to what ITC has achieved in many food categories.”'

According to Mr. Rustagi, a market analysis identified a set of consumers who look at chocolates for self-indulgence, while some may look at it as a a gifting or a snacking option. “While we are currently operating in the self-indulgence and the gifting space, in the near future, we wish to be present in as many segments as possible and cater to every chocolate loving consumer’s needs.”

He said the company had initially invested ₹100 crore to set up a greenfield chocolate manufacturing facility in Haridwar with a capacity of 5,000 tonnes per annum. In addition to this, another factory was opened in Bengaluru exclusively for making luxury chocolates.

Cold chain efficiency

The company has also invested in the global cooling technologies and real-time digital monitoring systems to ensure the cold chain remained efficient without downtime.

To ensure supply of prime-quality cocoa, ITC has roped in top global cocoa suppliers from Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Venezuela, Madagascar and India. It has plans to work with cocoa farmers directly in future.

“We executed innumerable trials and extensive research in our pursuit to craft the finest luxury chocolates in India and invested in training and getting the best talent and master chocolatiers.”

Mr. Rustagi said chocolate connoisseurs in the country had been appreciative of chocolate from ITC. “The overwhelming response we received, after launching Ruby Gianduja in the luxury segment, prompted us to extend the experience of Ruby Chocolate to the larger consumer base and hence the launch of Fabelle Choco Deck Milk and Ruby Chocolate varieties.”

India’s chocolate market is pegged at ₹11,000 crore, of which premium chocolates can be sized anywhere between 10% and 15%.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/18sj1r/article30906282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ITCchocolate,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/itc-eyes-big-bite-of-chocolate-market/article30883352.ece
327,2020/02/21,"Telcos facing ‘unprecedented crisis,’ says Airtel's Sunil Mittal","Vodafone Idea Ltd is the company that is said to be the most vulnerable following the Supreme Court’s order.

Amid a deepening crisis in the telecom sector, the government is looking to strike a balance between complying with the Supreme Court order on AGR dues, ensuring health of the sector and safeguarding consumer interest, even as Bharti Airtel’s Sunil Mittal continued to seek prompt measures.

Vodafone Idea Ltd, the company that is said to be the most vulnerable following the apex court’s order, paid another ₹1,000 crore on Thursday, while Mr. Mittal’s Bharti Airtel promised to clear all dues, as per its calculations, “expeditiously” and before March 17 deadline.

But Mr. Mittal, who followed up his meeting with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday with another one with Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday, wanted the government to cut taxes for the health of the sector.

A top government official, who did not wish to be named, said the attempts are being made to balance the need for health of the sector, consumer interest while complying with the Supreme Court order on statutory dues.

Although the official did not elaborate, sector watchers said the statement alludes to the government keen on ensuring adequate competition by retaining the present three-plus-one model of competition (three private players and one public sector company).

Vodafone Idea, which as per the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) owes over ₹53,000 crore in dues, paid ₹1,000 crore more to take its total payout this week to ₹3,500 crore. This together with ₹10,000 crore that Bharti Airtel had paid and another ₹2,197 crore paid by Tata Teleservices has taken the payments collected so far to almost ₹16,000 crore.

Some companies have assured they will make additional payments in next 7-8 days, the sources said. The government will, meanwhile, verify the companies’ claims on AGR-math and examine any deviations from its own calculation, through random ‘test checks’ before March 17, sources said.

This will be done by the government doing a ‘test check’ for any one year (of telcos’ dues) to examine variances between telecom companies’ assessment and the government calculation of AGR liabilities.

The ‘test check’ will happen for all telecom firms, but will start with those which have already claimed they have made full and final settlement towards their statutory liabilities. The exercise will help the department assess the gap between telcos’ claim of what their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues are and its own estimates, sources added.

Since the February 14 tongue lashing Supreme Court gave telecom companies for missing its previous deadline of January 23 to pay past dues as well as the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) for failing to enforce it, firms and Prasad’s ministry are doing separate maths on the actual dues.

The DoT had previously estimated ₹1.47 lakh crore as dues, including penalty and interest, from Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other firms. But telecom firms say the amount should be lower. The DoT too is doing its own stress test to double-check telcos’ numbers.

Emerging from the meeting with the telecom minister, Mr. Mittal termed AGR as an “unprecedented crisis” for the industry.

Stating that the telecom sector is “heavily taxed”, Mr. Mittal said levies need to be looked at as the industry has low revenue left in the kitty. He said that the government is fully focused towards the digital sector, and all discussions so far indicate that “government is alive to the situation“.

“...the AGR hit that has come in, also needs to be dealt with,” Mr. Mittal said.

Mr. Mittal said that he has assured the Minister that the company is committed to complying with the SC judgement, and that balance payments will be made “expeditiously“.

“We have time till March 17, much before that we will finish everything,” he pointed out.

Mr. Mittal said that he had pitched for measures for sustainability of the sector, through rationalisation of taxes and levies.

On whether the issue of setting floor price for tariffs also figured at the meeting with the Minister, Mr. Mittal said that was under the TRAI’s domain.

“But it is also true that the industry’s revenue has collapsed and that needs to go up. We talked of rationalisation, reduction of taxes, levies, this has been our demand for a long time...the regulator has been supporting it,” Mr. Mittal said.

Earlier in the day, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman R.S. Sharma also met the Telecom Minister but did not comment on the details of the meeting.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lwlath/article30878263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHARTIMITTAL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-looks-at-balancing-act-on-agr-dues-sunil-mittal-says-telcos-facing-unprecedented-crisis/article30878255.ece
328,2020/02/21,Staying neutral in moments of cultural friction,"Reporting on the nuances of parenting across cultures has its own challenges

With less than a week to go before the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to India, mainstream and social media conversations on the subject have centred on what the summit meeting could mean for bilateral ties, prospects for a trade deal, security questions, and a fixation on guesstimating the likely strength of the crowds that will attend. However thrilling the optics may be, or however sparkling the personal chemistry between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is worth remembering that in the longest arc of cooperation between the world’s oldest and largest democracies it is not only governments that matter but people-to-people relations.

In this context, there are many signs of organic convergence that has happened in recent decades, including the spread of the classic, consumer-focused, consumption-driven models of Western capitalism seeping into every pore of Indian culture and, conversely, the proliferation of yoga, Indian cuisine and lifestyle habits getting transmitted from the subcontinent to the U.S.

Yet there are still points of dissonance that become evident now and again, often quite controversially. One such source of cultural friction that I encountered and reported on more than once during my time as The Hindu’s U.S. correspondent goes to the very heart of each country’s value system: parenting. Almost with clockwork regularity, every few years an Indian immigrant family in the U.S. would find themselves in a crisis after the courts or social services took their children into protective custody or arrested a parent on suspicions of abuse towards a child.

In several cases that I reported on, the troubles began during a doctor’s visit, ostensibly a routine matter from the perspective of the parents. Typically, the physician would identify medical symptoms that raised a red flag according to a predetermined list of objective criteria for potential cases of abuse. One example is retinal damage, which is consistent with ‘shaken baby syndrome’. After interviewing the parents, separately and together, and potentially interviewing the child without the parents present, the physician would, perhaps along with a social worker, draw up a report testifying to the possibility of abuse.

At this point the case would usually enter a grey area depending on the specific reason for the injuries given by the parents. In one case that I examined, the father and mother were on the same page as they described how their child had been taken away from them by hospital staff after they reported head injuries that the child had suffered after falling off a bed. In another case a child reported a tibia fracture while engaged in play with a parent, yet a lack of consistency between the parents’ accounts regarding how the accident occurred led to suspicions that resulted in the father facing criminal charges and a ban on meeting his family.

In each of these cases the biggest challenge as a reporter was to remain, in the absence of overwhelming evidence or a conviction by a court, neutral in the sense of not taking the parents’ side or backing the host country government’s position. While I‘d like to think that The Hindu’s U.S. reportage held firm to this standard, to this day I have not figured out whether the authorities in each case were being overzealous, or whether the tenets of “Indian-style parenting” were strongly at odds with a more universal conception of child rights.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wb1i8b/article30874952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Modi-trumpjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/staying-neutral-in-moments-of-cultural-friction/article30873438.ece
329,2020/02/21,Iran parliamentary elections: Advantage hardliners,"With legitimacy of the reformists eroding in Iran, hardliners are expected to win big

The parliamentary elections in Iran come at a critical time for the Islamic regime. Unlike the previous elections where hardliners already in power fought against moderate and pro-reform figures seeking a comeback, this year’s elections hold huge importance for the future of the Iranian regime. The events of the past four months, starting with the social turmoil in cities in November 2019 until the shooting down of the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 on January 8 , 2020, not only shifted back the global attention to Iran, but also eroded much of the political legitimacy of the Iranian regime. The brutal response of Tehran’s authorities to the unrest in the country after the government announced a 33% increase in fuel prices created distrust of the regime. The regime’s popularity faded even more after the government lied for days about what caused Flight 752 to crash and finally admitted downing the plane. As a result, many Iranians are frustrated by the whole nomenclature, either hardliners or moderates, and will probably not participate in the elections.

Disqualification of moderates

The low turnout would make it impossible for the regime to pretend that it could prevail ideologically against U.S. President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure strategy. This comes as a surprise more than 40 days after the assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani at the orders of Mr. Trump in Iraq, which seemed to have helped the regime in Tehran on the domestic front and paused the anti-Iran regional outcry in Iraq and Lebanon. In a poll conducted by the Institute of Social Studies and Research at Tehran University, over 76% of the population across Tehran province said they will not take part in the elections. In addition, of more than 15,000 people who applied to run for parliament, 7,296 were disqualified by the Guardian Council from running. The 12-member Guardian Council consists of six Shiite clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader and six lawyers elected by parliament. It is charged with ensuring that draft laws do not contradict religious laws or Iran’s constitution, and overseeing elections and legislation. On paper, running for parliament is open to all Iranians who are between the ages of 30 and 75 years, but this time many reformist contenders were disqualified in the majority of constituencies due to embezzlement and corruption. As a result, hardliners are expected to win big. The Iranian government announced this month that it was preparing a new draft law for a referendum that would limit the powers of the Guardian Council of the Constitution. Even if this law is accepted, it will not take effect for these polls.

The disqualification of moderate candidates is the biggest cause of discontent for the Iranians. With hardliners in control, the government is set to lead to an even more aggressive foreign policy. Also, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) will see its power more strengthened than before as a result of the elections. With President Hassan Rouhani’s camp being weakened, Iran doesn’t look likely to produce a détente with the U.S. and EU. Though reformists could try to reunite as some kind of an opposition to a monopoly of power by hardliners, the truth is that they have lost a great deal of legitimacy and credibility in Iran over the years. Young Iranians have been disillusioned with Mr. Rouhani’s government and angered by poverty, high unemployment and corruption. As a result, for many of those who will not vote in the elections, one of the main reasons is also that Mr. Rouhani and his reformist Cabinet distanced themselves from the millions who voted for them in the presidential elections on promises of reform and action against corruption. Also, it is true that with the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration and designed to bring Iran to heel, Iranian hardliners, especially members of the IRGC, seem to have become even more assertive and ready to close ranks. Therefore, what the upcoming elections show clearly is that despite decline of legitimacy, the establishment tries to remain united, because as long as it is united, the Islamic Republic will likely continue to survive.

330,2020/02/21,What distinguishes welfare measures from freebies?,"Adequate fiscal space and socioeconomic context should be the basis for welfare policies

There is an overwhelming consensus that a slew of welfare policies initiated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in its previous term secured the party’s victory in the 2020 Delhi Assembly election. In a conversation moderated by Jayant Sriram, Reetika Khera (Developmental economist and Associate Professor at The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad) and Lekha Chakraborty (Professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy and Research Associate , Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, New York) discuss the rudiments of good spending and bad spending by governments:

Many say that welfare policies helped AAP win the Assembly election. There are two aspects to this. The first is spending on education and health, which is the fundamental obligation of the governement to provide for its citizens; the second aspect is offering water and electricity free and at subsidised rates. Yet they are clubbed together when people argue that the AAP doled out ‘freebies’. Is the word ‘freebies’ an elitist construct? There was a similar criticism of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005. It involved discussions on how ‘somebody would have to pay for the subsidy’.

Reetika Khera: I think there is a general problem with the mainstream media in India. Very often, when speaking about programmes of redistribution such as MGNREGA, the labels that are used are quite derogatory. I think [providing] healthcare and education are basically the functions of the government. That’s part of the reason why governments exist in the first place. [It’s the same with] water and electricity or public services. So, calling them ‘doles’ or ‘freebies’ isn’t exactly the right terminology.

Lekha Chakraborty: Talking about freebies sounds like some kind of private spending and “client-ism”, trying to sell it to a certain set of people. But that is not what happened in the Delhi election. The focus was on providing basic services in health and education and addressing any deficits in governance. I don’t know whether the term ‘freebies’ exists in economics. You’re right, perhaps it’s an elitist construct, but it’s not accurate in describing what happened in Delhi.

How does one explain state spending on welfare measures? What do we consider good spending and what is bad or fiscally irresponsible spending, given that AAP currently has a revenue surplus budget?

Reetika Khera: If the state spending on welfare is not legitimate, then what is a legitimate thing for it to spend on? A part of the function of the government is that for things that we cannot individually organise, we entrust elected representatives to do for us. Public goods/services — sewage, drinking water, water, electricity, public transport — are one set of things; education and health are what we call ‘merit goods’. And they are the kinds of things where the market mechanism is not a satisfactory mechanism to deliver these things. And this is not just an Indian thing, world over, this is a well-understood principle.

Lekha Chakraborty: It depends on the fiscal space you have. And within this fiscal space how you design public benefits is entirely [up to] that party or government. So the distinction between welfare and non-welfare is kind of blurred. What is important is basically the public finance or the fiscal space question. What’s important is stability of revenue in how you design your public benefits. I think the Delhi government has that stability of revenue, whether it’s the present government or the previous government, there is the comfort of having stability in revenue that other States do not have, so that’s a position of strength. Second, providing these things for free is giving income in hand, a kind of disposable income to the people. Whether it’s giving them free transport rides or free electricity, it is giving them disposable income to spend on something else which becomes important at a time of economic slowdown.

Reetika Khera: I think that often when people talk about the availability of fiscal space, the focus is only on the expenditure side and not enough attention is paid to revenue. Even in Delhi, there is great potential for increasing revenue. The second thing is good welfare spending, whether it’s on health, education or public transport, at the Central level is very low. So, what AAP did in the last term was try to bring it closer to what it should be.

Various State governments have schemes in the name of welfare. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, Amma canteens that provide cheap food are good but other policies like giving free grinders/computers/cycles are seen as problematic. Where do we draw the line?

Reetika Khera: Each of these has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The first thing to start with, of course, is the state’s ability to finance these things. And when I say finance, let me reiterate that the focus should be both on the expenditure side as well as its ability to generate revenues. Let me give you a small example in Jharkhand that illustrates the complexity of these issues. We learned recently that the State provides an exemption from registration duty for properties that are valued at more than ₹50 lakh if they’re registered in the names of women. Now, we know that women’s property rights are important, but weak. But these are properties that are worth ₹50 lakh and, according to the bureaucrat who told us, it costs the exchequer a few hundred crores annually. So, you know, it’s a question of balancing priorities and it’s always tricky.

Now, as far as free grinders are concerned, it’s a huge labour-saving device, especially in a State like Tamil Nadu where rice is always being ground to make idli or dosai. Ultimately, one would have to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis depending not only on the benefits in some cases but also on the cost side.

Lekha Chakraborty: Good welfare and bad welfare is context-specific. If I’m a girl going to school, then mobility is very precious to me. So, if a politician is providing cycles to girls, that is very valuable. And in the case of grinders, you can say it’s giving people more time to pursue other things and that can ultimately have a positive effect on income poverty as well. Similarly, with rural employment guarantee, I don’t know why the government is not giving adequate emphasis for this because when all else fails, the government acting as ‘the employer of last resort’ is very precious.

One criticism of welfare policies is they can be targeted at certain communities and groups. Then it becomes a somewhat cynical political act.

Lekha Chakraborty: Any state, or an entity that you call a state, is a heterogenous thing. You have to take into account the religious composition, the urban-rural mix, maybe the level of the economic development, all of these things matter. Governance structures and political decisions are then built around that. So, as long as there is no implicit crony contractual relationship between the government in power and the specific interest groups they are focusing on, it’s okay. All governments focus on winning over a group called swing voters and they look at how to make things attractive to those voters, but as long as there is no implicit crony contractual relationship or something like that, it’s okay.

Reetika Khera: When we speak of crony contracts, such clientelism also works in the award of contracts for infrastructure, possibly much more than in the design of welfare programmes. In general, I’m in favour of universal forms of public support and I think the principle of it is quite important. You can’t say some people have the right to food or water or employment more than others. And then of course there is the need to remedy existing social and economic inequality.

Building on what they have already achieved, what should be on the agenda for the AAP government this term?

Reetika Khera: It would be good to see the introduction of nutritious superfoods (such as eggs in midday meals and Integrated Child Development Services), much greater attention to children under six. Interventions like Amma canteens — which exist in Delhi, but their importance is not fully recognised — and health-related interventions — including, but not only Mohalla clinics — need to be scaled up. As far as public services are concerned, more attention to better sewage, drinking water supply, and, most importantly, the twin issue of public transport and pollution. There is so much that can be done even without increasing budgets — for example, if existing buses ran on time, rather than being clubbed; feeder services from residential colonies to metro stations will help car users switch to metro services. Higher parking (and other) fees for those who use cars to discourage them from polluting the city further. There’s also a no-go list that I have: no to expensive and often useless CCTVs. Focus on better street lighting instead. In the public distribution system, they seem to have a plan to start “home delivery” of PDS commodities. That is a bad idea, because distribution in a public place in front of others is a big protection against corruption.

Between 12 and 2 p.m., on any day, you should go and stand on the road outside AIIMS. It’s really heartbreaking how poor patients who have come to Delhi for treatment... their families are often sleeping outside on the footpath and then some NGO-type people come with trucks and they distribute food and people have to queue up. So the indignity involved with just the most basic need like this is something that Delhi should be working much more towards.

Lekha Chakraborty: What is still fresh in my mind is the Nirbhaya case. Things have not improved. And the government is not focusing much attention on the security of women and girls after sunset. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why the Congress lost actually. Because they were doing good things in terms of infrastructure and constructing flyovers and the like, but when it came to the narrative about security of citizens in the capital city, there wasn’t much focus. So I would like them to focus on that as a first priority. Then, of course, there is social infrastructure like health and education that Reetika rightly pointed out.

The argument about welfare policies, in Delhi and elsewhere, is that it takes money away that could be spent on roads and infrastructure. How do we square this?

Lekha Chakraborty: Infrastructure is one thing, but as an economy develops, a group of people are kept vulnerable. So, to remove their un-freedoms, and for them to participate in the economy and to access schools and colleges, we need to have public policies which tackle these logical entry barriers. So, ‘leave nobody behind’ should be the crux of a public policy or a welfare policy, rather than just thinking that roads and the public infrastructure should be [most important]. You need to remove many barriers that people face first.

331,2020/02/21,Gearing up to fight the next big viral outbreak,"Indian States should regularly test their preparedness to not just diagnose and treat diseases, but also to prevent them

India is ill-prepared to deal with the new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing worldwide panic. Policymakers must take forceful action to prevent the spread of the new virus and heed the urgent warnings of global public health professionals about new pathogens. The consequences of not doing this will be dire for all densely populated countries.

The World Health Organization (WHO)’s Global Health Security Index finds that no country is adequately prepared. It assesses 195 countries across six categories — prevention, early detection, rapid response, health system quality, standards, and the risk environment. India is ranked 57th. That the country scores around the global average is no comfort, because the global average is a low 40.2 out of 100, and India’s score is 46.5. (For the record, the U.S. is ranked first and China 51st).

4-point health agenda

The prospect of new outbreaks puts four items on the health agenda in the spotlight that require both immediate and longer-term action: early detection and prevention; better collaboration across health service providers; more investment in health systems, outcomes, and education; and better care of the environment and biodiversity, which directly affects people’s health safety.

That Thailand is ranked sixth in the Health Security Index — the highest ranking for an Asian country — says a great deal about the country’s track record in disease prevention, early detection, and rapid response linked to investments in its public health system. When the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also caused by a coronavirus, broke out in 2015, Thailand quickly notified the WHO of its first confirmed case and acted transparently to arrest the spread — in stark contrast to delayed notification by China’s officials of the recent outbreak.

The influenza A (H1N1) outbreaks since 2009 in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and other States have acutely underscored the need for better detection, awareness of symptoms and quarantining. The Pune-based National Institute of Virology has been designated as a WHO H5 reference laboratory. Yet, clearer protocols for all three types of surveillance are needed in all States, and these protocols need to be communicated to health professionals at all levels and the public in local languages.

One lesson of the 2008 global financial crisis was the need for countries to conduct regular stress tests on their financial systems, an exercise that has proved valuable. Countries need to do the same for their preparedness to deal with health emergencies. Each State in India should do this to expose crucial gaps in areas such as adequacy and supply of diagnostic equipment, health facilities, hygienic practices, and prevention and treatment protocols. Alarming scenes of queues of desperate shoppers trying to buy hand sanitisers, face masks and other protective products in Hong Kong and China highlight the need for strong supply chains for products that people need during health emergencies. China is realising, at a chilling cost to the safety of its health workers, the difficulty of ensuring enough supplies so that it can avert panic buying.

This is where partnership can come in — partnerships between private and public sectors, and between countries — that can sustain supply chains and bolster the medical capacity of countries struggling to cope. In Asia, collaborative approaches exist, for example, for combating tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria. But more is needed to tackle health emergencies on the scale of recent outbreak, particularly on funding. There could be an emergency loan facility, with a “deferred drawdown option” as the World Bank uses for disasters, natural or health, that can help augment own resources in times of a public health catastrophe.

But the best defence of all is to invest more, and more efficiently, in health and education to prepare populations and strengthen health services. Health expenditure by the government in India is less than 1.5% of Gross Domestic Product, which is low for a middle-income country. Spending at that level limits, among other things, the availability of health professionals during crises. According to WHO, India has only 80 doctors per 1,00,000 people.

Investing in education, health

Kerala’s experience in 2018 with the deadly Nipah virus showed the value of investing in education and health over the long term. The availability of equipment for quick diagnosis, measures to prevent diseases from spreading, and public information campaigns all helped to keep the mortality rate from the Nipah virus relatively low. Having capable public health professionals helped in the information exchange with WHO and other international bodies.

One of the many dimensions of new pathogens that is getting increased attention is the link with environmental degradation. The interaction between particulate matter from pollution and viral respiratory tract infections, especially in the young and the elderly, as well as the malnourished, has been increasingly noted in epidemiological studies. Many of the highest air pollution readings are being recorded in Indian cities.

India’s health status is being worsened by climate shocks. An HSBC study of 67 countries ranks India as the most climate-vulnerable one because of the impact of severe temperature increases and declines in rainfalls. The effects of such occurrences are magnified by the high density of the country’s population, the sheer number of people in harm’s way, and the high incidence of poverty. Research is increasingly connecting global warming to vector-borne viruses.

The recent outbreak in China — with the SARS-CoV-2 having believed to have emanated in a market where wild animals were sold — highlights the biodiversity link. Nearly two-thirds of known pathogens and three-quarters of newly emerging pathogens are spread from animals to humans. This dangerous trend for disease spillovers from animals to humans can be traced to increased human encroachment on wildlife territory; land-use changes that increase the rate of human-wildlife and wildlife-livestock interactions; and climate change. Protecting the precious biodiversity should be a priority.

More outbreaks are likely in the future; the best response is better preparedness.

332,2020/02/21,ART of life: On Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation Bill,"The Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation Bill is a much-needed complement to Surrogacy Bill

Sometimes, the leash follows the dog, but given the importance of control, the sequence can seem insignificant. It only matters that there remains a good hold over the circumstances. No matter then, that the Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation (ART) Bill, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet this week, came after the Surrogacy Bill that it should have preceded. Together, the ART Bill; the Surrogacy Bill; the amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act; and the older Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act present a bouquet of legislation that will have a positive impact on the reproductive rights and choices of women in India. The ART Bill to regulate clinics offering fertility treatments has been long in the works, and was first presented publicly way back in 2008. ART measures help couples unable to conceive naturally to bear children with the aid of state-of-the-art technology to achieve pregnancy, leading to safe delivery. India has a rich history of employing ART, though the initial years went officially undocumented at that time. In the late 1970s, only months after the birth of Louise Brown, the first ‘test tube baby’, Kolkata-based doctor Subhas Mukherjee announced the birth of the world’s second test tube baby. Subsequently, the industry saw phenomenal growth, as infertility rates went up. A market projection (by Fortune Business Insights) said the size of the ART market is expected to reach $45 billion by 2026. Among Asian countries, India’s ART market is pegged at third position. A lack of regulation and the consequent laxity in operations drove a lot of traffic from other nations to India. This, in turn, along with the relatively low costs, led to the mushrooming of ART clinics across the country. Undoubtedly, this also led to a plethora of legal, social and ethical issues.

It is at this juncture that the ART Bill has seen a fitting revival, egged on by legislators who facilitated the passage of the Surrogacy Bill in the Rajya Sabha. It seeks to regulate and monitor ART procedures, and mandates the establishment of a National Board and State Boards to lay down rules for implementation, and also honours a long-pending demand — creation of a national registry, and registration authority. While the rules will handle the bells and whistles, the Bill already sets a comprehensive framework to operate on. Most significantly, the Bill recommends punishment, even jail time, for violations of the provisions. Since it does impinge on surrogacy too, the government must now work on ensuring synchrony in both Bills. Having come this far to ensure the reproductive rights of women, the state now has the thriving ART industry on a leash, and the Bill is its best chance to eliminate exploitation in the field.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/art-of-life-on-assisted-reproductive-technology-regulation-bill/article30873613.ece
333,2020/02/21,Trump cards: On U.S. President’s India visit,"Even if the Trump visit yields no big deal, some agreement on trade will be made

Ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India, some of the key deliverables from the trip, as well as the outcomes that may not be delivered after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, are coming into view. The larger question remains as to whether the bonhomie between the two, who will be meeting for the fifth time in eight months, will also spur the bilateral relationship towards broader outcomes, with expectations centred at bilateral strategic ties, trade and energy relations as well as cooperation on India’s regional environment. On the strategic front, India and the U.S. are expected to take forward military cooperation and defence purchases totalling about $3 billion. Mr. Trump has cast a cloud over the possibility of a trade deal being announced, but is expected to bring U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to give a last push towards the trade package being discussed for nearly two years. Both sides have lowered expectations of any major deal coming through, given that differences remain over a range of tariffs from both sides; market access for U.S. products; and India’s demand that the U.S. restore its GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) status. However, it would be a setback if some sort of announcement on trade is not made. A failure to do so would denote the second missed opportunity since Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s U.S. visit last September. Finally, much of the attention will be taken by India’s regional fault-lines: the Indo-Pacific strategy to the east and Afghanistan’s future to the west. India and the U.S. are expected to upgrade their 2015 joint vision statement on the Indo-Pacific to increase their cooperation on freedom of navigation, particularly with a view to containing China. Meanwhile, the U.S.-Taliban deal is expected to be finalised next week, and the two leaders will discuss India’s role in Afghanistan, given Pakistan’s influence over any future dispensation that includes the Taliban.

Any high-level visit, particularly that of a U.S. President to India, is as much about the optics as it is about the outcomes. It is clear that both sides see the joint public rally at Ahmedabad’s Motera Stadium as the centrepiece of the visit, where the leaders hope to attract about 1.25 lakh people in the audience. Despite the Foreign Ministry’s statement to the contrary, the narrative will be political. Mr. Trump will pitch the Motera event as part of his election campaign back home. By choosing Gujarat as the venue, Mr. Modi too is scoring some political points with his home State. As they stand together, the two leaders, who have both been criticised in the last few months for not following democratic norms domestically, will hope to answer their critics with the message that they represent the world’s oldest democracy and the world’s largest one, respectively.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trump-cards-the-hindu-editorial-on-us-president-donald-trumps-india-visit/article30873581.ece

335,2020/02/21,Elevators malfunction in tenements in Perumbakkam,"Residents say the elevators work only twice a week and often get stuck

On Wednesday evening, Jayanthi, a 35-year-old woman was stuck in the elevator, in the L Block in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenements, Perumbakkam. It took one hour, 15 men and a few logs to rescue her.

Residents state this is a common occurrence in the tenements and in many blocks, the elevators work only twice a week. Many persons with disabilities and the elderly are put to hardship due to this.

“Jayanthi had come to meet her friend and was stuck in the elevator on the third floor. Hearing her cry for help we rushed to her aid. Some women gave her water and fruits. Some men finally managed to open the elevator door and pull her out,” said a resident of the tenements.

Some residents claimed that it was a common occurrence in the 1st block in the new tenements. “The elevator works only twice a week and people are forced to climb the stairs. Our repeated complaints have not yielded any result,” added another woman resident.

Last year, a lift came crashing down in C Block. “Emergency Rescue Devices that brings the box to the nearest landing in case of a power cut, should be installed in the lifts. Besides, the equipment should be maintained well. The life of residents is at stake here,” she added.

A TNSCB official said that Emergency Rescue Devices are installed in all elevators, but they do not work in many of them. “We will be replacing them. We have asked lift operators to stay inside the elevator, but most often they don’t do it,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ban9lz/article30879119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FEBTH-Elevatorjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/elevators-malfunction-in-tenements-in-perumbakkam/article30879121.ece
336,2020/02/21,Chennai Metro to rope in one more contractor to finish work on two stations,"The stations are part of the phase I extension project in north Chennai

Chennai Metro Rail is now in the process of looking out for a contractor who will complete finishing work in two stations in the phase I extension project in north Chennai.

This project — covering 9 km to link Washermanpet with Wimco Nagar — that is due for opening in June this year, is facing a challenge now, as a contract was terminated. Recently, Chennai Metro Rail ended the contract worth nearly ₹370 crore with IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (ITNL) as the firm failed to meet the deadline and it was felt the progress of construction of work was poor, officials said. This firm had to build Korukkupet and Sir Theagaraya College stations in the 9 km stretch.

Following this, Chennai Metro Rail had immediately roped in two contractors to finish the remaining construction work of both these stations and the work has been on for a while now.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they want a contractor just to finish some of the interior work. “We have just called tenders now for this work. We should finalise the contract in a month and award the contract. The new firm will have to provide sanitary installations, rainwater pipes and fittings, rainwater harvesting and tube wells and other such related work as well,” an official said.

This is not the first time that CMRL had to terminate a contract in the Metro project. For instance, in the phase I project that covers 45 km of the city, Gammon India and CCCL contracts too were terminated by CMRL as the work was getting inordinately delayed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dvzbd2/article30879049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FEBTH-CMRL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-metro-to-rope-in-one-more-contractor-to-finish-work-on-two-stations/article30879050.ece
337,2020/02/21,Chennai’s Government Ophthalmic Hospital campus will soon be greener,"Apart from 36 trees that have been transplanted, 500 new saplings of native species have been planted on the premises

The campus of the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology and Government Ophthalmic Hospital, Egmore, will turn greener in a few months. The Public Works Department (PWD) has planted 500 new saplings in the premises, apart from transplanting nearly 36 trees as per a Madras High Court directive in December last year.

The trees were removed to facilitate the construction of a bi-centenary building at a cost of ₹65.60 crore, to mark 200th year of the hospital. Some of the native trees transplanted including Pungai, Kondrai and Vagai, have started blooming over the past two months.

Officials of the PWD said that besides transplanting these trees, 500 saplings of native species were planted and are being maintained in both the old and new campuses of the hospital.

Some of the saplings planted to mark World Soil Day were neem, tamarind, gulmohar, mahogany, poovarasam and magizham. “The greenery is being enhanced around the campus to maintain ecological balance,” said an official.

On the new building, the official said about 20% of the work to construct the bi-centenary building has been completed so far. The six-storey building is coming up in an area of 2,45,091 square feet. The building would have facilities such as an out-patient clinic, including squint and neuropathy speciality OPs and a retina OP; pre and post-operative wards, operation theatre complex, conference room and central sterile services department, the official said.

It may be recalled that foundation stone for the new structure was laid in November last year.

338,2020/02/21,"Kamal Haasan, Lyca Productions announce compensation","Actor stresses on need for safe working conditions, protection for technicians

Actor Kamal Haasan announced ₹1 crore compensation for families of the technicians who died, as well as for those injured in the accident on the sets of Indian 2 on Wednesday night.

Speaking to mediapersons at KMC Hospital on Thursday, Mr. Haasan said that he was not there as a representative of a film production but as a concerned family member. “I have been in this profession since I was a child. This is yet another incident which proves that this industry does not have the level of safety which is expected of it,” he said.

Stating that the compensation he offered should be viewed only as a first-aid, Mr. Haasan said that the industry should come together and take steps to ensure protection and insurance for technicians. “We boast about big budget films but it is shameful that we are not able to protect our technicians,” he said. He stressed on the responsibility of any profession including the cinema industry to ensure that technicians are protected and insured. “This is not an appeal I am making to the film industry. It is our responsibility and duty, and I am merely reiterating it,” he said.

Mr. Haasan said that it had been a narrow escape for him as well, as he was under the same canopy with the actress of the film, sometime before the crane collapsed. “The director and the cameraman had a narrow escape as they moved from there just about four seconds before the accident,” he added. Speaking about Mr. Krishna, the assistant director who was killed in the mishap, the actor said that the youngster used to work with him as an assistant. “It was only day before yesterday that he came and told me that he had joined the sets of Indian 2,” he said. Mr. Krishna is the son-in-law of cartoonist and film critic Madhan.

Director Shankar and Lyca Productions founder Subaskaran Allirajah also met the families of the deceased at KMC. Tamil Kumaran, CEO of Lyca Productions, said that they were giving ₹2 crore to the families of the deceased and those who were injured. “We will take care of all the medical expenses,” he added. Reacting to questions about safety on set, Mr. Kumaran said that they had taken adequate precautions and that the accident had been “sudden and unfortunate”.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tdkba7/article30875056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THKAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kamal-haasan-lyca-productions-announce-compensation/article30875057.ece
339,2020/02/21,‘Regular shots can keep rabies at bay’,"R. Santhanam and his wife Vadivukkarasi have no less than 16 dogs as pets and they were among the pet parents who visited the Madras Veterinary College in Vepery to vaccinate their dogs at the free anti-rabies vaccination campaign.

“Since we are treating our dogs regularly here, we were informed in advance by the doctors to participate in the vaccination drive,” said Mr. Santhanam, who hired a mini-truck to transport his dogs to the veterinary college from Tondaiarpet.

On Thursday, around 250 dogs and 24 cats were vaccinated against rabies, a deadly disease for which there is no cure. The campaign was inaugurated by C. Balachandran, vice-chancellor, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Tanuvas).

“Every year, 59,000 people die of rabies, even though it is completely preventable. Vaccinate the dog when it is three months old and give a booster shot in the fourth month. It should be followed by regular single vaccination every year,” said Dr. B. Nagarajan, professor and head, Department of Clinics, Tanuvas. In the case of pups adopted from the streets, Dr. Nagarajan advised immediate vaccination, as their mothers would not have been vaccinated.

Asked about reports that a person had died of a bite from a vaccinated healthy dog, suggesting that the animal could have been a carrier, he said there was no basis for the reports. “Dogs are not carriers of rabies, they too suffer from the disease. We have not come across cats infected with rabies in Chennai. It is rare,” he said.

Dr. Nagarajan said that dogs infected with rabies were either aggressive or dumb. “But they will manifest ascending paralysis and salivate,” he said. Director of Clinics Dr. S.

A small day care centre for alcoholic patients started by Shanthi Ranganathan at the TTK Library in 1980 has grown into a world class hospital, helping in the recovery of more than 38,000.

To mark 40 years of the centre for addiction, rehabilitation and counselling services of the T.T.Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation, a book was released at a function held in the city on Thursday.

The memoir titled ‘Planting seeds of hope, for trees of joy – a tribute’, was released by Meena Muthiah, chairman, Board of Trustees, TTK Hospital.

The memoir traces the founding of the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation by Ms. Ranganathan and helping in rebuilding the families affected by addiction to alcohol and drugs through various therapies of music, horticulture and yoga.

The book has an amalgamation of photos and write-ups that bring to the fore, the four-decade long work of Ms. Ranganathan and her team, various rehabilitation works and de-addiction systems of the foundation.

The book also displays the awards including the Padma Shri, United Nations Civil Services Award and the Avvaiyar Award, conferred on Ms. Ranganathan.

Ms. Ranganathan said the medical institution has created methodology, to treat alcholism in the country, which is being followed all over the world. She elaborated on the starting of the after care centre, relapse ward to help patients from overcoming their alcohol and drug addiction, initiatives to publish documents and books and training programmes in the field of addiction, particularly in North Eastern States.

342,2020/02/21,HC orders extensive survey of illegal bungalows from Uthandi to Mahabalipuram,"The Madras High Court has directed the State Coastal Zone Management Authority (SCZMA) to conduct an extensive survey with the assistance of revenue officials, and with police protection, to find out the exact number of unauthorised bungalows, houses, resorts, hotels, restaurants, farm houses, guest houses and other structures that have been constructed along the Bay of Bengal on the East Coast Road (ECR), beginning from Uthandi to Mahabalipuram.

A Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha wanted to know the structures that had come up on areas classified as Coastal Regulatory Zone-I and II and those that had been constructed in no development zones. After granting a month’s time to complete the survey on the entire stretch, the Bench ordered that a detailed report on the illegal structures and the nature of violations should be filed in the court by April 2.

The Bench also directed the Greater Chennai Corporation to file a status report during the next hearing on further action taken against over 700 building owners, between Neelankarai and Uthandi, to whom lock and seal notices were issued a couple of years ago for having violated coastal zone regulations. The Bench noted that the owners included film stars, top businessmen and other VIPs.

The Bench further ordered that the Corporation should put in place an effective mechanism to prevent illegal construction of buildings on the coastal area that falls within the city limits and submit its plan before the court. It pointed out that the judgement delivered by the Supreme Court in the Maradu high rise buildings demolition case would squarely apply to the buildings constructed on ECR too.

After finding that most of the constructions on the sea side of ECR had been put up after obtaining building plan approval from local panchayats, whose power to grant such approval was questionable, the judges directed the Municipal Administration Secretary to place before the court the names of the elected members of the panchayat and officials who had granted the building plan approvals to those structures.

When it was brought to the notice of the Bench that some building owners had filed statutory revision and appeal petitions before the Housing and Urban Development Secretary to get their constructions regularised, the court directed the officer to file an affidavit listing out the number of pending petitions, the current status of those pleas, whether any interim protection had been granted and the tentative time within which the appeals would be decided.

The orders were passed on a batch of cases that were pending in the court since 2002 with regard to buildings constructed within 500 metres of the high tide lines on the ECR. After the court took serious view of the issue a couple of years ago, the officials inspected the stretch between Neelankarai and Uthandi and found that 50 buildings had been constructed within 200 metres from the high tide line, and 89 had been built between 200 and 500 metres of the high tide line.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-orders-extensive-survey-of-illegal-bungalows-from-uthandi-to-mahabalipuram/article30874957.ece
343,2020/02/21,"Insurance for shoots the exception, not norm","Acquiring risk cover restricted to a few big players in Tamil film industry

In Kollywood, an industry that churns out over 200 films a year, not all movies have insurance cover. Even now, producers making small and mid-budget films consider insurance a burden. Only the big players in the Tamil film industry ensure that insurance papers are in order before commencing shooting.

On Wednesday, a major accident happened on the sets of Indian 2, an upcoming action thriller directed by S. Shankar and starring actor Kamal Haasan. Luckily, the film was insured. “The film has been completely insured,” a top official from the company told The Hindu. But this is more of an exception than the norm, say members of the film fraternity. Not all producers bother to take insurance for their projects, and even if they do, it only covers equipment and stars.

“The insurance penetration has been low in the Tamil film industry when compared to Bollywood. There is need for more coverage for the crew. In case of an accident, the liability will on the production house, so having extra coverage helps,” Shreeraj Deshpande, Chief Operating Officer, Future Generali India Insurance, said.

The firm has sold over 190 policies under Future Cine Suraksha for movies including Baahubali 2, Don 2, Singham Returns, Rock On and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.

Sumant Salian, Business Head, Alliance Insurance Brokers Pvt. Ltd., said, “We have seen a few production houses consider insurance in the Tamil industry. A lot of them are either not aware or do not give importance to insuring their projects. In Bollywood, 15 years ago, producers began going for insurance at the insistence of the banking or financing partner. Now it is an integral part of every film.”

Insurance coverage

Film insurance refers to insuring the film against unforeseen incidents like death, illness of an actor, occurrence of natural calamities or accidental damage leading to delays in schedule. Insurance helps the producer mitigate his risk while making the film.

Four producers, on condition of anonymity, agreed that insurance penetration is quite low in the Tamil film industry when compared to Bollywood and other markets. Some of them even suggested that no shooting should be allowed henceforth without insurance in place.

S.R. Prabhu, who has made several movies under his banner Dream Warrior Pictures, said that today most financiers insist on insurance.

Noting that all his films are insured, he said, “In the past whenever there was a death or any other crisis people in the film industry have immediately come forward to help even before the insurance company comes in. A few actors in the past have even come forward to pay premium amounts for certain unions in the film industry,” he said.

There also needs to be an emphasis on making the sets and working conditions for all technicians safer.

Director Madhumita recalled from her time as a filmmaker in Los Angeles about how shooting wouldn't begin for the day unless all the wires from the different equipment were taped down on the floor so people working on the set would not trip. “This is a simple but an extremely important safety precaution that is followed even on the sets of a short film. Following such safety precautions just needs some extra time which we need to invest,” she said.

Insurance experts said more focus should be given to insurance and ensuring the safety of each and every crew member involved.

Following specific intelligence about smuggling of gold by a gang, the officers on Wednesday night intercepted the 18 passengers who arrived by flights from Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Dubai. Additional Director General, DRI, Chennai zonal unit, said that they were taking the 18 to board a vehicle, stationed outside the arrival hall of the international terminal, after completion of proceedings, for enquiry at the DRI office.

An unidentified mob gathered around the officers and the 18 passengers and hurled abuses. When the officers tried escorting the 18 into the bus, the mob started attacking the officers.

In the melee, two DRI officers were manhandled. Later, the mob fled with the passengers. The airport police have booked a case, following a complaint from the DRI officers.

Some passengers, who followed the officers to the police station, were asked to come to the DRI office on Thursday for enquiry.

Thirteen of the 18 passengers appeared in the morning at the DRI office in T. Nagar.

348,2020/02/21,Surgery helps 69-year-old walk pain-free,"A 69-year-old schoolteacher recently underwent a surgery to repair her osteoarthritic knee.

Sarah Hassler, a music teacher at a city-based international school, was suffering from pain in the knee which restricted her movement. As her condition deteriorated, she visited the Apollo Hospitals on OMR, seeking help.

Madhan Thiruvengada, senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon, said she suffered from grade-3 osteoarthritis of the knee joint.

Dr. Madhan offered her a non-invasive one-stop minced cartilage procedure instead of the conventional two-step process where the patient’s cartilage cells are grown in the lab for around six weeks and then an autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is performed.

The patient’s own cartilage was removed from the non-weight bearing side of the same knee and transplanted in the area with the damaged cartilage.

“A portion of the healthy cartilage is particulated from the same knee of the patient through a keyhole incision along with a bioactive material to the damaged portion of the cartilage, thereby reducing recovery time. The entire procedure is autologous, without any usage of chemical agents during the procedure, making it a completely safe procedure for the patient,” he said.

Ms. Hassler was discharged in a day. She had already undergone a procedure in the United States several years ago. On Thursday, she walked to the stage at the press meet and said she was planning an international holiday soon.

Across the world, almost 19% of the population above 40 years and 50% of people above the age of 75 suffer from osteoarthritis, Dr. Madhan said.

350,2020/02/21,Work on intelligent traffic management system kicks off,"Project expected to decongest major junctions, improve safety of pedestrians

Preliminary work on development of of the Chennai Metropolitan Area Intelligent Transport System kicked off on Thursday.

The ₹660-crore project has received loan assitance from Japan International Cooperation Agency. “The project is meant to construct an efficient traffic system to meet the increasing traffic demands in the Chennai Metropolitan Area,” said an official.

The Area Traffic Signal Control System (ATCS) and junction improvement for 159 crossings in the first phase of the project is expected to reduce travel time through better management of signals.

All signals along a particular corridor will be operated from the control centre. Currently, the signals are manually operated, causing traffic congestion. In addition to the 159 road junctions, 192 more junctions will be covered in the second phase, officials said.

The major components proposed in the Intelligent Transport System include Chennai Traffic Information System, Traffic Management System and City Bus System. Another aspect of the project is the Variable Message Sign (VMS) system. “We will install the system at 17 locations. Motorists will know which road is blocked. They will get information about alternative routes as well,” said an official.

The city will also get a CCTV-based traffic monitoring system. Pointing to benefits, officials said coordination between Traffic Control and Command and Control Centre would enable swift response for movement of emergency vehicles. “The project would facilitate decongestion of key junctions based on sensory monitoring of traffic volume. It would improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pia8q3/article30874669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21City-trafficcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/work-on-intelligent-traffic-management-system-kicks-off/article30874670.ece
351,2020/02/21,"Losing a nation, in seven acts","A Turkish journalist’s recent book on her country’s descent into ‘dictatorship’ has a troubling message for India

Are we losing our country? This is the question that Ece Temelkuran, a Turkish journalist and writer, suggests that we should be asking ourselves. In her recent book, How to Lose a Country, she describes how her homeland was stolen from her by what she considers the dictatorship of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Subtitled “The seven steps from democracy to dictatorship”, the book outlines a saptapadi that Indians have become intimately familiar with over the past six years. In fact, Ms. Temelkuran’s main point is that this is now a global trend.

The story begins with the creation of a movement that claims to be of and for the “real people”, the authentic owners of the nation unjustly marginalised in the past by assorted conspiracies. This is followed by an assault on rationality and on language, where new meanings are thrust upon old terms and argument is replaced by aggressive slogans. The third step is a shedding of all shame and decency on the part of leaders, who then teach their followers to do so as well, all in the name of an authentic indigeneity.

After this comes the dismantling, or co-option, of all the institutions that are intended to act as checks and balances on executive power, including the judiciary, the media and the Constitution. The fifth step is the designing of new citizens, who will be pre-calibrated to the new normalcy that has been speedily established, shrugging off the weight of history. The sixth step is the reduction of all liberal and secular thinking persons to a stage of irrelevance and despair where they can only “laugh at the horror” that their country has become. The seventh and last step, of course, is when the new rulers build their own country, having crushed all possible sources of resistance to their agendas.

How the liberals react

Ms. Temelkuran emphasises that the early steps in this journey are marked by confident expectations of the liberal establishment that the disturbances are temporary, and the built-in safeguards in the system will take care of the threats. But this confidence soon gives way to helpless disbelief expressed in incredulous exclamations: “They can’t do this!”, “How did they get away with that!”, and so on.

Ms. Temelkuran persuasively argues that, in the last two decades, this sequence has been repeated in countries as different from each other as Hungary, Brazil, the United States and Turkey (to name a few), and it is currently under way in the United Kingdom.

India finds no mention in Ms. Temelkuran’s book, which is mainly addressing Anglo Americans and Europeans. But the resemblance to our recent history is uncanny. We can argue about the exact sequence, and about the relative importance or distinctiveness of this or that step, but the overall trend is striking in its similarity. Oddly enough, this book is useful precisely because it is saying nothing new, nothing that we do not already know. It is merely holding out a mirror, and there is something helpful about seeing our own experiences reflected back to us as part of a larger phenomenon. This relativising of what we are accustomed to thinking of as uniquely Indian draws attention to three features of our recent history that we may otherwise neglect.

The first is that this journey towards an authoritarian communalism is flagged off by neoliberalism and the values it promotes. This may sound disappointingly formulaic, part of the same tired left-wing rant that most people have stopped hearing long ago. But think about it. Today, large sections of our population are convinced that some minorities ought to be legally deprived of citizenship. Could we have arrived at this point if neoliberalism had not discredited social welfare as an idea? Whatever its faults, welfarism did assume that citizens are connected to each other not only by communitarian but also by civic-national ties. Neoliberalism cut the ties that connected individuals to each other and to the state, thereby undermining our secular-social bonds. Or, to take an opposite example, think about why neoliberalism seems self-evidently opposed to things like reservation.

The second feature on which a lot has been said already is the unique role of the media in India. As the world has been repeatedly told, India has more than 400 news channels that broadcast news 24X7, far more than any other country on earth. But what is remarkable here is not so much the giant medium, but the invisible, yet incredibly effective, work that has gone into creating an audience that is primed for the message before it even arrives. The stunning swiftness and reach of the new social media are often credited with — or blamed for — the spread of bigotry. This is unfair, for most of that credit belongs to those who tutored the addressees to receive the message without the slightest trace of scepticism. This is no mean achievement in a country where, until yesterday, people prided themselves on their scepticism and wore their cynicism on their sleeves. The same suspicious lot are now eager consumers of the most crudely concocted fake news and alternative facts.

A fundamental disconnect

The final feature concerns the composition and positioning of the opinion-making classes, or of intellectuals in the broad sense. There are two related but distinct aspects to this. The first is the degree to which a left-of-centre perspective has monopolised the more formal and institutional parts of the intellectual world. This has meant that, taken as a whole, our intellectual class was never really outside the sphere of state power, but very much an insider. This is in spite of the sharp disagreements and antipathies that may have separated specific persons or groups from particular political parties or leaders. In fact, even during the Emergency, when a large number of politically active persons including some intellectuals was actually imprisoned, there was never a fundamental disconnect between the corridors of power and the opinion makers. Today, we have a clear split — a major section of the media and many bureaucrats, artists, performers and other such public persons are completely identified with the power centre to the extent that they have no autonomous identity left. On the other side of the divide is that segment of the intellectual class that is completely cut off from the power centre and has been made its target. This latter segment is struggling to come to terms with its unprecedented, total and aggressive exclusion from the power centre.

The other aspect is the relative scarcity of right-wing intellectuals. This ought to be a matter of concern for liberals and leftists because it denies those in power the benefits of moderation and refinement in the pursuit of their agendas. It also ensures that the politics of resentment plays out in extreme ways that damage institutions and cause irreparable harm to the intellectual ecosystem.

But the immediate message conveyed by How to Lose a Country is that it is imperative to act at once, before the saat pheras are over, and we are bound over to an authoritarian regime.

354,2020/02/21,Anti-CAA protests in T.N.,"The ongoing anti-CAA protests across Tamil Nadu are evidence of strong feeling against the discriminatory law in the State, as in many States. The protesters want the Edappadi Palaniswami government to pass a resolution against the CAA in the State Assembly so as to exert pressure on the Narendra Modi government to repeal the law that links citizenship to religion, and restore equality of religions. People do not take to the streets braving scorching heat if they are not fully convinced of the rightness of their cause.

Chief Minister Palaniswami has stated that the CAA does not affect anyone, betraying a lack of understanding of what it portends for India’s principal religious minority — the Muslims. Of course he can draw comfort from the fact that he and superstar Rajinikanth are on the same page on the issue. His assurance that his party and government will shield the Muslims cannot be taken at face value for the simple fact that they will be impotent to do anything about it when CAA is enforced. His argument that the Opposition is misleading the people is specious, if anything.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cannot be said to be less sophisticated and objective than Palaniswami to say that the ‘CAA will render a large number of Muslims stateless’. The mention of six religions and the omission of one religion do not befit the all-embracing character of Indian democracy nurtured by the Constitution drafted by India’s best political genius B.R.Ambedkar. Clearly, Mr. Palaniswami is toing the line of the Modi government. There is a general public perception that the AIADMK government is subservient to the BJP government as its continuance in power hinges on its singing from the latter’s hymn-book.

Mr. Palaniswami’s claim that AIADMK is a pro-minority party is belied by its stance on CAA. The party voted for the enactment of CAA, crucially in Rajya Sabha. Tamil Nadu is the only non-BJP ruled State where peaceful anti-CAA protesters were brutally lathi-charged. By sending a memorandum against the CAA with two crore signatures to the President, DMK has proved its credentials as a defender of rights of religious minorities. The least the State government can do is to remember the commitment to secularism of Periyar, Anna and MGR and accede to the demand for an anti-CAA resolution in the Assembly, failing which history will judge it harshly.

358,2020/02/21,‘Pressure Cooker’ movie review: A bland take on the 'US dream' and what it means to be an NRI,"The film doesn’t add anything new to the narrative of parental pressure and students chasing the aim of going abroad to study and settle down.

The trailer that showed a few plus points made me watch the film. One was the Telangana dialect, and two, the presence of Rahul Ramakrishna that assured entertainment and finally, the concept of the fetish to go to the U.S. to study and settle down.

Despite a déjà vu plot, there is always hope when a new director comes with a fresh perspective. This film has two directors but sadly the film doesn’t take off even after 15 minutes. Every Telugu household has at least one member living in the US and this is not a new phenomenon.

We have been discussing it since the 80s, about parents boasting about their NRI children and also how they rue for six months of staying indoors and becoming glorified baby sitters. From a reference to going to Chilkur Balaji temple for Visa to how when the children visit India, the women go jewellery shopping and have no time for relatives — all the aspects are known. So what new can be added to this?

Naryana (CVL Narasimha Rao) from Siddipet has unrealistic expectations from his child, and brainwashes him since his childhood that he should settle down in the U.S. In order to make his dad happy, the boy (Sai Ronak) works towards the dream but his Visa is always rejected.

After many attempts, his talent is recognised and he is all set to leave. This is where the conflict looks contrived. Just as he is loading his luggage into the car to go to the airport, he is given a letter by Rao’s (Tanikella Bharani) wife and the content is an eye opener. It is some gyan as to why you should stay back in India and find happiness in looking after parents. He has an argument with his parents on the spot; the father tells him he is doing all this to make his son happy and the son blames his father and says going to the U.S. was never his dream but the father’s. Once that is decided he runs to his girlfriend (Preethi Asrani) who is independent and has a mind of her own. He gives her an impression and also to the audience a feeling that he gave up the U.S. trip just for the girl.

Rahul is just a sidekick to another newcomer here, dialogues are purely functional and the love track is not properly etched out. Sai Ronak is good looking but needs to work on acting. Preethi Asrani looks convincing and has potential to be a promising artiste.

The story drags a lot in the second half and ultimately, we stop caring about the hero’s Visa. There are many unnecessary scenes and the editing could have been better. Cinematography is good and so is the music. The script could have done with sharp writing. This one is more like television serial but even serials are high on drama and emotions. Pressure Cooker falls short of that.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/xgeldf/article30880281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pressure-cooker2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/pressure-cooker-movie-review-a-bland-take-on-the-us-dream-and-what-it-means-to-be-an-nri/article30880283.ece
359,2020/02/21,‘Bheeshma’ movie review: A reasonably fun outing from Nithiin and Rashmika Mandanna,"Director Venky Kudumula sidesteps the pitfalls of age-old tropes with a dash of humour

Showing the plight of farmers and how a good-hearted hero saves them and their land is an overused trope in mainstream cinema. But imagine looking at it in the context of a hero who you can’t take too seriously. Wherever he is, there’s bound to be trouble. If at all there’s something the hero is seriously working at, it’s in trying to change his singleton status.

Director Venky Kudumula places such a character in the centre of a farming war. The result is a partly farcical comedy that’s at times deliberately frustrating and at other times, lends itself to laugh aloud segments.

There are two Bheeshmas in the film — Nithiin and veteran Kannada actor Anant Nag. The former thinks his name is the reason behind his jinx in romance and his desperation shows whenever he spots an attractive woman. The latter is sworn to bachelorhood and helms Bheeshma Organics, a company through which he encourages natural farming that’s beneficial for both the soil and people.

It’s anyone’s guess that destiny will bring the two Bheeshmas together and the farmers will be in safe hands. But to begin with, the two Bheeshmas seem like two ends of a spectrum. The young bachelor is an irritant not only to women, but also to men. Ask Vennela Kishore. It’s a hilarious track all through the film where Nithiin’s actions spell doom for Kishore, who is a gold medal winning post graduate in agriculture but is reduced to being a chauffeur.

Bheeshma comes at a time when Nithiin, who has often been questioned about his single status, is finally getting hitched. On screen, he does a good job of letting his character’s frustrations show. It feels so apt when Kishore calls him a ‘despo’ at one point. Nithiin’s character is unlucky in love but immensely lucky otherwise; big things just happen to him as a result of being at the right place at the right time.

The comedy woven around him ranges from lines that look like they’ve been picked from banal WhatsApp forwards (Raghubabu and Kishore shut their ears in a scene where Nithiin reels off rhyming lines, soon after an action scene) to some comedy-of-errors, especially the one involving Nithiin and police officer Sampath Raj.

Other than Anant Nag and his arch rival Raghavan (Jisshu Sengupta), who wants to implement a new method of exploitative chemical farming, no other character demands to be taken seriously. There are fun situations involving almost every supporting character, including Sampath Raj who is introduced as the fierce cop. The portion where Nithiin confronts his parents following a big pre-interval development is hilarious.

Rashmika Mandanna as Chaitra gets a role that requires her to be a little more than cute and charming. Her character gets better as it progresses. She does a fine job of portraying the naivete required of her in some portions and then looks every bit the young woman who’s sure of what she wants.

Venky Kudumula ties up the different threads to the story well. Even a regular hero introduction scene has its relevance in the story, as revealed later. Casting Anant Nag and Jisshu Sengupta for those pivotal parts, which the two actors perform earnestly, also work in favour of the film.

Bheeshma is not the smartest film around but is reasonably entertaining. Like the hero says, “haasam” — not awesome but there’s haasyam (humour), even if not all of it is politically correct.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/ixpgue/article30879962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bheeshma-13,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/bheeshma-review-this-nithiin-rashmika-starrer-directed-by-venky-kudumula-is-reasonably-entertaining/article30879963.ece
360,2020/02/21,Fooddoo app that delivers home-cooked food launches in Coimbatore,"The newly-launched fooddoo app promises to deliver healthy and tasty home-cooked meals

“In Coimbatore where we are just a week old, we are managing 50 meals a day,” says Saurav Mukherjee, co-founder of fooddoo app. He says that, while there are many food delivery apps, what sets them apart is the health factor. “We are moving towards good health. We don’t want our children to eat restaurant food every day.” The mobile and web-based app, currently active in Chennai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi, allows customers to order home-cooked food.

The options are plenty. From an all vegetarian meal of kootu and poriyal or to a simple simple fish curry and rice, one can pick and choose from a menu put up by home cooks on the app. “We call them fooddoo moms. We have 4000 moms registered with us. Of this, 600 are active,” says Saurav. There is also a Jain Food option, food with less oil, no garam masala and so on,” he explains

Saurav touches upon how nuclear families, where single moms or both parents are at work, find it a a big challenge to cook and consume healthy meals. Unhealthy eating habits are a big factor in lifestyle illnesses. “We want to bring about a change in the way food is prepared and delivered.”

The fooddoo team picks home makers who enjoy cooking. They can stay at home and generate income by doing something they are good at. Says a fooddoo mom based out of Chennai, “I finish cooking the lunch orders by noon. This suits me, as my child is away at school during those hours. As I take care of my child and manage my home, stepping out to deliver the meals is not an option for me. I get regular orders for my vegetarian meals and breakfast items like wheat dosa, red rice puttu, godhuma upma, rotis and parathas. A delivery executive picks up the prepared meal from home.” The moms have the option of switching off the app when they are unable to take orders.

Info you can use Orders for breakfast, lunch and dinner can be placed on the mobile app or on the website. A weekly/monthly subscription option is available

Fooddoo will soon extend its services to Erode, Madurai and Pudukottai

Fooddoo app is available on Android and iOS platform. It also takes orders via voice call at 9445502121

The cost of a standard meal is ₹100

Once a customer places an order with a fooddoo mom, the order reaches her dashboard. She then confirms the order and prepares the food. Once the food is ready, it is picked up and the customer can track the status — from order confirmation to delivery. “Our network of delivery boys are trained to check consistency, quantity and quality, and also help with packing. That’s why our tagline reads — moms prepare, friends deliver. We deliver food in biodegradable boxes.”

There is a seven-step quality and verification to validate the home cooks and their kitchens, points out K Shanmugasundaram, founder of Fooddoo.com. adding that fooddoo kitchens are FSSAI certified. “We also make surprise visits to their kitchens.” The tech-driven company is motivating the moms further.

“There is robust technology in place and now we can scale up at will. We are currently delivering 200 meals in Chennai,” says Saurav who reels out the top sellers. “The vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals, lemon, coconut and tomata rice, rotis and gravies do very well. Some of the app users also buy festival palakaaram from the moms.”

The next big plan is to get funding and scale up. “We have the capacity to service 40,000 meals a day. We have sensitised the cooks to make diabetic-friendly food with millets, cater to specific diets such as the paleo, low carb-high fat, high protein and so on. Children who are settled abroad subscribe to us to cater food to their aged parents. ”

Another mom who has been a fooddoo mom for three years says she loves experimenting. “Besides South Indian food, I also make teplas now and specialise in moong dal halwa, milk cake (which I learnt from my mother-in-law) and my own recipes like thinai paayasam. As my children are grown-up, I have plenty of time now. I order vegetables and provisions based on requirements. There has been no negative comments so far.” As she speaks the delivery executive arrives and takes away her lunch order of arachu vitta sambhar, inji rasam, beans paattani poriyal and kalandha kootu.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/tdrw7o/article30881075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rotis,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/fooddoo-app-that-delivers-home-cooked-food-launches-in-coimbatore/article30881076.ece
361,2020/02/21,Feeling peckish or having a party? Log in your orders now!,"Hyper-local cooking aided by social media takes off in Tiruchi, reviving interest in traditional recipes

Cloud kitchens — eateries that take online orders and don’t have a dine-in facility — have led to the growth of home-based chefs who cater to small groups of people.

While the metros have spun this out into pop-up dining experiences and food workshops, in smaller cities like Tiruchi, pre-order cooking is more about exploring dishes that are exotic yet homely in taste.

“I cook to share my joy in well-made food with others,” says Asma Mariam, who, with her son Armaan Salik, co-founded the Facebook-based enterprise Mariam’s Kitchen two years ago. “It’s not the profit or the business, it’s just the pure happiness of making tasty food that keeps us going.”

For Edamalaipattipudur resident Aarthi Rani Venkatesh, who describes herself as a hobby baker-cum-homemaker, fancy cakes have helped her to find a niche clientele in the city. M Asha, who once made and marketed her own spice mixes, has switched over to bespoke catering from her home in Shanmugha Nagar, UKT Malai. All these chefs have cashed in on the trend towards hyper-local cooking in Tiruchi, and in many cases, also revived interest in traditional recipes that commercial kitchens have long done away with. They all rely on self-clicked pictures on their Facebook pages rather than formal advertising, to keep the buzz going.

We take a peek into what is being served up by these pre-order cooks:

On a food safari

Mariam’s Kitchen

Cuisine: Mughlai, Chettinad, Malabar

A family legacy of cuisines has come in handy for Asma Mariam, a former teacher who is now enjoying a new career as a pre-order chef from her apartment in Crawford area. Most of her preparations reflect her multicultural roots. “My great-grandfather, leather exporter N M Khaja Miyan, was married to Malayali lady, so our everyday menu is partly Malabari and partly Mughal-style dishes. Up to the 1950s, our home recipes used to include dishes like roasted meat and puddings to cater to British guests to the family’s tanneries,” says Asma.

Keen to give her two sons something tasty and healthy to eat, Asma developed a passion for cooking that has now blossomed into a gourmet enterprise.

Starting with their signature Mughlai biryani (mutton, chicken and fish) her son Armaan Salik, assistant professor at Jamal Institute of Management and an ardent foodie as well, helped to bring his mother’s talent to the fore by formulating a menu of around 30 other dishes that pay homage to the family’s vast repository of recipes.

Mariam’s Kitchen functions through a Facebook page, with at least a day’s advance notice required for most dishes. Among other requested items are kofta (meatballs), khorma (gravy) and finger food like fish fingers and cutlets. Regional dishes made within the family circle, like ‘Delhi Stew’ and Thaali Salna are also on the menu.

While the weekdays are usually a little quiet, biryani orders fill up the weekend’s schedule.

“Even though Tiruchi’s eateries have oversold the biryani, we still feel ours is different, because we try and bring out regional variations more clearly,” says Armaan, who is mulling opening a standalone takeaway restaurant in the near future. Asma stocks up on exotic spices like saffron during her trips to Dubai, where her husband is working, and prefers to maintain a small clientele. “I’m confident of serving up to 15 people. Big orders could compromise on the taste,” she says.

Prices (approximate): ₹399 and above for 3-4 people

Cake Veedu

Cuisine: Novelty cakes, Thoothukudi macaroons and cashew stick candy

Aarthi Rani Venkatesh started ‘Cake Veedu’ from her home in Stalin Nagar, Edamalaipattipudur two years ago, after seeing how commercial kitchens play fast and loose with the rules on health and hygiene.

“I became addicted to baking after seeing innumerable online video tutorials. But after the novelty wore off, I decided to specialise in cakes that were both good to look at and also had a healthy choice of ingredients,” she says.

Considering that most of her clients are young children, she prefers to use fresh cream rather than fondant paste for icing to keep sugar levels under control. “I try to use organic gel dyes that are safer for consumption than chemical food colouring,” she says. She also avoids oil, baking powder and baking soda in her cookies.

Aarthi has made it her new year’s resolution to stop baking with refined flour (maida) and instead, switch over completely to wheat. “Since I don’t use softening agents, my cakes tend to be more dense and chewy. Improvers make sponge cakes taste like mattress foam,” she says.

While cake orders (minimum 1 kg) keep her busy in Tiruchi, Aarthi also bakes and holds workshops in Thoothukudi, her hometown. The most popular request is Rasmalai Cake, a decadent dessert for which she makes all the components of the milk sweet as well. Her cashew macaroons (which went through 40 trials before she got the right combination of ingredients) and Nei Kucchi Mittai (candy sticks made with cashew powder, ghee and caramelised sugar) are best-sellers there.

Prices (approximate): ₹800 (for 1 kg cake) and upwards

Taste of home

Home Kitchen

Cuisine: Traditional Tamil non-vegetarian

Soft-spoken M Asha reserves her fire for dishes like Vanjaram Meen Kuzhambu, Iluppur Podi Salna, and Graamathu Naatu Kozhi Kuzhambu, that she cooks up with great skill at home.

Since she started out with her Facebook-based eatery four months ago, Asha has been busy with orders. “Either due to their busy schedule or old age, many people have stopped cooking at home even in small cities like Tiruchi. At the same time, there’s a growing awareness about artificial preservatives and chemicals in restaurant food. I cook for my customers just as I would for my family – only the freshest of ingredients and no shortcuts,” she says.

After nearly 15 years of observing her mother-in-law making biryani, Asha finally learned how to prepare the ceremonial rice dish on her own. “Biryani has its own charm, and is a filling meal in itself. We also offer Khushka (a delicately spiced fried rice) with a variety of side dishes and gravies,” says Asha.

Minimum serving quantity starts at 1 kilo, which serves 10-12 people. “Even though the costs seem high, many customers realise that pre-order chefs actually provide a little extra food to suit the size of the gathering. This is especially true for fish, where a second helping in a restaurant can double the cost,” says Asha, who also provides wheat flour rotis and parathas in bulk. She takes orders for up to 80 people.

Asha is hoping to open a mess for office-goers and professionals soon. “A taste of home is what everyone yearns for after a busy day at work. I hope I’ll be able to fulfill that dream soon.”

Prices (approximate): ₹1000 and above, for 12-15 people

362,2020/02/21,Raahi's menu is a refreshing take on Indian cuisine,"Think regional, eat seasonal: From a cocktail list that embodies the five elements to dishes from the length and breadth of the country,

The menu at Raahi centres around Indian fare with a predominant focus on the use of local ingredients to enhance the flavour of each dish. From the snacks and starters to the main course, the spread here covers quite a bit of India’s culinary diversity.

The topli paneer chaat is one of their signature creations as is the sattu kachori. The paneer is made inhouse and its quality shows in its velvety texture. The use of sattu or millets and pulses to make the kachori results in a rather subtle taste difference, though perhaps only the most discerning maybe able to spot it.

Textures of mushrooms is a happy assortment of shitake, elephant ear, button and other mushrooms, each prepared to highlight their distinctive tastes.

Non-vegetarians should try the avarekalu beans and shrimp sukka. This homely dish of butter beans and shrimp lightly sauteed with fresh herbs and tomatoes, served with pav freshly toasted with butter would be a winner in summer or winter.

The pandi pork spare ribs are succulent and tender, the use of a knife is superfluous. Though yak cheese datchi served with tingmo-gurung bread, from the north eastern parts of the country, is a vegetarian dish, it is recommended for all, courtesy the balance of flavours as well as its lightness on the palate.

Slightly seasoned ghee idiyappams (string hoppers from Kerala) go equally well with the kalan kuzhambu (mushroom gravy dish from Tamil Nadu) as well as a meat dish; both variants are available here.

Items like the duck do pyaaza accompanied by a figs and date naan or the dak bungalow dal served with beetroot oil or the kheema and quail ghotala or the bheja fry and crisp dosa combination, certainly pique one’s interest, there’s only just so much one can try at a single sitting.

The ambience is casual chic and the food is gorgeously plated.

In keeping with the theme, the cocktails at Raahi have been segmented under the five tattva elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether. The huti — bacardi with red wine reduction and lemon juice accentuated with candied ginger — is for the fiery, while those feeling airy could go for the pavitr — a wonderful combination of Chivas, peanut butter, fresh cream and redberry puree — sort of like a spohisticated Snickers shake for grown-ups served in a golden goblet. And whether undecided or not, try the shaantras that falls under ether. It is a marvellous blend of gin, coffee liqueur, kewra water presented with a delightful dusting of vanilla talc; you’ll be forgiven for smacking your lips and ordering another.

To round off your meal and drinks, the coconut dessert is suggested — it is light and not too sweet, a fitting end to a sumptuous meal.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/5pnr16/article30879670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Raahi5jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/think-regional-eat-seasonal/article30879674.ece
363,2020/02/21,Sunday breakfasts now have a Bengali flavour at Visakhapatnam’s Sweet India,"With Club Kachori as a constant, the menu serves six dishes that changes every

It smells like Kolkata on Sunday mornings. Not surprising since there are crispy kachoris frying that will be served with aloo curry, or the Kolkata singhadas (samosas). Fresh, flavoured sandesh beckons and the whole lot can be washed down with the refreshing bhar (kulhad) chai. The Sunday breakfast menu at Sweet India at Dabagardens is hardly three weeks old, but it has caught on and Manoj Sharma, the branch head, and his team at the store say they have never been busier.

The restaurant has a modest seating arrangement at the first floor of the sweet shop. The menu is short with six dishes that changes every Sunday.

The one thing that is constant is the club kachori. “The club kachoris are the best. And you will find these only in Kolkata,” says Manoj.

I take his word and start with the kachoris, the size of a tennis ball, served with potatoes. It is the closest you can get to the Kolkata ones - kachoris stuffed with dal sautéed in hing. They are crisp and make a perfect marriage with the steaming and mildly spicy aloo curry.

The breakfast menu also has hot jalebis, pineapple sandesh and sandwiches. And who can resist biting into the hot flaky Kolkata samosa stuffed with aloo and green peas? Certainly, not me. This treat doesn’t really need an occasion, but just a wait till Sunday morning. Oh yes if you have a yen for Gujarati, try the sandwich dhokla. Layered with green chutney and drizzled with red sweet and tangy chutney, it melts in the mouth. Sweet India has for the first time ventured into breakfasts in the two decades of its existence in Visakhapatnam. Over the years, it has earned a name for its sweets, chai-time snacks and catering business. This, however, has not been an easy journey, says Manoj, who is a family member of Anil Joshi - who along with his father Ramavatar Joshi started the first Sweet India shop 50 years ago in Vizianagaram before stepping into Visakhapatnam market with two more stores. Those days the market for North Indian sweets and snacks was limited. As the city grew so did their business. This year, they will be opening up their third store at Ramnagar in the next two to three months.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/u58mld/article30879102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21VZBREAKFAST,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/sunday-morning-breakfasts-now-have-a-bengali-flavour-at-visakhapatnams-sweet-india/article30879104.ece

Lalit Salve, the 32-year-old police constable from Beed who had undergone genital reconstruction procedure at the Mumbai’s St. George Hospital, is busy preparing for his wedding reception on Sunday.

Overjoyed to start a new chapter, Lalit — who has lived three decades of his life as Lalita — says he had never imagined a woman would marry him after knowing his story. “I have lived the life of a woman and I know what women face when they take bold decisions. My wife has shown immense courage by agreeing to marry me,” said Mr. Salve who married 22-year-old Seema Bansode on February 16. Mr. Salve says it was an arranged marriage.

“My relatives had spoken about me to her parents a few months ago. Nothing moved forward then. But Seema had already started reading about me,” said Mr. Salve adding that Ms. Bansode saw him at a function and told her parents that she would like to marry him.

365,2020/02/21,Navi Mumbai airport PAPs postpone protest for 15 days,"Meeting held at Mantralaya to assure fulfilment of demands

The project-affected people (PAPs) of the Navi Mumbai airport project have postponed their protest against CIDCO after they were assured that their demands would be fulfilled, in a meeting at Mantralaya.

The meeting, held on February 13, was attended by 16 people including Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde, CIDCO MD Lokesh Chandra, president of Navi Mumbai International Airport Committee Anil Patil, and members of the Shiv Sena and All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS).

“They have promised us that they will conduct a survey of all fishermen in order to proceed with compensation. People who are facing zero eligibility issues have also been asked to produce their documents again before a committee formed by CIDCO for a final decision,” Kiran Keni, a resident of Waghivali village and member of AIKS, said

‘Might reconsider protest’

He said the PAPs have been assured that the survey of fishermen will start within 15 days. “If they don’t begin the survey within 15 days, we will reconsider the protest against CIDCO,” Mr. Keni said. He said CIDCO had also assured that their demands for jobs would be fulfilled.

The villagers of Waghivali had recently staged a 38-day protest, which was withdrawn after they were promised a joint meeting with CIDCO and the government. The villagers had declared of a second protest on February 17 if the meeting was not conducted, after which the meeting was arranged at Mantralaya on February 13.

“We have already written to fisheries department for a survey of the fishermen. We need to confirm if our list has all the registered fishermen. Once that is confirmed, the government will decide on the compensation. To solve the zero eligibility issue, a committee has already been formed to hear the aggrieved,” a CIDCO officer said.

The demands of the PAPs included: job preference in the project, compensation to fishermen who would lose their livelihood to the project, increase in construction aid from ₹1,500 to ₹2,500 per sq.ft. and reconsidering the decision of ‘zero eligibility’ for resettlement.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/navi-mumbai-airport-paps-postpone-protest-for-15-days/article30875384.ece
366,2020/02/21,City to host first kitten adoption camp this weekend,"At least 40 abandoned felines will be looking for a permanent home at the event on Sunday

The sight of abandoned kittens outsider her pet boarding at Santacruz drove Kanan Modi to organise an kitten and cat adoption camp, called Happily Ever After, this weekend. Although Mumbai has several dog adoption camps, this will be the first exclusive camp for kittens and cats, claims Ms. Modi.

Ms. Modi has been running The Pet Patch, a cat boarding, for the last two years. In her experience, people are more inclined towards adopting dogs rather than cats. She previously ran a kitten adoption campaign on social media.

“Around 30 cats and kittens got their permanent homes through that drive,” says Ms. Modi. “But often people who were interested used to show up only after four or five months and by then the kittens would grow up. They would then leave those cats saying they were looking for a kitten.”

Around 40 kittens will be up for adoption at Happily Ever After. “We take complete care of their food and health in our cat boarding,” says Ms. Modi.

The camp will allow visitors to spend time with the kittens and familiarise themselves with the animals. “There are about 150 people who have shown interest in our event on Facebook,” says Ms. Modi.

The kittens at the camp all have different back stories, from being abandoned in parking lots to being left on the street by their mothers, but they all share the same desire for a comfortable home.

Happily Ever After will take place at The Pet Patch in Santacruz (East) on February 23, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more details contact 9820038542.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/d4rg8q/article30875373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bm-Cat-Adaption-picture,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-to-host-first-kitten-adoption-camp-this-weekend/article30875374.ece
367,2020/02/21,Two-year-old dies after being bitten by snake at NMMC garden,"A two-year-old boy died after being bitten by a snake at a Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) garden in Vashi on Wednesday.

Sumeet Sonkamble was the son of police constable Vishal Sonkamble, who is attached to Turbhe police station. Sumeet, who lived in a C-type building in Sector 26, would visit the park in his locality frequently. On Wednesday, too, the child went there with his grandfather around 6.30 p.m.

Just as they walked into the park, Sumeet started crying and complained to his grandfather that an ant had bitten him. “I removed his socks and massaged his foot a little after which he started playing. Around half an hour later, he drank water and soon after, foam came out from his mouth and he fell unconscious,” Sumeet’s grandfather said.

The boy was immediately rushed to PKC Hospital in Vashi where the doctors said he had suffered a snake bite and asked the family to take him to Vashi NMMC hospital. At NMMC hospital, Sumeet was declared dead.

The second son of Mr. Sonkamble, Sumeet has a five-year-old elder brother. On Thursday evening, his grandfather went to the garden again and spoke to the watchman, and the latter confirmed there were snakes in the park.

“It is an unfortunate incident. We will carry out a spray treatment in the gardens to keep the snakes away. However, in this incident, the negligence was on the guardian’s part hence the NMMC can’t give compensation,” Mayor Jaywant Sutar said. The NMMC had developed the children’s park around two years ago, beside a pond, by spending around ₹4.25 crore.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h2yu70/article30875363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bm-Kid-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-year-old-dies-after-being-bitten-by-snake-at-nmmc-garden/article30875365.ece
368,2020/02/21,Mumbai prays for well-being of Chinese population,"Consul General of China expresses gratitude to India for its support in tackling coronavirus

A mass prayer meeting for the health and well-being of the Chinese population, in light of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, was held near the Gateway of India on Thursday.

The gathering of around 50 people was also attended by Tang Guocai, Consul General of China, and Ramdas Athawale, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment. Members of the All India Buddhist Monks, too, attended the meeting and lit candles along with Mr. Tang and Mr. Athawale, after which prayers were offered for the well-being of the Chinese.

Mr. Tang expressed his gratitude to India for its support to China during its time of crisis, raising the slogan, “Hindi-Chini bhai bhai.” “India is providing China with political, economic and cultural aid. We are getting great warmth and support from our neighbouring country and together we are making solid progress in fighting coronavirus,” he said.

Mr. Athawale assured the Consul General that India will continue to support China. “The deadly virus is disrupting peace in China, and thousands have lost their lives because of it. The India-China brotherhood will stay strong forever and we will always have their back,” he said.

Mr. Tang also paid homage to Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, one of the five Indian physicians despatched to China during the 1938 Sino-Japanese war. Revered in China to this day, Dr. Kotnis worked tirelessly to tend to Chinese soldiers at the cost of his own health, and died in China on December 9, 1942. He was buried at the Heroes Courtyard in Nanquan Village and later immortalised by V. Shantaram in his movie, Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani.

“The Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis Memorial Committee has provided a lot of medical assistance to fight against coronavirus, so we have full confidence that we’ll overcome it. The medical workers are angels, they are the best of humanity. In this fight against coronavirus, moral support and medical support are equally important,” Mr. Tang said.

On the shared cultural heritage of the two countries, Mr. Tang said, “Buddhism is the best example of the China-India cultural exchange, and is now spreading to America and east Europe, among other places.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/f9km4/article30875343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMPRAYERCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-prays-for-well-being-of-chinese-population/article30875344.ece

They have to meet certain fitness criteria, irrespective of their gender.”

Speaking at an investiture ceremony of the Southern Command at Gateway of India, Lt. Gen. Mohanty said, “A screening committee decides every promotion — from that of a Lieutenant Colonel to a Colonel.”

Stating that the scrapping of Article 370 was a positive step towards reduced insurgency in Jammu & Kashmir, Lt. Gen. Mohanty said, “This is a big step towards fighting terrorism in J&K. But there are other factors like better integration and coordination among the forces to thank as well.”

Lt. Gen. Mohanty also presented gallantry awards and medals for distinguished service to 51 Army personnel. Two awards were conferred upon record officers for keeping track of soldiers and 21 units of the command were awarded the ‘Southern Army Commander’s Unit citation’ for their outstanding contributions.

Tales of bravery

Among the 24 personnel who received gallantry awards was Col. Dhanajay Madhav Bhosle, who was conferred the Vishisht Seva Medal (gallantry award) for recovering an advanced light helicopter that crashed in Siachen glacier in January 2018. Col. Bhosle led the operation efficiently under extreme conditions at an altitude of 16,700 feet and flew the helicopter himself.

Sepoy Sunil Kumar from 20 JAT regiment also received a Sena Medal (gallantry). He was awarded for neutralising a terrorist on 28th September, 2018, despite sustaining injuries.

The Indian Army organises investiture ceremonies for each regional command at nominated locations every year. Mumbai played host to the ceremony after a gap of five years.

Lt. Gen. Mohanty said the ceremony was all the more special since the soldiers were awarded for their bravery just a day after Shiv Jayanti. “Yesterday marked the 390th birthday of Shivaji Maharaj who was the father of guerilla warfare. We chose this venue of Gateway of India as it is of particular significance, being just adjacent to the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Eleven years ago, Mumbaikars showed resilience and strength in battling the deadly terror attack here and the city rose to be a safe haven again.”

The GOC-in-C said the Indian Army is presently at the cusp of modernisation and must keep pace with the armies of the world to progress wholeheartedly.

Providing relief

In 2019, more than 3,000 troops of the Southern Command carried out flood relief operations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Rajasthan.

In conjunction with the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy and other civil disaster relief organisations, rescued and evacuated over 40,000 people to safety, Lt. Gen. Mohanty said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5g30i7/article30875336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMSOUTHERNCOMMANDINVESTITURECEREMONY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/women-have-been-part-of-the-army-for-30-years/article30875337.ece
370,2020/02/21,‘Judges can’t go by popular sentiment’,"Outgoing High Court judge talks about the demands of the job and the role of the judiciary

“There is no breaking news in a person demitting office,” said Justice Satyaranjan C. Dharmadhikari who recently demitted office as a Bombay High Court judge, adding, “It should be smooth, and should quietly pass off.” The judge, in an interview with The Hindu, explained his reasons for retiring, talked about the challenges of being a judge, the criticality of collegium and National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), and the need to improve the criminal justice system.

What are your reasons for retiring and your views on a judge being elevated?

The reason for me retiring was that I was going to be transferred to another State as a Chief Justice with less than two years of my tenure left. When you go to a different State there are different local laws, the problems arising out of local issues are different which you have to grapple with. And then one needs to understand the local administration where the language, culture and work ethics are different. For a person to adjust to the situation and settle down, it takes about six to eight months. Then soon would be my date of retirement. I was happy to go to any State, that was never the issue. The elevation of a judge is not a physical thing. It is a state of mind and body. The state of mind is very important. You have to be compassionate and concerned, but at the same time you cannot show that in your output. What a judge portrays are his principles.

What are the challenges of being a judge?

The challenges of a High Court judge are many. A judge has no assistance. Every day, you have to read the files, make your small notes so that you can raise pointed queries in court to save time. One has to hear several cases and decide if they are worth admitting or not, and the call for that has to be taken in about five to 10 minutes. It demands that you have in-depth knowledge, and cannot be peripheral or superficial. Then again, one cannot be obsessed about disposal of cases [either]. People look up to you, the whole State looks up to you. People might think that the work pressure is not enormous, but it is. In Bombay, there is also sizeable commercial ligation and arbitration where the stakes are too high and the matters have to be decided in a time-bound manner.

What is your take on the collegium vis-a-vis the NJAC Act?

The collegium system has been functioning for the past 27 years. Institutional independence is important. There are inadequacies, but it’s preferable than keeping all higher judicial appointments in the hands of the executive. Even as far as the postings and transfers are concerned, the functioning is best left to the members of the institution. We are not perfect, as many defects and deficiencies are pointed out, but we can work towards eliminating them.

You have closely seen our criminal justice system. What can be done to reform it?

The journey is from the suspect to accused and then from accused to a convict. This is where fair investigation and probe by the police and the investigating agencies come in. The evidence gathered has to be credible and stand the test of cross-examination in a trial.

You have been perceived as a strict judge who came down heavily on government officials for their apathy and inaction.

I should not be misunderstood. By issuing directions from time to time we do not take over governance. As it is always said, it is only the executive’s inaction which triggers directions from the courts. Once we ignore the constitutional framework, then the burden on the judiciary usually increases. The expectation of the people is then from the courts. I have seen noticeable anger, anguish, pain and frustration of the man on the street when dealing with criminal delivery justice system; especially in cases of rape and murder, he turns to the courts for justice.

In cases which have political implications, how does a judge or Bench hearing the case ensure that they remain insulated to the surroundings? The question is specific, considering the reach of the media, which has now percolated to people’s lives through various mediums, including mobile phones.

If you are fearless, impartial and independent — which means someone who is balanced, restrained, does not go overboard, is not looking for publicity, does not want himself to be seen in the electronic or social media — then you know you are doing your job. Judges are trained to function like this. Judges can’t go by popular sentiment and [resort to] knee-jerk reactions. The matter has to be decided on real facts and evidence. If I pull someone up, it is part of my job to ensure that he performs his functions in time.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bg36q6/article30823925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dharmadhikari,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/judges-cant-go-by-popular-sentiment/article30875324.ece
371,2020/02/21,Vacant SEZ land to be used for affordable housing: Maharashtra minister,"State to use unexplored provision in policy passed by BJP govt.

In what could turn out to be a major blow to the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) developers who continue to hold land bank without setting up industries, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is set to use an unexplored provision in the housing policy passed by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government which stipulates that in case of no industrial activity in more than 50% area, the land stands vested with the government.

Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, while addressing a CII Real Estate Summit on Thursday, said that he thanked Mr. Fadnavis for coming out with a policy to curb land speculation by SEZ developers and which ensured land is available for affordable housing. “As a government we will pursue the policy and will ensure that the real estate industry benefits,” he said.

As per the policy on land acquired for SEZ by private developers, more than 25,000 acres across Maharashtra was notified under the emergency clause of the erstwhile Land Acquisition Act 1888.

The policy clearly says that, “Land speculation cannot be permitted and therefore the government will put to notice all SEZ developers to start industrial production/ permitted activity within the SEZ within a period of 24 months. The activity must cover more than 50% of the SEZ land acquired and in case the developer fails to do so, the entire balance land will stand vested with the government and the government will reimburse the cost of such land to the developer at the same rate at which it was originally acquired by the SEZ developer by using Government machinery and thereafter use it for providing affordable housing.”

It further added that a special Bill, titled SEZ Prevention of Land Speculation Bill would be introduced which will incorporate the above as the guiding principle.

Mr. Awhad later told The Hindu that he only mentioned about the housing policy because being the minister of the department it is his duty to follow it, irrespective of which government passed it. “It was Devendra Fadnavis who passed it. We will merely work accordingly,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uwch06/article30875314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vacant-sez-land-to-be-used-for-affordable-housing-maharashtra-minister/article30875315.ece

BYJM member Parimal Dhananjay Deshpande has sought an immediate probe into Mr. Pathan’s remarks. He has filed a complaint against Mr. Pathan under Sections 153(a)(a) (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race etc.), 295a (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and more of the Indian Penal Code.

During his address at an anti-CAA rally on Wednesday, Mr. Pathan, a former MLA from Byculla in Mumbai, had reportedly lashed out against those who objected to the Muslim community protesting against the Narendra Modi government. He had said that while the Muslim community may be as less as 15 crore in numbers, it could give a fitting reply to the majority if needed.

In a video, Mr. Pathan is heard remarking that while it is just Muslim women who have rocked country (with their protests), the impact would be greater when the entire community came together and protested.

“[Those objecting to Muslims protesting against CAA] tell us that we have kept our women at the forefront. I want to tell these people, only the lionesses have come out and you are already sweating … You can understand what would happen if all of us come together. We are just 15 crore, but can be a bigger force than the 100 crore majority population,” Mr. Pathan had said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/byjm-seeks-case-against-waris-pathan/article30875293.ece
373,2020/02/21,Maharashtra to spend over ₹250 crore on internships,"Announcement may be made during presentation of Budget; programme will continue for four years

The Maharashtra government will spend over ₹250 crore every year on its project to extend internships to around one lakh graduates in government offices. The announcement is likely to be made in the State Budget to be presented on March 6. The programme will continue for four years with a total spending of nearly ₹1,000 crore.

This is part of the Maharashtra government’s soon-to-be-launched Maha e-skill 2020 mission.

“The scheme was positively received as it is about giving employment and enhancing skills of the youth to make them job-ready. We will be spending ₹250 crore in the first year and will continue it for four years,” said an official in the Skill Development Department.

He said the announcement will most likely be made in the State Budget.

The approval for the project comes in the wake of recent letter drafted by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis asking Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to not cancel the CM Fellowship Programme, under which select youngsters were working directly in coordination with the Chief Minister’s Office and monitoring the implementation of various government schemes at the local level.

According to an official from the State’s Skill Development Department, the new scheme will provide opportunities to over one lakh graduates, irrespective of their field of education, to work directly with various government departments from the tehsil level to Mantralaya.

The first six months will contain practicals, wherein the trainees will learn about the functions of government, the different works and departments. In the next year, the youngsters will be given work in their respective departments.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-to-spend-over-250-crore-on-internships/article30875287.ece
374,2020/02/21,TB survivors launch Statewide network to tackle patients’ issues,"Focus to be on prevention, awareness, access to diagnosis

Survivors Against Tuberculosis (SATB), a community-based network of patients who have prevailed over the infection, launched a Statewide network on Thursday.

The network will work and advocate State-specific issues around TB from a patient perspective, and will focus on prevention, awareness, access to diagnosis, stigma reduction, mental health, nutrition, and gender. It will also work on State-specific patient support and patient education interventions in tuberculosis care, SATB officials said.

According to SATB, drug-resistant TB remains a huge challenge in Maharashtra, which is a high burden State, and especially in Mumbai. The network aims to ensure that patients and survivors have access to high quality, patient-centric TB care that is stigma-free.

Deepti Chavan, a member of SATB and a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) survivor said, “This is an appropriate time for more State-focused advocacy that reflects patient needs. The government is open and receptive, and we must engage with them on these issues.”

The SATB has also launched a media fellowship in Maharashtra to provide regional journalists with the opportunity to report on local issues around TB.

Himanshu Patel, another member of the SATB and MDR-TB survivor, said, “Continuing our current efforts, we will work with all stakeholders to build a State coalition to fight TB. Our goal is to enhance community engagement, and consequently create people centred, high quality care.”

The SATB will also work to establish similar survivor networks in other States.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tb-survivors-launch-statewide-network-to-tackle-patients-issues/article30875263.ece
375,2020/02/21,Payal Tadvi suicide: gynaecology HoD of Nair Hospital to appear before HC,"Court wants to know if 3 accused can complete their degree

The Bombay High Court on Thursday summoned the head of department, gynaecology and obstetrics of BYL Nair Hospital, to determine if the three accused in the suicide case of their junior colleague Payal Tadvi can be permitted to complete their master’s degree at the hospital.

The three doctors — Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Meher and Ankita Khandelwal — were arrested for abetting Tadvi’s suicide and were granted bail in August last year with the condition that they will not enter Topiwala National Medical College affiliated to Nair Hospital. Their medical licences were also suspended till the end of the trial.

A single Bench of Justice Sadhana Jadhav asked the head of department to be present in the court on Friday afternoon when it is likely to pass an order on a plea filed by the accused seeking modifications to the order which granted them bail.

Aabad Ponda, counsel for the three accused, asked the court for permission to enter the hospital so that they could complete their final year of post-graduation.

Justic Jadhav hinted that she was inclined to let the accused complete their education when she said, “It is true that the victim has lost her life and right to education, but at the same time we cannot stop the accused persons from pursuing their education. Our society is not the one to go for ‘an eye for an eye’.”

But the court also asked if it would be right for the accused to go back to the same college. Mr. Ponda then told the court that there were three units of gynaecology and obstetrics at Nair Hospital and the problem that the accused would get in touch with witnesses could be solved if they were shifted to some other unit.

But the special public prosecutor objected to it stating that all witnesses would be at the hospital, and that most of them were subordinates to the accused.

The court said it was also concerned about the fact that the three accused doctors ‘lacked sensitivity’, which led to the incident of their junior committing suicide.

Justice Jadhav directed the hospital’s gynaecology department head to remain present in the court to say if the accused doctors could be transferred to another unit.

376,2020/02/21,"Ahead of Assembly session, Uddhav to meet Modi in Delhi today","Courtesy call, no need to delve into details, says Raut

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Friday, ahead of the Assembly session that starts on Monday. This will be his first meeting with Mr. Modi in the Capital since being sworn in as CM.

After the Shiv Sena broke ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form government with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party in the State, there has been a lot of bad blood between the former allies.

Most recently, in a meeting of the State BJP council in Navi Mumbai, the party’s national president, J.P. Nadda, called the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) an unnatural alliance, saying the mandate was with the BJP. He also said that people would soon see a difference of opinion between the MVA allies.

The Sena, meanwhile, has been criticising the BJP through its mouthpiece Saamana over several issues, the recent ones being the BJP’s performance in the Delhi Assembly elections and the preparations for U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India.

However, there are also signs of strife between the MVA allies since the Centre transferred the Elgaar Parishad cases to the National Investigation Agency.

Following intense speculation on Thursday that the CM would meet Mr. Modi in Delhi on Friday, Sena MP Sanjay Raut confirmed the meeting in a tweet. He said it would be a courtesy visit and that there was no need to delve into details.

This will be Mr. Thackeray’s first meeting with the PM in Delhi as Chief Minister. Before this, the CM had gone to Pune to receive Mr. Modi, who was visiting the city for an event.

In December, the CM had written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman saying Maharashtra is awaiting dues of ₹15,558 crore, including GST compensation up to November 2019, from the Centre.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5z3anu/article30875236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMUDDHAV-MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ahead-of-assembly-session-cm-to-meet-modi-in-delhi-today/article30875237.ece
377,2020/02/21,Esplanade owner to submit repair plan,"Owner, 146 tenants arrange ₹50 cr., to submit plan to High Court in two weeks

The 153-year-old Watson’s Esplanade Hotel or Esplanade Mansion, one of the earliest surviving cast-iron framed building in the world, may soon undergo restoration after the building owner informed the Bombay High Court on Thursday that he, along with 146 bona fide tenants, will receive ₹50 crore to restore the structure.

Earlier, the Maharashtra government had expressed its inability to acquire the building for nearly ₹3,200 crore.

The owner also submitted that a plan will be formulated on the disbursement of the amount (the funding details were submitted in a confidential envelope to the court) and be given to the HC in two weeks. A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and R.I. Chagla told the landlord not to start repairs or to refurbish the structure before submitting the plan.

Appearing for the landlord, advocate Chirag Balsara submitted the confidential letter to the Bench bearing the proposal from the owner and tenants and said, “We are eager to undertake the restoration, and will do the work on our own.”

The Bench then suggested that the work be done under the supervision of an expert, to which the landlord said, “If the court so desires, we will not have any problem in an expert coming on board.”

Senior advocate Janak Dwarkadas, appearing for Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), brought to the court’s notice a hoarding on the building which the court directed to be removed. The court also added that if any tenant had objections they would have to serve an advance notice of 15 days before coming to the court.

Earlier, the High Court had directed the landlord to submit the cost estimates for the conservation and restoration of the building by February 20 after it found discrepancies in the list submitted by experts.

One expert submitted an estimate of ₹23 crore while a second one said that it would cost ₹98 crore for the conservation and restoration of the building.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/20hehv/article30875218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMESPLANADEMANSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/esplanade-owner-to-submit-repair-plan/article30875219.ece

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Thursday directed a fire audit of all municipal buildings, especially hospitals, in the backdrop of the blaze at GST Bhavan. He has also ordered regular mock drills for the staff.

The fire at GST Bhavan in Mazgaon on February 17 damaged three floors and destroyed several important documents. Despite it being a Monday, there were no casualties as most of the employees ran out of the building. The State government ordered an inquiry into the fire soon after.

The municipal commissioner held a meeting with Chief Fire Officer P.S. Rahangdale and officers from various departments to review fire safety in municipal buildings. Mr. Pardeshi also ordered a special fire audit of all municipal hospitals as they see lakhs of patients from all over the country.

He directed officials to ensure that any scrap material lying around in corridors be removed as that blocks fire exits and all electrical connections be checked.

Mr. Rahangdale informed the commissioner that firemen had seized around 11,000 unauthorised gas cylinders in the last six months.

379,2020/02/21,Women’s safety: Maharashtra delegation in Andhra Pradesh,"Bill along lines of Disha Act to be introduced in the budget session of Assembly

A high-level delegation led by Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh reached Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday to finalise the blueprint of a Disha-like law [Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2019] for the State.

The Maharashtra government is committed to bringing an Act on the lines of A.P.’s Disha Act for quick trial and judgment in cases of rape and acid attacks, Mr. Deshmukh said, following meetings with A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Home Minister Mekathoti Sucharita.

The Maharashtra delegation said it is committed to introducing a Bill in this regard in the Budget session of the State Assembly starting Monday. “I have come to Vijayawada to know about the direction of the efforts made by the Andhra Pradesh government to curb oppression of women. Our delegation has already met Andhra Pradesh Home Minister Mekathoti Sucharita for more detail on the nature of the law, the processes to be followed etc.,” Mr. Deshmukh said after the meetings.

The delegation, comprising Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sanjay Kumar, Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, Special Inspector General of Police Pratap Dighavkar, senior police officer Aswati Dorje and other senior officials, also met two A.P. women officers designated to implement the Disha Act. The Disha special officers, Dr. Kritika Shukla and M. Deepika, who have been instrumental in implementing the Act passed by the A.P. Assembly on December 13, 2019, informed the delegation of the impact of the Act so far, officials said.

In the wake of the incident at Hinganghat in Vidarbha earlier this month, where a 24-year-old lecturer was set ablaze by a married man, the Maharashtra government had decided to discuss the issue of women’s safety in the Cabinet. On February 4, the Cabinet set up a four-member committee comprising Mr. Deshmukh, School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad, Women and Child Development Minister Yashomati Thakur and Transport Minister Anil Parab.

The A.P. Act was formulated after the rape and murder of a veterinarian in Hyderabad late last year. The Act took its name from the one given to her prior to her death. It prescribes a death penalty for rape convicts in cases where there is conclusive evidence, within 21 days. It allows investigations to be completed in seven days and the trial to be closed in 14 days. “We will not only use Disha as a blueprint, but will also visit other States for studying similar laws before enacting our own version for the safety of women. It will be introduced in the next Cabinet meeting,” said a senior Home Department official.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3sz28t/article30875202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMDESHMUKH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/womens-safety-state-delegation-in-ap/article30875203.ece

The travel trade has said it had observed a 23% spike in air ticket bookings from February 15 over three days amidst offers by Air India and IndiGo and drop in airfares to countries like Thailand in wake of the spread of COVID-19.

Travel and hotel booking e-commerce website Ixigo said they have seen a 23% growth in domestic flight bookings for February 15 to and 18 as compared to the previous week. With travel to mainland China and even Hong Kong severely restricted over several weeks, the fare on sectors like Mumbai-Bangkok (one way) for February 22 was ₹5,658.

IndiGo has a four-day sale across its network. The sale, which will end on Friday, is offering customers an all-inclusive fare on international flights, starting at a ₹ 3,499. The sale is valid on travel from March 1 to September 30. William Boulter, chief commercial officer, IndiGo, said, “The sale will help customers plan their international travel in advance at more affordable fares.”

Reji Philip of Fort-based travel agency Cosmos, said two things typically move airfares: the number of seats versus passengers and fuel prices, and both are in favour of flyers in India. “The impact of coronavirus is stopping airfares from going out of reach,” he said.

Air India officials said their special airfare sale had been received well. Under the two-day flash sale, which ended on February 17, domestic flights on Air India’s route started from ₹799 while on international flights, fares began from ₹4,500.

According to data released by aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the domestic air passenger traffic in January increased by 2.2% to 1.27 crore as compared to the same month in 2019.

381,2020/02/21,App gives out ‘accident-prone area’ alerts,"Engineering students team up with Navi Mumbai traffic police for the service

The Navi Mumbai traffic police, in association with engineering students of Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology, D.Y. Patil Group, have launched a mobile application to alert Navi Mumbai motorists about accident-prone spots.

The application, ‘Drive Safe — Navi Mumbai Traffic Police’, was inaugurated on Tuesday.

A brainchild of Dr. Amit Barve, an associate professor in the computer engineering department, the application was developed in two months. “I had this idea for a long time that there should be something that can alert a motorist about a danger-prone area. Hence, we approached the Navi Mumbai traffic police and after we received their approval, started working on it,” Mr. Barve said.

The team comprised third-year computer engineering students Balvinder Singh Gambhir, Gaurav Gajre, Shubham Gawade, Kailas Rathod and Rushikesh Koli, who were all led by Mr. Barve. The team was guided by Dr. Leena Ragha, head of department, computer engineering, and Dr. Mukesh D. Patil, principal of the college.

Navi Mumbai traffic officials provided a list of around 25 accident-prone spots. The application can be downloaded from Google Playstore and used for navigation just like Google Maps. “The first voice alert comes 300 m before approaching the location. It says. ‘In 300 m, danger zone ahead’ and after crossing 200 m, the second and final voice alert says, ‘In 100 m, danger zone ahead. Please drive slowly’,” Mr. Barve said.

The application gives out alerts only in Navi Mumbai. The creators are willing to expand it to Mumbai and later for the State as well.

“This application, if used by all, will surely help prevent accidents. When the driver gets an alert about a danger zone, he will slow down, which will in turn help in reducing the chances of accidents in an accident-prone area,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Sunil Lokhande.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lepsp9/article30875171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bmApp-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/app-gives-out-accident-prone-area-alerts/article30875172.ece

A CR official said the idea was to prepare a plan similar to the ones being implemented at the airports, and they are looking to enlist the services of a third party to monitor the same.

“Vehicles will not be allowed to stay parked at the departure point beyond a stipulated amount of time, as is done at the airports. While the time has not been decided yet, the wait time should not be more than 5 minutes, beyond which a penalty can be levied,” a CR official said.

The plan is being drawn up by the Railway Protection Force to crack down on the illegal parking of taxis and commercial vehicles at both entry points of the station.

The DN Road entry predominantly has kaali peeli taxis parked. CR officials last month demolished the pre-paid booth, which they said had been running illegally.

The P D’Mello Road entry has parcel vans and other commercial vehicles parked, which hinders the movement of other passengers who are arriving or departing in their personal or hired vehicles.

CR officials said they would have dedicated pick-up points for passengers to ensure that they benefit from the system. An official said a taxi pick-up point near platform 18 was also being considered.

K K Ashraf, senior divisional security commissioner, Mumbai division, CR, said the modalities of the plan were still being worked out and discussions and deliberations were on with other departments of the division.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3df68y/article30875183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMCSMT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/on-lines-of-airports-cr-draws-up-plan-to-regulate-vehicles-at-csmt/article30875154.ece
383,2020/02/21,Bombay Hospital asked to explain after constable alleges graft for 2014 surgery,"Policeman claims violation of health scheme; why would he wait for 6 years to make allegation: doctor

A constable has alleged that he was made to pay ₹1 lakh for a surgery at Bombay Hospital, despite the hospital providing treatment free of cost to the personnel under a Mumbai Police welfare scheme. The police have now written to the hospital seeking an explanation.

The constable, Sunil Tibe, is posted with the Naigaon unit of the local arms division. The Hindu is in possession of a copy of the letter signed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters-I) N. Ambika, which states that a complaint has been received from Mr. Tibe on December 25 last year.

According to the complaint, Mr. Tibe met with an accident in March 2014 and was admitted to the hospital. Under the Mumbai Police Kutumb Arogya Yojana, police constables are provided treatment free of cost at select hospitals in the city, and Bombay Hospital is one of them.

“We have received a complaint according to which one Dr. Dewnany demanded and later accepted ₹1 lakh under the table from Mr. Tibe in exchange for conducting a surgery on his heel and kneecap. The complaint further states Dr. Dewnany told Mr. Tibe that the money paid towards the scheme goes to the hospital’s trust, and that he would have to pay the amount if he wanted a proper surgery,” the letter said.

It ends by asking the hospital authorities to provide a response to Mr. Tibe’s allegations at the earliest.

Ms. Ambika could not be reached for comment.

Speaking to The Hindu, orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Girish Dewnany said he was shocked by such an allegation. “I received a call from Bombay Hospital informing me about the letter. I have already told them that it is a false and baseless allegation.”

He recalled conducting multiple surgeries on the patient to save his leg from amputation. “His leg was in a very bad condition. I remember operating on him in March, April, and October 2014,” Dr. Dewnany said, adding the allegation has been made with a mala fide intention.

“Why would someone who was operated in 2014 wait for six years to make such an allegation?” he asked. The Bombay Hospital authorities have set up a meeting with the doctor to get clarity on the matter.

385,2020/02/21,A new citizen’s list,"Setting right what our ever-erroneous powers are getting wrong

Every now and then, I take stock of things. You could say I go all Marie Kondo on them. I like to think of it as the very efficient part of me in action. What I am trying to say is that stocktaking is a great thing to do. Which is why I don’t get all this furore about the NRC. Of course, we need to stock take our citizens, see if they are living up to certain standards and if not, let them walk a very long plank. But, before you huff and puff and blow it all down, I think where our ever-erroneous powers have erred is in specifying the criteria upon which this sorting should be based. The game is all fair, really; it is just that the rules for choosing the players need to be re-written. Of course I have a plan, why else would I even exist otherwise? Here are the people who definitely don’t deserve to be Indian citizens.

1. People who park in front of your entrance and say they are coming in two minutes but then disappear for an entire decade. Nobody, except dead people, have the right to be so reckless with their time. De-citizen-ify them.

2. Idiots who think movies that mock or deride women, ethnicities or disabilities, or promote violence against them, are even worth a watch. When such people turn up to buy a ticket, let’s make it a one-way airline type and let them enjoy their “in-flight movie” in ignorant peace. The cast and crew of the movie should also be on the same flight, one possibly with impending engine failure.

3. Goons who feel that students need to be educated at the business end of a stick. Be it in Hong Kong or saddi Dilli, one thing we should have learnt by now is that you don’t mess with students. It is one thing to give them a low grade for a copy-paste assignment, or to poke fun at them for being a millennial or, worse still, a Gen Z, but it is wholly another to barge into their... wait, why am I having to explain this? If you think I should, then you too need to be on that boat, matey. Just look for the HMS Titanic II at the docks.

4. Indian uncles who always have a “better deal” for anything that we’ve acquired. We all have one — a relative or acquaintance who not only belittles your every purchase or holiday by announcing how he has done it better, but also tells us about how we got gypped in the process. I say we ask him to validate his claims, like produce a stolen towel rack from a luxury resort as proof of said fabled holiday at ‘rockbottom’ prices. If he can’t, we get him, nay, we let him get the best deal of a ticket out of the country, for good.

5.And aunties, because this column is gender-equal, if you ever ask when any of us is getting married, let’s just say your next kitty party will be in an entirely different continent.

6. Spitters: if you spit, you gotta’ go. No exceptions.

7. Discussing the weather with me will earn you a warning, but even mildly attempting to discuss cricket or Bollywood will certainly earn you a spot on the ejectees’ list.

8.Manspreaders. Believe me, the situation is out of hand (or thigh?) and I am a man complaining about this! Let them all ride the standing ferry out of India to nowhere in particular.

9.Smelly people: from morning flights to malls, if you can’t keep your BO in check, get ready to be transported to a deserted island where all vegetation will soon wilt and die. Think of it like a fantasy reality TV show, except with no cameras.

10.Mansplainers. To expand this any further would make me guilty of it.

386,2020/02/21,Are buildings ready for climate change?,"Existing urbanisation models are not suitable for our country, especially the construction industry, and we need to evolve new strategies.

Global warming and climate change have become existential problems for humanity today. We are already experiencing their irreversible effects. More dangerous, catastrophic climate impacts are inevitable if we keep going without any restraints. Unrestricted Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, in the next 3 to 5 decades, shall raise the average earth temperature, melt the ice caps, cause forest fires, endanger land and aquatic species and raise sea levels, submerging several coastal cities.

CO2 concentration in the atmosphere will also cross the 500 ppm mark. Existing urbanisation models are not suitable at Indian scale due to its unprecedented population growth and there are no off-the-shelf algorithms for India. We need to chart our own path of sustainable growth. Decarbonisation is the only way forward. Climate change and global warming are interconnected. Assessing GHG emission will help developing mitigation strategies for global warming and optimisation of natural resources. This in turn compliments evolving a sustainable infrastructure.

The construction industry consumes enormous amounts of energy. The operative phase of a building’s life span is very large and consumes high energy but is distributed over a design period of about 60 years.

Energy consumption during this phase is more or less streamlined due to advanced technologies, efficient gadgets and building automation systems. GHG emissions are observed to be very high during the actual construction, resulting in what is called Carbon Spike Phenomena (CSP).

In the global scenario, buildings, industries, transport and other sectors consume 31%, 27%, 28% and 14% of total energy produced and emit 29%, 35%, 22% and 14% CO2 respectively. Out of the total GHG emission, 8 to 10% is by cement manufacturing industries. This is mainly due to heating of kiln furnaces up to 1500 deg. C using enormous amount of fossil fuel. Laudably, many cement manufacturers now are constantly striving hard to optimise and refine the manufacturing processes. It is recorded that GHG emission due to one tonne of manufactured cement varies from 0.65 to 1.0 tonne of CO2 equivalent.

About 70% of Indian population still lives in rural areas and looking forward to migrate to nearby cities. This migration puts enormous pressure on limited land mass and available infrastructure in cities. It is projected that by 2050, India will experience one of the most dramatic transitions seen in human history, causing urban population to swell from current 300 million to 700 million. Mumbai-Nasik-Pune, NCR and Greater Kolkata are expected to be the three largest urban concentration corridors in the world.

Rural migration occurs for two important reasons. Firstly, due to climate-induced impacts including floods, droughts, storms etc., and migrants are termed as environmental refugees. This group will face a different set of problems in the urban scenario in terms of housing and other facilities. Secondly, migration in search of better lifestyle, education, comfort and safe living. This group will contribute to greenhouse gas emission, adding to global warming.

The need of the hour is to become sensitive to the impacts of climate change and global warming, to evolve a road map of achieving sustainable growth and to develop right mitigation strategies to decarbonise.

387,2020/02/21,Heart of the sea,"The third largest country in Africa, Libya is rich in history, boasts a long coastline and the Sahara desert.

Libya, in North Africa, is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea in the north, Egypt in the east, and Tunisia and Algeria in the west. There are about 140 tribes and clans and the official language is Arabic.

Libya's terrain is mostly barren, and features flat to undulating plains, plateaus and depressions. The Mediterranean coast and the Sahara Desert are the most prominent natural features.

The climate is mostly extremely dry and desert-like in nature. However, the northern regions enjoy a milder Mediterranean climate.

The Libyan Desert, which covers much of Libya, is one of the most arid and sun-baked places on earth. In some places, decades may pass without seeing any rainfall at all.

The hot, dry, dust-laden sirocco (known as the gibli) blows from one to four days in spring and autumn. There are several oases, the most important are Ghadames and Kufra.

When searching for oil in 1950, a massive aquifer underneath much of the country was also discovered. The water in this aquifer pre-dates the last ice age and the desert itself.

Food

The cuisine has Mediterranean, North African and Berber influences. The most popular dish is bazin, an unleavened bread. Tripoli, the capital, is especially partial to Italian food and pasta is a favourite. In the south traditional Arab and Berber cuisine are favoured.

Culture

Highly influenced by Islamic traditions, Libya has a rich history of folk art and dances. The arts include weaving, embroidery, metal engraving, and leather work are dominated by geometric and arabesque designs.

The country has five UNESCO world heritage sites, three of which are classical ruins. The heritage sites include Tadrart Acacus (Acacus Mountains), Arch of Marcus Aurelius, Sabratha, Ghadamès (the pearl of the desert).

390,2020/02/21,Dasavatharam performed at festival,"Natyanjali, a five-day event, is under way in Chidambaram

The 39th edition of the Natyanjali festival, which commenced in Chidambaram on Wednesday, brought together myriad dance forms on a single platform, with veteran and young dancers marking their presence at the five-day annual event.

Dasavatharam, a dance drama by students of the Nrithya Sangeetha Academy in the U.K., featured 20 dancers.

The students were supported by their guru and founder of the academy, Rathika Rajalokanathan. The performance by the team depicted the avatars of Vishnu, through the form of a dance drama. The performance started with an invocatory Thodaya Mangalam. This was followed by the dancers re-enacting the Dasavatharam — Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parasurama, Rama, Balarama, Krishna and Kalki — culminating with the Parkadal Alai Mele.

“Bharatanatyam is pure and expressive and the dance drama was choreographed in a simplified manner to ensure that even a layman understood it,” said Ms. Rajalokanathan.

The dancers, in the 5-50 age group, were trained individually for the performance in the last one-and-a-half months. The children were taught about Vishnu’s 10 avatars through pictures and visuals, and the team feels blessed to have performed at such a prestigious event, she said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/tot8e7/article30874426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THDANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/dasavatharam-performed-at-festival/article30874427.ece
391,2020/02/21,"Framing the stark realities of life, in black and white","French photographer’s work is on display at the Tasmai Art and Cultural Centre

French photographer Yann Le Ny is showcasing a section of his frames from Tunisia and Japan at the Tasmai Art and Cultural Centre.

The black-and-white frames depict the stark realities of life in the North African country. Le Ny zooms in on the many homeless women and the underprivileged, in the seemingly prosperous streets of Kairouan, a city in the northern Tunisian desert.

The subjects remain shrouded and faceless in his frames, giving them an aura of vulnerability.

Hailing from Strasbourg, Le Ny has been capturing facets of life on his Olympus camera, on the streets of various cities he travels, for over five years.

He is a regular visitor to India and Puducherry. A couple of years ago, he was engaged in a project for the Alliance Francaise. “I prefer black-and-white photography as it gives a depth of emotion and tone,” he said.

The exhibits from Japan focus primarily on the movements of a Butoh dancer.

The show, which concludes on Saturday, was co-hosted by Collectif, founded by Ari Gautier, a French author living in Norway, who has been a regular to the city. “Besides my writings, I have started Collectif, which involves artists, writers, film-makers and people from the cultural milieu, to promote the city’s unique culture,” Mr. Gautier said.

Cultural exchange

Collectif is organising two exhibitions for city-based photographer Mouhamad Moustapha in France, in April and October. “I believe that cultural exchange is very important,” he said.

Collectif is working on hosting more such shows to provide better visibility to local as well as international artists in the city.

Le Ny says he has been out on the streets of the city, shooting its varied moods and people.

This follows reports that the All-India Trade Union Congress too had raised objections to the move. A State government undertaking, KIIDC markets the ‘Hilly Aqua’ brand of bottled water.

M. Thampan, general secretary of the union, told the media on Thursday that the product could not be released into the market due to lack of clearance from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) clearance. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India had earlier given its clearance.

The plant has a capacity of 7,200 litre and the plan was to produce 1.81 lakh bottles a day.

The bottles in the ‘Thelineer’ brand were to come in 500 ml, one litre, and two litre bottles and 15 litre canisters.

The earlier plan was that KWA staff themselves would run the plant. Now the proposal is to hand over the handling and operations of the plant to KIIDC.

With the dispute threatening to derail the ₹60 crore initiative, the Water Resources Department has hastily stepped in. After a long delay, the department finally issued formal orders handing over six acres of Irrigation Department land in the area to the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) - the implementation agency - on Tuesday. Steps have also been launched to get its boundaries properly demarcated.

Following protests by a group of people, work on the project had ground to a halt more than a month back. But the department apparently did little to sort out the issue - until this week.

Scheduled for commissioning in March 2021, the Neyyar project promises Thiruvananthapuram city 100 million litres a day (mld) and 20 mld to the Vilappil, Vilavoorkal, Maranalloor and Malayinkeezhu panchayats. The long-term water requirements of the capital city hinge on the successful completion of this project.

Legally dismissed

According to the Irrigation Department, the land was identified for the KWA project after all external claims to it were legally dismissed. However, the protesters are still persisting with their claim. The KWA contractor - Chicago Constructions International Ltd - had commenced preliminary work three months ago, but they were forced to suspend work following the protest.

Bureaucratic delays too have amply contributed to the muddle. Although the KWA had kicked off work on the project, formal orders transferring the land to it were delayed. Moreover, the boundaries are yet to be demarcated.

Now that the orders have been issued, the KWA has requested revenue authorities to demarcate the land within two weeks.

According to Irrigation officials, KWA was offered the land after encroachments were cleared and High Court also upheld the department's claim on the land.

“The location is part of the highest point in the region, making it ideal for gravity-assisted pumping of the treated water to the city,” a KWA official said.

New pipeline

A new transmission main will be laid for carrying water from Neyyar to the KWA reservoir at PTP Nagar. This will be taken up as a separate project and is expected to cost ₹207 crore.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/neyyar-drinking-water-project-clouded-by-land-row/article30874603.ece

The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has demanded that an investigation be conducted into the case of two children who went missing from Karamana and Kannammoola in the city by an officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police, under the supervision of an Inspector General of Police.

The commission, in a statement here on Thursday, said Rahul, 15, of Kannammoola and Abhijith, 16, of Karamana and had gone missing on Feb. 15, 16 respectively.

While Abhijith’s body had been found from the Karamana river, Rahul was yet to be found.

Exam stress

As per the preliminary information received by the commission, the children had left their house owing to exam stress.

In the wake of this, the commission suo motu took cases in connection with both the incidents. Commission chairperson P. Suresh visited the children’s houses and took statements.

Abhijith’s parents denied that he had committed suicide. They said they suspected he had been murdered. His clothes, spectacles, and footwear were not found on his body or nearby.

The police too had been unable to locate these.

401,2020/02/21,Veteran scribe M.S. Mani practised value-based journalism: CM Pinarayi Vijayan,"The Chief Minister was addressing a function in memory of the veteran scribe

M.S. Mani continued his journalism without becoming anxious about setbacks, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was addressing a function in memory of veteran journalist M.S. Mani at Press Club here on Thursday.

The Chief Minister said Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai was exiled from the erstwhile Travancore before Independence. However, not many know that M.S. Mani had to face raids in an independent India, suffer a house arrest like condition in his newspaper office, or quit his post as editor in the name of writing a report, he said.

Investigative journalism

M.S. Mani was the one who kicked off investigative journalism that was still unheard of in Malayalam media. He published a near flawless report ‘Kattukallanmaar’ that created a stir in the corridors of power.

But it led to a response that created problems for the management of Kerala Kaumudi.

M.S. Mani not only ran a newspaper but also practised value-based journalism. He stayed steadfast to his values even when he became the owner, Mr. Vijayan said.

As an editor, he gave ample freedom to the new generation. His contributions were not limited to Kerala Kaumudi, they benefited Malayalam journalism in toto, the Chief Minister said.

402,2020/02/21,SC to hear State plea on airport next week,"High Court had refused to entertain a writ against the AAI

The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear next week an appeal filed by the Kerala government against the Kerala High Court’s refusal to entertain its petition challenging a proposal of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to grant the right of operation, management and development of Thiruvananthapuram Airport to Adani Enterprises Limited.

The petition came up before a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde.

Not maintainable

The High Court had on December 18 last year concluded that the State’s writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable before it.

The AAI proposal to hand over the airport management to the private company was essentially an implementation of the central policy, the High Court had reasoned.

The High Court said the dispute was between the State of Kerala and the Union government. Only the Supreme Court, and not High Courts, has jurisdiction in such Centre-State disputes. Kerala ought to directly file a suit under Article 131 in the Supreme Court, the High Court had advised.

Challenging this conclusion, the State contended in the Supreme Court that AAI is a necessary party in this dispute. Though it was a government policy, it is the AAI which has to prepare the lease. The lease for turning over the airport to the Adani company would be bad in law without the participation of the AAI.

The State dismissed the idea of filing a direct suit in the Supreme Court under Article 131.

It contended that a suit under Article 131 is permitted only if the dispute is exclusively between the Centre and a State government. The AAI does not qualify to be called a ‘State’ under the Article. Hence, a suit under Article 131 cannot be filed in the Supreme Court because though AAI is a necessary party to the dispute, it does not answer to the definition of a ‘State’. So, the only option was a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, Kerala government argued.

The State has contended that handing over the airport to Adani Enterprises Limited, who has no previous experience in managing airports, is “not in public interest and is violative of the provisions of the Airport Authority of India Act of 1994 as well as the proprietary rights of the State Government as regards the land wherein the Thiruvananthapuram Airport is situated”.

Arbitrary

This proposal ignored the Kerala Chief Minister’s offer to take the project at the rate at par with what was quoted by Adani, the Kerala government submitted. The State said the proposal is an arbitrary exercise of power.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/sc-to-hear-state-plea-on-airport-next-week/article30874577.ece

Chennaiyin FC defeated 10-man Mumbai City FC 1-0 on Friday in a virtual knockout tie to seal the final playoff berth in the Indian Super League. Defender Lucian Goian, formerly of Mumbai City, struck the winner in the 83rd minute from a corner kick, which took Chennaiyin's tally to 28 points, two more than the Islanders.

Mumbai City defender Sourav Das was shown a straight red in the 54th minute for bringing down Lallianzuala Chhangte, when he was running through on goal.

Chennaiyin has scripted a remarkable turnaround after having taken just six points from its opening six matches when it made the decision to part ways with former coach John Gregory.

404,2020/02/21,I-League | Neroca beats Gokulam,"Pritam Ningthoujam drew first blood for Neroca FC in the second minute before Shibil Muhammed restored parity for Gokulam in the 25th minute

Host Neroca FC eked out a narrow 3-2 win over Gokulam Kerala FC in a Hero I-League match to come out of the relegation zone here on Friday.

Pritam Ningthoujam drew first blood for Neroca FC in the second minute before Shibil Muhammed restored parity for Gokulam in the 25th minute.

The visitors then took the lead through Nataniel Garcia in the 40th minute.

After the breather, Neroca FC equalised in the 48th minute through Philip Adjah.

Neroca scored its third goal nine minutes from the end of regulation time through Ronald Singh to register a much-needed win.

Neroca FC started pressing hard for an early lead from the start. And its initial surge paid dividends when a mistimed clearance by the visitors saw the ball land in front of Pritam, who made no mistake in slotting home.

Gokulam reorganised itself and thereafter started attacking the Manipur side. Soon, Muhammed restored parity for the visitor after receiving a through ball from Marcus Joseph.

Gokulam then started its trademark passing game all over the pitch.

Joseph, Nataniel Garcia and Atuheire Kipson kept pressing hard for the visitors, keeping the lacklustre Neroca defence on its toes.

The Kerala outfit pulled ahead in the 40th minute when a short cross from Joseph found Garcia, who slotted home with a gem of a goal.

After the change of ends, Neroca pressed hard and its efforts soon paid dividends when Sebastian’s throw to Irshad was anticipated rightly by Neroca’s Philip Adjah, who scored a beautiful goal in the 48th minute to cancel the visitors’ lead.

Neroca shifted gears but the finesse in front of the opposition goal was missing.

Gokulam coach Fernando Varela introduced Henry Kisseka early into the second half. The change added pace and vigour but lacked the desired result.

Neroca boss Gift Rai Khan threw his last dice with a couple of changes in the final 10 minutes, introducing Chanso Horam and Siam Hangal, replacing Subash Singh and Busai Attila.

The changes yielded result immediately when Chanso’s cross, which was sloppily defended by Jestin George, landed straight into the feet of Ronald Singh, who made no mistake.

The result: Neroca FC 3 (Pritam Ningthoujam 2, Philip Adjah 48, Ronald Singh 81) bt Gokulam FC 2 (Shibil Muhammed 25, Nataniel Garcia 40).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/i-league-neroca-beats-gokulam/article30883348.ece
405,2020/02/21,How Gokulam Kerala women’s football team became champions,"The Gokulam Kerala women’s team emerged champions at the Indian Women’s League last week. Here’s what is behind their victory

Last week was VC Praveen’s most memorable one. At Coimbatore last Wednesday, Gokulam Kerala scored a badly needed 1-0 win against defending champion Chennai City in a crucial I-League match. Two days later, the women’s team of Gokulam did even better: it emerged champion at the fourth edition of the Indian Women’s League at Bengaluru. Gokulam Kerala is the only I-League or ISL team to have a women’s team.

Praveen, president of Gokulam Kerala, is delighted. “I had a lot of faith in the team and, after watching the other teams in the opening rounds, I felt our girls had the potential to win the title,” he said. “It is remarkable our women’s team has won the league before the men. This victory is no doubt an inspiration for the men’s team, too.”

He attributes the success to coach PV Priya, who has been with the team from its inception. She feels the team succeeded this year because it invested in some top quality players. “Another factor is experience,” says Priya. “We had a good team last year too, but lack of experience let us down.” (Gokulam had reached the semifinals last year. To make it to the League this year, the team had to play in the qualifying phase because Kerala doesn’t have a State league).

It’s a Goal At Bengaluru, Priya’s girls were in top form. They defeated Bangalore United 5-1, Odisha Police 7-0, Sreebhumi FC 1-0, Kenkre FC 10-1 and Bidesh XI 5-0 in the preliminary stage.

In the semifinals, they shocked defending Sethu FC 3-0 to set up the final clash with Kryspha. They won the exciting final 3-2.

In the final, Sabitra Bhandari, the Nepalese star who played a big role in Gokulam's triumph, netted the winning goal. She was also the top-scorer in the tournament with 19 goals. Yumnam Kamala Devi, from Manipur, was the other main scorer with eight goals. “I was very happy that I could bring both of them to Gokulam this year,” says Praveen. “Since the pool of quality players in India is very small, it is imperative that you get the best of the lot in your side.”

To get big stars, you have to spend big. “Running a women’s club is almost as expensive as running a men’s club,” explains Praveen. “But that didn’t stop me from forming the club. Gokulam Kerala believes in equal opportunity to women. My next aim is to have a team that has at least half the players from Kerala.”

That may not be easy, given the state of women’s football in Kerala. “We still have a long way to go, especially when compared to States like Manipur, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand,” says Priya. “But I see some potential among our young players.”

Praveen hopes Gokulam’s succes at the Indian Women's League will be a big boost to the game in Kerala. “If women’s football has to improve in India, the All India Football Federation has to make it mandatory for all clubs to form women’s teams. As of now we are the only one to have a women’s team.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/6szzpn/article30881184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpgokulam2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/the-gokulam-kerala-womens-team-emerged-champions-at-the-indian-womens-league-last-week-heres-what-is-behind-their-victory/article30881188.ece
406,2020/02/21,Messi demands calm after chaotic 2 months for Barcelona,"The run of poor results has not been stemmed by a coaching change.

Barcelona has been hit recently by a series of setbacks on the field and conflicts inside the club.

And Lionel Messi has had enough of it.

“We have only had problem after problem since January. What we need is some calm and to think about soccer, to think about the games, and to try to improve,” Messi told Spanish sports daily Mundo Deportivo in an interview on Thursday.

“At least we need to isolate ourselves (from the noise) because, if not, there are going to be complicated months ahead. We must be patient and hopefully we can turn this around.”

Since the start of the year, Barcelona has lost the Spanish Super Cup, been eliminated from the Copa del Rey, and ceded the lead in the Spanish league to Real Madrid.

The run of poor results has not been stemmed by a coaching change. Quique Setien replaced Ernesto Valverde and so far the team has struggled to adapt to the physical demands of his high-pressure playing style.

Injuries have also played their part. Striker Luis Suarez is out for several weeks and winger Ousmane Dembele for the rest of the season, forcing the club to make the curious signing of Denmark forward Martin Braithwaite to give it fit bodies in a depleted attack.

But the rest of the chaos has been created by the club.

Messi himself has been embroiled in a public spat with sports director — and former teammate — Eric Abidal, who has accused some players of not playing hard for Valverde. Messi responded on social media by demanding that Abidal name names and to take full responsibility for the firing of Valverde.

Two weeks later, Messi maintained his position that he had felt “attacked” by Abidal as a member of Barcelona’s squad and its captain.

“It bothered me that a club official, a sports director, had put the squad in middle of the firing of coach. That seemed crazy to me,” Messi said.

“He takes the decisions. That’s why I decided to clarify things. I knew that I couldn’t let the sports director attack me like that.”

Abidal said Thursday he should’t have talked publicly about the team’s problems.

“I’ve learned that internal issues need to be resolved within the club, not in the media,” the former player said.

Then came the oddest of all the Barcelona maladies when earlier this week the club severed its contract with an Internet services company that made negative comments on social media about people within the club.

Reports by Spanish radio Cadena SER said those online comments included Messi, fellow player Gerard Pique as well as former coach Pep Guardiola.

Messi said that he was still not sure what had happened.

“The truth is that I find it strange that something like that could happen,” the Argentine said.

“But they (Cadena SER) also said there was evidence. We will have to wait to see if it is true or not.”

Barcelona President Josep Bartomeu said Thursday an investigation remains open and the club will publicly talk about the results when it’s completed.

“We are working internally and analyzing everything,” he said.

“When we have anything else to say, we will let everybody know.”

Messi made the call for his club to put its house in order ahead of an important stretch of matches for the defending league champions. After hosting Eibar on Saturday, Barcelona travels to Italy to face Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday. It will then visit Real Madrid on March 1 in a “clasico” that could determine who leads the league.

Messi, however, also sent a message to Barcelona’s fans that he has no plans to abandon the club that has been his home since he was 13 years old.

“I have said many times that my plan (is to finish my career at Barcelona) and as long as the club and our fans want the same thing there will never be a problem,” Messi said.

“I have also said many times that I would like to be here and for all of us, the club, and our fans to be happy with the team we have and for us to be winners.”

The 32-year-old Messi is Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer with 622 goals. He has helped it win more than 30 trophies, including four Champions Leagues and 10 Spanish league titles.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/5rh5pz/article30878699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MESSI-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/messi-demands-calm-after-chaotic-2-months-for-barcelona/article30878700.ece
407,2020/02/21,"Europa League | Eriksen scores first Inter goal, Ajax lose, Manchester United held","Getafe beat Ajax 2-0, Wolves' Jota grabs hat-trick to sink Espanyol, Lacazette gives Arsenal 1-0 win at Olympiakos

Inter Milan midfielder Christian Eriksen scored his first goal for the club since last month's move from Tottenham Hotspur to set up a 2-0 win at Ludogorets Razgrad in their Europa League last 32, first leg on Thursday.

Getafe pulled off a surprise 2-0 home win over last year's Champions League semi-finalists Ajax Amsterdam, while Manchester United were held 1-1 at Club Brugge in wet and windy conditions.

Wolverhampton Wanderers' Diogo Jota scored a second successive hat-trick in the competition to lead his side to a 4-0 victory over Espanyol and Arsenal won 1-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus with a late Alexandre Lacazette goal.

Inter were frustrated for more than an hour by their Bulgarian opponents until Denmark playmaker Eriksen fired a low shot into the net from just outside the penalty area in the 71st minute.

“I think he can do much better than what we've seen today,” said Inter coach Antonio Conte. “I'm happy because the goal always gives confidence, but he has to find the rhythm and intensity that have made him stand out in the past years.”

Substitute Romelu Lukaku sealed Inter's win with a stoppage-time penalty, the Belgian striker's 22nd goal of the season, after Anicet Andrianantenaina was judged to have handled following a VAR review.

United were quickly in trouble in Belgium when Emmanuel Dennis lobbed the ball over Sergio Romero to give Brugge a 15th- minute lead, but Anthony Martial levelled in the 36th minute when he raced through to place a shot past Simon Mignolet.

United, with new midfield signing Bruno Fernandes on the bench, struggled to create many chances in the difficult conditions.

Jota strikes

At Molineux, Jota opened his account in the first half for Wolves when he poked in from close range and fellow Portuguese Ruben Neves volleyed the second early in the second half.

Jota fired home the third from Matt Doherty's pass before completing his hat-trick with a strike from the edge of the box.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka combined to set up an easy finish for Frenchman Lacazette to score the winner for Arsenal in the 81st minute and they nearly had a second when Sokritis Papastathopoulos headed against the woodwork.

Brazilian pair Deyverson and Kenedy scored in each half for Getafe against Ajax. Deyverson finished off a well-worked free kick to celebrate his European debut for the Liga club with a goal after 38 minutes and Kenedy broke clear to add a second in the last minute.

There was a remarkable comeback by Rangers who scored three goals in the last half hour, including a brace from Ianis Hagi, to beat Braga 3-2 after trailing 2-0 to the Portuguese visitors.

Daichi Kamada scored a hat-trick to help Eintracht Frankfurt to a 4-1 win over coach Adi Huetter's former club RB Salzburg.

408,2020/02/21,Barcelona sign striker Martin Braithwaite outside transfer window,"The 28-year-old, who scored six league goals in 21 starts for Leganes this season will be officially unveiled at the Camp Nou

Barcelona have signed Denmark striker Martin Braithwaite from fellow La Liga side Leganes for €18 million ($19.43 million) after receiving permission from the league's organising body to acquire a player outside the transfer window.

The Spanish champions said in a statement on Thursday they had paid the player's release clause and he will join the club until June 2024, with a buy-out clause of 300 million euros.

The 28-year-old, who scored six league goals in 21 starts for Leganes this season will be officially unveiled at the Camp Nou later on Thursday.

Barca decided not to sign a forward in the January transfer window after Luis Suarez was ruled out for four months following knee surgery but need another striker after French international Ousmane Dembele ruptured his hamstring.

Dembele was ruled out for six months after surgery earlier this month and, unlike in other major European leagues, clubs in Spain are allowed to sign a player outside the transfer window under special circumstances.

Leganes, who are second-bottom in La Liga, have been forced to part ways with their two key strikers since the start of the year after Youssef En-Nesyri left in January when Sevilla paid his 20 million-euro release clause.

Chief executive Martin Ortega fiercely criticised the rule which has left his side without their top scorer in their battle against relegation.

“We believe this rule is not fair and Barcelona have benefited from it while Leganes have been harmed by it. We want to raise our voices because we're in a very serious situation and have suffered a lot of damage,” he told reporters.

“We cannot understand the ruling that allows a club that has an injured player to carry out an operation like this unilaterally and transfer their problem to another club.”

However, he said he had no problem with Braithwaite or Barcelona.

“Barcelona have acted correctly, they told us on Monday of their intentions and the only way to get him was to pay the clause,” he added.

“We want to thank the player who has been professional until he left the club and who has been performed superbly for us.”

Braithwaite began his career with Danish side Esbjerg, later moving to Ligue 1 club Toulouse and then English outfit Middlesbrough, also playing on loan for Girondins Bordeaux.

He has made 39 appearances for Denmark, including four matches at the 2018 World Cup.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/7pkky1/article30874187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAITH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/barcelona-sign-striker-martin-braithwaite-outside-transfer-window/article30874188.ece
409,2020/02/21,"After four years, industrial estate in Mallur finally gets takers","The Small Industries Development Corporation has managed to sell two plots on the estate to small entrepreneurs recently

Almost four years after the establishment of an industrial estate in Mallur on the outskirts of Ariyalur, the Small Industries Development Corporation (SIDCO) has allotted industrial plots to two entrepreneurs.

SIDCO had promoted the industrial estate in Mallur in 2015, with a view to supporting small, medium and micro entrepreneurs and promoting industrial activities. Of the 25 acres, SIDCO developed 31 plots ranging from 5 cents to 75 cents on 5 acres, in the first phase, so as to suit the varied requirements of entrepreneurs. It also laid roads at the industrial estate and an approach road. Other basic infrastructures such as water supply, storm water drainage and power lines were also provided.

The plots were opened for outright sales or a 30-year long lease basis. Interested persons were given six months time for settlement from the date of allotment. Since the estate is located near cement factories, SIDCO officials expected that the estate would find many takers. On the contrary, none came forward to purchase the plots. In spite of a number of promotional campaigns, SIDCO could not make any headway in promoting the estate.

Now, after a long gap, SIDCO has managed to sell two plots to small entrepreneurs recently. They are expected to start their ventures shortly. SIDCO officials say there were signs of demand picking up for the plots in the estate.

“Until recently, there were hardly any enquires for plots. But, we get credible enquiries on a daily basis now. We hope that the allotment will pick up pace shortly,” a senior official of SIDCO said.

The estate is well connected by rail and road. A number of development works have been taken up in Ariyalur. The laying of highways from Perambalur to Thanjavur via Ariyalur and Tiruchi to Chidambaram via Meensuriti might be the reasons for increasing enquiries for industrial plots, officials said.

SIDCO has invited fresh applications for allotment of plots at the Ariyalur industrial estate. Interested persons can apply online. The last date for submission of application is February 29.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tiw0mq/article30878399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FEBTH-SIDCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/after-four-years-industrial-estate-in-mallur-finally-gets-takers/article30878401.ece

415,2020/02/21,RTA to impart training to LLR aspirants,"Applicants cannot skip this programme, says official

In order to make sure the candidate applying for Learning Licence Registration (LLR) is aware of the basic traffic norms and regulations, the Transport Department, in association with automobile major Honda, will conduct Safety Driving Education programme for the LLR applicants. The one-hour training programme with a simulator experience, which has been made mandatory, will be imparted to the candidates an hour before they appear for LLR test. Honda is associating with the project under its CSR activity.

The programme is likely to begin at the RTA office from the end of this month or the first week of March. Moreover, Visakhapatnam will be the second city after Vijayawada to have such cost-free simulation centre.

According to Deputy Transport Commissioner (DTC) G. Raja Ratnam, the department would inform the candidates/applicants to attend the LLR test before two hours of their slot time. Officials from the Honda company will train about road safety rules, regulations for about an hour in the class. They will also make use of simulator for better experience.

“After attending this class, we will issue a certificate. The certificate is mandatory for attending the LLR test. Applicants cannot skip this training programme,” Mr. Raja Ratnam said.

The DTC said that many people know to drive perfectly, but they might not understand the symbols used in signboards. The main aim of the training programme is to create awareness about road safety among the applicants.

Room provided

416,2020/02/21,"Now, moviegoers need not pay parking fee in Vizag","GVMC issues orders after government okays proposal

The GVMC has issued orders pertaining to revised parking charges at all multiplexes, shopping malls and cinema theatres in its limit, much to the relief of the citizens.

No fee will be charged for parking vehicles for the first 30 minutes, said an official tweet made by Municipal Commissioner G. Srijana on Thursday.

Revised rates 0 to 30 min. - no fee

30 to 59 min. – no fee on any purchase

1hr and above- No charge if the purchase is more than parking fee

In September last , the city police announced that the parking charges would be regulated and sent recommendations to the GVMC. However, it was not implemented. Finally, the government has okayed the proposal and the GVMC issued the orders.

No fee will be charged for parking vehicles from 30 and 59 minutes if there is any purchase. The visitors need not pay parking fee for one hour and above if the purchase is more than the parking fee.

The citizens have been complaining that exorbitant fees are being charged at multiplexes, cinema theatres and shopping malls.

“This indicates that there shall be no parking fee, unless one visits the place and hangs around for hours without making any purchase,” said a GVMC official.

Responding to a tweet, Ms. Srijana indicated that there would be no parking fees for moviegoers. “# No more charges. If you go for movie #,” she tweeted.

The GVMC officials said cinema tickets cost more than the parking fees any way which means the visitors need not to pay.

Immediately after the word on the revised parking charges spread and people visiting shopping malls, multiplexes and cinema theatres started questioning the management. But the common reply was that “the GVMC had reduced the charges, did not abolish it’.

Many malls and multiplexes put up boards with revised charges: ₹20 for 0-6 hours; ₹40 for 6 – 12 hours; and ₹100 for 12 -24 hours. However, a senior police officer said the tariffs were not as per the order.

“As per rules framed under GO 168 (MA&UD) issued on April 7, 2012 in the united Andhra Pradesh, adequate off-street parking space has to be provided by the commercial establishments. Any fee charged is illegal,” he said.

Check your bill

He said the visitors should check their bills before leaving the shopping malls as the parking charges might have been added to the bills.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/lhhxpa/article30878405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-rjy-parking-graphic-revcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/now-moviegoers-need-not-pay-parking-fee-in-vizag/article30878406.ece

418,2020/02/21,TIDCO beneficiaries can select plot size of their choice: Botcha,"‘Panel looking into Pancha Gramalu issue; erring staff will face disciplinary action’

Reiterating the government’s resolve to provide housing to the poor, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister Botcha Satyanarayana has instructed municipal officials to ask beneficiaries to be given a choice of the size of plots for houses being constructed by the Township and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDCO).

At a meeting with the Municipal Commissioners and officials from Town Planning departments of north-coastal and East Godavari districts at the GVMC office on Thursday, Mr. Satyanarayana said the options of 430 sft, 363 sft and 300 sft should be sent to the State government.

Summer Action Plan

The Minister also instructed the officials to prepare a Summer Action Plan and send it to the government for sanction of funds. He said the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was being sought for laying pipelines in cities and towns across the State.

About 46% of the pending applications under Building Penalisation Scheme (BPS) as well as layout regularisation applications should be disposed of transparently, Mr. Satyanarayana said. He instructed them to act sternly with unauthorised constructions and conduct surprise inspections before sanctioning transferable development rights and BPS and LRS approval.

Principal Secretary (MA&UD) J. Syamala Rao warned of disciplinary action against erring employees.

Commissioner and Director of Municipal Administration G.S.R.K.R. Vijay Kumar said the list of eligible beneficiaries for housing should be sent only after careful inspection.

419,2020/02/21,HSL finishes refit of INS Sindhuvir before schedule,"This puts the company in good stead for future projects, says CMD

Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) organised a ceremony to mark the refit of INS Sindhuvir here on Thursday.

HSL displayed its prowess in submarine repairs by completing extensive upgrades, repairs, system integration and trials of INS Sindhuvir ahead of the contractual delivery date of February 9.

Rear Admiral Sreekumar Nair, Admiral Superintendent, Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam complimented HSL on completing the refit ahead of deadline.

HSL CMD Rear Admiral L.V. Sarat Babu (Retd.) said the timely completion of refit was possible due to active involvement of the Naval Dockyard and support of the Eastern Naval Command (ENC).

Apart from this, a strong vendor base of 70 MSMEs developed during the refit had cumulatively generated a sizeable local revenue, employment and enhancement of skill, he said.

The CMD said that this had put HSL on a strong pedestal for undertaking future projects such as the construction of Project 75I-class submarine, medium refit life certification of Sindhugosh and other submarine refits by harnessing the potential of Indian companies, thus contributing to the Make in India initiative.

Leadership award

Rear Admiral Sarat Babu was honoured with the PSU Leadership Award by ‘Governance Now’ for transforming the HSL into a profitable PSU. The HSL has also won an award in the category of research and innovation (financial) for achieving an operating and net profit for the last four consecutive years (FY 2015-16 to 2018-19).

422,2020/02/21,Trade unions protest as POSCO team visits VSP,"They oppose land allocation to Korean steelmaker as part of the joint venture

Trade unions affiliated to the CITU, the AITUC and others staged a demonstration at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to register their protest against the visit of a team from Korean steelmaker POSCO to explore the possibility of entering into a joint venture with Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), on Thursday.

Around 200 members from various trade unions gathered near the administrative office of the RINL and staged a protest even as a posse of police personnel was deployed to prevent any untoward incident.

VSP recognised union president and CITU leader J. Ayodhyaram said that RINL Chairman-cum-Managing Director P.K. Rath and other senior officials held a meeting with the POSCO team at the project office.

As part of the joint venture, the POSCO has proposed a high-end steel plant on the land belonging to the RINL in Visakhapatnam, to meet the demand of automobile industry. However, the trade unions are vehemently opposing it.

Among others, CITU State president Ch. Narsinga Rao, AITUC leader D. Adinarayana and others took part in the protest. They alleged that despite the denial by Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, the proposal was still under active consideration.

“A layout has been prepared in 2,768 acres by the RINL management for its allotment to the POSCO for the proposed joint venture at the behest of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and this will lead to the privatisation of the public sector unit,” said representatives of trade unions.

423,2020/02/21,An early novel with an intriguing narrative technique,"Rodda Vyasrau Venkatrau’s novel Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu was discovered in the most dramatic way

Probably the only reference to Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu till 1998 was a mention in Venkatesha Sangli’s book, Sirigannada Granthakarthara Charitrakosha (1960). First published in 1900, Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu resurfaced almost a hundred years later in 1998 through the efforts of Prof. D. A. Shankar, well-known writer and critic. The story of the rediscovery of this novel is itself dramatic as is the writing of it, as Prof. Shankar recounts in his preface.

During a research visit to the British Museum, London, in the early 1990s, Prof. Shankar serendipitously discovered in the pages of The Indian Social Reformer a serialised English novel with a Hindi title, Aysa Kysa Hua, written by one Rodda Vyasrau Venkatrau, who he guessed was a Kannadiga. He gathered that the serialisation of the English novel which began in September 1899 ended abruptly in September 1900 with nine chapters. Issues of The Indian Social Reformer beyond 1899 were not available there, but Prof. Shankar was informed that the India Office Library had them preserved in microfilm. Prof. Shankar notes that this serialised novel sought to deal with social reform, especially the condition of women. The two narrators, both reform-minded young men, are shown to have a strong inclination towards social-reformist ideas of the time.

Dissatisfied with the abrupt ending to a promising theme, Prof. Shankar searched further to see if he could find anything else written by Venkatrau. His search revealed a Kannada novel by name Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu or The Fall of Chandramukhi written by the same writer. In the preface, Venkatrau refers to the serialised novel and says that he had to stop the serialisation midway, because it threatened to grow too large for a newspaper story. He further adds that he has “given the same in Kannada.” This explains the abrupt ending of the English serialisation and the realisation of the Kannada novel. Prof. Shankar brought back a copy of Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu and it was republished by Manohara Granthamala in 1998. From Prof. Shankar’s brief descriptions of the nine chapters of the serialized novel and from reading Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu, it is clear that the Kannada novel is not a translation of his unfinished English novel.

The broad themes of Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu are the blind beliefs and superstitions that afflict Hindu society, and how women are made to suffer to uphold these dubious beliefs. Briefly, the story is of an unemployed Brahmin youth, Haradatta, who feels burdened by his wife and three children. He is forced to work as a watchman in a factory and the meagre salary is not enough to feed his family and also support his vices. Haradatta resorts to manipulating accounts at his disposal, is found out and dismissed from his job. In revenge, he forges some papers and decamps with ₹3000 . He resurfaces in the garb of a holy man, as that costume would help him evade the police and hand him a lucrative profession to lure superstitious and gullible people. After witnessing some convincing tricks of Haradatta, the husband of a childless couple goads his wife, Chandramukhi, to serve the fake swami, so that he may grant them a child. Haradatta gives her a glass of milk laced with an intoxicant so that he could seduce her in her stupor-laden state. She drinks the spiked milk and dies soon after. The police who were on his trail finally catch up with him and he is sentenced to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment for his misdeeds.

Venkatrau uses the novel to mount a scathing attack on Hindu religion and its customs and beliefs, but ironically the caustic words come from the lips of the fake ‘swami’ Haradatta, as he explains why it is easy to fool people:

The Hindu society is like a blind creature without a torch! Stupid in its thinking! Antiquated in its customs! Foolish in its speech! It believes strongly in the godliness of its ancestors. Its belief is in divine ability! Its trust is in sorcerers. Women are slaves and men are rulers here. If things were not like this, would my following have grown so much?

Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu is a slim novel of only 28 pages, but for its time the novel is remarkable for its bold narrative technique. The novel opens with a first-person narrator, Kalicharan, a reporter for the daily Pioneer in Bhagalpur. Almost like the beginning of a detective novel, Kalicharan receives a terse mysterious telegraphic message from his friend Dhirendra, a police inspector in Alipore, asking him to reach Alipore the next day. Compared to the conventional location-description beginnings of most early Kannada novels, the way Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu begins is almost revolutionary. The mystery deepens as Dhirendra receives Kalicharan without giving him even a hint of the purpose of his urgent message, and at the dead of night, gives him a package and asks him to leave Alipore immediately. Kalicharan opens the package upon reaching Bhagalpur and discovers a manuscript of an autobiographical account of a life of a ’swami’ with Dhirendra’s comments, and a request to publish the account after deleting irrelevant details. From the second chapter onwards, it is the purported autobiography of the ’swami,’ published and presented by Kalicharan. Haradatta turns out to be the ‘swami’ and the second first-person narrator. And as this autobiographical account ends, the narrative returns to Kalicharan, the initial first-person narrator. The novel is constructed as an autobiographical/confessional account of a ‘swami,’ “discovered” and presented by Kalicharan.

The events in Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu, unusually, are set in the towns of Bengal Presidency and Central Provinces of colonial India. The names of places and of the people who inhabit this novel are far removed from the places where Kannada is spoken and the people who speak Kannada. This novel could very well have been a Hindi novel, except that it is written in Kannada.

There is a significant use of Sanskrit in the original Devanagari and Kannada scripts in the form of verses from the plays of Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti. They appear across the novel and are remarkably not translated into Kannada. Therefore, the reader of the novel should know Sanskrit, is able to read the Devanagari script, and know where the verses are taken from to appreciate their use in the contexts of the various situations in the novel. This novel, therefore, unwittingly becomes tri-lingual and polyphonic – the novel itself is in Kannada, but the verses appear in Sanskrit, and there is a scholarly English preface written by the author.

Chandramukhiya Ghaatavu, which began its journey as an English novel with a Hindi name written by a Kannadiga and serialised in an English journal, ends up as a Kannada novel set in colonial Bengal, outside the Kannada speaking areas, the present day Karnataka.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/dru9yy/article30879201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bgfpic110jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/an-early-novel-with-an-intriguing-narrative-technique/article30879207.ece
424,2020/02/21,Australian author Ken Spillman talks about writing for children,"Throughout his years of writing, Children’s author Ken Spillman has watched books for little ones change by leaps and bounds

Ken Spillman has been to India over 25 times. But it was not until 2008, when the Australian writer (based in Perth) was at a residency at Sanskriti Kendra, that the germ of an idea for his first children’s book based in India took form. His short chat over a car window with Ruskin Bond was nothing short of an inspiration for him then. And so, Advaita the Writer started taking shape, as a story based on the real-life account of a young writer he had met at the fellowship. Since then, the children’s writer’s love for Indian fiction, and his numerous interactions with children here, have only pulled him more towards exploring Indian settings and characters.

In town for a few workshop sessions for children with Tulika Books, Spillman sits down with MetroPlus to chart his journey with words and discuss the power of imagination, while giving away the names of some of his personal favourites in children’s literature.

Spillman’s love for stories has gone through several phases. “I liked stories even before I could read. When my mother used to read to me as a child, I would have the story playing out in my head.” At the age of eight, when Spillman started writing, it became a game. “I realised I could be a character, an animal or anything I wanted to. I had the power to move the story forward,” says the author renowned for his Jake series, who has over 70 books to his credit till date. As a shy teenager, writing slowly transformed into his tool for expression. With a teacher who loved his writing by his side, Spillman never looked back. This is also when the author, who is also an educator himself, discovered the importance of a child’s unadulterated imagination. The 60-year-old now teaches children to be confident in their own creativity. “I need them to have fun, while realising that humans have always told stories,” says Spillman.

His stories are often character-driven. “I need to have a character who is really well defined in my head. I need to know exactly how they would react in any situation. And the situation also needs to drive the characters to do something. This creates the plotline.” But while writing for children, does he have specific pointers in mind? No, for him all that matters is the story. The minute the story starts becoming work for Spillman, he realises that it has lost its charm. “Stories should never lag,” he says. The creator of Clumsy! also refrains from being preachy in his fiction for children. “Having said that, any message, across my body of work, is about being strong and imaginative. I think there’s a message of hope in my fiction and the story arc itself leads to some form of resolution, even if it’s not complete resolution,” continues Spillman.

Over the course of his writing, what seems to have changed more than the habit of reading in children, is the kind of books that are being published. “Typically today, a child wouldn’t read the kind of a book that I used to read, which was just black, dense text . Now, they want to see more colour, white spaces, illustrations and so on,” says the author who works with illustrators and artists quite frequently.

In a couple of months’ time, Spillman’s new picture book will be out — My Upside Down World published by Pickle Yolk and later in the year, his The Absolutely True Adventures of Daydreamer Dev will get its second volume after much demand from Indian readers.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/j7ixgs/article30881498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20mpkenspillmanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/australian-author-ken-spillman-on-writing-for-children/article30881499.ece
425,2020/02/21,Dan Brown to release debut picture book,"Releasing worldwide on September 1, “Wild Symphony” will have illustrations by Hungarian graphic designer Susan Batori

Bestselling author Dan Brown will make his picture book debut and talk about a big blue whale and speedy cheetahs, tiny beetles and graceful swans and their special secrets.

Releasing worldwide on September 1, “Wild Symphony” will have illustrations by Hungarian graphic designer Susan Batori.

The book, published by Penguin Random House, will take readers through the trees and across the seas with Maestro Mouse and his musical friends.

Dan Brown is fond of writing about puzzles and codes, and in this book too, Maestro Mouse leaves for the readers a hiding buzzy bee, jumbled letters that spell out clues, and even a coded message to solve.

The publishers called it a “mindful, humorous, musical, and uniquely entertaining” book.

“Children and adults can enjoy this timeless picture book as a traditional read-along, or can choose to listen to original musical compositions as they read - one for each animal - using a free interactive smartphone app which uses augmented reality to instantly play the appropriate song for each page when the camera of a mobile device is held over it,” a statement said.

Dan Brown is the author of numerous bestsellers, including “The Da Vinci Code”, “Inferno”, “The Lost Symbol”, “Angels & Demons”, “Deception Point”, “Digital Fortress”, and “Origin”.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/no25mt/article30881423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOOKS-DANBROWN,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/dan-brown-to-release-debut-picture-book/article30881424.ece
426,2020/02/21,Sabin Iqbal’s ‘The Cliffhangers’ is about the travails and triumphs of four youngsters in a Kerala seaside town,"The coming-of-age novel revolves around the adventures of Moosa, Thaha, Jahangir and Usman from Varkala and their multi-coloured dreams of making it big in the world outside their hangouts

Author Sabin Iqbal is not his chatty self as he tries to discuss his début novel, The Cliffhangers, set in the picturesque seaside town of Varkala. Like many mediapersons, Sabin is used to asking the questions and he finds it strange to be on the other side of the interview. But once he gets going, Sabin takes one behind the bitter-sweet adventures of four young men from Varkala — Moosa, Thaha, Jahangir and Usman — and their multi-coloured dreams of making it big in the world outside their hangouts.

A poignant tale of growing up in a place that is on the cusp of cataclysmic change caused by the spread of religious jingoism, The Cliffhangers weaves together current events to create a fast-paced, coming-of-age novel about identity and the divided times we live in.

“This is the story of many a young man in many small towns in Kerala. I write about my home town because I know it better than any other place. The four main protagonists are not angels but they are not terrorists or criminals either. It is circumstances that force them to have run-ins with the police,” says Sabin, festival director and co-curator of the Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters.

With a laugh, Sabin says he used to be one of those boys with a burning desire to speak English fluently. “Although, I could write correct English, I could not utter a word and all my conversations in English were bottled inside. It was only when I started working abroad in a news desk that I was able to break that barrier and speak up,” he admits.

Journey of a novel The first line of the book was written when I was working abroad. I was sitting in a restaurant when I wrote a line about something Moosa says. It was never used. But that one line set the ball rolling.

I had finished the book two years ago and sent the manuscript to many publishers who rejected it. It was my cousin, Anees Salim, who told me not to lose heart but to keep trying. I had resigned myself to never getting a book published. But when I sent the manuscript of The Cliffhangers to David Davidar, he read it and told me to send it to their managing editor, Aienla Ozukum. When her letter came, I was searching for the ‘however’ that usually signalled it had been rejected. It was a dream come true when that was missing. Instead, she said they were happy to publish the book. It has been published by Aleph

I have a long list of favourite authors. Anees, VS Naipaul, Gabriel García Márquez and George Orwell are some of the names on the list.

The title of the book is evident. The laterite cliffs bordering the beach in Varkala are famous. Growing up there, no day was complete without some time spent on the cliff. The ‘cliffhangers’ also dream, live and hang out there.

Through the eyes of his four main protagonists, the novel sketches a neat slice of life in the tourist haven that was once a sleepy village with its fishing hamlets and laid-back way of life.

“The Gulf boom changed the landscape forever. Once a young man reached the age of 18 and was not pursuing a professional course or not academically bright, he was packed off to the ‘Gulf’ with some relative and that would be his life from then on, doing some job there, mostly unskilled, till the day he decided to return home forever. To speak English fluently was to escape that monotonous life. In the meantime, he might have married, had children and so on.... But by the time he returns for good, he and his family would have become strangers to each other. That is the tragedy of the grass widows of the Gulf,” says Sabin.

Superb character sketches, accentuated by some clever strokes of humour, portray how the separation and the ensuing loneliness change the basic nature of the people in Moosa’s little space. If some, like Moosa’s mother, take refuge in an all-consuming rage, Jahangir’s mother wilts and shrinks while Moosa’s sister-in-law, Rasheeda, finds solace in others.

The slim book has a plethora of characters but Sabin imbues each with definitive personalities, right from the overbearing policeman Devan and the shopkeeper Balannan peddling patriotism to a new brand of nationalists to peripheral people like the priest’s wife who can’t stand the aroma of meat being cooked, Ismail, the lifeguard, and Masood, their friend and cricket scorer.

“I have been asked if the characters and anecdotes about people are autobiographical. They are not. Nevertheless, at some point or the other, I might have known or heard about them. I might have used some of that in the book,” elaborates Sabin.

The tone of irreverence gives the narrative a light touch but he makes no attempt to tone down the fearless and gripping account of how a rape and a murder show up the cracks in a close-knit society.

Although written over two years ago, the novel could well have been written yesterday as it delves into the divisive politics of today and highlights those invisible lines that partition minds. Sabin says it was the mediaperson in him that helped him adapt a series of events that created headlines in Kerala.

“But, like author Anees Salim writes in the book, it is a story of struggle and redemption. None of the characters is completely black or white. All of them have their positive sides too, even the killers and the zealots,” he says.

Pausing to reflect on his journey in words, Sabin says to turn author was his biggest dream. And now Sabin has already moved ahead with plans of new tales.

“Eventually, I want to write about the price paid by the men and the women who were forced to live apart because one of the spouses was working in West Asia. There are many stories I want to narrate,” he says.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/5vspjm/article30880764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvmsabin2,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/sabin-iqbals-the-cliffhangers-is-about-the-travails-and-triumphs-of-four-youngsters-in-a-kerala-seaside-town/article30880769.ece
427,2020/02/21,"Deepa Pradeep’s upcycling venture, Small, has a range of products for everyday life","Reduce, reuse and recycle are the key ideas that sustain the eco-friendly products

Deepa Pradeep’s eyes light up when she sees what most people would easily label and dismiss as trash. To the upcycling entrepreneur, everything is an opportunity at reinvention. Deepa’s upcycling label Small, with a Facebook page of the same name, displays her many creations. It is hard not to gape at the range of products that can spruce up one’s interiors or even make everyday living a more eco-friendly effort.

There are the now-common products such as newspapers made into paper bags, old tees as grocery bags, and table and bed runners from eye-catching pallus of old saris that are hard to let go of. But Deepa’s recycling abilities go an extra mile with fridge bags to store vegetables made from the ubiquitous thorthu, nylon umbrella fabric turned into durable, water-proof bags for buying meat and fish, and old furniture livened up with a change of upholstery, a new knob here and a bolt there.

Cake boards become hand-painted clocks by Deepa, while cushion covers are enriched in themes as requested by her patrons, cotton fabric with dabu, ajrakh prints become Christmas tree hangings, earrings and pouches or embellishments on bottle bags and table napkins.

A civil engineer, Deepa worked in the field of construction for seven years. She was also an RJ with a Malayalam FM station in the city for two years. Deepa’s stint with upcycling began on an impulsive note after discussions with a friend who specialised in embroidery. “Now that I think of it, I don’t know the names of fabrics in the market and neither can I embroider but the thought of playing with fabric appealed to me. That is how Small was born,” she recalls of her journey.

“The name stands for small enterprises such as these and was chosen by my husband, Pradeep, a marketing-communication professional,” she says. Mother to primary schooler Govind and teenager Karthika, Deepa says her daughter, with whom she attends art classes, is also her harshest critic.

Once the first few orders brought forth praise from customers, Deepa was able to take up bulk orders for weddings and corporate events. In the process, the initiative has also given several people a new means of livelihood or an added source of income. “It was a revelation to my tailors that so much could be made out of the scraps that they usually burn after cutting patterns,” she says.

Deepa has a tailor each for products made from cotton fabric and jute. One of the tailors used to work as a security guard at her husband’s firm but an accident rendered him unwell to continue. That’s when he took to stitching for Small. Bag-making is handled by a group of women from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Kovalam.

Vacations now also include trips to handloom units for collaborative work, exposure to natural fabric and their possibilities. She talks about a recent visit to a handloom cluster in Kannur where scraps of khadi that caught her attention now sit on her table as tastefully designed coasters. For Deepa, Small is about a big heart for the three Rs — reduce, reuse and recycle.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/trt36c/article30879690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvmsmall2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/deepa-pradeeps-brand-of-eco-friendly-products/article30879697.ece
428,2020/02/21,Colours of 2020,"It is the best time to ring in change in your home, and these shades could be your best bet, says Teja Lele Desai

When the year is new, why should the colours you dot across your home and hearth be the same old ones? We give you a selection of colours chosen by top experts across the world.

Pantone’s choice: Classic Blue

The colour institute’s pick for 2020 is a favourite of every third person in the world: classic blue. A timeless and enduring hue of blue, this colour can be worked in big and small doses across every kind of home.

Making the announcement, Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said: “We are living in a time that requires trust and faith. Imbued with a deep resonance, Classic Blue provides an anchoring foundation. [It] encourages us to look beyond the obvious to expand our thinking; challenging us to think more deeply, increase our perspective and open the flow of communication.”

Benjamin Moore’s choice: First Light

An almost-there pink, Benjamin Moore’s shade for the year could well be your neutral of choice. The soft, airy blush hue can be worked into any space and any room, and combines well with other colours. Andrea Magno, Benjamin Moore’s Colour & Design Expert said the hue was “flexible”. “It's a very soft kind of wash of blush; it has a little blue undertone, so it's not a peachy pink, which means it can work in any kind of room, warm or cool,” she said at the unveiling. Clearly, the perfect backdrop to anything.

Dulux’s choice: Tranquil Dawn

Paint major Dulux has chosen Tranquil Dawn, a cool shade of green. The colour, Dulux says, embodies the “mood on the approach of a new decade” and is meant to offer an antidote to an “increasingly disconnected” modern society.

The company’s UK creative director, Marianne Shillingford, compared the colour to “the space between the land and sky”. “A new decade heralds a new dawn and the hazy pale green tones of Tranquil Dawn are calming and comforting just when we need it most in our lives,” she said.

Sherwin Williams’ choice: Naval

Paint brand Sherwin Williams has also chosen a shade of blue as its colour of the year. Naval is a rich navy that references the sea and the night sky to create a calm and grounding environment.

According to Sue Wadden, Sherwin-Williams’ Director of Colour Marketing, the shade is simultaneously “luxurious and versatile, and would enhance a formal dining room as much as a zen yoga studio”. She called the blue a “new neutral” that can multitask. “While Naval may be seen as a bold colour choice, but when used as an everywhere hue, it can create a restful, retreat-like atmosphere,” she said.

WGSN’s choice: Neo Mint

London-headquartered trend forecasting service WGSN believes a pastel shade of green, which it has named “neo mint”, will be the colour to look out for. The gender-neutral colour has “an oxygenating, fresh tone that aligns science and technology with nature”.

WGSN’s Colour Director Jane Monnington Boddy said, “What is becoming clear is the importance of neo mint — a shade that succinctly aligns futuristic development with nature.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/bboqbw/article30880101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-828457564,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/colours-of-2020/article30880103.ece
429,2020/02/21,Things to keep in mind when building with glass,"Anupama Mohanram on how to select the right variant for your structure

The use of glass in buildings is here to stay. In today’s urban setting — where warding off dust, smoke and noise from the outdoors has become a necessity — glass windows and doors connect us to our surroundings without exposing us to these pollutants. In fact, glass skylights are an excellent feature to get a glimpse of the night sky from the comfort of your home, and also help light up spaces that do not have access to exterior walls.

How it evolved

Glass was been found as early as 7000 B.C. in the Neolithic period, mainly as coloured glaze on stone and pottery. Its use in buildings was first tried by the Romans, and technological advances in the 1600s lead to the manufacturing of glass for doors and windows. London’ Crystal Palace (built in 1851) is one of the earliest examples of sheet glass being used in a building on a large scale: it has 3,00,000 glass panes.

The advent of metal frame structures paved the way for glass walls and glass façades, features commonly in skyscrapers today. However, glass is a material that will let in heat easily and trap it too. In a place like Chennai, where we need to minimise heat ingress into interior spaces, this characteristic of glass is counter-productive. Having said that, advanced technological research has resulted in multiples types of glazing: low-emissivity (low-E) glass, insulating glass and solar control glass.

Considering the prevalence of the material, it is imperative to understand its properties and be aware of available options. What you need to look out for is the material’s Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), which reflects the amount of direct heat that is let in. Lower the value, lower the direct heat gain. Although solar control glass is more expensive than clear glass, sensible architecture with adequate shading of glass is a cost-effective alternative to prevent direct heat gain.

Heat control

Another factor to look for while selecting glass is its U-Value — which reflects its insulating property. The lower the U-value, better the insulation. Having said that, the U-value of glass (even double glass) is much higher than the U-value of any other wall material as the former is a poor insulator. Considering this, it would be wise to restrict the amount of glass used in buildings.

While evaluating the material’s heat control properties, ensure you don’t compromise on its light transmittance. Look out for its Visible Light Transmittance (VLT); higher the value, better the light transmittance as we need the daylight to come in, not heat.

A sensible and well-thought out selection of glass for our buildings will not only keep us comfortable indoors, but also benefit the environment by reducing the need for air-conditioning.

430,2020/02/21,For a sustained motivation and momentum,"Given up on your fitness? Experts explain how to sustain our resolutions so that they transform into lifestyle

The month of February makes it official. That’s when the ‘Exercise, Eat healthy, Stay happy’ resolution that we made and announced with an inspiring Facebook post and a cute Insta picture gets dumped. Once again, we thrive on our sweet and salt cravings, binge watch and forget about the walk-jog-play badminton/swim resolution. Why do we find it tough to sustain our resolutions by the second month, though we all agree the resolution to eat healthy, to weigh less on the weighing scale or volunteer at an animal shelter, orphanage or old age home should be more then a mere though during the new year’s time? We speak to experts to explore why our resolutions don’t last and how we can stay motivated.

Ask ‘why’?

One of the first hurdles in embracing the will-to- workout is our inability to answer a basic question — why do you want to exercise? Is it to lose weight, cut down on fat, cellulite, build muscle or to improve our mood. Fitness expert Sandeep Chakravarthy is sure that most of us have never asked ourselves that question, because if we did, we would know that fitness is never achieved in a short span of time. He says, “New fitness enthusiasts join gym with much hullabaloo, they even pay subscription for a whole year but when they do not lose weight within a a month, they lose interest and quit! They lack motivation and dedication to pursue.”

Such enthusiasts who change tracks can be of three types - working professionals with a bulging belly and lower and upper back problems; homemakers and the middle-aged with a sedentary lifestyle leading to excess fat in arms, lower abdomen, hips and thighs and finally students who expect results overnight.

Find solutions

The pointers to sustain motivation are do-able and easy; Understanding one’s body (even if you follow the same fitness programme as Mandira Bedi, the results could be different as each body takes its own time to respond), talking to a trainer before you start, maintaining a chart (measurement tape never lies), setting long time goals, cutting down on Unhealthy(read oily and fried and sweetened) food, chocolates, carbonated and alcohol-spiked drinks, sleeping early, having food as per a schedule and saying no to bad snacking, are all ways to get healthy.

If you have never exercised in life, begin with a regular 20-minute walk (30 or 40 minutes can be uncomfortable for sedentary people initially). Follow the routine for two weeks to slowly change pattern and increase the time span, by say 10 minutes.

Once you are comfortable with a 40-minute-walk, start walking with a half kilogram ankle weight or for every five minute walk, run/jog for 20 seconds.

“So for every 20-minute-walk, you jog for two minutes,” shares Sandeep suggesting one follow this pattern for at least six weeks to see slight results. “Bring in changes gradually and not feel pressurised; not as if you are not participating in a Miss/Mr India competition. Listen to your own consciousness and enjoy what you are doing. In one-and-half months, not only will your BP get controlled, but the exercise also influences hormone levels positively; that walk or run routine makes you feel lighter.”

Small changes on a weighing scale are enough to give you a kick. “Never take any powders or juices to reduce weight; those will only increase blood pressure and affect your kidneys. When you lose weight naturally, it gives body a different glow and confidence,” he advises.

Happiness a habit

A travel executive’s resolution was to stay happy without any negative feelings for an hour every day. Omar Khayyam’s lines ‘Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life’ adorned her WhatsApp status; she kept the resolution effectively for 40 days before calling it quits. “Happiness is a state of mind,” shares Chennai-based psychologist and certified happiness coach Sumathi Chandrashekaran. For the last two years, her clinic has been buzzing with people wanting to learn the skill of happiness.

The first step to be happy is to self-evaluate and know the difference between happiness and joy. “Happiness is temporary and joy lasts forever,” she says. So, even if you are a pro at analysing the hashtag trends on social media, assess yourself so that you are aware of your faults and can work on each of them.

Happiness and joy are connected, yet different. Watching movies with friends, indulging in a new dress or shoes, eating pani puri evokes happiness but the feeling is only temporary and can even become addictive to the extent that it becomes a way to make you happy. Instead, spending quality time with people (friends and family) who value and cherish you or doing actions that build warmth.

Sumathi asks us to accommodate mindfulness in our packed schedules so that we live in the present, stay focussed and not go in a reactive mode and create a volatile environment for ourselves. “Clarity in intent is also important; ask yourself why you need to do it,” she says. Starting a new enterprise, shifting gears or quitting a job... be clear of the purpose that is driving you.

Using mental filters are a must in our happy-days-goal. Sumathi explains these filters create a protective shade. Once you find yourself in a threatening environment — read unhealthy work atmosphere, screaming boss, demanding parents, sibling or a nagging spouse, use a filter so that their talk does not affect you. “Bring changes and be connected to memories and people that fill joy in your heart.” Continue this routine for three weeks and repeat so that happiness becomes a habit.

For a rewarding experience

We start the year with an innate desire to help others. We begin volunteering and contributing our time and resources but within a couple of months, we are overwhelmed, unable to handle things; that’s when the wish seems impractical and unattainable. “The thought that you are going to make a difference is the main hindrance. Focus on yourself; the minute you think you are transforming, it gives you a powerful feeling,” observes Meera Shenoy of Youth4Jobs. When our approach is modest and the belief that one also learns, the experience is different.

Professionals often turn volunteers as part of their companies’ CSR activities. Many of them however drop out due to the distances they have to travel to participate. “If travelling takes up too much time, employees do not prefer going far to rural areas for such programmes; that restricts them to cities. Also, time management is an issue, until it is put in the KRA (key responsibility areas) of an employee.”

Vague resolutions or being too idealistic about changing the world will not yield results. Staying beyond the gestational period as a volunteer can be a rewarding and learning experience. “What people forget is that there is as much as you can learn from the less-privileged as they have to learn from you. The person may be disabled or blind but can give you as much as you give him/her.” Meera shares how a depressed widow filled the void she felt in her life by working with disabled people and saw the challenges they face. “When you give, the other side gives you back double,” she says.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/m19qcb/article30878368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM20JOG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/experts-share-a-few-pointers-on-how-to-stick-to-our-new-year-resolutions/article30878369.ece
