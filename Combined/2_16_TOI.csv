Writer, activist, anchor, and queen bee Apsara Reddy fills you in...As Women’s Day approaches, everyone is planning their line-up of events and guests. It seems some of the big NGOs and corporates are gunning for danseuse Shobana to be their chief guest. Shobana is even being requested by an international royal family who want to fly her to Dubai for a workshop with women. Buzz is top image managers in Mumbai have been contacted to reach out to Shobana.One of the heirs of a construction tycoon, Sanjay is London-made so to speak, with a body to brag and royalty as friends. His posts on social media, a collection of photographs shot during his visits to the country, promote Indian culture and the rustic sights of India. Sources in top industry circles say a director has approached this lad for a lead role in a romcom. However, the scion is focused on getting into townships rather than tinsel world.At a popular gym in the city where so-called ‘beasts’ workout, a leading businessman has spotted a pattern. It seems these men promote the videos of only middle-aged women who buy them gifts. And it’s become like a competition for these women to feature in the videos of these reasonably well-known trainers. The businessman in question is offended as one of the trainers had put up a video of his mother with the title ‘Hottie on the floor’!Among some of Wendell Rodricks’s high-profile friends in the city, Dr Priya Selvaraj penned a tearful farewell for the designer. The two had met multiple times when he had come to Chennai and when she had visited Goa.

He’s been sourcing furniture for his beach house, and in an email to his Chinese agent, who is a petite lass, he happened to send a naughty smiley! And the girl sent an equally racy symbol back.

1,['16/02/2020'],Understanding your addictions,"Addictions come in many forms. It is no longer only about drinking or substance abuse. It could be an addiction for sugar, social media, partying, socialising – either out of habit or to feel better. In my career of consulting people and breaking down the root cause of these addictions, the commonalities I have observed mostly stem from emotional issues – stress, anxiety, unresolved emotional issues, low self-esteem, loneliness, loss, grief, rejection. So, for someone going through emotional distress, it’s easy to find solace in addictions because they are great at altering brain signals and providing a false escape from the current situation.To begin with, it’s necessary to identify the “root cause” of your addiction. What happened (an event or situation) before you actually got into an addiction? Only when we identify the root cause, can we successfully work towards weaning off the habit. We need to understand that a decrease in anxiety or stress levels achieved by using the above-mentioned stuff is for a very short time. You will need another fix very soon if you are not working towards eliminating the root cause.It’s easy to put the blame on alcohol or cigarettes for your own addictions, but the truth is that alcohol or smoking is never the problem. It’s the person abusing it, using it with the wrong state of mind, wrong attitude, lack of discipline and the inability to handle emotions in a matured way. There are so many who do it but they are also aware of where to stop and draw the line.You shouldn’t do something just because your friends are doing it and it is trendy. You may lose many friends and social groups if you decide not to indulge in these things, but you should also know that these are the people worth moving away from. Friends who expect you to be a certain way so that you can “fit in” are not the kind of people you want to be with.Most people live in denial and are unable to accept having a bad day or a bad event. They are unable to accept and go through an unpleasant emotion that results from it and hence resort to external aids to numb these feelings. If you are having a bad day, go through the feeling. Feel the downs. The more you feel these emotions, the easier it is for you to process it and let it die its natural death. When you numb sadness through addictions, you also numb feelings of true happiness and joy.This is one of the most common reasons why people give in to addictions even after deciding to give it up. There is no magic pill for this, but the lack of will power is not to be blamed. Self-discipline comes from within.Dopamine or the motivation molecule is a neurotransmitter/ chemical messenger that our brain produces naturally. We lose it over time due to a poor lifestyle or heavy medications. Whenever you think about motivation/demotivation, pleasure, focus, intention, feel-good factors or are constantly stuck in the victim mode, you should think about dopamine. Social media surfing, moving from page to page, picture to picture, checking for notifications every 15-30 minutes are all symptoms of low dopamine – each one stimulates dopamine production and bring about excitement and thrill.So, be aware of your vices and whether they are controlling you, your behaviour, decision, health, and lifestyle. Take professional help if you need to.Low self-esteem: Confidence in one’s ability decides his or her self-esteem. People with low self-esteem and self-worth have difficulty overcoming negative thoughts and converting them into positive ones. This, in turn, makes them vulnerable to the outside environment. If you have low self-esteem, you feel everything is impossible for you; there is no motivation or energy. This leads to destructive behaviour and most commonly to addiction.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74133993,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-795729/74133993.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/understanding-your-addictions/articleshow/74133993.cms

Secondly, because of the low-fat epidemic that began in the 1980s, dietary fats gradually began disappearing from everyone’s plate due to concerns over heart health and obesity by nutritionists and doctors. Since Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, now after almost 40 years, we are witnessing a marked deficiency of this vitamin in people of all ages and genders.Vitamin D keeps bones healthy and strong, benefits the immune system and is important for brain health as well. People with low Vitamin D are at a much greater risk of depression and increased susceptibility to infections.: New research from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) suggests that exercising two or three hours per week boosts the levels of Vitamin D in the body.: Avoid going fat-free with your food since Vitamin D3 is a fat soluble vitamin. Instead, add generous amounts of desi ghee, home-churned butter, kacchi ghani (cold pressed) oils, nuts, dry fruits and dairy products originating from indigenous breeds of cows.As the name suggests, supplements are only to supplement or aid and enhance.

5,['16/02/2020'],Kshanam Remake: Aadyaa allowed me to work with great performers: Chaitanya KM,"Like most filmmakers worth their salt, Chaitanya KM is a sucker for original stories. Yet, when a refreshing tale from across the border comes to him to be retold for Kannada audiences, he does not shy away from it, provided the narrative has scope for improvisation. His next, Aadyaa , is one such, says Chaitanya. The official remake of the Telugu film , Kshanam, Aadyaa follows the protagonist, who nurses a broken heart, and the journey he sets on when someone from his past seeks his help. “I take the liberty to change the scripts of all my films. There is no way that I will do a photocopy of another film for the Kannada market. I will only take up a remake if I can do something with it and truly own it. With Aadyaa, I saw that there is a phenomenon in psychology that I could use, which was not explored in the original. I have also introduced a new character to the narrative. Add to that the writing by writer-filmmaker Rohit Padaki and I knew I could give this story a new flavour,” says Chaitanya. In making Aadyaa, Chaitanya got to work with a bunch of “great performers”. “That is the highlight of the film, because, ultimately, what people watch on the screen, no matter what you as a director do, is actors. And a thriller really depends on good acting. I am blessed in that department — there’s Chiranjeevi Sarja Sangeetha Bhat , Ravishankar Gowda, Shashank Purushottam and Pramod Shetty, among others.

I like to get up early in the morning and beat the sun and the birds to it. I ban all electronics, social media, email and phone calls for a set amount of time. Instead, I read a book or magazine, go for a walk, or simply stare out and daydream. Being an OCD planner, I spend 15 minutes every morning to prioritise and plan my day with breathing time in-between. I am mindful of the surprises that crop up. Being curious, introspecting and learning from mistakes helps me navigate the changes through the day with a positive attitude, and sometimes, these changes work better than what I had planned.

10,['16/02/2020'],Play with colours,"When it comes to styling hacks, monochrome is on the top of the list along with the holiest of style hacks – layering. Wearing a top-to-toe same colour or pattern is a failsafe move that can change your look in interesting ways without doing too much. We have all done it at some point, especially on lazy days. You pull out a pair of black trousers, black top, black blazer and finish up with black boots for a simple single-colour look. The Guardian’s fashion writer Jess Cartner-Morley calls “monotoning the new colour blocking”. It’s all about pairing items from your own wardrobe in a fresh way – a shop-your-own-closet move, if you will. And it’s really simple to achieve. The idea is to elevate an easy-to-wear outfit into something with a bit of drama/attitude. To start, Cartner-Morley suggests picking one basic item like a bright shoe or bag and pull out everything in your closet in the same colour wheel. Hot tip: Black is one of the simplest colours to break into this trend.In fashion terms, monochromatic dressing is wearing separates of one colour that have different textures and/or similar shades of that colour for an overall tonal look. Now, many celebrities are leading the way in pairing separates in the same colour and breaking it with either a necklace or a belt or an interesting shoe to achieve high drama. Unlike pattern mixing that can look fussy and colour-blocking that may come off as kitschy, a single shade is a simpler, cleaner approach to style an outfit.Whether it’s top-to-bottom jewel tones, winter whites, or a neutral ensemble, monochromatic dressing offers visual relief. It looks sharp and put together and yet carries the element of experimentation. And the best bit: it’s easy to achieve with Indian outfits like salwar-kameez and sarees. Even as the name suggests one colour, it doesn’t mean you have to stick to that same shade. The joy of this trend is to try out shades and tints of the same colour. Start with a charcoal-grey skirt and a light grey blouse; wear dark grey booties and silver jewellery to complete the look.In her popular style blog, Stylishly Me, blogger Vanessa Rodriguez, says she considers the monochromatic trend as the easiest and trickiest style to pull off. Her advice: start with selecting the colour. Keep in mind that the colour suits your skin tone and hair. Pull out all the items you have in the colour you want to wear. Once the items are laid out, start experimenting by combining your pieces. See what looks good together, what doesn’t.Mix textures to add visual interest, depth, and dimension. Mix knits with smooth, add sequins to a plain top, or wear leather with cashmere. Accessories, especially shoes and belts, can amp up the visual element. While mixing, keep an eye on balance, let no one shade overpower the outfit. To break up the solid blocks of colour, add a print piece made of the same colour you’re working with. You can also try adding a patterned shawl or scarf for fun.Monotoning works with virtually any colour: purple, red, blue, green, brown, pinkMonotoning takes some testing to find out what you like and what looks good- You can mix clothes you already own to create a totally new look. Mix new with older pieces- Wearing multiple layers of varied textures of one colour adds depth and dimension to a look- You can highlight, or downplay, certain parts of your body. For instance, if you have long legs but are heavy around the middle, wear white skinny jeans with a white blouse and cream jacket vest to draw attention to a lean lower body. To bring the focus towards your face, go with reverse ombre with a slightly darker shade at the bottom and lighter, brighter variations upwards- Dressing mono means you have one uninterrupted line from head to toe that elongates yoursilhouette, making you appear slimmer and taller than you actually areVidya Balan wears a saree-inspired silhouette while Sophie Choudry goes for the classic pantsuit – the simplest ways to monoShilpa Shetty and Bhumi Pednekar try the yellow shade with the latter breaking it with a blue jacket and Shetty cinching it in with a beltKareena Kapoor Khan wears a shade of hot pink; Tamannaah wears soft lilac suit and Yami Gautam goes purpleDeepika Padukone mixed checks and stripes in blue for a work-ready look",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74134597,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-680940/74134597.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/celeb-style/play-with-colours/articleshow/74134597.cms
11,['16/02/2020'],Heard of the 30-wears test?,"In 2016, Livia Firth floated the 30 wears campaign. It’s simply what it says – asking yourself “Will I wear this (any item of clothing you are buying) at least 30 times?” The idea is to promote mindfulshopping, and not giving up buying new clothes. Firth, who runs a sustainability consultancy calledEco-Age which certifies brands for their green practices, aims to change the way we approachshopping and owning clothes. The key: think of your clothes as an investment, rather thandisposable.This mindful way of shopping aims at reducing the amount of clothing ending up in landfills.Incidentally, UK studies of women’s closets have proved that the average woman keeps a piece ofclothing in her wardrobe for only five weeks. The campaign encourages you to wear your clothesagain and again, thereby being an outfit repeater.Now, 30 times may not seem like a lot. To break it down, you’d have to wear the same top once aweek over seven months before you have worn it 30 times. Even with a capsule wardrobe, peoplestruggled to find pieces that they had worn over 30 times.Before buying, ask yourself: Will I wear this at least 30 times? Is this a high-quality piece? Will it lastat least 30 washes? Will I still want to wear this in 6 months? Or in a year’s time?In an online interview she said: “The biggest message is every time you buy something, always think,‘Will I wear it a minimum of 30 times?’ If the answer is yes, then buy it.

12,['16/02/2020'],It’s sad that no woman player has individual sponsorship: Bembem Devi,"Former Indian football team captain Bembem Devi, who has moved on to coaching, was in the city for the finale of the Indian Women’s League (IWL) recently. Known as the Durga of Indian football, Bembem has been an inspiration for many after her successful two-decade-old career that even earned her a Padma Shri this year. Bangalore Times caught up with the two captains of the finalist teams, Dangmei Grace from KRYPHSA and Michel Margaret Castanha from Gokulam Kerala FC, for a chat with the veteran player. Excerpts...Tell us about your journey...I began my professional career with the All Indian Football Federation (AIFF) in 1995. At the time, we didn’t have great sponsors. While sponsorship trickled in a few years later, the AIFF ensured that they had a good team, irrespective of the funds. All of us on the team had only one thing in our minds — represent our country. The AIFF has been equally supportive of both men’s and women’s football. My journey in football has been memorable, given that I was encouraged to lead the team seven times. I was also recommended for and won an Arjuna Award in 2017. If I have given my all to the sport, the recognition and rewards have also been encouraging. If I have played football for 21 years, it has been satisfying and rewarding.What drew you to football? Were your parents supportive?As a child, I began playing football with the boys’ team. I used to cut my hair really short to pass off for a boy, which I continued doing till Class 5. Throughout this time, my father would often reprimand me and ask me to focus on academics instead. But I didn’t pay heed and found ways to continue playing; including changing my name to a more masculine sounding Bobo to enroll with teams. This is how my love affair with football began. In 1991, a women’s football club approached me to join them. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a team for women. As luck would have it, I was selected to Manipur ’s Under-13 state team the same year.Tell us about some noteworthy changes in the sport that you have seen over the years?The biggest change I see today is in terms of exposure. Back in the day, we did not get opportunities to play with seniors or experienced players. Now, players from the Under-19 team get to play with national players and understand the nuances of the game in in friendly matches. The daily allowances, travelling allowances and other facilities have also changed for the better.How helpful is the Indian Women’s League in promoting football for women?IWL can help sort careers for girls interested in football. From six teams in the first installment, we now have 12 teams in the fourth edition; it has definitely grown. For players who excel, good contracts and support from the federation and the state governments can go a long way in stabilising their futures. It also helps the teams scout for promising and new talent.Bangalore Times: Indian men’s football has seen a growth in popularity lately. What do you think will help women’s football get there?I agree that men’s football gets a lot more help and has the fame. But this year, India is playing host to the Under-17 Football World Cup. This tournament will ensure that people know that there’s women’s football in the country. It is heartening for me to get calls from parents of girls asking about the process of selection and trials for the national team for this tournament.After 21 years in the game, do you have any administrative plans?In 2017, after I retired from active football, I was appointed the Manipur state team’s coach. Later, I was also an assistant coach for the Under-15 Indian team. I want to keep at this and help as many youngsters as possible with the sport.When we spoke to the 12 captains of the IWL, they said that players need encouragements in terms of sponsors and kits individually...Individually, no player in women’s football has a sponsor. I wish that the top brands think about this, as it helps encourage the players. The emerging players, especially, should be considered for this, as this will help take the sport to the next level.You were conferred a Padma Shri this year.

Born on January 30, 2020, she is named after Padma Shri awardee Tulasi Gowda. Tulasi Gowda hails from the village of Honnali, located in the Ankola Taluk of North Karnataka. She is known for her extensive work in conservation of the environment and forests, this despite having no formal education. The environmentalist was honoured with the fourth highest civilian award on January 26, 2020.The baby elephant, however, is the second resident to have been named after an influential female role model, the first one being the tiger cub Hima, who was named after ace sprinter Hima Das. Tulasi’s mother Vanashree is around 13 years old, and she also has a sibling – seven-year-old Sampath, who incidentally is a fellow Aquarian. A lesser known fact is that Tulasi remained in her mother’s womb for a good 22 months before she was born — the longest period, by normal standards known, for any mammal.January 30, 2020Bannerghatta Biological Park3.27 ft104 kgsAquariusVanashree (13 years old)Sampath (7 years old)Mother’s milk, for the next 18 months",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74147892,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-230120/74147892.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bannerghattas-new-baby-elephant-named-after-tulasi-gowda/articleshow/74147892.cms

Allow the dog to get comfortable before training it

Get it checked for rabies, fleas, and parasites, too

Indie dogs may develop anxiety and distrust the people: give them time

They are territorial and do not trust strangers quickly, so aggression towards new people is normal. Warn the humans

They are flexible with eating habits, but overfeeding may lead to behavioural shift

Data source: India International Pet Trade Fair/WHO

People often adopt stray indie dogs as it makes them feel good about having done a good deed. But these poor mutts that look cute and cuddly when they are puppies don’t measure up to pedigreed status dogs in looks once they’re fully grown. Plus, indie dogs are quite energetic and need a stern hand when it comes to being trained. This leads to owners abandoning them once they grow up, sometimes cruelly so! Don’t do this, plead pet parents fostering many of these homeless curs, and give us a few points when it comes to keeping strays as pets...Saikiran VC, who runs a pet homestay in Chennai, has five indie dogs, all adopted under various circumstances. Aiko and Annie were adopted in 2013 and 2014, Luna and Lyka were just 3-4 days old when they were wrapped in a plastic bag and thrown inside Saikiran’s compound in 2016, and Tommy is a cancer survivor, adopted in 2019. “Indie dogs are high on energy, temperamental and territorial. So learn about the breed you’re going to adopt, get them ‘socialised’ and trained early on,” says Saikiran.Akash Tiwari, a working professional in Mumbai, brought home a pup five years ago. He says, “Think it through, especially if you’re living in a metro, as space is a challenge. Just because it’s a stray, it cannot be abandoned as per convenience. People think these dogs are easy maintenance, but the reality is they require extra care as they are prone to catching infections fast.”If you’re about to adopt an indie dog, don’t do so for their looks because they look and act a certain way as they age. But they also suffer from separation anxiety when they are abandoned, so don’t make them go through that. Indie dogs are very sharp, their immunity is better than pedigreed ones as they are accustomed to local conditions. Do keep in mind that as they start growing, they get aggressive and start tearing things around them like shoes, the couch, etc. Be patient, get pet-friendly toys, as with training, they’ll become genteel,” explains Siddharth Manoharan, a Bengaluru-based businessman who has three indie dogs at home, and has been fostering a dog mom and her litter on the street.Adds Uma Prakash, a Carnatic musician from Chennai who has three mongrels at home, “Indie dogs are no less good looking than their pedigreed counterparts. They are totally low maintenance, shed minimum and assess people in minutes. So, if you are bringing an indie dog home, make sure you spend time spend with them and only then, will they become friendly.”“I already had two pedigree dogs when I brought Puchu home. I feel indie dogs are more easygoing, low maintenance and quick to pick up things. Puchu is quite self-trained. People often think indie breeds can be fed anything since they are born on the streets, but that’s not true. They also need a different set of calories, proteins and vitamins, and certain food items need to be avoided. Mostly, they need the same kind of love and care,” opines Snigdha Bose, MSc student from Kolkata.The top three reasons why stray dogs are abandoned by owners after they adopt them as puppies:Unexpected costs, disobedience, hyperactivity, aggression towards family members",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74160708,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-952987,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dont-let-the-dog-down/articleshow/74160352.cms

20,['16/02/2020'],Goan trio taste success with Kerala,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Panaji: No Goan team has come close to winning the Indian Women’s League ( IWL ) but three players from the state achieved the feat with Gokulam Kerala FC in Bengaluru on Friday.

Panjim Footballers had represented the state twice but never managed to proceed beyond the group stage. This year there were high expectations from Bidesh XI Sports Club who won the Goa Women’s League undefeated. The Assonora side lost all five league matches.

Michel Castanha, Karishma Shirvoikar and Linda Colado, all looked for opportunities beyond their comfort zone and it paid off. Current international Michel not only played a stellar role in defence but also captained the Kerala side in the fourth edition where they edged past Kryphsa FC 3-2 in a thrilling summit clash.

“Leading the team was a great honour and I am thankful to the management for trusting me. It was a big responsibility but handling it could only be possible because of the support I received from teammates,” Michel told TOI on Saturday.

The defender featured in seven matches for Kerala and helped goalkeeper Aditi Chauhan maintain four clean sheets. In the group stage, Michel provided the stability at the back that saw Kerala concede only two goals. They remained undefeated in five matches and scored a staggering 28. Kerala added three more in the semifinals against defending champions Sethu FC.

“Coach Prya PV really helped us throughout along with her coaching staff. Most of us are getting competitive exposure and the level of football has really gone up,” said Michel.

While the Curtorim girl flourished, Karishma was not far behind. Her appearances were restricted to only three games as Nepal striker Sabitra Bhandari often grabbed headlines with her goal-scoring prowess.

“I played for Panjim in the IWL last two seasons and it helped me. This year I played less games but learned a lot of new things from the seniors in the side. I will continue to work hard in the future,” said Karishma.

Although the forward from Odxel couldn’t get more game time, she still managed to net four goals, including one in the 5-0 win over Bidesh. Linda too had prior experience in the IWL after turning up for Panjim Footballers, but the defender did not feature for Kerala this time.

The Goan trio have set an example for other footballers from the state and hope more can follow in their footsteps next season",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-trio-taste-success-with-kerala/articleshow/74155409.cms
21,['16/02/2020'],I-League: Churchill have the last laugh,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Margao: Whatever reason Churchill Brothers coach Bernardo Tavares may have had to bench his star striker Willis Plaza, he certainly got a reaction.

Plaza looked gingerly from the bench for most part, then warmed up nervously in the second half. A few young fans cheered him, he acknowledged, and it was not until the 67th minute that he took the field. As always, he tried hard, missed a very good chance with a close-range header, but unlike previous games, this time there was a happy ending for Churchill as they put it across Aizawl FC 2-1 in a I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.

Just when everything seemed lost, it was Plaza who settled it for Churchill in the fifth minute of added time. That the winner came after Churchill had conceded an equalizer in the first minute of added time and it seemed like they would be crushed again, made the strike even sweeter.

Never mind that the winner from Plaza (90+5) came from a goalmouth melee. Never mind that it looked fortuitous. Never mind that, despite being so close, it almost didn’t happen.

The win took Churchill to the fourth spot with 16 points from 10 matches, 13 points behind league leaders Mohun Bagan who have played two extra matches and visit Goa next week. Plaza’s last-gasp winner also overshadowed an excellent strike from Paul Ramfangzauva (90+1), who had cancelled out Dawda Ceesay’s opener for Churchill in the 73rd minute.

Churchill coach Bernardo Tavares tried to shake things up by leaving Plaza on the bench. It was a bold decision to leave the league’s highest goal-scorer out, and instead show faith in Hafis Mohammed. That didn’t seem to work. Hafis tried, ran into open spaces, but when everyone thought it would be Plaza’s turn to show what he’s got, it was midfielder Quan Gomes who replaced the forward in a tactical switch.

Churchill were in better control of the proceedings than previous matches. The passing was smooth, but chances were at a premium. Aizawl FC missed the presence of Mali forward Abdoulaye Kanoute – left on the bench because of an injury – so even though there were a few chances, neither goalkeeper had anything to worry in the opening 45 minutes.

Churchill broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute through Ceesay. The Gambian midfielder and former captain intercepted a loose ball from Alfred Jaryan in Alzawl’s own half and after working his way forward, tried his luck from the edge of the box. The ball took a deflection off Joseph Adjei and dipped past goalkeeper Zothangmawia, who was caught slightly out of position.

Aizawl got the equalizer only in the first minute of added time with a strike that had beauty written all over it. Joe Zoherliana's throw-in was not cleared well by the Churchill defence and the ball fell just on top of the box for Ramfanfzauva. The young midfielder controlled the ball with his right and then executed a brilliant volley with his left that crashed into the top corner of the nets.

Expectedly, shoulders dropped. Three of the four Churchill defenders slumped to the ground. But there was still time to conjure up something and Plaza was the man to do it.

Glan Martins entered the box from the right and sent a cross into the centre where Abu Bakr's effort on goal was stopped by the goalkeeper, whose collision with his own defender allowed Plaza the time to somehow tap the ball home.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-churchill-have-the-last-laugh/articleshow/74155424.cms

A bright and warm Friday was a lot of relief to Bhaichand Patel , who had to delay his Valentine 's Day celebrations last year after rain played spoilsport on February 14. Continuing his decades old tradition, he hosted a V-Day party at his home in Sujan Singh Park this year. For some guests, the party was a reunion of friends and for others it was an occasion to let loose and dance.Dancing is a must at Bhaichand's party and he made sure that no guest was glued to chair for long. ""If you are here, you must dance. You have to pay a price for being at this party by being on the dance floor,"" he said. The playlist for the evening comprised classic English romantic numbers and the DJ told us that the playlist for the party hasn’t changed in the last five years. Shovana Narayan, who has been a regular at this bash, told us, ""I just love coming here, meeting friends and dancing with them. I am coming straight from my performance and haven’t even changed my dancing costume. I wanted to be here as soon as I finished my performance.""The dress code for the evening was red and black and the guests took it ""very seriously"". ""I chose a black outfit and then I realised I needed to add a hint of red to my look, so I wore red lipstick. Being a designer, I take dress codes very seriously. I also think that a host plans a party keeping a certain theme in mind and guests should try to stick to the dress code as much as possible,"" said Leena Singh. Another guest, Renuka Khanna, made an extra effort and added a few extra roses with LED lights.

The photographer shared some exclusive images with BT and spoke about the thought behind them:John Abraham: John and I have done a lot of body shots. We wanted to bring out the naughty and cool side of his personality. We’ve used a lot of hard lights in the past, but here, we opted for soft lights, to make the photo look sexy and be in that desirable zone. We lit up John’s picture the way filmmakers light up a love scene in Hollywood films. His smile and the way he has posed are just amazing.Vidya Balan: Vidya has always been a part of my calendars. If I have an idea, she always enhances it and adds her own thought to it. She believes in doing something different and pushing the boundary each time we shoot together. I love it when an actor is so involved in the picture we’re shooting. We wanted the overall effect to be soft and glamourous, and Vidya lent herself beautifully to it.

31,['16/02/2020'],"'Don't worry, one democracy will settle it,' Jaishankar to US Senator on Kashmir","This story is from February 16, 2020

Foreign minister S Jaishankar firmly rebutted attempts by a US senator to raise Kashmir at the Munich Security Conference , responding to the US politician’s remark that he hoped “two democracies” will settle the matter, saying one democracy would and there was no prize for guessing which one.

“Do not worry, senator. One democracy will settle it and you know which one,” Jaishankar told Senator Lindsey Graham , a Republican, during a panel discussion after the US politician said the best way to “sell” democracy will be to settle the Kashmir issue in a democratic way.

“In India, you are moving forward, you got your problems like we do at home, but you've chosen the democratic path. When it comes to Kashmir, I don’t know how it ends, but let’s make sure that two democracies will end it differently. If you can prove that concept here, then I think that’s probably the best way to sell democracy,” the senator said.

Jaishankar’s immediate put-down seemed to reflect India’s impatience about western commentary that either ignores the role of Pakistan in backing terror groups — and separatists — intent on carrying out attacks in Jammu & Kashmir or an assumed equivalence that places India and Pakistan on the same footing.

Graham was among four senators who wrote to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last week, ahead of President Donald Trump ’s visit to India, expressing concern about the restrictions in Kashmir and saying that the Indian government’s action threatened the rights of certain religious minorities.

During the discussion, Jaishankar also said that the United Nations is far less credible than before and “something” should be done about it. “The United Nations is far less credible than it has been in history, which is not entirely surprising because when you think about it, there are not too many things which are 75 years old and still as good as they were. Clearly there is something that needs to be done there.”

He also spoke about “westlessness” and multilateralism at the panel discussion. “Clearly multilateralism has become weaker, and clearly westlessness is in evidence and I would suggest that there is a correlation between the two. It is not to say that multilateralism is solely dependent on the West, or that the West has been faithfully multilateral,” he said.

Jaishankar also met US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Munich. He said her “consistent support” to India-US ties had always been a great source of strength.

Jaishankar arrived in Munich on Friday for the prestigious security conference during which he is expected to outline India’s views on several issues of global concern. “Such a pleasure to catch up with Speaker Pelosi,” Jaishankar tweeted. He also met US ambassador to the UN Kelly Knight Craft on the sidelines of the conference on Friday.

KALABURAGI (Karnataka): A medical student jailed for life in 2002 for murdering his lover’s husband and released for good conduct after 14 years rejoined the course and finished it last year. He was awarded an MBBS degree at the convocation on Saturday.

Subhash Tukaram Patil (40), a resident of Bhasagi village in Afzalpur taluk, 475km from Bengaluru, was not deterred by the years in jail. “I was jailed when I was doing my MBBS course at the Hyderabad Education Society’s Mahadeveppa Rampure Medical College in Kalaburagi. I worked in the jail’s OPD,” Patil said. Earlier this month, he completed a one-year mandatory internship.

On August 15, 2016, he was released from jail and continued his medical studies after getting special permission from the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences . He rejoined his old college in 2016 and cleared all subjects in the first attempt. He had been doing his housemanship since 2019 at Basaveshwar Hospital, attached to MRMC.

Patil told TOI: “I’m committed to serving society, especially relatives of prisoners and soldiers. I spent a lot of time in the jail library and never lost interest in studies.”

As a student, Patil had been in love with a married woman and, abetted by her, he shot and killed her husband, an excise contractor. For six years he was in Parappana Agrahara Central Jail, Bengaluru, and was then shifted to Kalaburagi Central Jail for the rest of his term. While in prison he also completed Karnataka State Open University ’s journalism course.

MRMC dean Umeshchandra said though Patil was about 14 years older than his classmates, he completed the course successfully. Dr Kiran Patil, an ENT specialist at Basaveshwar Hospital who lectures at MRMC, said he and Subhash Patil were classmates in 2002. “It’s remarkable that after coming out of jail he continued the same course and successfully completed it.”

34,['16/02/2020'],Trump India visit: Govt picks national flavour: Namaste President Trump wins over Kem Cho,"This story is from February 16, 2020

GANDHINAGAR: Even as Gujarat waits with bated breath to welcome the US President with “Kem Chho Trump”, the state government has been directed to replace the Gujarati expression with “Namaste President Trump” to help the event find resonance across India.

Gujarat chief secretary Anil Mukim told TOI: “The government of India has informed us about the ‘ Namaste President Trump ’ theme and all campaign materials will be as per the Centre’s directions.”

Sources said that “Kem Chho Trump (How are you, Trump)” had a regional flavour, while the event is being planned as a massive national show.

The state government has been told to design communication material to present “namaste” as the traditional Indian welcome for Trump on his maiden visit as president to the country.

In Ahmedabad, Trump will join Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate Motera Stadium, the world’s largest cricket arena.

“A Gujarati label for Trump’s first event in India would not have been appropriate,” said a government official. “Moreover, ‘namaste’ is understood as an Indian greeting across the world.”

Deputy CM and government spokesperson Nitin Patel said India has to be the theme of the visit as it is a national event.

A source said though the Prime Minister’s Office and the foreign ministry are yet to formally approve the “Namaste President Trump” theme, all billboards, placards and hoardings are likely to feature it. “Photographs of President Trump and the first lady will be used along with images that reflect India-US ties,” the source said.

35,['16/02/2020'],"If a bank chief isn't beholden to a finmin join secretary; he will behave differently, says Montek Singh Ahluwalia","Montek Singh Ahluwalia, former deputy chairperson of the erstwhile Planning Commission and one of India’s most experienced economic policymakers is the author of ‘Backstage: The Story Behind India’s High Growth Years’. He spoke to Nalin Mehta and Sanjiv Shankaran on economic reforms, India’s big economic challenges and similarities and differences between the

and the NDA governments' approaches to the economy.

You say in the first seven years of UPA, the economy grew at 8.4% and 138 million people escaped poverty. What happened later?

The rules have always been ambiguous. Even the current government is struggling.

How different has NDA been in pushing reforms?

On economic issues, does BJP seem left of centre?

In the Vodafone retrospective tax case, didn’t you advise finance minister

against it?

Isn’t the banking structure unchanged?

You were the author of an early reforms blueprint, the M document. What lessons can today’s policy makers learn from your experience?

The growth momentum of the first seven years was remarkable, but economies have ups and downs and there was a down turn in the last three years. The global downturn after the Eurozone crisis in 2011 was one explanatory factor, But the system also ran into domestic constraints. Regulatory constraints prevented large projects from taking off. That problem continues even today. Allegations of corruption after 2011 also altered the political atmosphere. By the time of the election, the mood of the country turned completely against UPA.Looking back, many positive developments in the earlier years were simply swamped. Look at the telecom story. The CAG came up with unrealistically large estimates of revenue losses and public opinion came to the view that not auctioning spectrum was a big mistake. However, the experience around the world was not that auctions were the best method and in any case, the TRAI had not recommended auctions. I have mentioned in the book that some of the decisions taken in allocating licenses were questionable but the real question to ask was whether the telecom policy succeeded in its objective of expanding telecom access. From that perspective the policy was an outstanding success but this was never brought out in the public debate.I agree that many of the problems we face arise from the fact that our rules and regulations are very poorly drafted and are open to multiple interpretations. This is true of environmental regulations and also our tax laws. We do not put enough high quality effort into converting policy intentions into specific regulations that are clear and transparent. Regulations that can be interpreted in different ways are a recipe for people trying to manipulate the rules while others claim that the rules have been violated. The result is a multiplication of disputes and litigation. It is also a vicious circle that lends itself to allegations of corruption which then acquire a life of their own.As far as programmes are concerned, the NDA has more or less maintained most of the earlier programmes though many of them have been renamed and modified in some ways. The question to ask is whether they are being better implemented. This calls for credible independent evaluation.GST is an important tax reform which was actually put on the agenda by the UPA but opposed at that time by the BJP ruled states. Be that as it may, I think it is good that the Constitution was amended to enable GST but I feel the design of the GST has got mangled with far too many rates and heavy compliance obligations on smaller firms. Demonetization is called a reform but in my view it was a negative development which imposed a huge and unnecessary burden on the informal sector.The insolvency and bankruptcy code is a very important reform. I hope it proves to be a success.There are some areas where the NDA government has actually reversed the reform process. The decision to raise import duties, with the possibility of further increases ahead, is a major reversal of the policy of gradually reducing import duties, which has been in place for thirty years and was followed by several governments including the Vajpayee government. It is not consistent with the objective of improving export performance and joining global value chains.I also think it is a pity that the government has not joined RCEP. Asia is the one part of the world in which growth is expected to be high and which still remains open. Not joining RCEP is a negation of the Act East policy which was meant to replace the Look East Policy.This right-left binary has become a little jaded. I think you are implying that the BJP was expected to be more pro private sector but it isn't. Part of the problem is because, in the words of Arvind Subramanian, the private sector is now “stigmatized”. As Amartya Sen has said, India doesn’t really have a genuine right-wing party in economic terms.I was called in to give some ideas for the budget. There was talk at the time that the government might bring in an amendment to overturn the Supreme Court judgement. I used the opportunity to say that if we wanted to change the law prospectively there could be no objection but we should not do so retrospectively to overcome the Supreme Court judgement.I have said in my book that banking sector reform is a major task ahead. We have not seen any serious reform of public sector banking. Public sector banks are subject to dual control, by the Finance Ministry and the RBI. The Reserve bank does not have as much control over public sector banks as it does over private sector banks. That asymmetry vis a vis the private sector is wrong.The PJ Nayak committee had recommended that if reducing government equity to a minority is not politically feasible the government share in public sector banks should be put into a holding company. That company should then appoint the chairman and top managers, not the ACC (cabinet). If the chairman of the bank is not beholden to a joint secretary within the finance ministry he will behave differently. I think the time has come to recognise that the bureaucracy in the finance ministry adds no value to the quality of banking.In the last year of the Rajiv Gandhi government, we felt that the economy was not responding as much as we thought it would to the reform initiatives. I came to the conclusion that it was because we were pushing individual reform initiatives and not pushing for a core set of mutually supportive reforms as a package. When V.P Singh became Prime Minister he asked me to prepare a paper proposing an integrated reform package and I prepared a 34 page paper, which proposed a set of core reforms: reducing the fiscal deficit, liberalising industrial licensing, decontrolling imports, and moving to a flexible exchange rate. The paper was discussed in a committee of secretaries. Some were totally against it, but others were supportive. It taught me that a clear statement about the direction of reforms can run into opposition but it can also meet with a lot of support.The V.P Singh government wasn't there for long enough to implement reforms but when the Narasimha Rao government came in, they were able to do quite a lot of what was proposed in that paper. The main lesson I would draw is that we need to outline a set of core reforms and allow them to be discussed so that the pros and cons are fully debated.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74153017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-200335,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/if-a-bank-chief-isnt-beholden-to-a-finmin-join-secretary-he-will-behave-differently-says-montek-singh-ahluwalia/articleshow/74152939.cms
36,['16/02/2020'],Calling dissenters ‘anti-national’ an attack on constitutional values: SC judge,"This story is from February 16, 2020

AHMEDABAD: Justice D Y Chandrachud of the Supreme Court on Saturday said dissenting voices cannot be labelled ‘anti-national’ or ‘anti-democratic’ and such assertions are an attack on the people’s commitment to protecting constitutional values.

“Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that citizens enjoy the right to express themselves in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest, and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national or anti-democratic strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and promotion of a deliberative democracy,” Justice Chandrachud said during a talk at the Gujarat high court auditorium in Ahmedabad.

Laying emphasis on retaining India’s plural traditions, he added, “What is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history that we have inherited. Homogeneity is not the defining feature of Indianness.”

The SC judge said India as a nation is not committed to just one language, one religion, one culture, or one assimilated race. “No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India,” Justice Chandrachud said, insisting that the country at present finds itself “in defence of its plural views and the multitude of its cultures”.

Later, as chief guest of the 10th convocation of the Gujarat National Law University (GNLU), the SC judge encouraged students to stand up not just to government but for those who cannot speak for themselves. He asked students to question and question often. “It is important to stand up and be dissenters. It is only through your power of expressing views and courage of stating contrary positions that you will make others stop and think,” he said.

Earlier, during his talk on the ‘Hues that make India’ organised by the Justice P D Desai Memorial Lecture Committee, Justice Chandrachud called on the audience to include communities that are pushed to the fringe of the mainstream for being minorities — based on their language, faith, culture or gender — and asserted that this was aimed for by the Constitution.

Speaking after Justice Chandrachud, SC senior advocate Dushyant Dave reminded the audience and judges present about the Karnataka police investigating schoolchildren for performing a play opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the “unfortunate incident” at a Bhuj hostel where girls were being kept in a basement because they were menstruating.

“We have these situations which are completely antithetical to constitutional beliefs and values. Why is it happening? Why is the judiciary sitting (quietly) watching them? I would request the judges to ponder upon them. These are something on which you can definitely speak. What we need is pluralism in action, not merely in thoughts,” he said.

37,['16/02/2020'],Credit flow is slowly but steadily reviving: RBI guv,"This story is from February 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Saturday said that credit flow was reviving and is expected to improve further in the coming months on the back of steps taken by the central bank and the government .

“The momentum is gathering pace... Credit flow is slowly and steadily reviving,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das told reporters after the post-Budget board meeting that was addressed by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman .

While latest data showed that credit growth had moderated to 7.1% at the end of January, Das said that from contracting by 1.3 lakh crore at the end of September 2019, the flow of credit was higher by Rs 2.7 lakh crore. Similarly, fund flow to the commercial sector was estimated at around Rs 1 lakh crore in September has now risen to around 7.5 lakh crore. “There is expectation of the flow to improve in coming months due to the steps announced by the government and RBI,” he said. RBI has reduced policy rates five times since February 2018 and Das said that there were indications that banks were passing on the cuts now.

Asked about the Rs 15 lakh crore target for loan flow to the farm sector, Sitharaman said that she was confident of the goal being achieved. “Credit limit has been expanded. I am sure it is based on local ground level requirement...we expect the demand to grow and credit requirements to also meet up with it. I am actually closely monitoring banks and their extension of credit facility particularly to rural areas. So I think we'll be able to meet that,” the FM said.

The RBI governor also suggested that the overall impact of the steps announced in the Budget will not be inflationary. Measures such as higher import duty on a number of products are expected to make these items more expensive. Das, however, said that the main concern was over the fiscal deficit, which the government has handled by “adhering to the principle of fiscal prudence”.

“The good part of the government borrowing is also budgeted to come from small savings. Therefore, I don’t see much of an inflationary impact... Declining crude prices has definitely positive impact on inflation...The main reason for spike in inflation is because of food inflation, mostly milk, fish, and various protein related items. Core inflation has slightly edged up because of revision of telecom tariffs,” he added.

Retail inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) soared to a near six-year high of 7.6% in January, surpassing the Reserve Bank of India's comfort range primarily on account of rising vegetable and food prices.

38,['16/02/2020'],"Coronavirus: Some drugs may not last beyond February because of coronavirus crisis, says FICCI","NEW DELHI: Production of several commonly used medicines such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, some antibiotics and diabetes drugs may be adversely hit along with smartphones and solar equipment if the supply disruption caused by the outbreak of coronavirus in China lasts beyond two months, lobby group FICCI has assessed based on feedback from industry.In several cases, Indian drug-makers have raw material stocks of two to three months and so do not see any immediate problem but this could change if the problem persists, the study said. “Also, if the shutdown extends beyond February, then there may be some rise in prices of pharmaceutical products made in India,” the study said.India depends on China for around 70% of its bulk drugs and drug intermediates, according to industry estimates. This is the first-of-its-kind study based on feedback from the industry. The government has said there is ample stock of medicines to continue till April. However, the health ministry is working on a plan with measures to ensure there is no crisis in case if the lockdown in China continues for another fortnight impacting supplies. The government has identified specific drugs for which APIs are sourced from Hubei province, epicentre of the outbreak, and alternate production plan is in the making, officials told TOI earlier.In certain segments, such as penicillins and their derivatives, China accounts for over 90% of India’s import of the ingredient, the study said. In several product segments such as telecom equipment and organic compounds, China’s share is around 70%. On Tuesday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to meet industry representatives to assess the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.Apart from pharma raw materials, the Ficci study said, India's production of smartphones faces the risk of disruption in case the prevailing situation continues beyond February, the report cautioned while stating that the impact of the outbreak on the automobile sector is divided. The report said that industry estimates show that China accounts for some 85% of the total value of parts and components used in smartphones in India (cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards). India imports mobile phone components worth Rs 7,000-8,000 crore from China every month.“According to feedback received from industry, Indian industry could still manage the challenge till end-February (as inventory is expected to last for next 3-6 weeks),” the report said.“If the crisis is prolonged, then for March and April production, they will have trouble and there will be a shortage of devices. As an alternative, some components can be sourced from South Korea Vietnam or Taiwan; however, this is going to be the ""last resort"" only because it would require the smartphone makers to make changes in design and software,” the report said.Regarding the automotive sector, the report said opinion on the likely impact on automobile sector is divided. While Maruti Suzuki does not expect any serious impact, TATA Motors and MG Motor India think otherwise, it said.It said that according to Fitch Solutions , vehicle production in India may suffer contraction by 8.3% in 2020 in the wake of increasing risk of supply shortage due to the coronavirus outbreak in China. “With 10 to 30% share, China is one of India’s largest suppliers of automotive components and this explains the entire scenario. The downside may be much higher for the electric vehicle segment in India,” the report said.The impact of the outbreak will have severe implications for the country’s solar industry as bulk of solar cells, modules, inverters and robotic module cleaning systems for the solar energy projects are imported from China.The industry has urged the government to support solar developers by considering the situation in China as force majeure and grant extension of scheduled commissioning date without any financial implications to the developer. “The extension granted should be of sufficient time considering the date of complete recovery and the normal condition reinstated,” the report said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74156731,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123525,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ficci-some-drugs-may-not-last-beyond-feb-because-of-virus-crisis/articleshow/74155763.cms
39,['16/02/2020'],"Keep off J&amp;K, it’s our internal affair, India tells Turkey’s president","This story is from February 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: After Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s open backing of Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, the government on Saturday strongly rejected his references to J&K, while reiterating that the newly created Union Territory was an integral and inalienable part of India.

The foreign ministry also asked the “Turkish leadership” to not interfere in India’s internal affairs and to develop proper understanding of the facts, including the grave threat posed by terrorism emanating from Pakistan to India and the region.

Addressing a joint session of Pakistan’s parliament, Erdogan had not just said that Turkey will back Pakistan at FATF, where Pakistan is still facing the possibility of being blacklisted for its support to terrorist groups, but also that “Kashmiri brothers and sisters’’ were suffering because of unilateral steps taken (by India).

Erdogan went on to draw a comparison with the battle of Gallipoli, which was fought in Turkey between the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire , saying “there is no difference between Gallipoli and Kashmir”.

This though is only the latest in a series of run-ins which India has had with Turkey since its decision last year on August 5 to revoke the special status of J&K state. Along with Malaysia and China, Turkey has openly sided with Pakistan on the issue.

Expressing concerns over India’s decision, it has repeatedly called for resolution of the “problem” through dialogue and within the framework of the “relevant UN resolutions by observing the legitimate interests of all people of Jammu and Kashmir’’. India has in response on several occasions said that statements made by Turkey were not just biased and unwarranted but also factually incorrect.

Erdogan had, in fact, even raised the issue at the UNGA last year, saying that Kashmir was “virtually under blockade with 8 million people, unfortunately, unable to step outside of Kashmir’’. He had said that it was “imperative’’ to solve the problem through dialogue and on the basis of “justice and equity, not through clashes”.

Soon after that, PM Narendra Modi was reported to have cancelled his trip to Turkey. The visit though had never been confirmed by Indian authorities. India’s response to a Turkey offensive in northern Syria in October targeting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was also seen in the context of deteriorating ties with Ankara. India had said it was “deeply concerned” over the “unilateral military offensive” by Turkey in northeastern Syria and asserted that the action can undermine stability in the region as well as the fight against terrorism.

CM Uddhav Thackeray earlier this week consented to handing over the Elgar probe to the NIA despite NCP’s objections.The Congress Working Committee had in January passed a resolution saying updation of NPR must be stopped. NPR is a list of “usual residents” of the country but Congress has opposed NPR “in its present form.” “We are against CAA, NCR and NPR. MVA constituents will meet soon and decide the future course of action,” State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat told TOI.Home minister Anil Deshmukh of NCP, who complained days ago that the CM had “overruled him” on handing over the Elgar probe to NIA, told TOI the three parties need to have a meeting soon to discuss implementation of NPR. “The three parties will have to discuss soon and take a final decision as only after the meeting will a final order be issued,” he said.However, Harshal Pradhan, chief media advisor to CM Thackeray and Sena, said, “NPR and NRC are two different subjects. NPR is related to the census and it is the Centre’s prerogative to implement it.” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, “The entire exercise has created panic among the common people. It appears to be an exercise for harassing people.”Thorat said Congress will study the information sought by the Union home affairs ministry for NPR. “We have been told uncalled-for information has been sought,” he said.In Video: Rift in Maha govt widens over NPR rollout in state",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74155789,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169861,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/population-register-creates-rift-in-maharashtra-govt/articleshow/74155788.cms
41,['16/02/2020'],"Biryani, foreign funds driving the uneducated to CAA rallies: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh","This story is from February 16, 2020

KOLKATA: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh raked up yet another controversy on Saturday by taking a dig at the “uneducated, unaware and poor people” who are “paid and fed biryani with foreign funds” for continuing with protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Ghosh’s comment drew scathing criticism from TMC.

Talking about the role of the party in office in Bengal and other Opposition parties in the anti-CAA protests, Ghosh said: “The ruling party (of Bengal) and others have taken to the streets but they don’t have public support. Some uneducated, unaware, poor people have been lured with money and are being fed biryani with foreign funds to continue with the protests,” he said.

Trinamool senior and state parliamentary minister Partha Chatterjee said Ghosh has taken Bengal’s political narrative to a new low. “Is this how a party leader should speak? People are the best judge. But I believe that the BJP leader is deliberately targeting a particular community for narrow political ends,” Chatterjee said. Ghosh had made similar offensive comments earlier, saying that 50 lakh Muslims will be chased out of the country.

On Saturday, explaining the Shaheen Bagh-Park Circus narrative, the Bengal BJP president pointed out how they have become the must-reach destination for those opposing the NDA move. “Park Circus has become a must-visit place for Brinda Karat and Chidambaram . They do not want to address others. Only burqa-clad women with children in their laps are their sole audience,” he added.

Ghosh also didn’t spare intellectuals and students participating in the countrywide protests, from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi to Park Circus in Kolkata. “These people are writing poems, asking people not to show papers. But you have seen during the Delhi assembly polls how the protesters flashed their voter ID cards,” he said.

Administrative sources stated that Rs 13.42 lakh is spent per day on the police and paramilitary forces, including one platoon of Rapid Action Force , half section of Provincial Armed Constabulary and police force deployed at the Eidgah. So, the eight-day expense adds up to Rs 1.04 crore.On the notice, Pratapgarhi told TOI on Saturday, “I reached Moradabad on February 7. But, the notice was issued on February 6.

BHOPAL/DELHI: A day after AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia said he would hit the streets if manifesto promises weren’t fulfilled by Madhya Pradesh government, his early departure from a review meeting of state Congress on Saturday further deepened the impression of rift. Congress clarified that Scindia had informed in advance that he will leave the meeting early and that all was well in the state.

However, the impression of bitterness in MP Congress only gained ground when CM Kamal Nath made a terse comment in response to Scindia’s threat . Emerging from the review meeting, when Nath was asked by reporters about Scindia’s warning to hit the streets, he shot back: “Let him.”

Differences between CM Nath and Scindia have been out in the open for around eight months after Scindia criticised the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh over crop damage survey, farm loan waiver and, more recently, the demand of agitating contractual teachers to regularise their employment.

The erstwhile royal’s strong words are being linked to the jostling for the post of Madhya Pradesh Congress chief as well as to the Rajya Sabha berth falling vacant soon. The Congress coordination committee met at Nath’s house in the capital. Top state functionaries, including Nath, Digvijaya Singh , AICC general secretary in-charge of MP Deepak Babaria , former Union ministers Scindia and Arun Yadav , and higher education minister Jeetu Patwari attended the meeting.

“It was a very good meeting. Scindia had informed me on Friday that he had other appointments at 12 noon, so he would leave the meeting early,” Babaria told TOI.

“Promise letter is for five years. We have fulfilled many promises and fulfilment of other promises is underway. Scindia Ji is not against anybody. Congress is together under the leadership of Kamal Nath ji,” said Singh.

“The meeting was on the upcoming assembly bypolls in Jaura and Agar-Malwa, and the urban local body polls,” Babaria said.

In this time, the government has implemented public welfare policies and now Congress leaders are making baseless statements, he said.

Barala said the defeat in 2019 elections had left Congress leaders unemployed. “They are not able to assess the government’s welfare policies and their achievements in a state of desperation. Congress leaders do not want welfare policies to reach people,” he said.

He said the state budget will be presented in the assembly in a few days and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar wanted it to be in accordance with the aspirations of the people. “With the same objective, the opinion of all sections of society of all districts have been taken into account,” he said.

He added all MLAs had been given Rs 5 crore for development in their constituencies as soon as the BJP came to power in the state. “Under the Parivar Samriddhi Yojana, a provision has been made to provide financial assistance to every eligible family whose annual income is lesst than Rs 1.8 lakh.

Neeraj showed various documents to media persons to establish that the bus was registered in the name of a person belonging to BPL category. However, the mobile number in the document was that of a former RJD MLA, he said.

Neeraj said the bus was registered with state transport department in the name of one Magal Pal on November 29 last year, but contact number of the owner was that of former RJD MLA Anirudh Yadav.

Neeraj said Pal was a resident of Hidayatpur village in Bakhtiyarpur and belonged to extremely backward caste. He even presented documents showing Pal’s approval by the block development officer and deputy development commissioner in February 2008 to be included on the BPL list.

“While Mangal Pal is a poor man, Anirudh is a former RJD MLA and a muscleman. RJD has done another fraud and Tejashwi should explain how a poor person could afford such hi-tech bus,” the IPRD minister said.

Describing Tejashwi’s yatra as ‘ shahi yatra ’, Neeraj said while RJD chief Lalu Prasad believed in land deals, his son has turned hi-tech to boost family’s benami property.

However, RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said the JD(U) and BJP leaders were nervous before Tejashwi’s yatra and trying to divert people’s attention from the main issue of unemployment. “They have been ruling the state for past 15 years just by blaming Laluji. Such tricks will not work anymore. We have hired this bus and since they are in government, they can do the investigation,” Tiwari added.

Lalu’s son to address public meet today: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad will hold public meetings at Madhubani and Purnia for three consecutive from Sunday, his close aide Sanjay Yadav said. “Tejashwi will raise issues like CAA, NRC, health, education and unemployment at the meetings. On Sunday, he will address a gathering at Pyare Ram Swaroop Uchcha Vidyalaya at Korahiya in Madhubani. He is also scheduled to address public meetings at Bisfi Intermediate School in Madhubani on Monday and Vaisi in Purnia on Tuesday,” Yadav said.

PATNA: Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has issued a slew of directives to prevent damages caused due to digging of roads in the city.

In a meeting held at his office on Saturday, Agarwal pointed out that the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCo), the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) or any other agency would now have to take written permission from Patna traffic SP Amarkesh D and municipal commissioner Amit Kumar Pandey as well as a no-objection certificate (NoC) from the road construction department for digging up roads.

The traffic SP, municipal commissioner, executives of the GAIL and other officials attended the meet.

According to a press statement issued by the office of the divisional commissioner, the instruction for taking prior permission from the traffic SP and the municipal commissioner was issued based on their feedback as well as the complaints of the common people. The two officials said in the meeting that the GAIL and the BUIDCo had dug up roads for carrying out underground works without informing them.

It was also decided that permission for digging up a new stretch would be granted only after a previously dug up road was filled up and black-topped.

“The work will have to be completed within a given time frame so that vehicular movement is not affected for long. Besides, roads will be dug up only at night even if the agency concerned has to rope in additional manpower,” the statement said and added that lawful action would be taken against the agencies that violate the instructions.

In order to ensure smooth vehicular movement, the divisional commissioner asked Amarkesh D to depute additional traffic constables in areas where roads were being dug up. He was also told to make sure that the GAIL and the BUIDCo did not close any road for digging it up without permission.

Those present in Saturday’s meeting were directed to monitor the digging of roads in the city and hold meetings on the first and fifteenth days of every month.

PATNA: Improper lifestyle and intake to junk food has led to increase in colorectal diseases, including intestinal cancer problem, constipation and rectal collapse, especially in the youngsters, experts said at a continuing medical education (CME) programme on ‘Controversies in colorectal disease’ at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGMIS) on Saturday.

IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said there had been increase in the cases of patients coming with problem of large intestine and rectum. “This is mostly found in youngsters in Bihar and is more painful than constipation. It is mainly caused by fast food and western food style,” he added. Dr UC Ghoshal of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences said almost 50% of people suffer from constipation problem these days.

Gastro head of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences Dr Ashok Kumar said there was also an increase in intestinal cancer cases due to intake of improper food. “Constipation could be the result of being addicted to television, computers and mobile phones,” he said. Dr Abhijeet Chandra of King George’s Medical University talked about rectal prolapse and its surgery.

The event was inaugurated by state health department director-in-chief (administration) Dr Ashok Kumar Singh.

PATNA: Police have detained two suspects for interrogation in connection with firing near an anti-CAA dharna site at Ishanagar Petrol Line under the Phulwarisharif police station area in the city late on Friday night. However, nobody was injured in the firing.

The incident took place around 10.15pm when the people staging dharna to protest CAA and NRC were about to depart from the spot. While one shot was fired close to the dharna site, another round was fired about 200 metres away from there. One empty cartridge was seized from the spot.

SHO of Phulwarisharif police station Rafiq-ur-Rahman said two youths riding a motorcycle reached the spot and opened fire in the air. Another shot was fired from a place close to the dharna site causing panic among the protesters. Those involved in the firing later fled towards Ishapur Rai Chowk.

“We are trying to collect footages of CCTV cameras installed at nearby shops and business establishments to identify the miscreants involved in the firing. A complaint has been lodged on the statement of a police officer,” the SHO said.

The dharna to oppose the CAA and NRC entered 29th day at Phulwarisharif on Saturday. People from a particular community come to the site in the morning and leave around 10pm.

Patrolling has been intensified in the locality following Friday’s incident. “We are frightened after the firing. We demand more protection for the people taking part in the protests against the CAA and NRC,” said a CPI-ML (Liberation) activist preferring anonymity.

The SHO said all precautionary measures were taken to ensure safety of protesters. “There is no need to worry for them,” he added.

Earlier, violent clashes had taken place between pro-CAA and anti-CAA supporters near Tamtam Parao under the Phulwarisharif police station area during dawn to dusk bandh on December 23 last year. The firing led to bullet injuries to about 12 protesters and a youth’s body was later found from a well in the locality. Over 60 people were arrested from two different communities in connection with the violent clashes.

SASARAM: In a unique way of showing support to CAA and NRC, BJP’s Sasaram unit organised a ‘buddhi-suddhi yajna’ at a Lord Shiva temple near the tomb of Sher Shah Suri here on Saturday.

Sasaram MP Chedi Pasawan, who led the yajna, said it was organised with a view to purifying the minds of the people protesting against the CAA and NPR.

The four-time MP said the yajna was organised in the interest of the nation and no one would be deprived of their citizenship. “Some people are creating confusion over the citizenship laws for their vested interests,” he said.

The yajna, which lasted for three hours, was attended by BJP’s Rohtas district unit president Sushil Kumar, former MLA Jawahar Prasad and around 50 party workers.

According to sources, the yajna started on Saturday morning with rituals in five ‘havan kunds’ performed by five priests. Party workers and MP Pasawan chanted ‘Bharat mata ki Jai’ during the yajna.

55,['16/02/2020'],Laskana powerloom units remain shut since worker’s death week ago,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Surat: Production at Laskana industrial estate , located 20 kilometres away from the city on Surat-Kamrej Road, has come to a grinding halt. About 400 powerloom units remain shut for last one week after the death of an Oriya worker in one of the units located in Krishna industrial estate.

Industry sources said some anti-social elements in the guise of union leaders are trying to take undue advantage of the incident that occurred on February 7. Majority of powerloom units shut down from the very next day. Laskana’s 400 units employ more than 30,000 workers. The industrial area manufactures about 15 lakh metres of polyester fabric per day. Powerloom weavers in Laskana stated that majority of workers employed in the industrial societies are from Odisha and Bihar. The anti-social elements instigated workers to abstain from work as the unit owner was not paying compensation to family of the deceased worker.

Praful Panna Sheti, 50, a textile worker employed in a powerloom unit owned by Mayur Vaghasia in Krishna industrial estate, had died of heart attack on February 7. A group of anti-social elements protested outside the unit of Vaghasia and demanded Rs10 lakh compensation for his family.

Vaghasia told TOI, “The worker died a natural death. We offered to pay Rs2 lakh compensation to his family, but the union leaders demanded Rs10 lakh. They distributed pamphlets in Oriya language asking workers to not go to their units.”

Laskana Powerloom Weavers’ Association president Hari Kathiria told TOI, “The entire powerloom industry in Laskana has come to a standstill. The anti-social elements are demanding hefty compensation for the worker who died a natural death, which is unfair. When we didn’t accept their demands, they forced workers not to go to their units.”

Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Association (FOGWA) president Ashok Jirawala said, “We fear such incidents will disturb peace in other powerloom industrial areas. A group of anti-social elements is trying to disturb peace in the industry. The association will be writing to the chief minister demanding protection for industrial areas from such elements.”

Vijay Mangukiya, president of Anjani industrial estate, said: The death of worker is unfortunate, but the anti-social elements are going to destroy the industry forever. We are doing business and providing employment to workers from other states, still we have to face losses due to unnecessary closures.

Mayur Golwala, leader of powerloom weaving sector, said: There is a sense of fear among powerloom weavers. If there is one or two unions, we are ready to sort out the issue through talks. But, here we have several groups approaching us for settlement. Many weavers in Laskana and outer areas are fed up and looking to shift their units to other places.

Kolkata: More than 1,500 people marched in a silent rally organized by Calcutta Khilafat Committee on Saturday afternoon to protest against the amended citizenship law. Participants carried the National flag, wore black bands and many held up posters against CAA and NRC. As the rally proceeded to Park Circus from Zakaria Street, several people joined in.

Calcutta Khilafat Committee, which was formed a century ago to unite Hindus and Muslims against the British, had kept itself away from socio-political movements after Independence. It was mainly instrumental in organizing the Eid prayers on Red Road and organizing cultural functions. The committee has also faced a lot of criticism for keeping silent even after so many people started hitting the streets in protest.

“Saturday’s rally was our first initiative against the citizenship law. Besides organizing such protest marches, we are also going to provide legal and moral support to other protesters. We have set up a legal cell for this purpose,” said Mullick Mohammad Ishaque, convenor, Calcutta Khilafat Committee.

The procession had participants from several communities. “This movement is not restricted to any community. Anybody who is protesting in any which way must forge alliance with the people around them. This is essential to send a message to the Prime Minister and the home minister that the citizens are against this new law,” said Qari Fazlu Rahman, who leads the Eid prayers on Red Road every year.

The committee is also planning to engage in a dialogue with the intelligentsia from other communities to convey the fears of the people regarding CAA, NPR and NRC.

Video grab of two accused while committing the crime

SURAT: Three unidentified persons were booked at Varachha police station for stealing 4.4kg gold dust worth Rs1.42 crore from a gold and diamond jewellery unit in the city on Saturday. Police suspect role of an insider in the theft since only he would know where the gold dust was being collected.

The gold dust is collected in a plastic bag placed under jewellery grinding machines through vacuum suction during the process of jewellery polishing. The burglars escaped with these bags which were full of gold dust after removing them from the machines.

Of the three burglars, two had entered the unit while one waited outside. The burglars were caught by CCTV cameras entering Dazzle Jewels at 1.10am and leaving at 2.40am. The complaint was lodged by Keyur Patel, a resident of Alkapuri on Sumul Dairy Road. Dazzle Jewels, which employs 125 people, manufactures diamond and gold jewellery.

Every 15 days, the unit replaces the bags and recycles the gold dust for jewellery making. It is suspected that the burglars stole the bags on the 15th day of the month.

""The unit owners change the bags that collect gold dust twice in a month. The unit maintains exact log of the gold dust collected in that period. The owners claim approximately 4.462kg gold dust has been stolen,"" said an officer of Varachha police station.

The faces of the burglars were covered and they are yet to be identified. ""Two persons entered the unit and we suspect more than two were involved in the theft. We are working to identify the individuals involved and the route they took to come to the unit and escape,” police said.

Investigators are also checking if any former or current employee was involved. So far, they haven’t got any leads.

Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday said the government would introduce new e-tendering module from April this year for greater transparency in the processing of tenders submitted by contractors and executing agencies for their selection and allotment of work.

Modi was addressing the pre-budget consultative meeting involving contractors and representatives of agencies. Building construction department minister Ashok Choudhary , public health and engineering department minister Vinod Narayan Jha and water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha were also present on the occasion.

Modi dwelt on various other aspects related to the tendering process on which the government has been working for introduction in the future. Even as contractors might be seeking work allotment in various works departments, including the road construction department, their registration with the government would be done at one place.

He added that prior to the submission of tender and preparation of the estimate of work sought for, they would be provided with a checklist which would mention the laws and other aspects with which they would have to comply during the preparation of the estimate or the execution of work.

Modi said documents submitted during the filing of tenders would be put on display on the official portal for seven days as was being done in the road construction department. This would be done to give information to the tenderers about errors in the tender papers they had submitted, or the reasons for the rejection of the tenders filed by them for the work allotment.

Earlier, the participant contractors and representatives of the work executing agencies raised queries regarding Goods and Services Tax (GST) and mining activities. Modi said a workshop would be held in the near future to resolve their grievances and clear their confusions.

Modi talked about the quantum of work that had been undertaken in the current fiscal, saying that Bihar had become the biggest consumer of cement in the country. During the current fiscal, works worth Rs 31,600 crore had been taken up for execution, while raw materials worth Rs 22,146 crore had been brought into the state for use in the construction work.

The raw materials brought for use in the construction work included iron and steel worth Rs 10,600 crore, cement worth Rs 4,279 crore, electrical goods in the range of Rs 6,572 crore and tiles and marbles to the tune of Rs 675 crore.

Besides, in the 2019-20 financial year, works worth Rs 7,023 crore had been taken up for execution in the road construction department, followed by Rs 4,423 crore in the building construction department and Rs 2,662 crore in the water resources department.

Mamata Sarkar and Lucky Singh will tie the knot on March 10

KOLKATA: For Nadia’s acid attack survivor Mamata Sarkar and her partner, Uttarakhand’s Lucky Singh, it hasn’t always been a smooth journey. Four years ago, the scars on Sarkar’s face didn’t come in the way of Singh falling in love with “her soul” and soon, he shifted base to Kolkata to strengthen their relationship. His family, however, didn’t accept his decision to marry an acid attack survivor and disowned him.

But this Valentine’s Day, Singh decided to take up a room on rent near Sarkar’s house so that they can get married on March 10 and settle down there.

One night in 2004, when Sarkar was asleep with her mother in their bedroom, she felt a liquid splash over her face and body. “I was around 13-14. The culprit was a relative who had enmity with us over property issues. He thought the incident would bring a bad name to my family and no one would marry me. He thought I would become an unlucky burden for my family. Though I survived, my scars were devastating. The culprit got bail while I locked myself at home for over four years,” she recalled.

Four years ago, Sarkar decided to rebuild her life. She got multiple surgeries done, cleared her higher secondary exams and got a job. She met Singh when she went to Durgapur for work. “Slowly, I started liking her. I always believed that looks are skin-deep and the soul of a person needs to be beautiful. I fell in love with her soul,” 25-year-old Singh told TOI.

However, a long-distance relationship wasn’t Singh’s cup of tea. Though the company where he was working had branches across India, it folded up at the time he decided to move to Kolkata. And family opposition couldn’t change his mind. “I got a job in Kolkata just to be close to her. Though my family didn’t disrespect my decision to be in a relationship with her, they didn’t accept my decision to marry her. They disowned me,” he said.

On March 10, the couple will tie the knot at Sarkar’s house in Nadia’s Binodnagar village. “I had lost faith in love. He taught me that true love isn’t cosmetic,” Sarkar said. “He has got me a red lehenga for the wedding,” the bride-to-be added.

“I want to return to my village with her. Time and professional success, I hope, will get us acceptance,” he said.

A child being treated suspected symptoms of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Patna (File photo)

PATNA: National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences ( NIMHANS ), Bangalore, will provide technical support to state health department for enhancing surveillance for acute encephalitis syndrome ( AES ), which had killed over 150 children in the state last year.

NIMHANS will also strengthen the capacity of existing laboratories in the state and develop a tiered network of labs.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard was signed between state health department and NIMHANS here on Saturday. The non-financial MoU will be effective till September this year.

As part of the MoU, NIMHANS team will provide support in strengthening district laboratories or level-1 lab where basic test can be done and two virology labs, one at Patna Medical College and Hospital and another at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), will be developed as level-2 labs.

For high level test, samples will be sent to NIMHANS lab in Bangalore. Before enhancing these labs, NIMHANS and Care India will conduct a gap assessment and then suggest measures for strengthening surveillance capabilities. This gap assistance will be done in 15 days.

State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar after said signing the MoU that it was important to understand the reason behind AES, for which research was required and NIMHANS will be training health experts on the ways of documentation. Sanjay said many experts had earlier given various theories on AES, but its aetiology is still unknown.

NIMHANS neuro-virology head Dr V Ravi said doctors would be imparted training in March and pharmacists and lab technicians in April.

“NIMHANS has already done such surveillances in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam. In UP, 30 to 40% of encephalitis cases were because of scrub typhus germs. Dengue was found to be another factor. In fact, causes have been found for 50% encephalitis cases in UP,” he said.

‘100-bed PIU at Muzaffarpur hospital by April’: State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar on Saturday said the 100-bed paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur would be ready by the last week of April this year.

He also said a dhramshala was being made at SKMCH to provide accommodation to the parents of sick kids. “A batch of 36 doctors and nurses has been sent to Delhi for training on AES,” Sanjay said.

Kanhaiya Kumar

ARA/BIHARSHARIF: Police on Saturday booked 25 people for the attack on the convoy of CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar at Bibiganj under Gajrajganj outpost of Bhojpur district on Friday.

The convoy of Kanhaiya, who has been holding public meetings against Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the state under his ‘Jan Gan Man Yatra’ since January 29, has so far been attacked for eighth time.

SHO of Gajrajganj police outpost Manish Kumar said an FIR was lodged against 10 named and 15 unknown people for the attack on Kanhaiya’s convoy. “The FIR was been lodged on the statement of an ASI, Hira Lal Rai, as he was a member of the police escort that accompanied the convoy of Kanhaiya. According to our initial investigation, mostly members of Shiv Sena or their sympathizers were behind the attack,” the SHO said.

Bhojpur SP Sushil Kumar, on the other hand, said three people have been arrested so far in connection with attack on Kanhaiya’s convoy and raids were on to nab others. “One of the arrested persons is Vikramaditya Singh, who claims to be the state organizational secretary of Shiv Sena,” the SP said.

Meanwhile, Bajrang Dal activists organised a massive candlelight match in Biharsharif on Friday night in solidarity with Pulwama martyrs and threatened Kanhaiya of dire consequences, if he made anti-national statements during his proposed visit to Nalanda on Sunday.

Nalanda district CPI general secretary Surindra Ram said tens of hundreds of people listen to Kanhaiya wherever he goes. “The overwhelming response by the people has upset the divisive forces and out of desperation, they have made at least eight abortive attempts on his life,” he said.

Kanhaiya is also scheduled to address a rally at Sheikhpura’s Islamia School Ground on Sunday.

Meanwhile, CPI’s state secretary Satya Narayan Singh on Saturday demanded “adequate security” for Kanhaiya. “Kanhaiya and other persons accompanying him have been attacked at eight places,” Singh said.

Representative image

PATNA: Work on installation of ropeways on Rohtasgarh hill in Rohtas and Mundeshwari hill in Kaimur district is likely to commence within a month.

The ropeway connecting Akbarpur and Rohtasgarh Fort will be 1.35km-long. “The Chorasan temple situated on the top of Rohtasgarh Hill is a major tourist attraction. The area is intended to be developed as an ecotourism site,” said Sikandar Paswan, project engineer of Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL).

BRPNNL is the executing agency of the project. The estimated outlay for ropeway in Rohtas and Kaimur is Rs8.34 crore and Rs5.77 crore, respectively.

Officials said altogether six ropeways are proposed at different places in the state, including three in Gaya and one each in Kaimur, Rohtas and Jehanabad districts. Sources at BRPNNL said bidding process for the other ropeways were in the initial stages.

Talking about the delay in the Rohtasgarh and Mundeshwari hill projects, a BRPNNL official said: “We were not getting a firm with the required specializations. As of now, the bidding process for ropeway system at Rohtas and Kaimur are in final stages and construction work will begin in March.”

The 425m ropeway on Mundeshwari hill will provide connectivity to Mundeshwari Dham. “Climbing 951 steps on Mundeshwari hill is not just time taking and tiring but unsafe as well. With ropeway system, tourists will be able to reach the hilltop in less than 10 minutes,” Paswan said.

Meanwhile, another BRPNNL official said: “Both Rohtas and Kaimur are located on hills and are environmentally sensitive zones. These are already established tourist destinations in the state. The districts witness vehicular movement throughout the day, causing pollution. Cable car facility on ropeway will not just be convenient for tourists but time saving too. Besides, they are eco-friendly and sustainable and most importantly sources of tourist attraction.”

BHAGALPUR: In stern action against a beneficiary of multi-hundred crore scam related to siphoning of government money by Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti ( SMVSS ), the Bank of Baroda and Bhagalpur district administration have confiscated immovable property of N V Raju, an absconding trader. Raju is accused number 3 in one of the 22 FIRs lodged in connection with the scam.

A plot of land (1440 square feet) at Jogsar and one shop each of the trader at Ishwari Complex and Adhyaanti Complex in Bhagalpur town were confiscated under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (also known as the SARFAESI Act).

The seized properties were under mortgage with Bank of Baroda (BOB) against a loan of Rs 1.55 crore, whose present value is Rs 1.88 crore.

BOB panel lawyer Keshav Kumar Jha said confiscation of three immovable properties were made under SARFAESI Act, allowing banks and other financial institutions to auction residential or commercial properties (of defaulter) to recover loans.

Special magistrate Manikant Prasad Gupta, who executed the confiscation and sealing process of the immovable property of N V Raju, said it was done as per law.

Sources said Raju was under the scanner of CBI, income-tax department and Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of Bihar police as well as banks and other agencies since the Rs 1,910-crore Srijan scam came to light in August 2017.

Raju, who was earlier a small time sales representative with a private firm, is presently a big dealer of electronics items. According to sources, Raju took loans from BOB and went underground after the scam surfaced. The BOB authorities recently approached Bhagalpur DM Pranav Kumar to initiate confiscation of his property and put it on auction to recover the bank money.

PATNA: A three-day national seminar on ‘Population, Health and Sustainable Development Goals: Performance and Prioritizing Policies’, which was jointly organized by Patna University (PU) and the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), concluded here on Saturday.

Delivering the valedictory address, health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar observed that a national-level institute of demography was urgently required in the state as its total fertility rate (TFR) was 3.2 against the national average of 2.1. “This is mainly due to low acceptance of family planning measures by the people on account of poor awareness. Such an institute may be set up under the umbrella of PU,” he said.

Kumar added, “Low age of marriage and little age gap between two children are leading to unwarranted population growth. A woman usually gives birth to three children till she attains the age of 24 and the rate of male vasectomy is almost nil in Bihar .”

PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, in his presidential remarks, highlighted the importance of demographic studies in socio-economic development of the country. He lauded the progress of the Population Research Centre attached to PU’s statistics department and assured of his full cooperation in its development.

Two papers on ‘Neglected Cause of Morbidity’ and ‘Consanguineous Marriages and Their Impact on Neonatal and Child Mortality in India’ were awarded the first and second prizes on the occasion.

KOLKATA: It was a dream come true for members of Lake Gardens People ’s Association when mayor Firhad Hakim inaugurated a capsule water booster pumping station at Bangur Park on Saturday evening. This pumping station, with a capacity to supply 18 lakh gallons of filtered water every day, will cater to more than 10,000 people staying at Lake Gardens and its adjacent areas.

The water movement in the locality had started nine years ago. Amit Mukherjee, one of members of the Lake Gardens People’s Association, recalled, “We started a movement for safe and pure water as the only source of drinking water here was under ground. We were scared of drinking it for fear of arsenic contamination. Now we are happy that the KMC has set up a booster pumping station that will supply us with safe filtered water.”

“We had to shift our Durga Puja to a corner of the park to accommodate the water booster pumping station. But we are happy to have got the pumping station,” Mukherjee added.

Sources in the water supply department said the newly built booster pumping station will be able to supply filtered water from next month.

Sagar Khare

BHOPAL: Khajuraho MP Vishnu Dutt Sharma’s appointment as Madhya Pradesh BJP chief has turned into a headache — or ear ache — for a Delhiite, who got hundreds of congratulatory calls all of Saturday. He has the same phone number that Sharma once used.

Sagar Khare, 24, a resident of Saroj Nagar in New Delhi, said his phone “went berserk” on Saturday afternoon. “It kept ringing. There were hundreds of WhatsApp messages,” he told TOI over phone. “I had taken this phone number around a year ago after my father’s death. Earlier, I used a number that was in the name of my father,” said Sagar, adding that it was an “ordinary number”. “I work in a salon and distributed it among my customers, friends and family members. But soon I started receiving calls and messages from unknown numbers.”

“I complained about it to customer care, and they assured me that I would not receive such calls, but to no avail. I do not mind one or two calls a day, but today I have received hundreds of calls. They just don’t stop coming,” he said. He found out that several popular caller identification apps also list his number as V D Sharma’s.

Weekends are busy and he couldn’t take all the calls, he said. “There is a huge pile of missed calls. However, I can’t avoid taking calls because it may be from a client or an acquaintance. Today, all the calls began with ‘badhai ho...’. I keep telling them politely that I am not the person they want to congratulate,” he said. “I will again complain to customer care and urge them to find a way out.”

Asked if he knows Sharma, Saroj said, “I do not know him personally, but from the calls I assume he is an important political leader.”

BEGUSARAI: In a bizarre incident, a group of CPI workers on Saturday “purified” a statue of B R Ambedkar by washing it with ‘Gangajal’ after it was garlanded by Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh.

The CPI workers sprinkled ‘Gangajal’ on the statue amid chants of ‘Jai Bhim’ and slogans in praise of Phule (the 19th century social reformer couple Jyotiba and Savitribai) before washing the sculpture thoroughly.

The statue, installed on the premises of Ballia block office, was garlanded by Giriraj while he was participating in a procession organised by local BJP and Bajrang Dal activists on Friday.

Local CPI leaders alleged that Giriraj, while addressing a public meet at the venue, used highly objectionable, provocative and communal language, throwing all constitutional obligations to wind.

“His speech spread communal hatred and CPI workers as a gesture washed Baba Saheb’s statue to rid it from the inauspicious touch of the minister,” CPI district working general secretary Awadhes Rai said.

He claimed that they also wrote to CM Nitish Kumar and chief secretary Deepak Kumar as well as DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, asking them to lodge criminal cases against Giriraj for his provocative speeches on Friday.

Meanwhile, BJP’s former Begusarai district president Sanjay Singh said the ‘Bharat Vanshi Jagriti Yatra’ led by the Union minister was only intended to make people aware about the rich religious legacy of India.

BJP’s state spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “Giriraj has all the right to pay tribute by garlanding the statue of Ambedkar. The act of purification of the statue by the communists and RJD is very shameful and condemnable. They must know that Ambedkar belongs to every Indian and it is not the Congress but our PM Narendra Modi who has developed the ‘panch tirth’ places in the memory of the Father of Indian Constitution.”

PATNA: Two new compressed natural gas (CNG) stations of the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) were inaugurated in Naubatpur and Saguna Mor area of Patna on Saturday.

During inspection, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal claimed that three more CNG stations would come up in a couple of months in areas like Gola Road and Digha.

“Apart from these, the interstate bus terminal, which is under construction at Ramchak Bairiya, and the proposed transport complex at Phulwarisharif will also get CNG stations. Besides, lands in other locations like Gandhi Maidan and Bailey Road are being identified for such stations,” the transport secretary said and added that altogether 12 CNG stations would be ready in the city by December-end.

At present, three CNG stations are operational at Rukanpura, Transport Nagar and Bakhtiyarpur toll plaza in Patna. The gas supply is done under the City Gas Distribution Scheme, which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Begusarai on February 17 last year.

Agarwal said, “We have been promoting the use of CNG as it is an eco-friendly fuel that can help reduce the levels of pollution. It is also cheaper than petrol and diesel. The state government also introduced 50% rebate on road tax for CNG vehicles.”

According to sources, more than 5,000 vehicles, most of which are autorickshaws, are running on CNG in Patna. The remaining 15,000 autos run on diesel and petrol.

GAIL’s deputy general manager (Patna region) Rajneesh Goel told this newspaper that the daily consumption of CNG in the state capital was 11,000kg, at present. “Approximately 3,000 vehicles refill their tankers at the three CNG stations every day,” he added.

Last year, the state government had decided to ban diesel-run autos in Patna from January 31, 2021 and its adjoining areas from March 31, 2021.

Surat: Sarthana police arrested four persons and booked 25 others on Saturday on charges of their alleged attempt to incite riot in an industrial area over the death of a labourer. The workers took to streets on Friday night at around 10.30 pm and circulated handbills in Odiya language in Diamond Nagar, a cluster of textile weaving units , and forced the labourers to stop work while hurling abuses.

Police arrested four labourers – Santosh Dalabehra, Subrot Jena, Onadi Khutiya and Mohan Reddy – for allegedly provoking the labourers and creating disturbance in the area. The complaint was lodged by Babu Sojitra, one of the unit owners in Diamond Nagar.

Police investigation so far revealed that a 41-year-old labourer died of heart attack on February 7 while working in a textile unit in Diamond Nagar in Laskana, an area in outskirts of the city. His relatives demanded compensation from the employer, while the body was sent for cremation to Odisha. When the discussion for compensation failed, the labourers created disturbance in the area.

“Kin demanded around Rs 7 lakh while the employer proposed to give Rs 2 lakh. Following failure to get the expected amount, the labourers started creating nuisance,” said a officer in Sarthana police station.

“Though the issue of compensation does not come under police's purview, police took immediate action as they started creating disturbance forcing other labourers to go on strike leading to riots. While the leaders are yet to be identified, the situation is normal now,” police said.

TimesView The exam season starts from Tuesday and the traffic in this zone will severely test people’s — and traffic managers’ — patience. Responsible driving will become even more important to ensure accidents do not add to the chaos.

KOLKATA: Several steps taken by the Shyambazar traffic guard to ensure smoother vehicular flow on the Belgachhia flyover to allow easy access of ambulances and doctors to RG Kar Hospital’s emergency gate has led to several commuters — especially patients and their relatives — to appeal to cops to “reconsider them.”Their plea included allowing RG Kar Hospital-bound passengers to get off buses near the emergency gate, allowing personal vehicles of doctors on emergency the right of way and arranging a specific drop-off and pick-up spot for taxis and app cabs, most of which are now asking passengers to walk down to the Kolkata station-bound road for fear of being challaned.The cops said they are in a catch-22 situation. “The pressure is so heavy at the hospital gates that allowing even a few seconds for a bus to stop outside is leading to a major tail on the bridge. Additionally, some buses are trying to encourage passengers to disembark on the go, leading to accidents. Even with so much pressure, we have allowed passengers to get off less than 100m from the new gate beside the police kiosk, a distance most people can walk down. As of now, we have no other option as ambulances will have to be given first priority at the main gate,” explained an officer.Kolkata traffic police’s Facebook page carried specific complaints on this issue since Thursday morning, with even a doctor pitching in.“The buses are no longer stopping at RG Kar Hospital. The conductors are saying that if they stop there, sergeants will issue traffic stickers. This has now forced us — the kin of patients and local residents — to sometimes walk close to 800m from Belgachhia Metro station bus stop. The Tallah Bridge reconstruction has adversely affected us. Such a decision is making the daily commute even more difficult. I request you to look into the matter quickly,” wrote Debjani Pal, a resident of Tallah.Tanushree Roy, a doctor at RG Kar, wrote, “Due to the closure of Tallah Bridge, there is huge traffic pressure on Belgachhia flyover. The exit from RG Kar has been very difficult as cops just let the traffic flow one way from Shyambazar towards Belgachhia. It takes near about 40 minutes for a car to get to the main road from RG Kar Hospital. They even threatened my driver when I, a doctor at the hospital, pleaded about a medical emergency. Please look into the matter and ensure free flow of traffic from and towards RG Kar Medical College and Hospital .”A Lalbazar officer said they were open to “suggestions”. “We will ascertain what can be done and forward it to the guards,” said an IPS officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74159578,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-287615,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/complaints-about-rg-kar-hosp-access-flood-city-cops-fb-page/articleshow/74155366.cms

A view of pathetic condition of Mauryalok Complex in Patna on Friday

PATNA: Maurya Lok Complex, the city’s premier shopping hub, has almost lost its sheen. Loose electric wires, open manholes and parking chaos are a common sight at Maurya Lok. Even protests inside the shopping complex have become a daily affair, leading to drastic fall in commercial activities.

Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), which has its headquarters in one of the towers inside Maurya Lok, was supposed to revamp this market complex by August last year. Even urban development and housing department minister Suresh Kumar Sharma had earlier assured to renovate the market complex by August 15, 2019. However, nothing has been done so far.

The western side of this shopping complex is still lying excavated. The southern part has piles of PMC’s office waste, hindering connectivity and parking. Open manholes and dirty toilets are also a common sight. Even the park which has Swami Vivekanand’s statue has been left dug with trash on statue’s podium.

Ashraf Hasan, once a regular visitor to this place, said he stopped visiting the complex now. “It has become impossible to enter Maurya Lok in a four-wheeler. Even if one enters, there is no place to park the vehicle as the roads are dug and other portion has waste in the field,” Hasan added,

Kadamkuan resident Anita Prasad (40), who was found shopping at Maurya Lok the other day, said, “I have been buying clothes from here since my college days. The condition of Maurya Lok is deteriorating with each passing day.”

Shopkeepers blamed PMC for the poor condition of Maurya Lok. “It was much better before PMC’s office was shifted here. They have made the entire market a garbage dump. It has virtually turned into a dharna site. We have written to PMC officials and also met UDHD minister in this regard,” said Maurya Lok Shopkeeper Kalyan Samiti president Rajesh Kumar Dabloo.

One Ashwani Logan, who owns a shoe shop at Maurya Lok, said, “Whenever, anyone has problem with PMC, they hold dharna here. The place becomes so congested that buyers cannot come here. Our sales dropped by 90% when sanitation workers staged protests at this shopping complex in support of their demands. We were not even able to meet the establishment cost.”

Patna mayor Sita Sahu said funds crunch led to delay in renovation of Maurya Lok . “UDHD had promised Rs 10 crore for its renovation. However, we have not got the amount yet,” she added.

81,['16/02/2020'],5 injured as speeding bus hits school van in Koh-e-Fiza,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Bhopal: A speeding bus rammed into a school van carrying students of Campion School in Khajuri on Saturday morning. Four girls and a man were seriously injured in the accident. One girl’s index finger was severed in the incident and was re-attached after a surgery. The mishap led to a pile-up with several vehicles getting hit while the errant bus driver fled the scene. He was later arrested.

The incident occurred while the van had stopped on the Koh-e-Fiza main road to pick up children in the morning. The collision was so intense that the van hit the divider of the service lane. The van also hit a car parked in front, which in turn rammed into another car ahead. A man, who was getting off his car, was hit by the school van. He too fell on the road around five feet away.

There were around a dozen minor children on board the van, mostly girls. About four of them fell on the road and were seriously injured. The 9-year-old girl, whose index finger was severed from her hand, was operated at a hospital in Rohit Nagar, where the doctors have attached the finger back in a four-hour-long microsurgery. Apart from her, two minor sisters were undergoing treatment at a hospital near Royal Market.

The bus involved in the accident was supposed to go Guna from Halalpur bus stand and the errant driver was going to pick up passengers when he rammed into school van. He fled the spot after the incident. Koh-e-Fiza police reached the spot on getting information and rushed the injured students to hospital. Police seized the bus and arrested the errant driver after registering a case against him.

SHO, Koh-e-Fiza, Sudhir Arjaria, said that school van driver, GC Lal Yadav, 35, a resident of Bairagarh Kalan in Khajuri, told police that after picking up students from Koh-e-Fiza, he was going to drop them to school. Around 7.20am, he stopped in front of a gym on Koh-e-Fiza main road to pick up the children. At the same time, a speeding bus belonging to Qureshi Bus Service came from the back and rammed into the van. The van turned sidewise and stopped after hitting a divider and a car parked in front. About five minor girls fell on the road and sustained injuries. The students inside the van too sustained injuries.

SHO Arjaria said that four girls, including Arna Rathore, 9, Bilkis, 13, and her sister Amana, 9, and Ayesha, 13, were injured in the accident and rushed to hospital. All the injured girls are residents of Koh-e-Fiza. Arna is a student of class 2, while Ayesha and Bilkis are students of class 7. Amana is a student of class 3.

The SHO said that Arna’s index finger on the left hand was severed from her hand and she was operated at a hospital in Rohit Nagar. Bilkis sustained injuries on head and face while her younger sister, Amana, also sustained a head injury. They were admitted to a hospital near Royal Market. Ayesha had injured her legs and was discharged after treatment.

SHO Arjaria said that Arna’s father Mahendra is a businessman and supplies stationery while the father of Bilkis and Amana, Mohammed Akbar, takes catering contracts. Police have registered a case against errant bus driver Shafiq Khan and arrested him.

Eyewitness account

Advocate Vaibhav Choudhary, a resident of Jain Nagar near Lalghati, whose car was hit by the van, told TOI that he had gone to purchase grocery from a departmental store along with his friend Aslam Khan. He stopped the car in front of the store and was sitting on the driver’s seat while Aslam was getting down when the incident took place. Aslam fell almost five feet away on the road and sustained minor injuries. He was saved as he was wearing seat belt. When he saw the school girls of the van bleeding, Choudhary got down and asked the van driver to call their parents. The errant bus driver had fled the spot immediately after accident. Police reached the spot and rushed the students to hospital.

Box-

Too many cars parked near mishap spot

Arna’s father Mahendra Rathore told TOI that the main cause of accident is that a large number of vehicles are parked in front of the gym, at the accident spot, both in the morning and evening hours. Half of the road is occupied by the BRTS corridor and the vehicles are parked outside the service lane, which makes the area accident-prone. He said Arna’s finger was attached back by doctors in a four-hour long microsurgery and the family hopes for her speedy recovery.

82,['16/02/2020'],BJP may field Udayanraje for RS,"This story is from February 16, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: Three months after his defeat in Satara Lok Sabha by-election, BJP leadership is seriously thinking of fielding Udayanraje Bhosale , 13th descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, for Rajya Sabha election from Maharashtra.

Top sources in BJP confirmed with TOI that the senior leaders of the party have principally agreed to nominate Bhosale for the election to be held in April this year. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was pressing for Bhosale’s candidature.

BJP leaders, who are involved in the decision-making, said Bhosale was promised that he would be accommodated in Rajya Sabha in case he lost the by-election. Bhosale was reluctant to join BJP because of fear that he may be defeated in NCP bastion of Satara. “His fear is a reality and it’s the party’s duty to keep its promise,” said a top BJP leader.

Even after his defeat in Satara Lok Sabha by-election, BJP leaders believe that Bhosale has the potential to challenge NCP’s dominance in western Maharashtra. BJP is looking for a formidable face in the region and the party believes that a member of the royal family may be useful in the regional politics.

Party also hopes to keep the dominant Maratha community in good humor as may of the leaders held BJP responsible for luring Bhosale for its political objectives. Bhosale has been keeping a low profile after his defeat.

Sources in BJP said that senior leader Eaknath Khadse and party spokesperson Shaina N C were other aspirants for Rajya Sabha. However, Fadnavis and state BJP president Chandrakant Patil are pushing for Bhosale.

BJP leaders are still upset with Khadse as he had not stopped his outrage against state leaders. Central party leadership feels that Khadse is trying to emerge as a rallying point of disgruntled elements in Maharashtra BJP unit.

BJP had nominated Amar Sable last time, whose term will expire soon. Sable, who hails from Pune, has been given the hint that his tenure would not be extended.

BJP sources said a primary meeting was held at the residence of union home minister Amit Shah on Friday night. Bhosale was present at the meeting along with Fadnavis and Patil. BJP can send two Rajya Sabha members considering its strength in Assembly. Ramdas Aathwale’s candidature is considered as certain, said BJP sources.

Kolhapur: Activists and citizens have objected to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) proposal for increasing the water tax rates by 30%.

The civic administration had presented the wax tax hike proposal before the standing committee which has recently forwarded the same to the general body meeting in which the final decision will be taken.

Water tax superintendent Prashant Pandat said that the revenue losses of the department are mounting and the water tax rates have not been hiked in the last six years. He said that owing to the shortage of revenue collection, the salaries of staff are not being paid regularly.

Baba Indulkar, an activist from the association ‘Common Man’ from Rajarampuri, said, “We have learnt that taxes for 50% of the water supplied is already collected. The government offices have dues of over Rs 6 crore. While drafting the proposal of water tax hike , the officials deliberately refrained from mentioning their own failures pertaining to run the water supply system properly. At present, dues have mounted to Rs 24 crore and civic authorities have not prepared any plan to recover them. We have requested the mayor and deputy mayor to not allow the tax hike.”

Activists from the association also listed several issues related to the water supply system. They said that the water supply to most areas in the city does not take place properly and, at the same time, some areas receive water twice a day for about two-three hours. Such imbalance in supply should be addressed, said activists.

They also threatened to initiate an agitation if the proposal for water tax hike gets approval from the general body.

Responding to their concerns, mayor Nilofer Ajrekar said that she will initiate talks with the corporators and the officials to ensure that all the issues grappling the water supply system are addressed immediately. “Before the GBM, I will talk to all the stakeholders once again. We, too, are against the hike in water tax rates as it will cause burden to the citizens. However, we have to address the concerns of the water supply department as well,” said Ajrekar.

Jaipur: Various employees unions of North Western Railway are planning to protest against the idea of allowing private players to operate trains on busiest circuits across the country. The unions said that railways has been the cheapest medium of transportation, while the move by the rail minister to give a nod to operate 150 private trains will hit its earnings.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman in her budget speech had announced that railways will allow private players to run their trains on 100 routes across the country.

Railways employees unions of NWR are organising various meetings to take a final decision on if they should go for a strike against this initiative.

“This is first step towards privatization. Government will do all what they did to Air India. We will discuss on a strategy to show our anger and protest against the move. At any cost we will save railways to get privatized,” said Saurabh Dixit, divisional chairman of UPRMS told TOI.

Railways employees said allowing private players to use the infrastructure of railways will affect regular trains.

“Indian railways has been the cheapest mode of transportation for masses . These private players will merely run super luxury trains which won’t run on shorter distances. Also in trains run by Indian railways offer concessions in at least 65 categories of people including those awarded with Padma Shree, Bharat Ratna, differently abled, cancer patients, senior citizens and others. These operators will not only end these concessions but will also take a major chunk of revenue of railways,” said Vinod Mehta, general secretary, Uttar Pachim Railway Mazdooor Sangh.

Various unions including UPRMS and North Western Railways Employees Unions are having meetings to decide on if they can go for a strike on various anti-employee policies. “We will chalk out some result oriented strategy to combat the attempt of the Centre which is in a mood to facilitate the private players,” said general secretary of NWREU.TNN

88,['16/02/2020'],Bagilge: A village that hosts Shiva temple built in Hemadpanti architectural style,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Bagilge, a remote village on the border of Maharashtra-Karnataka in the Chandgad taluka hosts an ancient Shiva temple carved in black stone and built in Hemadpanti architectural style. The temple is beautiful even if it has been left in ruins. The temple needs to be restored in order to maintain the sanctity and beauty of the temple. The site is certainly worth studying for the architecture and temple researchers.

How to reach

Bagilge village, with around 250 houses, is located in Kolhapur district near Belgavi city. It is 115 km from Kolhapur city. From there, it takes two hours to reach the place. While traveling towards Karnataka on the national highway, one has to take right deviation after Tawandi ghat towards Gadhinglaj and then go towards Bagilge, crossing Mahagaon, Nesari, Adkur, Naganwadi and Tambulwadi villages to reach the ancient temple located on the road side. Along with the temple, one can also visit Mahipalgad fort and Gandharvgad fort located nearby. Ibrahimpur, located in the close vicinity of the temple also hosts the same kind of ancient Hemadpanti temples.

Legends have it

This temple is known in the vicinity as Prachin Shiv Mandir. Sadanand Gurav, the priest of the temple, said, “This temple of Lord Shiva is a perfect example of Hemadpanti architecture and thus many historians and those interested in architecture keep visiting this place. The stone carvings are one of its kinds. Proper care was taken to provide ventilation in the temple, with plenty of light vents in those eras as well. At present, the condition of the temple is not good. It has been partially damaged and the temple needs immediate restoration to conserve the beauty of the temple.”

Flora and Fauna

Bagilge and its surroundings are home to several varieties of flower and butterfly species. Sachin Mane, a wildlife photographer, said, “This place is located amidst nature and is home to several species. It has several species of medicinal plants and herbs around it. Karvee, jamun, banyan and bamboo trees can be found in plenty here. Butterflies are one of the main attractions for the tourists here with species like sleepy orange, blue tiger, grey pansy, common sailor, lemon pansy, great egg fly and common crow found flying all around here.”

Kota collector Om Prakash Kasera

KOTA: A day after chief minister Ashok Gehlot made Kota collector Om Prakash Kasera read out the complaint of 60-year-old widow Yasmeen during a video conference, the collector on Saturday handed over the sanction order to her for pension under the government’s widow pension scheme at her residence in Anantpura. He also apologised to her for making her wait six months.

Yasmeen’s husband died on September 21, 2019 but she could not avail of the benefits of the scheme as she didn’t possess a Jan Aadhaar card.

After the death of her husband, religious restrictions kept her indoors for four months, which prevented her from fulfilling necessary formalities for pension in time.

After a complaint was lodged on the Sampark portal, district officials had to treat the case in special category. “First, I would like to apologise for making you wait for around six months for a simple issue,” said Kasera with folded hands as he handed over the pension order to her. Now, she will get Rs 700 per month.

The collector also handed over a cheque of Rs 5,000 from his personal account and assured her all possible assistance from the government.

Kasera also directed an official to arrange a contractual job for Yasmeen’s daughter in Kota Municipal Corporation. He also asked officials to add Yasmeen’s family to the Below Poverty Level (BPL) list so that they can avail of the benefits of food security and free medical schemes.

“While applying for widow pension, she did not fill up the form, which is required to be filled up at an e-mitra centre. When she was contacted, she was performing some rituals following the death of her husband. Hence, she could not step out of her house for four months. That’s why she failed to fulfill the formalities,” Kasera told TOI on Sunday.

“Treating the case in a special category, we sent the officials to Yasmeen’s residence to open her bank account and to make her Jan Adhaar card,” he added. “Issuance of Jan Adhaar card takes a certain amount of time and while the process was underway, the matter was raised during the video conference where the chief minister expressed displeasure.”

Bhopal: A kitchen with no utensils, stinking beds and an empty sports room. Welcome to Barkatullah University (BU)’s Jawahar hostel right in the heart of the state capital.

BU’s has three boys’ hostels on its campus—named after late Congress leader Sanjay Gandhi, writer Munshi Premchand and country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru—each with a capacity to accommodate 100 students.

Students at the Jawahar hostel say their rooms are in such a bad shape that they can easily pass off as haunted houses.

“It resembles a haunted place from some old Bollywood movie. A few days ago, a snake was found curled inside a student’s room. Wardens hardly pay any heed. We are told that huge money is being allotted for maintenance and upkeep of the hostels every year. They should come and spend a day here and see where all the money goes,” says a student requesting anonymity.

Heaps of filth, waterlogged pits and defunct lights are the order of the day, say students.

“Do we really need to raise our voice for utensils in the kitchen? Such is the situation in the hostel of a university situated right in the middle of the state capital,” said another student. Students have been drinking water from an overhead tank, which most of them say, has not been cleaned for years.

Students say the hostels are in urgent need of maintenance. On Saturday, they submitted an application to university authorities.

“Imagine a situation where you don’t have anything to sleep on. Old and stinking beds have made the situation even worst for us. In the absence of basic hygiene, many students are not keeping well,” said another student.

University’s registrar, B Bharti, said: “I have directed the officials to provide kitchen utensils immediately. Students will get it by Monday,” said Bharti.

Asked about beds in bad shape, Bharti said: “I have also accepted this demand. Students will get within a month all such stuff,” adding “sports equipment and a gym will also be made available.”

Thiruvananthapuram: With projects entering the execution phase , Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd ( SCTL ) has decided to constitute a four-member sub-committee to monitor on-site execution of works. This was decided at the board meeting, held on Friday, after mayor K Sreekumar raised apprehensions over the progress of the projects and the lack of regular updates.

In a recent review meeting at the corporation office, the mayor had pulled up SCTL staff for tardy progress. He voiced concern that nothing concrete was being done on the field and that staff had failed in updating the corporation about the timely execution of works.

On Friday, Sreekumar said it was imperative for the civic body to keep tabs on the progress of ‘Smart City’ projects. The mayor will chair the sub-committee, with representatives of the secretaries of PWD, LSGD and SCTL CEO as members.

“We are nearing completion of situation analysis, feasibility study, detailed project report, administrative and technical sanctions. We are moving into execution phase and once that begins, there would be like over 50 work sites and that would require constant monitoring. That’s why we have formed a sub-committee,” said SCTL CEO P Bala Kiran.

The city mayor said the sub-committee will go a long way in expediting implementation of works. “The execution of works has been a matter of concern and hopefully it will be addressed with the formation of the sub-committee,” Sreekumar said.

The board also approved six projects to the tune of Rs 347.16 crore. Once the minutes of the meeting are approved, administrative sanction will be given for the projects. Based on Smart City proposal grant from the centre and shares from state and city corporation, detailed project reports for projects worth Rs 1,122.05 crore have been completed. Administrative sanction has been given for projects worth Rs 937.84 crore and technical sanction accorded for projects worth Rs 584.97 crore. Works worth Rs 205.14 crore have been tendered and Rs 10.45 crore works have been awarded.

SCTL plans to tender all works by March.

It issued a tender for the Rs 83 crore redevelopment of Palayam market on Saturday. The project involves design, supply and installation of prefabricated structures for construction of a rehabilitation block for existing vendors, site clearance and construction of a new market building, design, supply and installation and maintenance of a electro-mechanical car parking system within the basement of the proposed market building.

JAIPUR: The Special Operations Group (SOG) arrested two persons accused of smuggling narcotics across the state and recovered 1.5kg cannabis from them.

The accused Ankush Singh, 24, and Upesh Thagariya, 22 were nabbed with balls of the banned substance hidden in their jackets.

Anil Paliwal, ADG, SOG & ATS, said, “We received information that the accused were getting ‘charas’ from Himachal Pradesh and supplying it in various parts of Rajasthan. We tracked the accused and arrested them.”

According to officials, the recovered drug was of very high quality and would fetch a good price.

“The accused got high quality cannabis for around Rs 1 lakh and would sell it at ten times the price. In places where the availability is less, the cost would be even higher,” added the official. Both the accused were arrested in Jaipur. They are being questioned further.

Jaipur police also arrested three people from different parts of the city and seized approximately 5kg marijuana. The accused were arrested from Sanganer and Muhana police stations areas. Bunty Bairwa was arrested from Sanganer police station area with 2.5kg of marijuana who during questioning said he got the narcotics from Tonk and supplied it in Jaipur. In Muhana, Radheshyam and Satyanarayan were caught with the remaining quantity. Since October last year, city police has registered 238 cases and arrested 285 people for dealing in narcotics.

Jacobite faction members protest after Orthodox faction arrived with police to take over St Stephen’s Church o... Read More

KOCHI: St Stephen’s Church at Koothattukulam was taken over by the Orthodox faction on Saturday amid high drama as the Jacobite faction protested when the Orthodox faction arrived with police protection to ‘conduct holy mass’ in the morning.

Earlier, the high court had issued an order to provide police cover to the Orthodox faction to conduct prayers at the church. Police used force to control the unruly protesters and 23 of them were arrested and removed from the church’s premises.

The Jacobite faction condemned the police action. “The act of authorities and the police of evicting a Ramban (a senior priest), priests and devotees from their place of worship and cutting open the lock of the church is denial of justice. It is inhumane,” said the Jacobite faction in a statement.

“Most of the faithful, belonging to the church, are Jacobites and the church was taken over and given to the minority (around 10 families) belonging to the Orthodox faction,” said Jacobite faction members.

The Orthodox faction entered the church and conducted holy mass after police removed the protesters. “No devotee was forced out. Only those who were creating a ruckus and protested against the observance of prayers at the place of worship were removed by the police,” said Fr John Abraham Konnatt of Orthodox church.

“Maccabi (Malankara Action Council for Church Act bill implementation) and Kerala Christian Reformation Movement (KCRM) members also took part in the protest. Implementing the Church Act as it is only the long-term solution,” said Indulekha Joseph of KCRM.

It was on Tuesday that the high court ordered the government to provide police protection so that the Orthodox faction can conduct religious rituals as per the Supreme Court judgement issued in this regard. Earlier, Orthodox faction had returned after facing protest from Jacobite parishioners, when they arrived to implement the order at St Stephen’s Church. Yuhanon Ramban of Piramadam Dayara church, director of Maccabi was also arrested and removed from the spot.

96,['16/02/2020'],Commissioner set to take charge of BMC after council term ends on Feb 18,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Bhopal: The tenure of Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) elected council ends on February 18. With elections to the civic body some time away, the state government would be required to appoint an administrator till such time the new council is in place.

The administrator will have his work cut out to manoeuvre the cash-strapped civic body in the next few months. Sources indicate that it could be a few months, before civic body polls are held.

As per municipal rules, divisional commissioner is expected to become the administrator, said top government officials.

Bhopal is also a part of smart cities mission and land monetisation for smart city development is expected to take place in the next few weeks. Government plans to raise over Rs 10,000 crore from private participation and lease of land along TT Nagar. The area based development (ADB) under smart city in the area is planned in 350 acre.

Action on Swachh Bharat mission, which includes completion of solid waste management and disposal at Adampur Chhwani along with construction of new abattoir facility, as per NGT orders would also be a priority. “We did our best. Some of the directives were to be met by urban development department,” said outing mayor, Alok Shamra.

“We are prepared to take the failures of the BJP-led BMC council to the public. There are numerous scams that have taken place while several public interest projects delayed. Handover of 350 colonies could not be accomplished, master plan roads could not be completed and the new master plan could not be implemented,” said local Congress leader, Girish Sharma.

In the current council, BJP enjoyed a two-third majority. Now, the ruling Congress government is expected to pace the development in the state capital ahead of local body elections in 85 wards. Another issue pending, which has been challenged in court is the division of BMC into two municipal councils, said political observers.

Over the last five years, while there has been a separate surcharge on waste collection, property tax was not increased. Over the past two weeks, senior state government officials have already sought a report on supply of piped water during summers. With bountiful monsoon last year, supply of uninterrupted water could prove to be a boon for the Congress government.

Development of metro rail in Bhopal along with proposed addition of new public transport buses are expected to gain momentum in the coming months.

97,['16/02/2020'],Fire erupts as shopkeeper ‘tests’ cracker,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Jaipur: Around seven shops located in the Indira Market of the Walled City were gutted in a devastating fire on Saturday afternoon.

The fire broke out in a cracker shop in the area and in no time engulfed the nearby structures. Around 21 fire tenders were pressed to douse the flames. The crew battled hard for four hours to control the fire.

Chief fire officer (CFO) Jagdish Phulwari, said, “The fire was controlled in time, otherwise it could have been bigger as shops are adjoined in the narrow market. No causalty was reported during the operation. Our team member Naveen Kumar was injured but is now stable. A total of 21 fire tenders made three rounds during the operation.”

The incident occurred around 12.30pm. There was widespread panic as soon as the inferno raged through the shutter with thousands of visitors, who thronged the market, running helter-skelter. Though, officials have not ascertained the cause of fire, eyewitnesses claimed it erupted due to the carelessness of the cracker shop owner. Rashid Khan, who works in a nearby shop, said, “The owner was testing a party cracker. The spark fell on other crackers which led to the incident.”

Cops cordoned off the area to keep spectators at bay. However, many a times the tenders struggled to reached on the spot as vehicles were parked haphazardly. A fire tender also hit an ambulance parked in the middle of the lane while rushing to the spot.

Shopkeepers alleged that there are more cracker shops in the area and administration has turned a blind eye towards them. A shopkeeper, on condition of anonymity, said, “Right next to my shop there is an influential cracker shop owner. This is a market for garments and not explosive items. Despite several complaints no action has been taken as officers claim he has licence to sell crackers.”

Phulwari, however, said, “The cracker shop owner where the fire occured did not take any NOC from JMC. We will take action against the remaining shopkeepers of the area.”

98,['16/02/2020'],First-time MP is new BJP chief in MP,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh BJP has got a new party president — first-time MP V D Sharma. Like Rakesh Singh before him, 49-year-old Sharma emerged as the dark horse as seniors like Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Rakesh Singh and Narottam Mishra were overlooked.

The announcement on Saturday took most of the party rank and file by surprise, say sources. One of the youngest leaders to be made state party president, Sharma is known to be a go-getter and joined BJP in 2013.

It’s believed Sharma was elevated over other big names being considered for the post during RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s weeklong trip to Bhopal earlier this month.

A former ABVP national general secretary, he has the full backing of RSS but doesn’t have a base yet in the state BJP. In fact, a section of BJP workers had burned his effigies when he was named party candidate from Khajuraho for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but he won.Despite initial opposition from within, he won by 5 lakh votes. The coming civic election is his first challenge. Sharma, who hails from Morena in MP, is an MSc in agriculture.He started with ABVP and has been in active politics for almost 32 years, recognized as a grass roots Brahmin leader in MP. He has studied pollution in Narmada and filed a case with NGT.

With Sharma being handed the party reins, the Madhya Pradesh BJP unit now has Brahmins in two key posts — the other being leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava.

Sharma thanked PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda for giving “a normal party worker like him” responsibility of the party in the state. On the Kamal Nath government, he said: “Is sarkar ki eint se eint baja dange.”

Chief minister Kamal Nath congratulated Sharma and tweeted: “I hope to get his cooperation for development, progress and welfare of people of the state.”

Greetings poured in for Sharma. State BJP leaders, including Chouhan, congratulated Sharma. Party sources say Chouhan, a former state party chief, was considered a strong candidate for the post yet again, and that he wanted one of his trusted lieutenants, like Bhupendra Singh or Rajendra Shukla, to get the post. Rakesh Singh said he is happy that state party unit is getting a “young and dynamic leader”. “I was informed by the party in advance,” he added.

In Singh’s tenure, BJP lost power in 2018 after ruling MP for 15 years and bounced back with a stunning sweep of the Lok Sabha polls less than six months later, winning 28 of 29 seats in the state. By appointing a young state president, BJP seems to be moving ahead with its plan to prepare a new line of leadership. In the recent appointment of ‘mandal’ heads, the party stuck to leaders below 40 years of age and district presidents cannot be above 50.

Sources say Sharma will constitute his new team, unlike his predecessor who did not make any changes in the state organizational structure after his appointment in April 2018. Rakesh Singh, a trusted lieutenant of Amit Shah, was trying for a second term and had organised a grand pro-CAA rally in his Lok Sabha constituency, Jabalpur, last month which was attended by Amit Shah. However, sources in BJP say he lost out because it was perceived that he had not been able to corner the Congress government in MP, couldn’t create a wave in favour of CAA and NRC in the state, and neither could he stem the scores of resignations by minority community members from the party.

One of the biggest embarrassments for Singh was the voting of two BJP MLAs with Congress in assembly in July 2019, which took the party completely by surprise. Despite the setbacks, Singh was confident his tenure may continue till the civic polls in October. Party sources say he will now be accommodated in the Centre.

Mhow: In a suspected honour killing, a 17-year-old girl was forced to drink pesticide and her throat was slit by a cousin, at the instance of her father, because she refused to end her relationship with a boy from another caste, police in MP’s Dhar said on Saturday.

The girl’s body was found beside Satghata Nullah near the tourist destination of Mandu, about 90km from Indore, on February 7. For the first five days, police struggled to identify the victim. Then, informers tipped them off that a schoolgirl was missing from missing from Patliyapura village, about 25km from where the body was found.

Police met the family, asked them why they hadn’t filed a missing person’s report, and took back a picture of the missing girl. It matched with the murder victim and she was identified as Roshni, a Class 12 student.

During investigation, police found that her family was furious with her for having a relationship with a boy from a different caste in the same village. The girl was a Bhil, and the boy is from Bhilala community. He, too, is a minor.

“Roshni’s father Ishwar Singh broke down during interrogation and confessed that he conspired to kill her. He asked Roshni’s cousin Mukesh and his friend Prithvi to murder her and dispose the body after she refused to break up with the boy,” said Dhar SP Aditya Pratap Singh.

On February 6, Mukesh and Prithvi took Roshni to Mandu in a car on the pretext of sightseeing. While returning, they force-fed her pesticides, rendering her unconscious, the SP said. “They stuffed her in the boot of the car and drove towards Satghata Nullah, where Mukesh slit her throat with a knife. The body was dumped on the roadside,” he added.

Police arrested all three on Friday. They were produced in court on Saturday and remanded in jail.

Embright Infotech members who developed Auticare (extended reality)

Thiruvananthapuram: A crowded shopping mall could be an autistic kid’s worst nightmare. Imagine a therapist gently guiding the child through the mall where he/she doesn’t feel threatened or disturbed by fellow shoppers. This is one among the various scenarios Auticare , an extended reality (XR), artificial intelligence-based assistive technology developed by Technopark-based startup Embright Infotech , could provide to help children with autism-spectrum disorders manage life situations.

Auticare has helped the firm land the central department of science and technology’s highest innovation grant of Rs 50 lakh.

Embright, which specializes in virtual reality, augmented reality, internet of things and artificial intelligence (AI), is one of 15 companies to bag the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIRAC BIG15).

This is the third governmental recognition for the firm, which had earlier cornered KSIDC’s entrepreneurial development fund and Nidhi Prayas grant. In 2019, Embright was one of 20 firms that reached the fourth round of BIRAC BIG14.

Founded in 2017 by A R Sathyanarayanan and Bobin Chandra, Embright has associated with the Kerala social security mission. “Auticare is being used in 12 therapy clinics under the social security mission. It helps with cognitive, social and self-care skills of autistic children through assistive technology based on XR and AI,” Sathyanarayanan, chief executive, told TOI.

He said Auticare was inspired by his mother, who has a PhD in clinical linguistics.

Jaipur: Much-awaited Right to Health Bill, which was announced by Raghu Sharma when he took over as health minister after winning the assembly elections, might be tabled in the ongoing budget session. The Bill was part of election manifesto of the Congress.

Though the health department has been preparing it for quite some time but the draft was yet to take the final shape. However, senior health department officials said that they are not sure that it will be tabled in the ongoing assembly session.

By bringing the Act, the state government is aiming to provide treatment to the most underprivileged person of the state.

The health department has taken help of the NGOs, working in health sector, for preparing the draft of the Bill. The NGOs have come out with their own draft framework for the Bill which was thoroughly discussed and submitted to the government. Chhaya Pachauli, a health rights activist, said that the draft essentially consists of three key sections which includes roles and obligations of the health department and the service providers, the rights of the users/patients and the implementation and monitoring mechanisms.

She said that the Act would ensure that the state is obligated to make sure that the right to access to quality health services and other underlying determinants of health, such as sanitation and food, is assured to everyone in the state and that the government takes adequate measures to ensure the same.

“While states like Assam and Kerala do have Public Health Acts in place, there’s no state which has yet introduced a Right to Health Act. Rajasthan, if it brings about this Act, would be the first one to do so and this would be a major step ahead towards meeting the goal of universal healthcare,” she said.

The NGOs have for long been advocating for a Right to Health Act to be brought about in the state.

103,['16/02/2020'],Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar wants two-tier flyovers on PMRDA’s Metro corridor,"The University flyover in Shivajinagar

TimesView The proposal is shocking to say the least, and will lead to a massive wastage of public money. Pune city has already suffered due to a lack of long-term and scientific planning, not to mention misguided designs for flyovers. There is a complete lack of continuity, when it comes to traffic and transportation issues. The comprehensive mobility plan has become a mere showpiece and politicians rush in with new plans to show that they are doing some work. Citizens will have to join forces to foil such fancy ideas if they want to prevent further hardships and wastage of money through demolition and reconstruction of the flyovers.

New line’s report submitted

PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has directed Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) to explore the possibility of a two-tier flyovers — comprising a vehicular thoroughfare and a Metro viaduct — at three key junctions in the city.PMRDA is developing the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar corridor of the Pune Metro rail project. If implemented, the proposal would entail the demolition of the existing flyovers at University Chowk , E-Square Chowk and RBI Chowk.The proposal calls for the flyover and the Metro viaduct to come up on the same pillars, along the lines of the double-decker flyover coming up at Nal Stop on Karve Road.So far, the authorities had considered the possibility of maintaining the existing University flyover and construct the elevated Metro line above it.Sources in the state government told TOI that with the 2022 deadline for all the Metro lines to become operational, Pawar’s fresh directive could cause a delay and also increase the project cost by over Rs600 crore. “These flyovers were constructed between 2007-10. Their demolition would put a huge burden on state exchequer,” a senior government official said.As per the agreement between the project executor and PMRDA signed last September, March-end was the date for the financial closure of the project, within three years of which the project must be completed. “Demolishing the flyover and re-constructing a two-tier structure would extend the operational period by two more years. This would be a violation of the agreement,” a source said.Meanwhile, transport experts from the city have opposed the construction of the Metro lines with flyovers. “Why give the option of taking out one’s private vehicle when there is a Metro line on the same route?” one expert said.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has submitted the initial project report for the proposed 18km elevated Shivajinagar-Shewalwadi Metro corridor. PMRDA officials said DMRC would soon ready the detailed project report (DPR).",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74158254,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-310827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-wants-2-tier-flyovers-on-pmrdas-metro-corridor/articleshow/74154986.cms

Jaipur: City police will file the chargesheet in the mother-son murder case in Pratap Nagar before the end of this month with the cops claiming that the investigation is nearly complete.

Shweta and her 18-month-old son were murdered on January 7. Three days later, her husband Rohit and his friend Saurabh Chaudhary were arrested. Both are currently in judicial custody.

“The investigation is nearly complete and it would not be long before we file the chargesheet in the case. We have enough evidence for a strong case against the two including scientific and digital proof,” a police officer said.

Though the FSL report is yet to come, officials claimed that its finding can be added in the chargesheet later.

Following the arrests, police had constituted a special team to frame the chargesheet in the double murder case which had sent shock waves across the city.

Rohit had paid Saurabh Rs 20,000 for the murders and had promised to pay more once the crime was executed.

During the investigation, cops also hinted at the possibility that the two actually had a pact to kill each other’s spouses due to marital discord.

While Shweta’s body was found in her house, the son’s body was found in the forest area just across the boundary wall of the residential complex where the family resided.

Saurabh had hit Shweta multiple times on the head with a blunt object before slitting her throat. He used the same weapon on the infant and strangled him to be doubly sure of the death.

Police caught up to him when he was seen leaving the house with the baby’s body in the neighbour’s CCTV camera. When the two accused were brought in front of each other, they confessed to the crime.

Nagpur: The Maharashtra forest department will showcase its tiger conservation efforts at the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) to Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP-13) at Gandhinagar, Gujarat , between February 15 and 22, 2020.

The conference is being attended by representatives from 130 parties, including ministers from various countries, international inter-government and civil society organizations, experts, state governments among others.

As part of CMS-COP 13, side events, exhibitions, high level panel discussions have been organized for showcasing India’s diversity of ecosystems, landscapes and key conservation initiatives taken in the country for wildlife and habitat.

To conserve and protect migratory species, an international convention under the aegis of the United Nation’s Environment Programme — Convention on Migratory Species (CMS)’ is in force.

Presently, there are 130 parties to the CMS. It provides a global platform for conservation of migratory species, their habitats and migration routes. It brings together the states through which migratory animals pass the range states and lays the legal foundation for internationally coordinated conservation measures throughout a migratory range.

AHMEDABAD: With several delegates from the US and from across India visiting Ahmedabad for the ‘Namaste President Trump’ event, most 4-star and five-star hotels in Ahmedabad are operating at 100% occupancy on February 23 and 24. Apart from the Trump trip , the peak wedding season, and the movement of business travellers will boost hotel occupancy.

“Several rooms have been booked for the delegates arriving for the US president’s event,” said the spokesperson of Renaissance Ahmedabad Hotel. “Because of the wedding season, several rooms were booked in advance. Our hotel has been completely sold out on February 23 and 24.”

Subhrajit Bardhan, the general manager of DoubleTree By Hilton, Ahmedabad, said: “The US Embassy has blocked 80 rooms at our hotel and delegates will start arriving from February 22.” Corporate events and the wedding season have kept the hotel nearly full, Bardhan said. “We’re left with a handful of rooms for both days and it is expected that they will be sold out,” Bardhan said.

“Our hotel was fully booked even before the US president’s visit was confirmed, since this is the peak season for corporate events and weddings,” said Sonika Chaturvedi, the general manager of Courtyard by Marriott.

The presidential suite along with other rooms have been blocked for the US president and the first lady at Hyatt Regency on Ashram Road, sources said.

AAI chairman Arvind Singh inaugurates the departure hall on Saturday

JAIPUR: In a move to de-congest the Jaipur airport during rush hour, the Airport Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur has started a new departure hall in an area of 2,700 square metre. The new hall has eight check-in counters, extra washrooms and other passenger’s amenities.

AAI chairman Arvind Singh inaugurated the departure hall on Saturday.

However, various airlines are yet to open their counters due to technical glitches. According to sources, 3.9 million passengers had travelled from Jaipur airport from January to December 2019.

While speaking reporters, Singh said, “On the instructions of the Union government, the AAI started the process of privatizing six airports in the country. For this a memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has also been signed on Friday for the privatization of Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangaluru airports.”

However, AAI is awaiting the final approval for the privatization of other three airports, including Jaipur, Guwahati and Trivandrum.

On the new departure hall, director (AAI), Jaipur, Jaideep Singh Balhara, said, “We have got eight new check-in counters and the passengers would be able to go for boarding through escalators. New facilities for drinking water and washrooms have been added for the passengers in the new hall. The new hall has also been connected to the existing departure hall. It has also been connected to the boarding gate number 2 and 3 on the second floor.”

With the boarding gate attached to the new hall, passengers will also have the option of going directly to the flight.

Apart from airport director, all heads of departments, CISF commandant Y P Singh and representatives of airlines were also present at the launch event.

New check-in counters have been installed in the new departure hall without any connection with SITA software needed to issue boarding pass. Currently, no airlines have started its operations in the new departure hall. “We will start this in next couple of days,” said Jaideep Singh Balhara, director (AAI), Jaipur.

Panaji: In a bid to propagate cinnamon farming in the state, ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI) will be providing specialised cinnamon processing training.

“There is good scope for cinnamon cultivation, especially since the condiment is very good for those with diabetes and blood pressure,” ICAR-CCARI director EB Chakurkar said.

He said the cinnamon available in the market – the thick-bark-type Acacia variety – is not always of good quality. The variety grown by ICAR meanwhile is a thin-bark variety which attracts anywhere between Rs 800 to 1000 per kg. “It is a pure form of cinnamon that can be grown easily as an intercrop. We can train farmers to grow and process it,” he said.

Chakurkar said farmers can directly sell the same to the Goa Bagayatdar, thus avoiding involvement of middlemen. “But farmers must come forward, themselves. Cinnamon is a slow growing crop. If farmers are interested, we can help,” he said.

ICAR itself has nearly 100 cinnamon plants growing on its Old Goa property.

111,['16/02/2020'],Additional toll booths at lanes at Khed-Shivapur toll plaza,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Pune: The Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram has directed the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to build additional toll booths and lanes at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza to ease congestion.

The first phase of the work at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza would be completed by February 25 and the next phase would be completed by March 31.

New deadlines were set, post a meeting held on Friday evening, for the work on the Pune-Satara stretch to be completed. The road repairs and construction of the necessary bridges will be completed by the end of March. The concessionaire Reliance Infrastructure will complete the remaining work by the end of May.

In the meeting, the NHAI and the concessionaire assured to speed up the repair works.

The work of increasing the toll booths from Satara to Pune will be completed first by February 25. Internet services too would be strengthened in the area to enable FASTag services, the collector said.

The NHAI officials who attended the meeting told TOI that the necessary instructions were given to the concessionaire. “The contractor Reliance Infrastructure has assured us that all the road work will be completed as per the new deadlines,” Suhas Chitnis, the project director of NHAI, said.

Amit Bhatia, the regional head of the west region of Reliance Infrastucture said that five additional booths and lanes from Satara to Pune would be added to the existing 10 lanes to ease down the traffic congestion on weekends. The three additional booths to the existing 10 lanes towards Satara were expected to be operational by March 31.

He said additional manpower of 30 personnel would be deployed on weekends with hand held machines to issue tickets while waiting in the lane. The vehicles would be able to cross the toll plaza by showing the receipt.

The concessionaire also agreed to complete work for the bridge at Dhangewadi and Verve by March 31, while the balance work including street lights (proposed as per concession agreement) and service road (where land is free of encumbrances) would be completed by May 31.

While earlier there was a discussion about shifting the toll both, a government source said it was not feasible as the concession agreement with Reliance Infrastructure was done for a period of 24 years (2010-2034) and the toll booths were constructed accordingly. “If the toll booths are to be shifted, they have to adhere to the guidelines of 60km distance between two toll booths and the state government would have to bear all the shifting charges,” a senior government official said.

The Baramati MP Supriya Sule and MLA Sangram Thopte in the past led protests to close the toll plaza, which have become a major obstacle for commuters because of the traffic congestion. In December, the Pune collector had declared the route unsafe and even called for a halt on toll collection because of the large-scale protests.

Fresh target-completion dates were set. But, nothing concrete transpired. In the same month, the Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari held a meeting with NHAI officials and yet no decision was taken on the cancellation of the toll.

PUNE: Following a court order, the Shivajinagar police have booked a city-based builder and two others for cheating a 32-year-old man from Wadgaon Budruk to the tune of Rs2.5 lakh.

The victim had booked a flat in a building, which was supposed to come up in Paud, in 2015.

The police on Friday registered the offence under charges of cheating and breach of criminal trust.

Assistant inspector Somnath Padsalkar, who is investigating the case, told TOI that Ananda Patil had approached the court, which directed police to take action.

In 2015, Padsalkar said, the builder claimed that he was starting a low-cost housing project in Paud, about 30km from here. He advertised a 1BHK flat for Rs16.5 lakh.

“After seeing the advertisement, Patil, who works in a small company, visited the builder’s office and paid Rs2.5 lakh via cheque and cash,” he said.

Recently, Patil visited the Paud to see the upcoming project. On reaching the spot, he realized that the builder has not undertaken any construction activity there. Patil then visited the builder’s office and demanded a refund of his booking amount, police said.

“The builder initially promised to return the amount, but then started evading Patil, who then approached the court,” Padsalkar said.

Ahead of the visit of US president Donald Trump to the city, police has begun a drive to check if property owners have carried out police verification before renting out houses to tenants in Chandkheda, Motera and other areas. These areas are close to Motera stadium, which will be inaugurated by the US President on February 24.

DCP SOG Harshad Patel said they conduct such drives periodically, but because of Trump’s visit to the city, they have intensified these actions across the city. “In Chandkheda on Friday we booked four property owners for renting out houses without informing the nearest police station. We booked them under Section 188 of IPC for violation of a notification of the police commissioner, which had mandated that house owner inform the nearest police station before allowing tenants to move in,” added Patel.

Patel said they registered a case against Bhavik Parikh of Kalapinagar at Chandkheda police station who had rented his house in Divya Kunj Bungalows to Jignesh Parmar for a monthly rent of Rs 600 and had not informed police about it.

“Police also booked Mayur Patel of Hebatpur, for renting his house to Vipul Thakore without informing police. A case was also registered against Nimesh Patel of Vadodara, who rented his house to one Priya Patel for a monthly rent of Rs 5,000 and did not provide any identity proof of the tenant to police. The fourth case was against Amiben Shah of Shahpur who had rented her house to Bharatkumar Shah for Rs 5,000 and did not inform the nearest police station about. All four tenants were living in the same society,” added Patel. SOG sources said their drive will be more aggressive till Trump’s visit is over.

116,['16/02/2020'],Wagholi residents expect quick fix to garbage issue,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Pune: Wagholi residents are hopeful of a quick solution to the long-standing garbage problem after their recent meeting with district guardian minister Ajit Pawar who has asked the zilla parishad and local gram panchayat to draw up a detailed plan on garbage management for the area.

The gram panchayat swung into action after Pawar’s review meeting. It initiated steps to distribute garbage bins to every household in Wagholi to segregate wet and dry waste. There is a plan to deploy 15 vans for daily collection of garbage.

Until now, the residents, especially from housing societies in Wagholi, handed over the garbage to a contractor as the gram panchayat collected waste only from gaothan areas, leaving out housing societies which had no choice but to appoint private contractors to collect the garbage. The gram panchayat will collect waste henceforth.

An official from the gram panchayat said that there are 27,000 households registered with the administration. The distribution of two bins to every household---one each for dry and wet garbage—is about to start. The gram panchayat has 15 vans, which will operate on designated routes in six wards to collect garbage. The housing societies have been told to set up units to treat wet garbage within their premises. Many societies have already commissioned such units. The gram panchayat will primarily collect dry garbage, an official said.

The official added that Wagholi generates about 50 tonnes of garbage every day. The administration does not have a processing plant to treat all garbage. A contractor has been appointed to collect and transport the waste till the new processing plants become functional.

Three plants are expected to come up at Wagholi which will cater to the waste from six wards. The gram panchayat has already demanded spaces to commission the processing units.

Meanwhile, Pawar asked the Zilla Parishad and gram panchayat to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) on garbage management. The gram panchayat has said that the DPR is expected to be ready in the next few days.

Nitin Kumar Jain of Wagholi Housing Societies Association said that the residents are hoping for a concrete solution to the garbage issue after meeting the guardian minister. He said that the gram panchayat and zilla parishad need to be proactive in setting up garbage processing plants and keep a tab on open burning of garbage.

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Saturday demanded a comprehensive inquiry into the findings of the report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) with regards to the police department. The opposition leader alleged that an organized loot is going on in the police department under state police chief Loknath Behera with the clear knowledge of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

“A comprehensive inquiry should be conducted, which can also cover the period when UDF was in the power. Even during the time when UDF was in power, Behera was the ADGP in charge of funds for modernization of police force,” Chennithala said. Let there be a CBI probe, he suggested. Chennithala said that chief secretary Tom Jose using the vehicle purchased by the state police chief is unusual, and alleged that “the chief secretary has also connived with the state police chief in the loot”.

The opposition leader said that the Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS) launched by the state police and Keltron is a high-level corruption in which a company named Galaxon, which has no previous experience in any similar initiatives anywhere in the country, is also a part. He demanded that a “probe should uncover the real people behind the company Galaxon, which has just a paid up capital of Rs 10 lakhs and has no previous experience in such projects”. He demanded that the government should give a clarification if the two directors of the company had earlier been blacklisted by the ministry of corporate affairs.

Chennithala said that despite the police explaining that the missing of 25 Insas rifles were only a clerical mistake, the CAG’s audit team had conducted inspection at the police chief store and examined the rifles before reaching at its final conclusion that the rifles are indeed missing. Regarding the diversion of funds meant for construction of subordinate police officers’ quarters, the opposition leader said that in 2015, when he was the home minister, the funds were sanctioned for Kerala Police Housing and Construction Corporation (KPHCC) for building the quarters, but in 2017, the funds were provided as supplementary grants, which cannot happen without the knowledge of the chief minister. The CAG had said in the audit report that the funds were then utilized to construct villas for the state police chief and ADGPs. Chennithala said that the vehicles for senior officers were being purchased using the funds for modernization, while the actual guidelines do not allow such a purchase. He added that during his tenure as home minister, the government had sanctioned Rs 40 crore from the Plan funds for vehicle purchase, so that the MoPF funds are not diverted for such purpose.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: K Surendran has been appointed as the new state president of BJP. Party national president J P Nadda announced the appointment of Surendran through a press statement in New Delhi on Saturday.

The post of party state president has been lying vacant ever since former president P S Sreedharan Pillai was appointed as Mizoram governor in October last year. The appointment of Surendran comes after much deliberations between the national leadership and senior party leaders in Kerala . The new president will choose his team soon.

Known as the trusted lieutenant of Union minister V Muraleedharan, Surendran was considered to the party chief post in 2018 too when Kummanam Rajasekharan demitted the office. But, he missed the same by a whisker then, mainly due to the resistance from RSS and former state president P K Krishnadas.

Surendran started his political career as a worker of ABVP and rose through the ranks. He had been serving the party as one of its state general secretaries since 2009. His active role in the Sabarimala agitation against the entry of women made him the face of BJP during Sabarimala agitation. He was jailed for 22 days during the stir.

In his first response, Surendran said: “The delay in the announcement of new party state president must be due to the time it took for completing the organisational election process. It doesn’t mean that the announcement got delayed due to any dispute. There is only one group in Kerala and that’s BJP core group. The party is not person centric. I would like to lead the party as a single unit, with the support and cooperation of all.”

Known as the trusted lieutenant of Union minister V Muraleedharan, Surendran was considered to the party chief post in 2018 too when Kummanam Rajasekharan demitted the office. But, he missed the same by a whisker then, mainly due to the resistance from RSS and former state president P K Krishnadas.

Surendran started his political career as a worker of ABVP and rose through the ranks. He had been serving the party as one of its state general secretaries since 2009. His active role in the Sabarimala agitation against the entry of women made him the face of BJP during Sabarimala agitation. He was jailed for 22 days during the stir.

In his first response, Surendran said: “The delay in the announcement of new party state president must be due to the time it took for completing the organisational election process. It doesn’t mean that the announcement got delayed due to any dispute. There is only one group in Kerala and that’s BJP core group. The party is not person centric. I would like to lead the party as a single unit, with the support and cooperation of all.”

Ahmedabad: US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not spend more than 15 minutes at the Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram on February 24. US consulate representatives, a team from India’s external affairs ministry, and officials of the Gujarat tourism department conducted a detailed review of the ashram premises on Saturday. A temporary stage has been set up at the ashram between Magan Niwas and the prayer ground on the stairs to the ghats leading to the riverfront. There, the two world leaders will stop for a brief photo call. The leaders will then proceed to the Motera stadium. A senior government official said, “President Trump will garland the picture of the Mahatma at Hriday Kunj.

122,['16/02/2020'],Sunday clean-up date for Pashan residents,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Pune: Sunday morning is clean-up time for Pashan residents, especially those living in the vicinity of Shivalay Society.

For an hour starting 7:15 am, they clean the internal road and surrounding areas leading to Sai Chowk armed with masks, glows and trash bags.

What started as a one-day event by a housing society to mark the 71st Republic Day has now become a weekly affair for the neighbourhood.

It was last month when a message to residents to join a clean-up drive of rivers started doing the rounds on society Whatsapp groups. Rajesh Deshpande, a researcher, saw the message and thought of joining the initiative. “But then I thought about my own neighbourhood. In gated communities, the act of cleaning up takes place inside the compound, but nobody cares about the roads outside. Plastic and other waste lie strewn on roadside and these get washed down the river, polluting waterbodies.”

Deshpande floated the idea of a clean-up in the neighbourhood to mark the Republic Day celebration. Soon others from the Neha Apartments joined in. “On January 26, all of us cleaned the internal road area near our society till Sai Chowk on Sus Road. All of us toiled for an hour. When we saw how clean the area looked, we all felt very happy. Soon, we started thinking of doing this once a month and then decided to do it every Sunday,” he said.

However, there was a dip in enthusiasm the next Sunday and the numbers also came down. “I knew the momentum needed to be maintained for the programme to be a success and hence wrote a circular, urging people from other societies to join the movement. I went from society to society with this circular hoping that more people will turn up,” said Deshpande.

The next Sunday (February 9), three more people from other societies turned up. One of them was 66-year-old Umesh Gupta, a retired government official. “When I received the circular, being the secretary of a society, I circulated it to all members. We keep making noises about poor hygiene in our neighbourhood, but nobody takes any initiative to do anything. When I saw that someone was doing it, I wanted to help. I went on a clean-up drive along with members from other societies. I plan to do it every week,” said Gupta.

123,['16/02/2020'],Former state forest boss launches memoir about Melghat days,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Pune: Prakash Thosre, who had overseen the state’s forest department as the principal chief conservator of forests, recalled the forest range in Melghat in Amravati as one of its kind in terms of wildlife reserves and protected areas.

He was speaking at the launch ceremony of his memoir, “The Melghat Trail”, on Saturday. The event was attended by state home minister Anil Deshmukh.

“There are a few areas in Melghat which is covered by fog during the monsoon season. Patrolling during that time meant that my team and I had to be very alert for bear attacks,” Thosre said, while displaying a slideshow on about his years in the Melghat forest range.

Thosre said that several issues continue to plague Melghat, which is a protected tiger reserve. “Most notable of these is the land encroachment issue. The British started a logging industry in the forest range and encroachments have since been rife,” he said.

The guest for the evening, the state home minister Anil Deshmukh, echoed Thosre while recalling the origins of Project Tiger, the extensive tiger conservation initiative launched by the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to arrest the huge decline in India’s tiger population. Deshmukh, whose home constituency is not too far from Melghat, used to accompany Thosre on many forest patrols and inspections, the latter recalled.

“Back in the day, hunting tigers was a big deal for many of the royal families in that area. Some kings ended up killing thousands of tigers because hunting was legal. But after Indira Gandhi launched Project Tiger, the number of tigers increased. In Vidarbha, there are now six tiger projects within a 200km radius,” Deshmukh added.

G Kishan Reddy and K Laxman take a Metro ride from JBS to MGBS post a review meeting

HYDERABAD: Blaming both ruling TRS and AIMIM for not completing Metro Rail connectivity, Telangana BJP leaders alleged that TRS government has been dancing to the tunes of AIMIM and as a result, people of Old City are being deprived of Metro.

The leaders demanded that government extend Metro connectivity to all corners of the city such as Alwal, ECIL and Kompally apart from completing MMTS phase II at the earliest.

Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy held a review meeting with Hyderabad Metro Rail Ltd (HMRL) and L&T officials on Saturday. Later, he travelled from JBS to MGBS with BJP state president K Laxman and other leaders.

Kishan said had Metro connectivity been provided to Old City, the face of the Old City would have changed. He said people were complaining about high ticket rates and parking problems.

He took strong objection to inaugurating the Metro stretch from JBS to MGBS during Parliament session and not following protocols. The Union minister said though the project was taken up with help from Centre, the Prime Minister’s picture was not used at the inaugural.

Kishan said the government had sanctioned Rs 1,200 crore viability gap funding to Metro Rail project and the balance Rs 250 crore would be released soon.

On MMTS phase II, the Secunderabad MP said the Centre had released works for MMTS phase II to take it up to Yadadri, but state government has not released its share. Laxman said though Metro project was completed, footpaths, service roads and parking lots were not completed in several places.

Ahmedabad: Travelling out of Ahmedabad from the city airport on February 24? It is likely that your journey may not be a smooth one. US president Donald Trump is coming here on the same day and there’s a strong buzz that passenger aircraft movements on Monday may be impacted. More than 250 flight movements are handled at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad on a daily basis.

Travel agents are also concerned over bookings made by customers. “Several artists, who are coming from different parts of the country for the grand welcome for the US president, will arrive a day in advance on February 23,” said Manish Sharma, secretary, Travel Agents’ Federation of India, Gujarat chapter.

While there is no official confirmation about flight movements being affected, there is a buzz that the city may be declared a no-fly zone on February 24 with temporary flight restrictions put in place.

“No decision has been taken regarding rescheduling, diverting or cancellation of flight movements as yet,” said Manoj Gangal, director, SVPI airport.

Even airlines confirmed that they have not received any such information from the airport authorities. A well-placed source said that just like a notice to airmen (NOTAM) warning is issued to prevent landings and take-offs of aircraft on January 26 in Delhi for about two hours, similar measures may be put in place for the visit of the US president.

Thiruvananthapuram: A panel discussion on Japanese culture , art , literature and cinema was held as part of the ‘ Discover Japan ’ event at Ayyankali Hall on Saturday. Organised by the district centre of the alumni society of AOTS (Association of Overseas Technical Cooperation for Sustainable Partnership) in collaboration with Japan’s ministry for foreign affairs, the three-day festival will conclude on Sunday.

Sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman said people should learn from the Japanese, their culture and development.

“One can understand Asian culture through Japan. I had an opportunity to visit Japan in 1982. I found the Japanese people friendly and very helpful. Japan gives equal importance to culture and science. Despite all the resources, we are not developed as other countries. This is because we imitate other cultures. In Japan, people live in harmony with nature,” said Kunhiraman.

He went on to explain how artists such as Van Gogh were inspired by Japanese prints and their influence on art and world cinema.

K S Ravikumar, pro vice-chancellor of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, said the works of Malayalam writers and Japanese literature share many features.

“The short poems of Kunjunni Mash can be compared to haiku, a traditional form of Japanese poetry consisting of three lines. But, Kunjunni Mash had said that he was not aware of the Japanese form. More than art and culture, it is the industries and products of Japan that people here know more about. Japan created a model for enterprises and the country emerged as a phoenix after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed during World War II. During the war, left ideologues opposed Japan, considering it a fascist force,” said Ravikumar.

Pradeep Panangad, media advocacy coordinator at Institute for Sustainable Development and Governance, moderated the session.

130,['16/02/2020'],Early signs often ignored in paediatric cancer,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Visakhapatnam: In contrast to cancers that develop in adults, the treatment of children with cancer poses several challenges on account of lack of paediatric oncology specialists, difficulty in prevention due to the genetic origin of these cancers and low awareness of detecting early symptoms.

On International Childhood Cancer Day on February 15, oncologists said that while not common, around 1 per cent of all new cancer cases in a year are paediatric cancer.

In children, the most common incidences of cancer are acute lymphoblastic leukamia (ALL) or blood cancer, which accounts for about 40 per cent of cases, followed by brain tumour (30 per cent).

“Carcinoma of the bone, lymphoma or lymph nodes, Wilms tumour (kidney) and neuroblastoma (adrenal glands) are other types of cancer found in children mainly due to genetic mutation of idiopathy or unknown reasons,” said Dr Muralikrishna Voona, surgical oncologist and managing director of Mahatma Gandhi Cancer Hospital (MGCH).

“Since childhood cancer grows and spreads rapidly, it is essential that mothers and paediatricians or treating general physicians do not miss early symptoms. Complete cure rates of paediatric cancer are 70-80 per cent when diagnosed early and children respond well to chemotherapy. However, in our country, there is scarcity of specialties like paediatric oncologists. Training has to be given to haematologists and paediatricians in oncology,” said Dr Muralikrishna.

Dr Maruthi Prasad Upputuri, consultant paediatrician at Kims Icon Hospital said, “Since most general paediatricians rarely encounter children with cancer, they might miss the early symptoms. The symptoms differ with each type of childhood cancer and are generally non-specific. Nonetheless, persistent fever, fatigue, recent weight loss, night sweats, painless swellings, especially of the lymph nodes, early morning headache with vomiting, abdominal mass, unexplained pains, especially of the bone, should be taken note of and tested.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The vigilance and anti-corruption bureau sleuths grilled former PWD minister V K Ebrahim Kunju for almost three hours on Saturday, in connection with the alleged corruption in the construction of Palarivattom flyover.

The former PWD minister appeared before the vigilance team at the special investigation unit-1, led by DSP Shyam Kumar for interrogation, after he was summoned by the agency. The government had sought the clearance from governor for prosecuting the former PWD minister who is currently an MLA, in connection with granting advance funds for the RDS projects, the contractor company for constructing the flyover.

It is reliably learnt that the vigilance sleuths also sought the reason from the former minister on why he gave clearance for providing funds in advance to the company, on the basis of which the funds were released. The vigilance sleuths also had confiscated the file in which he had given his clearance for releasing the funds. The files regarding the clearance of funds had shown that Kunju had given clearance for releasing Rs 8.5 crore to the company for the project.

Sources said that the former minister replied that there is nothing unusual on his part in giving clearance as all those who are involved in handling the concerned file from the secretariat assistant to the department secretary had made no objection towards the request for releasing the funds. tnn

Ponda: The Goa Mining People’s Front (GMPF) has demanded that the state government initiate an inquiry into the members of Goa Foundation as well as its sources of income . The mining dependants’ front has blamed the legal suit filed by the NGO for the delay in resumption of mining activities in the state. Further, it has alleged that the NGO is delaying mining resumption simply because of greed.

Speaking at the press conference, GMPF’s Balaji Gawas said that members of Goa Foundation file suits in the apex court and travel by air to New Delhi and hence, chief minister Pramod Sawant should investigate their sources of income.

“There are several other sensitive issues in the state such as the Mhadei river water dispute, but Goa Foundation is only challenging mining-related issues”, Gawas said. Hailing the state government for its various initiative to get mining activities resumed, he said that just as this seemed likely, the NGO had created hurdles. If the NGO hadn’t filed the intervention petition, the mining resumption order could have been declared on February 10, Gawas said.

GMPF president Puti Gaonkar meanwhile demanded that before operations restart, the government must first ensure that mining companies reinstate staff who were let go after March 16, 2018 as well as absorb trucks and machinery that were stopped after closure of mining.

Work in progress on Arya Samaj road in Mangaluru.

Mangaluru: Residents and business establishments on Arya Samaj Road are miffed over the work going on at a snail’s pace at Arya Samaj Road and Bridge Road .

Though the work on Arya Samaj Road was taken up about two years ago, this road which connects Balmatta with Kadri Road, still remains closed. Meanwhile, the situation is the same on Bridge Road that connects Bunts Hostel Road with Balmatta. This road remains closed for nearly a year for concreting.

Ashok Kumar, a resident staying near Arya Samaj Road, told TOI that people have been facing inconvenience due to the inordinate delay in the completion of work at Arya Samaj Road and Bridge Road. Initially, they closed the road two years ago, for the laying interlocking tiles. It was later dug up for the purpose of underground drainage (UGD) works. Now they have closed the road completely, to convert it into a concrete stretch. People are forced to park their vehicles on the road due to this,” he said.

Businessman Sharath Kumar said that both roads which link up to Balmatta, help in reducing traffic congestions on the Jyothi Circle to Balmatta road stretch and also from Jyothi Circle to Bunts Hostel Road. Since, both roads are closed, the area witnesses traffic snarls every day during peak hours, he added.

Mangaluru Smart City Limited managing director Mohammed Nazeer said the work is being expedited and initiatives will be taken to open both roads at the earliest. “Development work on Arya Samaj Road and Bridge Road are complicated, as it is a narrow stretch. We had to close the road to facilitate the work. The concrete work on Bridge Road is completed, but we need 20 more days for curing. Similarly, the work on Arya Samaj Road is also nearing completion,” he added.

The main road caved in due to water leakage on Saturday

Vadodara: The main road caved in near Bagikhana area of the city on Saturday owing to leakage in a water pipeline.

After the incident came to light on Saturday, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has put barricades to ensure that commuters stay safe from the large pit that appeared in the middle of the busy road. Work on identifying the leakage under the road and then closing the crater is yet to begin, said corporator Balasaheb Surve.

Surve said that the area was prone to such cave ins due to leakage in drainage or water pipelines. He said even this seems to have its roots in the laying of an underground cable. “There are booth sewage and water supply pipelines under crater. A cable can be seen in it. Which pipeline was damaged will become clear only when the crater is dug up further to access the pipelines,” he said.

Surve added that students of two schools and other institites located in the area were facing many difficulties.

Visakhapatnam: While the state government has enhanced the scope of cashless cancer treatment by bringing certain treatments under the Aarogyasri scheme, the largest state-run tertiary healthcare centre in AP – the King George Hospital ( KGH ) — lacks infrastructure for treating leukaemia patients, which is the most common form of paediatric cancer and certain other childhood cancers requiring high-end equipment and expertise.

“Given the high expenditures involved in prolonged cancer treatment, which may extend from several months to years, the government has included most paediatric cancers under its insurance scheme. Patients covered under Aarogyasri can avail treatment in the network corporate hospitals. Though we treat free-of-cost, we have to refer most paediatric cancer patients to other private oncology centres as the required infrastructure is unavailable,” said Dr N Sujatha, head of the department of oncology at KGH. The department did not have a medical oncologist for the last three years.

Further, radiotherapy for children is not recommended as it impedes their growth. “In the absence of medical oncologists, we could not treat any paediatric cancer cases, even though they were mostly curable. Every month four to five such cases had to be sent back to other hospitals. But now we have a qualified medical oncologist on deputation and can at least treat certain types of carcinoma such as bone tumour, certain brain tumours and lymphoma,” said Dr Sujatha.

“We are still not equipped to treat leukaemia or blood cancer as it requires a costly, high-end set-up with trained staff, dedicated wards, a sterile environment, mechanism for storage of stem cells, advanced equipment for bone marrow transplant – altogether a separate unit to support the treatment which may last a year or two,” said Dr Sujatha.

On its last visit to the campus on February 6, the team had met several university officials, including the officiating VC RR Tewari. The panel members had invited complaints about irregularities and said anyone could submit them along with valid supporting documents by February 16. By Saturday, AU received 30 complaints along with the supporting documents.

Sources said AU officials were preparing a summary of the complaints, which would scrutinised by the three-member committee on their next visit.

“The committee would look into the summary and decide if they would like to meet any of the complainants in person,” said a senior AU official.

The news about the committee’s visit comes days after a three-member team of National Commission of Women (NCW) members met AU hostel inmates on Thursday and Friday.

The committee, led by NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma, had recommended that AU registrar NK Shukla and finance officer Sunilkant Mishra be removed from their respective posts.

AU public relations officer Shailendra Mishra said, “The two inquiry committees have been doing their work independently and AU authorities would be cooperating in every possible way.”

Allahabad: Allahabad University ( AU ) sent a reminder to the ministry of human resources development (HRD) on Friday seeking amendments in a statute, which would allow it to expand its campus beyond the existing limit of 16-kilometre radius.

If the Centre approves the proposed changes to section 8 (1) of University of Allahabad Act, 2005, it would pave way for the construction of a satellite campus — a goal the varsity has been working towards since the past several years. University of Allahabad Act 2005 section 8 reads: “the powers conferred on the university shall be exercisable in respect of the area within a radius of 16 kilometres from the convocation hall of the university.”

On July 19, 2019, AU executive council wrote to HRD ministry requesting the government to remove the technicality pertaining to 16-kilometre limit and replacing it with ‘anywhere in the country’.

Officiating vice-chancellor of AU RR Tewari said, “It is the need of the hour that AU should expand and if the Act is amended suitably, it would help AU to open its satellite campus in Kaushambi or in any other district”.

Inspections in 260 education institutions

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) is preparing to intensify inspections across private and corporate schools and junior colleges, which are charging exorbitant fees. The committee is eyeing to complete the inspections by the first week of April to provide the grading so that fees can be fixed for the new academic year.

The committee, which had conducted inspections in 260 education institutions in two days last week, had found major discrepancies. They even found out that while schools in Kerala have introduced a water bell to increase hydration in kids, a few schools in Andhra Pradesh were not allowing the students to drink sufficient water to prevent them from visiting the toilet repeatedly.

“Schools were playing with the health of the students. Toilets in the schools were in poor condition. They are not allowing students to drink water to prevent them from visiting the toilet frequently. This is causing renal problems. Quality of food supplied in residential and semi-residential junior colleges is of poor quality and students will suffer gut disorders if they continue to consume this food,” said commission vice-chairperson Vijaya Sharada Reddy.

The APSERMC also noticed that several under-qualified teachers were playing a key role in private and corporate schools. Managements were recruiting under-qualified staff and paying them lesser wages. A few institutions were paying around Rs 7,000 to staff for 12 hour-work that is against the guidelines, the committee observed.

The APSERMC will initiate stringent action against corporate schools, which lacking proper infrastructure. The committee is in talks to suggest the education department to cancel accredition of schools found violating the rules. Meanwhile, private school managements are in limbo over the grading system proposed by APSERMC in fixing school fee.

Thiruvananthapuram: The government has given permission to the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB) to register a case and conduct a probe against Congress leader and former health and devaswom minister V S Sivakumar MLA.

Additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Vishwas Mehta issued the order granting permission to the agency to register a case against him on the basis of the findings of a preliminary inquiry against the former minister, with regards to amassment of wealth beyond his known sources on income during his tenure as the health minister in the previous UDF government.

“The government has examined the findings of the preliminary inquiry in detail and on the basis of the findings of the inquiry, the government hereby accords sanction for the vigilance to register a case and conduct a probe against him,” the order issued by the government said.

Earlier, the sanction for conducting a probe against the former minister was obtained from the governor. The vigilance had initiated a preliminary inquiry against him in 2016 and had submitted a report to the government that he has acquired assets beyond his known sources of income and a detailed investigation has to be conducted by registering a case. There were complaints against Sivakumar that he has acquired several assets in the capital district when he was the minister.

Sivakumar responded that the case against him is a politically motivated one, and he welcomes any probe and would fully cooperate with it. He said that the clearance for vigilance probe is a ploy to divert the attention when the government is in the thick of corruption allegations. He said that the same complaint was earlier probed and found baseless.

Thiruvananthapuram: The district panchayat and Nedumangad block panchayat did the capital proud by bagging the Swaraj trophy for panchayats in the state for the second time in a row. The awards were announced by local self-government minister A C Moideen here on Saturday.

Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat rode on a slew of projects aimed at social welfare and ecological conservation to repeat the feat. Its ‘patheyam’ project for a hunger-free district entailed distribution of lunch packets. The Vidyajyothi scheme targeted weak students in class X to ensure better results in SSLC examinations.

“Following the success of green milk unit at Chettachal, we also introduced a modern hatchery unit which can produce 10,000 chicks a week. We were able to address transportation woes at 26 schools through our ‘sarathi’ project which involved purchasing vehicles for needy schools,” said V K Madhu, district panchayat president. Hi-tech girl-friendly amenity centres were also established in schools under another project.

The district panchayat also joined hands with the rural employment guarantee scheme cell to generate 2,000 farm ponds in various places. In addition, 1 lakh rainwater pits were also created.

Under ‘snehasparsham’, the panchayat launched a scholarship scheme for mentally ill students and an amount of Rs 28,000 is disbursed to eligible students annually. ‘Koothambalam’, which was conceived to give training in percussion instruments to students, was implemented in 15 schools and 10 libraries. The panchayat attained 99.9% plan expenditure during 2018-19. “It was a record among district panchayats,’’ said Madhu.

Nedumangad block panchayat’s ‘vallam nira’ scheme came in for special mention. It blends organic farming and floriculture and promotes it as an employment opportunity for households. On special occasions, four types of organic vegetables are made available to 25,000 houses. The project aims to realise organic villages through Kudumbashree and sale of additional vegetables and flowers from every house through stalls. The project will ensure that 50% of households in one village panchayat is covered under the scheme. Besides, the panchayat also conducted an social audit for all schemes in an exercise that lasted six months. ‘Jaivagramam’ scheme, plastic recycling and agri-incubation centres were also launched by Nedumangad block panchayat, said president B Biju.

CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The state government is aiming to procure 50% of products and services from medium, small and micro enterprises ( MSME ) to boost the sector, said chief minister Pramod Sawant .

He also said that land that was repossessed from special economic zone (SEZ) developers would be utilised for setting up industries.

Speaking at a function in Panaji on Saturday, Sawant said the government is taking numerous steps to facilitate the growth of MSMEs in Goa.

He also said as availability of land is a major challenge, this problem would be solved to a large extent following the move to repossess SEZ land.

Sawant also said the government has reconstituted investment promotion board to facilitate the setting up of industries in the state.

“We are committed to ensure that at least 50% of the total procurement for the government will be done from local MSMEs,” he said.

The chief minister further said that the state and union governments have geared up to promote the growth of the MSME sector.

At present, the MSME sector contributes 29% of the GDP and constitutes 48% of exports, as well as generates employment, Sawant said.

He said that the MSME sector is the real growth engine of India’s economy and holds the key to realise India’s aim to be a 5 trillion dollor economy, a goal set up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi .

“For this goal to be a reality by 2024, the MSME sector should be geared up to contribute 2 trillion dollars,” he said, adding that Union minister Nitin Gadkari has set a target of generating 5 crore additional jobs in this sector.

“I am sure the MSME sector will rise up to the challenge and meet both these objectives,” Sawant said.

He said that India has more than 50 million MSMEs which are facing liquidity crunch, for which the government is trying to find a solution.

Visakhapatnam: In what comes as good news for the city and the Visakhapatnam region, officials have projected that the new South Coast Railway ( SCoR ) will be Indian Railways’ highest revenue generator with projected annual earnings of around Rs 13,000 crore.

Till now, it is the Delhi-based Northern Railways that earns the highest revenue with the sector having earned Rs 8,925 crore as per the latest report. The Northern Railways covers 6,968km— the largest route in the country.

The SCoR, which is the 18th railway zone in the country will cover a route length of 3,496km, according to a senior railway official who added that the zone is projected to transport nearly 8.7 crore tonnes of freight and 20 crore passengers.

The reasons behind such high projected earnings include four major ports located nearby— Krishnapatnam, Kakinada, Gangavaram and Visakhapatnam and the four major railway stations— Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Rajahmundry.

Moreover, there are seven loco sheds— three electric and four diesel, seven coaching depots, the Rajahmundry-based MEMU car shed, wagon workshops, railway land for commercial operations, tourist spots, vast coastline and the Chennai-Howrah railway line.

“The four ports in Andhra Pradesh will be the backbone of SCoR which will contribute nearly 60-70% of revenue earnings by the zone,” the railway official told TOI.

Additionally, the Indian Railways has decided to build a second main railway station in Vizag city and another at Marripalem. These will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 76 crore. These stations are expected to provide advanced passenger amenities. “We are waiting for the date of commencement of SCoR. It will hopefully be done in the first quarter of the next fiscal,” the official said.

The SCoR zone was announced by the railway ministry in February 2019. A sum of Rs 170 crore was sanctioned for the development of the zone in the recent Budget. “Existing infrastructure in the city is enough to commence the zone,” added the official.

VIJAYAWADA: Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan visited capital region villages on Saturday and extended support to villagers who have been agitating in support of Amaravati as seed capital.

“Amaravati is the capital city of Andhra Pradesh and the decision happened long ago. The state government has the right to take a call on the location of the capital, but in this case Amaravati was already approved as the state’s new capital. The central government also recognized Amaravati in the map and granted funds for the development of infrastructure here. I am sure it will be the capital city forever. It’s shifting is just a temporary phase,” Pawan said.

He also blamed the YSRC government for the deaths of around 41 farmers. “They lost their lives for Amaravati. The state government should recognize their sacrifices,” he demanded.

He further said that chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy’s recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be taken in the right context. “Jagan met the PM in his capacity as CM of AP. There is no chance of BJP forging an alliance with the YSRC. Our cadres should understand this. We have decided to go for an alliance with the BJP for the welfare of AP and I am working in that direction,” Pawan added.

Explaining the reasons for the postponement of the Kavathu long march, Pawan said he took the decision on the request of BJP. “Both Jana Sena and BJP will fight in support of Amaravati.

Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram

TRICHY: Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram has accused the BJP government at the Centre of not accepting its mistakes and being in denial mode as rising unemployment and falling consumption are making India poorer.

Speaking on ‘Union Budget 2020’ at St Joseph's College here on Saturday, Chidambaram said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took 160 minutes to present the Budget, but did not convey anything.

“The finance minister should first speak about the present economic condition of the country. Then the minister should list out what all are the measures needed to streamline shortcomings in the previous year and future plans on existing projects which are successfully going on. However, she conveyed nothing in her 160-minute budget speech,” he said.

“No government would run without a single mistake. That can be rectified, but this government is not like that. The ruling BJP government has never accepted its mistakes. For example, demonetization and the way GST was implemented were great mistakes committed in independent India. But, they never accepted it because the ruling BJP government is always in denial mode,” he said.

“Electricity, industry, mines, refineries, coal and gas are important sectors which would determine the economic condition of any country. However, none of these sectors witnessed growth under the BJP regime. 60% of people rely on the agriculture sector. However, the growth rate of the sector was only 2%,” he added.

“When rising unemployment and falling consumption is making India poorer, the Union budget has no answer to address it. Former chief economic advisor of the Union government Arvind Subramanian had stated that the economy was in the ICU. However, my opinion is that the patient has been kept out of the ICU and incompetent doctors are looking after the patient,” he added.

MEERUT: Body of a 35-year-old woman who had gone missing on Friday evening was recovered from a field at Samaypur village under Mundali police station on Saturday morning.

The deceased was identified as Lakshmi, a resident of Jai Bheem Nagar in Bhawanpur area.

Police suspect that Lakshmi was strangled and later, her body was dumped in a desolate spot. Based on the complaint of her family, a case of murder has been registered against three named accused at Mundali police station.

According to Lakshmi’s family, she had left home on her scooter after she got call from one Umesh Gurjar, a resident of Parikshitgarh area. She had lent Rs 2 lakh to him. When she did not return home at night, her family lodged a missing complaint with Mundali police.

In the morning, her scooter was found abandoned on Garh road. The jewellery she was wearing was missing from her person while there were strangulation marks on her neck.

Meanwhile, police are yet to ascertain the reason for the murder. The investigating sleuths claim that the deceased woman was a money lender and the murder could be linked to one such deal gone wrong.

“We have registered a case against three named accused based on the complaint of the deceased’s husband. Efforts are on to arrest them. We are trying to look into all possible angles in the case,” said Avinash Pandey, SP (rural).

153,['16/02/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Moradabad brass firms stare at Rs 700-crore loss as handicraft fair in Frankfurt wears deserted look,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Meerut: A drastic dip in the footfall at coveted handicraft fair in Frankfurt, Germany due to the coronavirus scare has left the Moradabad brass exporters gasping for breath as they are now staring at a loss of around Rs 700-crore. As many as 150 representatives of the brass industry, who have put up stalls at the fair which will a five-day affair, stared at empty galleries for the second day running on Friday.

Adding to their woes, they have been allotted the stalls right next to exporters from China at the Ambiënte Fair Frankfurt 2020, one of the largest annual fares for handicraft held in Germany.

Rohit Dhal, director of H Lal Exports, who spoke to TOI from Frankfurt, said, “Scenario is bad, really bad. There are 150 exporters from Moradabad and most of them are sitting idle. The US and European buyers are in any case not coming here because of coronavirus scare.”

According to director of Export Promotion Council for Handicraft (EPCH), Neeraj Khanna, “According to an estimate, we expect a downfall of 70-80% in terms of footfalls. In usual circumstances, Moradabad-based brass industry used to conduct business worth Rs 800-crore in this fair. But, this year, we are staring at a loss of Rs 500 to 700 crores.”

“We are already getting feelers from the biggest importers in the US and in Europe. They are cancelling their visits due to advisory issued by the US to its citizens,” says Rakesh Kumar, director general of EPCH.

It’s not just export which has been affected drastically, but import as well.

“There are a lot of items we import from China to keep our export deliveries intact. Our current orders are also stuck in the customs department in China. Factories there are shut down and no production is taking place. All that is impacting us,” added Khanna.

However, there is a silver lining. China’s loss could be India’s gain. All hopes now rest on EPCH Fair in Greater Noida in April, the largest annual handicraft fair in India which is quite a draw for foreign buyers.

“Since it is a national affair and no foreign exhibitors are invited here, we have strong feeling that losses suffered in Frankfurt can be made up in April. Although, we usually have Chinese buyers also, this time things are not so easy for them because of undeclared visa restriction after coronavirus outbreak. So European and American buyers can always arrive here,” said Vishal Agarwal, an exporter from Moradabad.

Hajabba along with schoolchildren at the Kannada Zilla Panchayat Higher Primary School at New Padpu in Harekal... Read More

MANGALURU: Most of those who complete their SSLC , especially girls in Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Higher Primary School at New Padpu in Harekala, which is the school built by Padma Shri awardee Harekala Hajabba, discontinue their studies as there is no PU college in the village.

Last academic year, only one girl student and a few boys out of 26 students,opted for PU after SSLC, but the rest have discontinued studies

Harekala Hajabba , 64, known as ‘Akshara Santha,’ says he can be at peace only when his school gets a PU college wing or the school is turned into a Karnataka Public School. The reason is that 80 to 85 per cent of students, especially girls, after completion of SSLC in Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Higher Primary and High School, New Padpu, discontinue studies as there is no government PU college nearby. The school, which is popularly known as Hajabba’s school, is situated about 25km away from the city.

“Last year, there were about 26 SSLC students who passed out from this institution, yet only one girl and few boys have continued their studies. Some boys dropped out after attending PU college for a few months. The rest have discontinued their studies or joined madrassa education, and one among them is a school and taluk topper, who scored 95 per cent. The reason is there is not a single government PU or any vocational training institution nearby. They have to travel to the city, which many parents do not prefer, and they cannot afford to send children to private PU colleges. Therefore, most of them discontinue their studies,” said school teacher Susheema. She added that some continue their PU after working for a year.

This year, 23 students including 10 girls will appear for the SSLC examination. Last academic year, the school received 92 per cent results in SSLC. The high school has 73 students and 91 students study in primary school. The primary school started in 2001 and high school in 2007. A majority of students come to school either by walking or by using public transport.

“Year by year, due to mushrooming of private English-medium schools and non-availability of PU college here, admissions are coming down at the school. It can be stopped when the government sanctions a PU college or a public school,” added a teacher.

Class X student Raksha, who quit an English-medium school at Konaje and joined Hajabba’s school, said that she prefers this school to her previous one. “There is a learning atmosphere at this educational institution. I wish to continue my PU on the same campus. It all depends on the government,” she said. Raksha’s sister Rashmi also studies in the same school.

“It is my dream to see a PU college on this campus,” said Harekala Hajabba.

Memorandum submitted to minister

During the visit of minister for primary and secondary education of S Suresh Kumar to the school on Saturday, Harekala Hajabba submitted a memorandum requesting additional facilities for the institution. In return, the minister responded and said that he will consider the memorandum.

He demanded to upgrade the Harekala school to a Karnataka Public School in order to provide education till the plus-two level, under one roof; compound wall across campus, bus facility as well as to carry out repairs of school building; school ground; laboratory, library and computer labs.

Visakhapatnam: Even though India’s eastern coast is famous for the export of mango pulp, export of the fruit is negligible in these parts compared to the west coast. In a bid to close in on this gap, the horticulture department had farmers experiment with the Alphonso mango at a clinical scale in Vizianagaram and Chittoor . However, the experiment did not yield desired results.

Alphonso, one of the most popular varieties of mango is exported the most. Most of the Alphonso is grown in Ratnagiri and areas like Aurangabad in Maharashtra. While the export of the Alphonso has been a huge success there, it could not be replicated in north-coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Speaking to STOI, K Srinivasalu, director of planning at the horticulture department said, “The Alphonso experiment did not succeed here because the variety thrives in dry climatic conditions aided by black cotton soil. Both these conditions need to be met for flowering and pollination.”

Upon being asked about the clinical trials in Vizianagaram and Chittoor, Srinivasalu said, “It (the experiment) met with some success in Chittoor district where conditions are dry. However, farmers are not very keen on it because Chittoor is home to India’s mango pulp industry and only pulpy varieties are grown here. We have around 46 such units in Chittor district.”

Discussing the failure of the experiment in Vizianagaram, R Srinivasa Rao, AD horticulture said, “The excessive humidity in the coastal district proved too oppressive for the species to flower. This is why the farmers are simply not interested.”

On being asked if there is any other coastal district in the state where this variety could be grown, Srinivasulu pointed out that the extremely high moisture levels aided by high groundwater levels would make it impossible to introduce this variety in any of the coastal regions. In dry areas such as Rayalaseema, pulp varieties are highly suitable as they yield better results.

ALLAHABAD: A 22-year-old jilted youth allegedly gunned down a woman using a countrymade pistol before killing himself with the same firearm in Jhunsi’s Havelia locality on Saturday.

The two died on the spot. SSP Allahabad Satyarth Aniruddha Pankaj said, “The girl was identified as Saumya (19) and was pursuing BCom from a local degree college.”

According to reports, the deceased youth Shanu, son of Rizwan Ahmed, reached Saumya’s home around 2.30pm and then shot her. She was on her way to attend coaching classes when she was attacked.

Police said the CCTV footage recovered from nearby homes showed Shanu and Saumya interacting often. The footage from the day of the attack shows that after killing Saumya, Shanu ran a few steps and then shot himself in the head.

“We have sent the two bodies for postmortem examination. Their call detail records show that the two knew each other well and had been in touch for quite some time,” said the SSP. Police said they are still probing what might have caused the deceased youth to kill the woman.

Protesters in Trichy

TRICHY: Hundreds of people affiliated to various Muslim outfits staged protests in Trichy, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur condemning the police action on people who were protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) at Washermenpet in Chennai on Friday. CPI state secretary R Mutharasan, Trichy MP S Thirunavukkarasar and Manithaneya Makkal Katchi leader M H Jawahirullah condemned the police action against protesters.

Around 1,000 people including women, and children gathered near Palakkarai Roundabout on Old Madurai Road at 11 am on Saturday. They raised slogans against police alleging that they unleashed violence against the protesters in Chennai. They also demanded action against the police officer who ordered the lathi charge. They also raised slogans against the ruling AIADMK government.

Following the protests, traffic was affected along the road for more than an hour. Buses and other vehicles were diverted via Beema Nagar, Heber Road, and Court to reach Chathiram bus stand. More than 200 police personnel were deployed in the area.

Hundreds of people also staged protests at Keelvelur, Nagore and Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district. Earlier, they took out rallies before gathering at the protest spot. Similar protests were held in 11 places in Thanjavur. Police arrested 40 people as they tried to block traffic in Thanjavur city. More than 500 protesters participated in the stir.

Protests were staged at various places including Mathukur, Athirampattinam, Mallipattinam, Senthalai East Coast Road, Nadukkadai in Thiruvaiyaru, near Head Post Office in Kumbakonam, Thirubuvanam, and Natchiyar Koil in Thanjavur district.

Meanwhile police registered cases against around 1,000 protesters in Tiruvarur for staging agitation. People from Thiruvarur, Koothanallur, Thiruthuraipoondi, and Muthupettai gathered in large numbers and raised slogans against the police violence.

CPI state secretary R Mutharasan and Trichy Congress MP S Thirunavukkarasar, who were in Pudukottai to participate in various events on Saturday, said that police used force to disperse the peaceful protesters in Chennai. Police resorted to lathi charge unnecessarily, which has prompted people across the state to take it to the streets, they alleged.

Manithaneya Makkal Katchi leader M H Jawahirulla urged the state government to pass a resolution against CAA in the assembly.

<p>Representative image<br></p>

TRICHY: The Cantonment police have registered a dacoity case against 10 unidentified people for snatching two mobile phones from a 22-year-old student and four of his friends at gun-point here on Friday.

In his compliant, V K Ushama of Kozhikode district in Kerala said that he was studying first year MSc Chemistry in a private college in Trichy. He and three of his friends who were staying in the hostel, had gone to meet another friend Mohammed Abubacker Sadhik in Mannarpuram. They took Abubacker’s car and went to an indoor badminton club. After playing in the club, they went back to Abubacker’s place and then they all went to the Trichy International Airport for sight-seeing.

While returning, when they were nearing the Government Circuit House, a multi-utility vehicle overtook and stopped in front of them. Another car locked their car from behind.

Around 10 people got down from the car and one of them smashed the right mirror of the car using the gun.

They threatened the students at gun-point demanding to part with their valuables. They also sprayed some liquid on their faces after which they snatched Abubacker and Ushama’s mobile phones and fled the scene.

As the incident took place near the government circuit house, police intensified the inquiry with the students. Commissioner of police, Trichy city V Varadharaju also conducted the enquiry with them on Friday.

While launching the investigation by sifting through the CCTV footage of the entry and exit points of the city to identify the accused, police also inquired with the students as to why they visited the airport in the late hours.

Police said that the weapon could have been an air gun as they found some air gun pellets at the spot.

Visakhapatnam: Buoyed by Aam Aadmi Party’s Delhi sweep, the party is now likely to contest the upcoming municipal election in the city.

“In the past 48 hours or so people’s perception about the party has changed. There is a high chance that in the forthcoming GVMC election we might field a few candidates,” Sheetal Madan, AAP district convener in Visakhapatnam told STOI on Thursday.

AAP’s tryst with Visakhapatnam began on February 23, 2014. They inaugurated a party office at New Venkojipalem and within a few months 380 people registered as party volunteers.

But since then AAP’s journey in the City of Destiny has not been promising. In a year, their number of active volunteers plunged to 10. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls the party contested from two Lok Sabha constituencies – Araku and Visakhapatnam – and from five assembly constituencies – Vizag East, Vizag South, Vizag West, Gajuwaka and Araku, and lost. At present the party has barely 180 volunteers and a majority of them are college students or recent graduates.

Speaking about the party’s journey, Madan, who is a physician by profession, told STOI, “We lost popularity in no time because of two factors. First, in Indian politics it takes time for a regional party to gain popularity outside its headquarters region. Second, whatever popularity we received in the city it vanished suddenly after Arvind Kejriwal decided to resign in 2015.”

At present, besides few supporters, AAP members face acute fund shortage. Members of the executive body hold meetings at their residences on a rotational basis.

In fact, the condition of AAP in Visakhapatnam is so critical that the party did not contest from any seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha and Andhra Pradesh assembly polls.

YOGI OF TABLA : Pt Suresh Talwalkar

Pandit Suresh Talwalkar is giving this interview from Dhaka, Bangladesh where he along with four other renowned musicians have been training interested students in aspects of Hindustani classical music. “I visit Dhaka every month and teach at the Bengal Parampara Sangeetalay, I have been doing it for the past five years,” says Pt Talwalkar who one of India’s foremost tabla players. Hailed as a Taalyogi, teaching the instrument, mostly used in Hindustani classical music concerts as an accompaniment, comes naturally to him. “I run a tabla school (Taalyogi Ashram) in Pune and I have everyone from Western music instrumentalists, percussionists, and even Kathak dancers coming to learn from me. I teach them the laya-taal aspect of music because I clearly can’t teach them movement,” he laughs. At 72, Talwalkar has been playing the instrument for over 60 years and is a prominent soloist. A constant feature of his concerts is how he uses vocal music as an accompaniment to the instrument while traditional format places the vocalist at the centre. “I started doing this because if people only heard the tabla going da-da-da-da, they’d get bored. Adding vocal music makes it a more pleasant listen,” he says. He may be a Padma Shri awardee but Talwalkar does riyaaz just like he did when he was a young student. “I end up playing the tabla for 7-8 hours every day and this includes when I sit down to teach my students.” “For musicians, music is our life and there’s little else we think about,” he says.

NEVER A SIDE MAN: Ranjit Barot

As a drummer, all music is fair play for Ranjit Barot. Whether it’s Carnatic classical, Hindustani classical, jazz or film music, Barot is comfortable lending his drums to all kinds of music. “At the heart of it, all music is the same. There is a sense of discipline and great mastery of skill underlying the art, and when you as a performer are thrown into different styles of music, you get with it. I don’t find it difficult to communicate with musicians at all,” says Barot. As a drummer, he is part of John McLaughlin’s band, McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension, and plays the drums, composes and sings for his band Uncommon. He is also the music director of live shows for long-time associate AR Rahman. As a constant collaborator, when it comes to sharing the stage with other performers, it must be a task to know when to take the lead and when to take the backseat. “But I have never been a part of an ensemble where I have been a side man,” he laughs. In John McLaughlin’s band, all four of us members are strongly featured. And about performing live with AR Rahman – his songs are popular and fantastically written, that if music is needed to be soft, I take a backseat,” says Barot who will be performing at the Udupa Festival with a whole ensemble of musicians including Ustad Taufiq Qureshi, singers Kaushiki Chakraborty and Vijayprakash, bassist Etienne Mbappe and keyboardist and violinist Christophe Cravero.

THREE GENERATIONS TOGETHER: Sukanya Ramgopal

I have performed with my guru many times before but every time I play with him, I am just as nervous as the first time I played with him,” says Sukanya Ramgopal about performing with her guru, the legendary ghatam player Vikku Vinayakram at the Udupa Festival on February 21. “It’s a mix of feelings I have. One part of me is nervous, one part of me looks at it as a learning experience, and a whole other part of me is looking to get a ‘sabhash’ from him for any musical experiments that I will present on stage,” Ramgopal says. Her relationship with the legendary Vinayakram goes back to over fifty years now, when as a barely 10-year-old she heard him play and knew she wanted to play ghatam for the rest of her life. The story of how she asked him to teach her the instrument – making her probably the first women to play the ghatam – is by now legendary. Vinayakram initially refused to teach her by telling her that the clay pot made for a difficult instrument for a girl to play. Ramgopal persisted. “Then, he went to his father and told him that I was troubling him! That’s when his father (TR Harihara Sharma) told him, ‘the ghatam doesn’t know who is playing it. I think we will be fine inducting Sukanya as a student,” she recalls, all these years later. A trailblazer, Ramgopal today is a guru herself, and next Saturday, what has her excited is that she will be sharing stage with her guru, and her student, Ghatam Giridhar Udupa. “It is for the first time that I will be playing with both of them together; that also makes it three generations on the same stage,” she says.

STUDENT OF MUSIC FOREVER: Pt Subhankar Banerjee

Tabla maestro Pandit Subhankar Banerjee has an impressive list of musicians he has accompanied in concerts. The most noteworthy among them would include Pt Ravi Shankar, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pt Shivkumar Sharma, Balamurali Krishna and Ustad Rashid Khan. He has also like a handful of his peers been part of diverse collaborations including performing with a symphonic orchestra, jazz ensembles, and film music. Looking back fondly at having shared the stage with lofty names like these at a relatively young age, Banerjee says that what was noteworthy was the maestros never treated him any different. “They never made me feel like I was a kid. They always treated me as a peer and for me, these opportunities were about being at par with them in terms of my expertise. It was about making a mark of my own,” says Banerjee. That he got these opportunities makes him lucky. “Yes, it is true that I got these opportunities rather early but as a musician, you can’t merely rely on luck. You have to sustain your talent and mastery over your instrument, so that people trust you to deliver every single time,” he adds. Banerjee has been playing the tabla for over 49 years and every time he sits with it, “I see how it is this exhaustive subject with more to explore. It is a nice feeling to be a student of music, and one lifetime is not enough to know it completely.”

Kanpur: Around 248 tanneries in Jajmau area will stop their operation from February 19 following a notice issued by the Regional Pollution Control Board asking them to close the units again till its further orders without giving any reason.

The tanneries, which remained closed for a period of 13 months on the charge of polluting Ganga, were allowed to start production on December 20 for two months only. This time limit is expiring on February 19

SB Franklin, regional pollution control board officer, said the government had allowed running the units for two months only and this time will expire on February 19.

Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board in its order has simply stated that the tanneries in Jajmau would remain closed till further orders, he said.

Firoz Alam of Small Tanners' Association said that on December 20 last year, the government, while granting permission to run the units with half capacity, had also stated that the tanners would be allowed to run their units till next year if they followed the necessary norms and standards fixed by the pollution control board.

""During the last two months not a single notice was issued to any tannery by the regional pollution control board because the tanneries did not flout the norms set by it"", Alam said.

The new closure order is beyond our comprehension. The office-bearers of the association will meet senior officers of the board to know the reason for closure, he added.

Firoz Zafar, an export-import advisor, said the closure order would not only damage the business image of tanneries but would affect leather export too.

He said the tanneries which have got orders from foreign companies would suffer a lot for failing to supply the goods in time.

The tanners would not only suffer pecuniary losses but also face problems in getting new orders, he added.

Bhubaneswar: With an aim to strengthen connectivity, the state government is likely to make a substantial allocation for road projects in the annual budget for 2020-21 to be presented by finance minister Niranjan Pujari on Tuesday.

Officials said the state highway development project, the Biju Expressway project, the Capital Road Development Programme, road reconstruction in Left-wing extremism (LWE)-affected areas and Mukhya Mantri Sadak Yojana will get adequate allocation in the budget.

Announced in August 2014, the 639-km Biju Expressway has been conceived as an economic corridor project connecting Rourkela and Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh. The project has been designed to pass through western Odisha and the Koraput-Balangir-Kalahandi (KBK) region.

While the Rourkela-Sambalpur stretch (163km) of the project has already been completed, around 182km stretch of the project is being developed by the National Highways Authority of India. The state works department has taken up the development of the remaining 293km.

“Work on different patches of the project is going on in full swing. We expect the project to be completed by December next year. We hope that the state government will allocate adequate funds for the project. A detailed project-wise allocation will only be known after the presentation of the budget,” a senior works department official said.

Under the state highways development project, the government has taken up the ambitious task of developing the state highways. By the end of December 2019, about 2,000 km of state highways have been widened since 2013-14. Adequate funds are also likely to be earmarked for the project during 2020-21 for the project.

<p>Old woman died allegedly after a termite-infested tree fell on her car<br></p>

DEHRADUN: A 36-year-old woman died allegedly after a termite-infested tree fell on her car near Indian Military Academy in the city late on Friday night. The victim was a resident of Vasant Vihar area near IMA.

According to reports, the tree was found to be infested with termites and snapped and fell when the woman was passing by in her car. The woman’s family was also on board the car at around 11:30 pm on Friday when the accident took place. Woman’s husband and daughter sustained critical injuries.

“The family of Nitin Gupta from Vasant Vihar was travelling in the car. The accident, in which a giant tree fell on the car left Priyanka Gupta dead. Meanwhile, Nitin and her daughter were admitted to a hospital with serious injuries,” added the cop who said that no FIR has been lodged in the case as this was a natural incident.

Expressing concern over the accident, local environmentalists asked the government to put “tree doctors” in place so that they can identify such trees and avoid such accidents. They pointed out that there are several big and small trees along roads and highways in the city and thus, their health must be regularly monitored.

Anoop Nautiyal, a city-based social activist, maintained that everything has a shelf life and trees are no different. “Cutting of trees is illegal but those which are in poor condition and can lead to such accidents shouldn’t be left like this along roadside. There must be a robust mechanism to identify such trees and then treat them or cut them down,” said Nautiyal who is planning to write to the state government to deploy forest department staff to track the health of trees.

Reenu Paul, another activist and environmentalist, put forest department in the culprit box for the accident. “The trees, which are there on roadsides or on highways, are responsibility of forest department. In our area, there were old trees which were bent and falling down towards road. We had written to the forest department several times to get these trees removed or slashed but they kept on passing the bucks to Public Works Department (PWD). This accident could have been prevented if the forest department had done its job,” said Paul. He added that forest and power department are responsible for decay of trees in city as they put up posters, banners, and wires on them and all this increases the pace of their decay.

As part of unveiling, a booklet on the life of Sivachandran and a rural folk song commemorating him was released in the presence of chief government whip S Rajendran. “We have placed a demand with the district administration to erect a statue of my husband at a roundabout near Ariyalur district collectorate. His statue may serve as an inspiration for the youth to join the armed forces and serve the nation,” said S Gandhimathi, Sivachandran’s wife told TOI.

Gandhimathi who was pregnant when Sivachandran was killed had delivered a baby girl recently. “We named her Sivamathi as per my husband’s wish,” Gandhimathi added.

Sivachandran had joined the CRPF in 2010 and had been posted across Jammu and Kashmir since then. He was one of the two soldiers from Tamil Nadu among the 40 CRPF soldiers killed in the terror attack on February 14 last year. Sivachandran is survived by parents Chinnaiyan and Singaravalli, wife Gandhimathi and children Sivamuniyan and Sivamathi.

182,['16/02/2020'],Trichy: Ignorance of procedures complicating adoption says S P Mohan,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Commission member S P Mohan.

TRICHY: Lack of understanding of adoption procedures has been prompting prospective adoptive parents (PAP) to go for illegal means to adopt a child, according to the Tamil Nadu state commission for protection of child rights (TNSCPCR). The recent exposure of two babies being illegally given for adoption by their parents in Thiruverumbur and Kuvalakudi was a matter of serious concern, said commission member S P Mohan.

He was addressing a seminar on the legal procedures for adoption organized for the police and media personnel by the anti-child trafficking unit (ACTU) in Trichy at the district police office on Saturday. “The process of adopting a child legally takes ten months, but the concerning factor is that the number of children is less than that of the prospective adoptive parents now. Further, such parents are also misguided about the procedures and documents required,” said Mohan.

He said PAPs can apply online on the website www.cara.nic.in of the central adoption resource authority (CARA) by uploading 11 documents and paying the prescribed fee fixed by the government. Children being given care and protection at any one of the 21 specialized adoption agencies (SAA) will be given for adoption. “Most of the 11 documents, like Aadhaar, are readily available with everyone. They have to obtain only certificates for income, fitness and conduct. The fee for the procedure would run into a maximum of Rs 50,000. Unfortunately, those ignorant about these things go for illegal adoption by coughing up Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh and land in trouble,” said Mohan. Referring to the two recent incidents, Trichy superintendent of police Zia Ul Haq said had the parents waited for some time they could have adopted the children legally. Mohan also revealed the recent instruction from the government to ensure CCTV cameras in all private hospitals to check child theft. He said the administration of government hospitals should check if these CCTV cameras were functioning properly.

The TNSCPCR member also pointed out incidences of birth certificates of newborn babies being manipulated with names of ‘adoptive parents’ during illegal adoption to show as if the child was born to them. Member of child welfare committee (CWC) N Krishnamoorthy spoke about the legal procedures for adoption.

Bareilly: Police in Pilibhit have registered a case against 33 named individuals and 90-100 unidentified others for allegedly assaulting a constable and illegally confining him during a protest against CAA and NRC on Thursday.

According to police, constable Dushyant Kumar, who was on duty at the site of protest, was allegedly assaulted when he tried to stop the protesters from cooking at the venue. A police officer said, “The protesters caught him and thrashed him. They even dragged him to an adjoining house and locked him up before threatening to kill him if he raised an alarm. However, he managed to escape from the house on Friday and reached the police station where he narrated his ordeal. After Kumar’s statement was recorded, he was sent for medical examination. He sustained seven injuries in the incident.”

Police said that though section 144 is in force in the district, the protest was organised without permission and the protesters had placed a loudspeaker and chairs at the venue.

Based on the complaint of SHO Shrikant Dwivedi, police have registered a case against the accused under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order promogulated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act.

184,['16/02/2020'],Leopard attacks spur Bijnor BSA to order boundary walls around 800 government schools,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Picture used for representational purpose only

BIJNOR: In the wake of repeated leopard attacks in Bijnor , the basic education adhikari has chalked out a plan to construct boundary walls around 800 government schools located near forests or agricultural fields. Of the 2,556 government primary schools in the district, 800 schools do not have boundary walls and are located in areas where leopards are known to prowl. These have been shortlisted for building a boundary wall.

The decision was taken as six people have lost their lives in leopard attacks in the district since November 27. Among the victims was 14-year-old Prahsant Kumar, who was killed near his school at Bhogpur village in Najibabad tehsil on January 6. Besides scores of people have been injured in attacks by the big cats.

After the boy’s death, BSA Mahesh Chandra suspended the head master of Bhogpur primary school for dereliction of duty. The BSA also issued an advisory to all teachers to keep a strict eye on their wards and ensure that none is allowed to leave school during study time. On their part, many teachers and parents’ associations raised the issue of the lack of boundary walls around schools.

When contacted, district coordinator of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan Salim Beg said, “We have chalked out a proposal to construct boundary walls around the remaining schools. In at least 800 schools, the boundary wall is either broken or do not exist at all. I hope the boundary walls will be constructed in the next academic session.”

He added, “We have also sent a proposal to revamp over 70 primary schools whose buildings are dilapidated.”

There are 2,556 primary and upper primary schools in Bijnor district in which around two lakh students are enrolled. According to the data available with the basic education department, as many as 450 schools do not have a boundary wall while it is under construction in 350 schools. This poses a constant threat to both students and teachers alike. More than 24,000 children are at risk of an attack by the big cat. Many of these schools are near sugarcane fields, which have become home for the leopards.

According to forest department officials, some 100 leopards live amid the cane fields. With cane harvesting on, leopard sightings have increase and so have man-big cat confrontations.

Rameshwari, a senior teacher in Najibabad block, said, “Big cats have been attacking people for the past two months. Six people have been killed. Many schools are located on the outskirts of villages and the route to reach them are unsafe. Teachers themselves fear to take such routes to reach their schools.”

According to a resident of Raipuri village in the absence of a boundary wall, a leopard can enter a school, especially those on the outskirts of the village, near cane fields.

185,['16/02/2020'],Kolkata: Novelty factor keeps East-West trains packed on first weekend,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Rush of passengers at Karunamoyee station on Saturday

KOLKATA: The excitement over the newly opened East-West Metro line continued on the second day, which happened to be the first weekend for the truncated services, as thousands poured in at the stations to get a feel of the latest addition to the city’s public transport system.

Waiting to buy his return ticket from Salt Lake Stadium to Sector V station, Howrah resident Sandip Das said, “The new Metro is Kolkata’s pride. I hope we can keep it this way.” The bank employee made use of his weekend free time to take his first East-West Metro ride. “This is too good, easily comparable with the other Metros I have travelled on, be it in Turkey, China or Paris . I am waiting for the day I can ditch my car and take the Metro straight from my house to my Sector V office.”

At the Bengal Chemical station’s ticket counter, Saini Saha echoed Das: “Please, please make sure that the city’s pride is kept as shiny and efficient forever. The station looks like an airport and the rakes like bullet trains.”

Even as the weekend ridership dipped on Saturday compared to the first day of service on Friday, which was a weekday, the crowd meter spiked on and off. The hourly census compiled by Metro Railway for the six East-West Metro stations showed the passenger count rising to 1,593 between 4pm and 5pm on Saturday from 1,541 during the same time on Friday. Between 5pm and 6pm on Saturday, 1,905 commuters boarded the East-West Metro as against 1,779 the same time on Friday. According to data, Karunamoyee station is the biggest crowd-puller after terminal stations Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium. Even as people kept walking in and out of City Centre station all through the day, its numbers weren’t as high as expected.

But then, Atrija Dutta, a Class XI student from EC Block, was taking her fifth joyride from City Centre at 3pm. She intended travelling five more times with school pal Soumyabrata Samanta. “Staying opposite City Centre, I have seen the Metro project being pieced together over the last nine years. I remember the park that was sacrificed to make way for it. I have missed the green patch all my life, but now I am feeling a little better after riding the world-class Metro,” Adrija said, pausing to catch some breath. Her excitement was palpable.

The weekend riders included people like Kabir Chakraborty, who had deliberately skipped the first-day ride for that group photo he was busy clicking along with his 11-year-old son, Ayushman, and wife Nabamita at Sector V station on Saturday. On Friday, the TCS worker did long to cross over to the Metro station when he saw his colleagues rushing to catch Kolkata’s brand new rapid transit on the very first day. “But then, I thought of my son, who was in school writing his exams, and decided to defer the visit to the weekend so that we could take the first ride together,” Chakraborty said.

East-West Metro token stock has started depleting very fast

KOLKATA: On its first day of commercial service, East-West Metro lost 353 of the 11,860 tokens it sold and on Saturday, another 200 tokens went missing. Apparently, the passengers wanted to keep them as mementos of their first ride.

The missing tokens have set the new Metro back by Rs 20 (rounded up cost) for each token. Asked how commuters managed to leave the station without swiping out of the automatic fare collection system, officials said people simply walked away with the tokens because on the first day, the station staff were not all that vigilant and the side gates weren’t locked.

“Mediapersons were allowed into the station through these side gates, and they remained open,” an official said. He recalled that the occasion was so special that everyone was in a light mood. Officials believed that most tokens went missing between 8am and 10am.

On Saturday, a Salt Lake resident who had commuted on the first day showed his token and confessed, “This means a lot to me. It’s my first token of the East-West Metro, on its first day of service.”

HARIDWAR/DEHRADUN: A clash between rival factions owing allegiance to two BJP MLAs — Haridwar MLA Madan Kaushik on one side and Haridwar (rural) MLA Swami Yatishwaranand on the other — over the management of the Gurukul Mahavidyalaya, a more than a century-old educational institution in the city, has been going on since February 5, allegedly over control of the land belonging to the institution.

Both the factions are accusing each other of “trying to illegally capture control of the institution.”

Speaking to TOI, Hari Gopal Shastri, vice-chancellor, who is an associate of Yatishwaranand, alleged that the trouble arose on February 5 as supporters of cabinet minister Madan Kaushik tried forcibly to throw out the college officials from their offices in the campus. Reiterating the claims, Yatishwaranand said, “This is a blatant attempt by Madan Kaushik and his associates to take over the institution simply because they are eyeing the property of the college.”

Yatishwaranand alleged that when he along with other office bearers reached the premises on February 6, they were not allowed to enter. “All of us were forced to sit on a protest outside,” he claimed.

Reacting to the allegations, the college joint secretary Anil Goel, an associate of Kaushik, alleged that “Yatishwaranand is not even a primary member of the managing committee and has been expelled.” “His writ petition in the Nainital high court against his expulsion was dismissed by a single-judge bench in May last year and by a double-judge bench in October. Their group has illegally captured the college,” he added.

The college situated on the Delhi-Haridwar highway has about 300 bigha of prime land worth several hundred crores. Only a small part of it is being used to run Sanskrit courses and the strength of students is hardly a hundred. ""The land mafia want to grab the remaining land lying unutilised and they are behind the power struggle in the institution,"" a local resident said.

RAJKOT: Members of the state commission for women visited the Shree Sahjanand Girls Institute campus in Bhuj on Saturday, while the National Commission for Women (NCW) will visit the premises on Sunday. The five-member team of the state commission recorded statements of the victims.

Talking to media persons in Bhuj, member of commission, Hansa Patel said, “We talked to nearly 60 girls in a separate room and also with the trustee and hostel management later. We have also asked the management to provide CCTV records of the day of the incident and to update us about the findings of their investigation.”

Members of the Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathan (KMVS), working on women’s issue in Kutch, also accompanied the state commission members. A member of KMVS, Malshree Gadhvi said, “We are going to organize a programme in Bhuj on Sunday that will spread the message of abolishing these kinds of inhuman tradition followed by some of the sects. We will ask the girls of other institutes to report to us if they too are facing any similar kind of harassment.”

Meanwhile, the head of Swaminarayan temple in Bhuj, Dev Prakash Swami, reportedly visited the girl’s hostel on Saturday evening to resolve the issue. Generally, Swaminarayan priests are not even supposed to look at girls, but according to informed sources, the priest even went to the girls’ hostel.

PATNA: A 40-year-old woman teacher of a government school was shot dead by unidentified criminals in Sheohar district on Saturday.

Police said the incident took place around 9am when the deceased, Pallavi Kumari, was on way to a government middle school at Salempur under Tariyani block on a scooty. Three motorcycle-borne assailants intercepted Pallavi near Deokuli Dam and fired at her from close range.

The injured was rushed to a private hospital by locals. She, however, succumbed to her injuries during treatment. Pallavi was a resident of Sahiyari village under Riga block in Sitamarhi district.

Sheohar sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) said Pallavi was transferred to Salempur from Belahi Dullah about two months ago. “Efforts are on to identify the assailants and arrest them. The reason behind the murder is yet to be ascertained,” he added.

The daylight murder of the woman teacher has sent shockwaves among the local residents. “She used to go to her school on a two-wheeler from Sitamarhi, which the assailants were aware of. They were waiting for her near the Deokuli Dam. They fired at her soon after she reached the spot,” an investigating officer said quoting an eyewitness.

KOLKATA: Partha Roy, a resident of Northern Avenue, went to Fariapukur last Sunday to buy a remote-controlled toy to gift his nephew on his birthday. He was looking for the same one he had earlier bought for one of his relative’s son. But to his surprise, Roy looked around but could not find it at 10-15 odd toy shops in the vicinity. He had no other option but to buy something else for his nephew.Roy is not the only one. Many buyers visiting markets at China Bazaar, Bagri Market or Fariapukur are having a tough time buying items for kids. A virtual stop in import from China in the wake of a massive hike on import duty on toys, and the coronavirus scare have hit the toy trade hard.Vikash Jain, the vice-president of West Bengal Exim Association, pointed out that the customs duty has been hiked from 20% to 60% in the Budget from immediate effect. Besides, only 10% of the total import from China are now coming to India. “The shortage has pushed up the prices of most toys by 25%-30%. The number of varieties available now has also gone down. We have stock of imported toys that will last 30-40 days,” he said. He added that the coronavirus scare has also taken a toll on import f Chinese toys.Currently, over 80% toys that are sold in city markets are imported from China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the UK and Germany. Bengal is a Rs 1,000 crore market for toys while Kolkata alone account for Rs 700-750 crore. There are over 4,000 retail shops for toys in the city and the state figure is 10,000. The retailer and small vendors are now apprehensive that this steep hike would destroy the industry.Souvikk Ghosh, a toy retailer in Fariapukur felt the industry will cease to exist gradually. “The customs duty hike is from immediate effect, so even if some distributors have old stock, they will turn costly.

BAREILLY: A man was booked for the alleged rape and murder of his sister-in-law following the directions of a judicial magistrate in Izzatnagar. The case was booked on Friday and the accused has not been arrested so far in want of “sufficient evidence”.

According to the police, a 25-year-old woman was found dead in her house in Izzatnagar on November 16, 2019, and her mother cremated the body without informing the police.

Later her mother came to know through her neighbour that her daughter was raped by her sister’s husband, who had also strangulated her to death, police said.

The court later gave directions to the police to record the statement of the neighbour. SHO Izzatnagar police station AK Verma said he would arrest the accused once he is able to gather sufficient evidence against the accused.

“The accused cannot be arrested unless we have strong evidence against him. In the absence of the autopsy report, we have to find some conclusive evidence. Self-confession is also an option, but we don’t think that the accused will accept his guilt. I wish the mother had informed police immediately after the death of her daughter and post-mortem report would have cleared the path for an investigation,” Verma told TOI.

Notably, an application was filed in the court under 156 (3) CrPC by victim’s mother after police had earlier refused to file an FIR in the absence of post-mortem report.

According to the complaint, the victim’s mother works as a labourer at a reputed institute in Bareilly and her elder daughter was married to the accused nearly 6 years ago. Accused often used to stay at her house but days before the incident her elder daughter had a quarrel with him because of his behaviour.

On October 16, when her mother went for work with her elder daughter, the accused allegedly came to her house and raped and killed her. When mother returned home, she thought that her daughter had committed suicide and cremated her body. Few days later, her neighbours gathered courage and told her that they had heard her daughter shouting for help but didn’t interfere as it was a family matter.

The joy of marriage soon turned out be a horror of tragedy for Zilpe family when four of its members, who were returning to Nagpur in a private bus, rammed into a stationary container from behind, were killed and 16 of them injured. The incident happened at around 5:15am on Saturday on NH53 near Singori village.

Around 35 ‘baraatis’, including men, women and children, were returning to the city after attending marriage of Amit Zilpe, a policeman posted at police headquarter in Nagpur, from Tiroda in Gondia district when the accident took place.

The deceased have been identified as Vithabai Zilpe, 72, Karuna Wankhede, 58, Anand Athawle, 28 and Satish Jambhulkar, 35. Vithabai was the grandmother of the groom. While Karuna and Anand were killed on the spot, the other two succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Bhandara which is just 15 to 20 kilometres away from the accident spot.

It is learnt that Karuna and Anand were stuck inside the damaged parts of the bus and had to be pulled out by police.

Mauda police have registered a case of rash driving and death due to negligence against drivers of the bus and the stationary container. Both the drivers are currently absconding. The driver of the container has been booked as he parked the vehicle without taking proper precautions.

Police sources said the bus driver was driving the vehicle at a high speed and might have fallen asleep following which it rammed into the container which was stationed on far left of the road, leaving the traffic on the national highway blocked for several hours. Such was the impact of the accident, that the bus split from middle till the third seat and the container’s head turned to 90% to the right.

Uncle of the groom, Arvind Zilpe, who was also travelling in the bus, told TOI, “We left the marriage hall in Tiroda at around 10pm on Friday. We were travelling to Nagpur when suddenly early in the morning our bus rammed into the container. It led to a chaos but we managed to calm people.”

Soon, a traveller informed police control room, and Mauda police, led by PI Madhukar Gite, rushed to the spot.

By the time help arrived, Vithabai and Satish who were seriously injured in the accident were sent to a hospital in Bhandara by their relatives but they died later, police said.

Police sent the injured to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Nagpur where two persons were declared dead. Bodies of the deceased were later sent to Mayo Hospital where their postmortem were conducted.

“We used cranes to remove both the vehicle from the spot. We have also started search of both the drivers in the case,” said PI Gite.

The Trichy-Chennai National Highway 38

TRICHY: As a part of eliminating the accident black spot on the Trichy-Chennai National Highway 38, National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has launched civil work on a vehicular underpass on the highway at Srirangam. The proposed four-lane underpass will link Kondayampettai in Srirangam with Thiruvalarsolai and adjoining agrarian hamlets on Kallanai Road bordering the neighbouring Thanjavur district.

According to NHAI Trichy Project Implementation Unit (PIU), the underpass was sanctioned by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) based on suggestions by the NHAI to eliminate accidents on the stretch. Hundreds of vehicles from Kondayampettai and Srirangam cross the busy Trichy-Chennai NH every day amidst the heavy volume of speeding vehicles to reach Thiruvalarsolai on Kallanai Road and Grand Anicut dam, a major tourist attraction.

As accidents are frequent on the stretch, the underpass on the lines of the one at Samayapuram on the Trichy-Chennai NH was suggested on the NH near Iraniyamman temple. NHAI through the concessionaire of Samayapuram toll plaza has taken up the civil work on the underpass at an estimated cost of Rs 15 crore after getting permission from the MoRTH.

Ahead of installing the underpass, NHAI has launched the civil work on service roads. Vehicles using the Trichy-Chennai NH can use the 400-metre two-lane service roads until the completion of the work. “Once the work on the service roads is completed, the portion of the Trichy-Chennai NH will be closed,” an official source with NHAI said. The seven-metre wide service roads are being relaid by the concessionaire of Samayapuram toll plaza. NHAI said work will take 8-9 months to complete. “Kondayampettai-Thiruvalarcholai road intersection is a major black spots on Trichy-Chennai NH,” G Kanaga Rajan, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours, said.

NAGPUR: Reading a favourite book with a beverage to boot is a high in itself, but engaging in a lively and engaging conversation with the stars who put their pens to paper is a high of a different kind, a culture which is slowly gaining momentum due to the rise in the number of literature festivals being held in the city in the last three months.

Right from the Orange City Literature Festival which was held in December to the Vidarbha Literary Festival and the ongoing Nagpur Literary Festival, engrossing and enthralling sessions have taken the theme ‘celebrating literature’ to an altogether new level.

To get to know their side of the story, TOI spoke to a few citizens and authors .

Mrunal Naik, project head of the Orange City Literature Festival believes that such festivals satisfy the literature needs of avid readers. “It’s really nice that the city is witnessing such initiatives. Readers are getting the opportunity to interact with renowned authors and personalities in Nagpur. I hope this trend continues for years to come. One gets to attend multiple sessions and there are a variety of topics to choose from,” said Naik.

People from all age groups can be found at these festivals. They are either soaking in the knowledge or lending their ears to celebrity speakers. “Literature festivals are attracting more and more authors to Nagpur, irrespective of the genre. This will help Nagpur to shine on the world literary map,” said Hemant Lodha, chairman of the Vidarbha Literary Festival.

For Swati Sani, literature festivals have opened new doors for budding authors to make a big impression by talking about their creative work and interacting with their readers or future readers.

“Interacting with authors helps readers to understand the art of writing and interpreting. Local authors are also getting a stage to showcase their literary work which is truly appreciable,” said Sani.

Dr Naznin Chimthanawala, an author and psychologist, spoke about the gains from literature festivals. “In today’s fast-paced world, where people are busy on their mobile phones, literature festivals offer a much-needed positive escape. People not only meet authors, they also meet other literature lovers which is a very healthy sign.” she said.

Right from science to romance, history to sexuality, there is something for every book lover because of the multiple sessions that are conducted. “People are coming in good numbers to enjoy the lit fests. I think it’s a great opportunity to bond over books and interact with your favourite authors,” said, Mandar Pandhare, an active participant in city’s social events.

Rashmi Priya, another literature lover, said, “We get to learn a lot from authors and their writing journeys. Lit fests are very motivating for youngsters as their minds are filled with curiosity and creativity.”

Suresh Akotkar is not only an avid reader but also an author. He is all praise for the literature wave that has swept the city. “People always appreciate good books but with such kind of events, they even get to celebrate the authors in person. People come enthusiastically to attend and engage in mindful conversation with the authors.”

Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey

PATNA: Fame can sometimes be a burden, but going unrecognised can be much more problematic. State health minister Mangal Pandey discovered it the hard way when a police officer stopped him from entering the venue for a foundation stone laying ceremony of a hospital in Siwan district on Friday.

A video went viral on Saturday in which Pandey, who is also a native of Siwan district, can be heard rebuking an assistant sub-inspector of police (ASI), Ganesh Chauhan, for preventing him from entering the venue of the function. “Pagal ho gaye ho kya? Mantri ko nahi pahchanta hai (Have you lost your senses? You don’t recognize the minister),” he said.

The minister didn’t stop there. Going a step further, he asked sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Jitendra Pandey to place the cop in question under suspension. “Isko turant suspend karo. Isko kaun yahan duty lagaya hai (Suspend him immediately. Who has deployed him here on duty?” the minister can be heard telling the SDPO, who was assigned to take care of the VIPs.

Apart from governor Phagu Chauhan, a number of ministers and BJP functionaries were present at the function. State art, culture and youth affairs minister Pramod Kumar, who was watching the scene from close distance, however, preferred not to intervene with a lower rung police officer.

In a bid to pacify the minister, who was angry over the cop’s (mis) behaviour, the SDPO assured the former of looking into the matter on a priority basis. “I will apprise my seniors about his (Ganesh Chauhan’s) misconduct. He should not have behaved even with common people so rudely,” the SDPO told the minister before he left for the venue.

A BJP functionary, who was just behind the health minister, said on condition of anonymity, “It was more humiliating for him (minister) as he was surrounded by many supporters, who later introduced him to the police officer on duty. Pandey, a native of Siwan district, was earlier the state president of the BJP.”

The ASI Chauhan, however, had no regrets for the incident. “I was doing my job. Frisking was being conducted at the entrance gate of the venue for the function. I signalled him to stop for frisking because I didn’t recognise him. The rest depends on my seniors,” he told this newspaper.

Last year, the minister had hogged the limelight when a video surfaced in which he could be heard asking about the India-Pakistan match score amid a press briefing held by Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan to discuss the ways to cope with the AES deaths in Muzaffarpur and other parts of the state.

Meanwhile, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav slammed the health minister for seeking suspension of the police officer. “Shocked to see how Bihar’s health minister is bragging about his entitlement. Assuming the Cop on duty couldn’t recognize the minister & requested for identification, does it behove of a minister to publicly threaten & humiliate him? Power drunk minister shd be suspended instead (sic),” Tejashwi tweeted on Saturday.

The coal furnaces are used to smelt copper and zinc for manufacturing brass and molding it into shapes.

BAREILLY: In an attempt to curb air pollution due to emissions of toxic fumes from brass furnaces in UP’s Moradabad, the Pollution Control Board in collaboration with Moradabad’s district administration and civic authorities is chalking out a plan to replace use of coal to fire furnaces with piped natural gas ( PNG ).

According to officials at the Pollution Control Board in Moradabad, there are approximately 5,000 big and small metal manufacturing units operating in the city and some are running in residential areas. They coal furnaces are used to smelt copper and zinc for manufacturing brass and molding it into shapes. Aluminum and silver are also smelted. Most of the units flout pollution norms. Despite frequent crackdowns on erring operators, not much has been achieved. This time around, efforts are being made to replace the pollution emitting units with gas furnace to reduce air pollution. A private gas agency has been roped in for the purpose, said officials.

Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, regional officer, Moradabad, Ajay Kumar Sharma told TOI, “The pollution board, district administration and Moradabad Municipal Corporation are jointly working on a plan to completely eliminate the coal furnaces from the city and replace them with gas-based furnaces. The PNG-based furnaces are expected to reduce level of air pollution as compared to coal furnaces that emit a huge amount of carbon dioxide.”

Speaking with TOI, deputy commissioner (industries) Anuj Kumar said, “Around 5,000 big and small metal units are currently operational in Moradabad and all of them use coal-based furnaces for smelting metals. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CBCB), the city was among the 10 most polluted cities (persistently recording ‘severe’ AQI levels) in the country in 2019. It is a matter of concern and, therefore, a plan is underway to control the air pollution. The work will be taken up in phases. Initially, all coal-based furnaces will be converted into PNG-based furnaces.”

Kumar added, “The gas supplying agency will soon be applying for an NOC from the nagar nigam to undertake digging work in parts of city in order to lay the gas pipelines for supply of PNG to these units. All the areas where the coal-based furnaces are being used will be covered under the project. By doing so, the livelihood of those working in the brass units will not suffer as these will not be shut down. The use of green fuel will also help in environment conservation.”

Recently, residents of Rehmat Nagar under Katghar police station limits had lodged a complaint with district administration regarding air pollution from metal furnaces in residential areas and had demanded closure of such units. So far, around 80 metal manufacturing units flouting pollution board norms have been shut down by Moradabad Pollution Control Board.

Taking out a protest march on medical college campus, the resident doctors demanded revocation of NSA charges against Khan. The medicos said raising one’s voice against injustice is not a crime and Khan should be released immediately.

Shouting slogans against UP police and the state government, the medicos also demanded withdrawal of Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Talking with mediapersons, president of RDA, Dr Hamza Malik, wondered how can a doctor, who has organised several free health camps to save people from encephalitis and floods, be a threat to the nation.

Dr Shahnawaz Iqubali, vice-president of RDA, said the government’s move of slapping NSA on Khan was nothing more than a blatant attempt to suppress his voice.

210,['16/02/2020'],All 61 anti-CAA protesters skip hearing on damages in Bijnor,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Anti- protesters of CAA

BIJNOR: All the 61 alleged protesters who were served notices by the local administration to recover damages for their alleged activities during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest last year failed to turn up at the hearing of the case at the ADM court here on Saturday. Additional district magistrate Avadesh Mishra has now advanced the final date of hearing by two days. Now, it is scheduled to take place on February 17.

Speaking with TOI, ADM Mishra said, “We have given one more opportunity to the protesters who were served notice. The hearing was to be completed on Saturday but none of the 61 accused attended the proceedings. We have now fixed February 17 as the final date. If anyone skips the next hearing, procedure for attaching their property will be initiated. Any further pleas will not be accepted.”

According to officials, a massive protest took place against the CAA in Bijnor district on December 20. Protests turned violent in eight towns of the district, including Bijnor, Nahtaur, Jalalabad, Nagina, Chandpur, Najibabad and Sherkot. The protesters allegedly burnt vehicles and vandalized shops.

The worst-affected towns were Bijnor and Nahtaur. In Nahtaur, two persons were killed in firing. More than 40 police personnel across district were injured. More than 3,900 protesters were booked under various IPC sections, including sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 307 (attempt to murder), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).

More than 150 protesters were arrested from various parts of the district. So far, more than 70% of those arrested have come out of jail on bail.

The administration had assessed damage to public properties at Rs 21.70 lakh and served notices on 61 protesters. ADM Mishra awarded 30 days to them for their explanation. All the accused submitted their explanation, asserting that they were not involved in damaging properties. The date was scheduled for hearing the matter on February 15. Government counsel appeared in the court but none of the protesters served notices showed up to attend the proceedings. Now, next date has been fixed on February 17.

Mishra said, “We kept on waiting for them but they did not reach y court. That is why, I think it is justifiable to give one more opportunity to the accused. If they do not come on February 17, I will have to initiate legal proceedings against them. Later, their pleas will not be conceded.”

Short-circuit sparked the fire on Saturday morning

Vadodara: A godown of a water bottling company at Makarpura GIDC was gutted as short-circuit sparked fire on Saturday early morning.

According to fire department sources, short-circuit in electrical wires in the company’s godown led to fire which engulfed the entire facility within a short time.

The company’s workers smelt the smoke when they were asleep in the area. Thankfully they evacuated the area in nick of time thus managing to save their lives.

Meanwhile, firemen from Makarpura GIDC fire station reached the spot immediately and saw the plastic bottles burning furiously.

A fire official said that the water jugs caught fire quickly as these were all made of plastic material. “We showered water but as these were made of plastic fire spread quickly. Our men could save some of the jugs, but the company claims to have suffered losses in lakhs of rupees,” the fire official said.

The company provides drinking water in these jugs to several commercial establishments in the city.

Rajkot: A day after four women staffers including the principal of Bhuj-based Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute were booked for outraging the modesty of 68 girls, the victims now fear a different kind of backlash for their mutiny.

The girls now are mortally frightened that principal Rita Raniga, who is dominating by nature and the main culprit who orchestrated the shameful exercise, may heap serious reprisal on the girls. Monday’s strip test opened a Pandora’s box of other issues with the institute.

Talking to TOI, the victim said: “It’s not that all the teachers were in favour of Raniga’s exercise. There were many teachers who objected and of them one was even thrashed by Raniga for trying to physically protect the girls. Raniga often insulted teachers in the assembly hall in front of all the students.”

Raniga “asked her (the teacher) not to interfere in the matter” and also gave a deaf ear to many other teachers who pleaded her not to go ahead with the test, said one of the victims.

The girl further said that the teachers who started to voice their objections verbally after a few students began to cry, “were told by Rita Ma’am to keep quiet if they wanted to continue in the job”.

Such is their fear for her, that students have nicknamed Raniga as “terror”.

The girls also said that the claim that they are informed of all these rules prior to admission is false. “When we joined the college we were not informed about the rules regarding periods at that time. Only after joining we came to know about these strict rules. We are also not allowed to wear western outfits in college and have to wear traditional clothes only. If a legging is slightly above the ankle, the student is punished for wearing such a short garment,” another student said, insisting repeatedly not to be quoted for fear of being tormented again.

The girls also complained that they are made to clean the entire hostel area owing to a shortage of staff inside the hostel. They are also ordered to help the kitchen staff in cooking and cleaning.

217,['16/02/2020'],Nagpur: CBSE enters the world of memes to calm anxious nerves,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Nagpur: On Saturday afternoon, the CBSE entered a previously uncharted territory on social media as it created its first ever set of memes .

The central board pleasantly surprised the internet when its official handle on Facebook displayed two memes related to board exams, which kicked off on Saturday with optional subjects. The posts were soon racing around in WhatsApp groups comprising mostly academicians and were also shared on unofficial school/class groups.

Senior PRO of CBSE Rama Sharma said the idea was to connect with young kids. “To engage with students in a meaningful and interesting way, we have developed memes for the first time and posted them on social media handles.” The board has been smartly using social media to not only propagate messages but to also counter fake news on the platform.

Ad guru Sanjay Arora said this is a welcome move by CBSE since the board is communicating with teenagers. “I am really happy that the CBSE has done such a thing because you have to speak the language of your target audience. It’s a brilliant move by the board,” said Arora.

Students too are loving the social media-friendly board and its antics. Manav Wadhwani, a Std X student, said “Memes are often the only way these days that youngsters like us are getting updated with the current affairs. This form of adaptation by CBSE was unexpected, but I am pretty sure it will be fun to go through. I am in full support of CBSE using memes to guide us children, especially those appearing for boards.”

Abhishek Gallewale, also a Std X student, said “I think this a great initiative to distress students from the pressure of exams. They should do it more often to keep the students charged up and increase the humour quotient a bit more next time.”

For the current memes, CBSE is pushing the hashtags #examtime #beontime #dontbelate #discipline #youcandoit #the unstoppableyou #preparewell #bestofluck. It is on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and a simple search for “CBSE HQ” will guide students and parents online to these social media handles.

The board exams kicked off on Saturday for optional /vocational subjects with 55,364 students appearing for them across the country.

218,['16/02/2020'],Yasmin Shaikh: How a bar girl became Mumbai's crime queen,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Yasmin Shaikh

MUMBAI: Her rap sheet shows 53 cases of theft. Meet Yasmin Shaikh , the crime queen on Mumbai railways who has been allegedly stealing from female commuters for more than a decade. Her crimes are said to have financed a flat in Govandi and a boarding school for her oldest daughter. Shaikh (37) is currently in the custody of Wadala GRP.

Shaikh started her career as a bar girl . She lived at Antop Hill at the time. Following the state ban on bars, she took to crime. Initially, she partnered with other women snatchers. One of the snatchers advised her to don a burkha to avoid getting identified and she followed the advice even after she went solo. Twice married, Shaikh has three children. Her oldest, a 15-year-old girl, studied in a boarding school at Panchgani and chose not to live with her mother afterwards.

“On January 26, a teacher approached Wadala GRP chowky and said she had been looted on the Harbour line at Kurla the previous evening. She said a woman in a burkha was standing close to her as she boarded a packed train. Later, she couldn’t find her mangalsutra,” said an officer. When the police checked the CCTV footage from the station, they guessed who the thief was. “We identified Shaikh from the footage on the basis of gait and picked her up near her current home at Govandi. Around 5.5 tolas of gold was found on her,” said senior inspector Rajendra Pal.

But the police were convinced Shaikh had amassed more stolen valuables and had hidden them. Subsequently, a GRP team reached her residence and searched it thoroughly. “We found gold ornaments and cash stashed in empty tiffin boxes,” said Pal. Stolen cellphones were also found. Combined with the previous day’s recovery, the value of all stolen valuables came to nearly Rs 8 lakh. Police also learnt that Shaikh had paid Rs 16 lakh for the Govandi house, though the property is yet to be officially transferred in her name.

One of Shaikh’s modi operandi was to enter women’s coaches carrying an infant. She would stand close to her target and on the pretext of pacifying the crying infant, slip her fingers through her target’s handbag. In some cases, she was found covering her face with a bag to avoid getting captured on camera. Whenever her case is scheduled to be heard in court, she instructs her family to bring an infant to court to gain sympathy, said cops. Outside railway premises, she has also been involved in thefts at Dharavi and Kurla.

219,['16/02/2020'],"Nagpur: Now, 24/7 cops’ presence at board exam custody centres","This story is from February 16, 2020

NAGPUR: Taking a cue from last year’s board exam evaluation scam in Nagpur, officials from the divisional board office have revamped security measures at custody centres where answer sheets are stored post the exam.

The biggest change in the new system is that cops will be present round the clock at these sensitive custody centres where answer sheets are brought straight from the examination hall after the exam is over. The other changes include increase in the custody centres and number of personnel deployed there.

In 2019, Nagpur cops busted a racket in which the solved answer sheets were being replaced in the original bundles in connivance with people at custody centres, evaluators and touts. Though the board has a very secretive and almost foolproof system in place meant to ensure that the paper evaluator’s identity is never revealed to the student and vice versa, some people were able to find a weak link at the custody centre. The replacement of answer sheets too never got caught till 2019 as they were using original booklets and hologram stickers. Till last year, extra unused answer sheets and holograms were not properly accounted for by the board which led to their misuse by unscrupulous characters.

Ravikant Deshpande, chairman of the Nagpur divisional board, said, “Every custody centre will now have 24/7 police presence. We have also changed many custody centres and also increased their numbers to spread out the answer sheet bundles.”

Starting this year, the board has also eliminated the problem of unused sensitive material through efficient monitoring. Now a proper count of total answer sheets and holograms given to every exam centre is noted and this will be matched against the number of students who actually appeared. The exam material will be accounted for properly when the excess is being returned to the board.

A senior principal told TOI that earlier, everyone was very lax. “Teachers would just go and return the bundle and say that all unused 50 sheets are here. But in reality, that bundle contained 45 sheets or maybe 47. Nobody knew and that’s how the pilferage started,” said the principal.

The increase in personnel at the custody centre has, however, not gone down well with the people being called to report for duty. Sharad Bhandarkar, a zilla parishad employee and office bearer of one faction of the union, said, “ZP schools’ primary teachers have been assigned duty at custody centres from February 17 till March 16. Now what is the role of primary teachers for an exam that is related to high school and junior college? And who will teach ZP school kids when these teachers are away on duty. We will be meeting officials and requesting them to reconsider their decision.”

DEHRADUN: A verbal tussle has resumed between ex-chief minister Harish Rawat and his successor Trivendra Singh Rawat . While Harish Rawat accused BJP of making Uttarakhand into a “state of instability”, CM Trivendra Singh hit back saying that the statement of the former CM might have been made in wake of the “poor condition of Congress party”.

Hinting at a possible change of CM by the BJP, Harish Rawat in his post said that judging by the results of Delhi polls and the activities in BJP, it looked as if the “state was heading towards another political instability”. He further wrote that BJP was responsible for pushing Uttarakhand into instability right from the time the state was created. “I stand by what I have written. Any change hampers the development work and pushes the state backwards,” Harish Rawat said on Saturday.

Meanwhile, the post on social media by the former CM has further set tongues wagging about the speculations on change of CM in the state.

On the sidelines of an event, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat said, “[Harish] Rawat ji is a senior leader of opposition party and is performing his duty.” He did not fail to take a swipe at the senior Congress leader quipping that if the post was linked to the recent Delhi polls, then, “he needs to give it a serious thought as Congress has performed worst there”.

The CM also said that the BJP has increased its vote share as well as the number of seats in Delhi and “if anyone has lost everything, it was the Congress party”.

The yield is exclusively used for preparation of midday meals. Magdalene said if there’s any excess, it’ sold locally and the revenue is used for school development work.

“Currently, there is a water supply issue on campus. Students, who don’t want their garden to go dry, collect water from all possible sources, including waste water used for cleaning vessels and plates,” she said. The school, built in 1945, has 43 students in classes one to seven with four teachers and two honorary teachers. Most students are children of migrants from other parts of Karnataka who are daily wage labourers and have no formal education.

TOKYO/ DELHI: The Indian embassy in Japan on Saturday said it is making efforts to disembark all the Indians on board the cruise ship moored off the Japanese coast after the end of the quarantine period as authorities confirmed that 218 people, including three Indians, have been infected with the deadly disease on the ship.

Official sources said Indian officials were in touch with Japanese authorities and were making all efforts possible to ensure the well being of the three Indians who tested positive.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and six passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the quarantined ship that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month. It was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.

The Indian embassy is in contact with Japanese authorities, the ship management company and Indian nationals on board the ship. “We have continued our efforts for early disembarkation of our nationals after the end of the quarantine period and subject to favourable results of their tests,” an embassy official told PTI on Saturday.

A third Indian crew on board a cruise ship off the Japanese coast tested positive for the virus, taking the total number of infected Indians to three. The embassy has contacted all three Indians who are currently receiving treatment at medical facilities.

Hyderabad: The Association of Surgeons of India (SAI) has started training future surgeons (PG students of general surgery) in critical care , breaking bad news to patients, communicating with patients and relatives etc to improve human touch, patient interaction and overall quality of surgeons. In the first batch, 50 trainee surgeons from Telangana have undergone the training. Meanwhile, the association will make a representation to the union health ministry to include these courses as mandatory courses in medical curriculum.

Courses such as basic surgical skills course, surgical skills training, critical care course and communication skills course are areas which are currently untouched in MBBS curriculum.

“These subjects are largely untouched and need to be focussed upon. In the three years of the MS (general surgery) programme, even though trainees work in a ward, see and operate on patients, important elements like how to make an incision, how to hold each instrument, how to break bad news is not formally taught,” said Dr P Raghuram, President, Association of Surgeons of India.

The trainees undergoing these courses will also be presenting papers overseas at conferences overseas, so they can learn and collaborate with counterparts from across the world.

“At any given time in India, there are over 3,000 surgical trainees in the system, who are indeed the future of ASI . Therefore enhancing their knowledge base and improving their skills is of paramount importance for the future of surgery,” added the official.

Lord Bhikhu Parekh (centre) at Navrachana University

Vadodara: “Mahatma Gandhi was a complex personality which many have failed to understand till date,” — said Lord Bhikhu Parekh, member of UK’s House of Lords, at an event in the city on Saturday.

Parekh, former vice-chancellor of M S University and an eminent political theorist, was delivering a lecture on ‘Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy: A critical assessment’ at the city-based Navrachana University (NU) as part of NU’s ‘Samvaad’, a celebrity lecture series.

The Padma Bhushan awardee said that no biography of Gandhi so far has been able either fully capture or illuminate the complexity, tensions and apparent contradictions of Mahatma’s personality. He said nobody has been able to elucidate the sources of his powerful emotional hold over so many of his associates as well as his countrymen in general.

It was his (Bapu’s) conviction that India should not be partitioned, but he was not prepared to impose this view on others, said Parekh, who himself has penned several books on Gandhi. Parekh added that at times even he believes that they could have been better.

He said that even the then Congress leaders could not understand Gandhi. “It is very obvious because of the complexity of his personality,” said Parekh.

Responding to query whether political leaders of the country are using Gandhi’s name to serve their own purpose, Parekh said that world over, names of eminent political leaders are used by the political leadership. India is no exception to the general rule, he said.

Opining that today’s youth are moving fast towards consumerism, he said that it is totally different from what Gandhi used to believe.

Madurai: The overall road fatalities in southern districts have come down by 11.18% in 2019 compared to its previous year, according to data available with the Tamil Nadu police. In 2018, there were 2,746 road deaths in nine southern districts, while in 2019, the number came down to 2,439. However, while many districts succeeded in bringing down the road deaths in 2019, a few have seen a rise in the number.

Various departments like police, transport and district administrations are working together more enthusiastically to bring down road accidents and deaths for the past four years. A team comprising officials led by transport commissioner T S Jawahar recently reviewed road accident prevention in Madurai and Virudhunagar districts and took stock of the situation. The year 2018 witnessed 12,200 deaths, and it came down to 10,500 in 2019.

Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts stood out among the nine southern districts as they managed to bring down the accident deaths respectively by 22.56% and 22.27% respectively. However, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin fared badly, as they witnessed an increase by 3.64% and 1.73% respectively.

Virudhunagar superintendent of police P Perumal told TOI that various efforts like introducing zig zag barricades at important junctions and road studs, used as reflectors and increase in traffic violation cases like helmet, drunk and drive and overspeeding have helped the police bring down the accident rate. “Last year, we had a target of 20% reduction in road fatality, which we achieved. This year, 15% reduction has been fixed and we are working to achieve it as well,” he said.

Police officials said that identification of places, where accidents take place frequently and improving safety in such places has helped bring down accidents. Apart from doing some modification in road engineering to improve safety, locals in such areas have been sensitized to use roads cautiously.

Rajkot: Mystery shrouds the death of a 65-year-old man , who claimed that he was poisoned before his demise on Saturday in Rajkot.

According to police, the victim Dhanji Kasiyani was brought to Rajkot Civil Hospital by his live-in partner Jignasa Vasiyani and his son Balkrushna. At the hospital, Kasiyani was declared brought dead.

Kasiyani had arrived in Rajkot from his native Jayava village of Dhrol taluka in Jamnagar district on Saturday afternoon, after which he made a call to his uncle.

“His uncle made us listen to the audio clip of his telephonic conversation with Kasiyani in which Kasiyani was heard saying that he was victim to blackmailing and that four men had siphoned off Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh from him. He also talked about his live-in relationship with Vasiyani,” said an official from University police station, while refusing to divulge the name of Kasiyani’s uncle, citing secrecy of the investigation.

Police said that Kasiyani made his last call to his uncle, saying that he had been poisoned. His uncle called up Kasiyani’s son Balkrushna, who rushed to Rajkot. Balkrushna knew about Kasiyani’s relationship with Vasiyani. So he went straight to her home in Ratnam Pride Residency near Ghanteshwer SRP Camp and found Kasiyani lying unconscious. Then both Vasiyani and Balkrushna rushed Kasiyani to the civil hospital where the doctors declared him dead on arrival.

As Kasiyani was at Vasiyani’s house, the needle of suspicion pointed towards her. However, in her statement to the police, Vasiyani claimed, “When he came to my house, he said he had been thrown out of his house. Then he started spitting blood, following which I called up Balkrushna. He was poisoned much before he came to my house.”

Meanwhile, the police have launched an investigation into the case. “As of now, we have little evidence to draw any conclusion in this case. We are investigating as to who had made Kasiyani consume poison,” added the official.

The duo sat in the ditch with their motorcycle and said they would not move till the issue is resolved.

The incident took place on Saturday morning when the duo was travelling together on the same motorcycle. They tried to avoid the ditch filled with water, but somehow ended up falling in it. Since they had been seeing he ditch since quite some time now, they decided to sit at the site itself in protest.

Opposition Congress councillor from the area Anil Parmar said that the two men Ghanshyam Parmar and Vijay Patil were known to him.

“They called me after the incident and said that they would sit there itself in protest. There is a leakage in a water supply pipeline at the spot since 15-20 days. It was repaired twice, but the problem recurred,” said Parmar.

Parmar pointed out that VMC officials swung into action soon after the protest and the pipeline was repaired. “I requested the duo to leave the place to which they agreed,” he said.

Congress leader Imran Pratapgarhi

BAREILLY: Congress leader Imran Pratapgarhi , who had contested 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Moradabad constituency, has been issued Rs 1.04 crore show cause notice for “violating section 144” by addressing anti-CAA protesters at a sit-in in Moradabad. People, including a large number of women, have been protesting at the city Eidgah since January 29, and such notices, according to an official, are “only precautionary measure to avert violent protests”.

In the notice issued by additional city magistrate (first) Rajesh Kumar, Pratapgarhi has been asked to explain why Rs 1.04 crore “spent on deploying force to maintain law and order in and around the Eidgah should not be recovered from him”. Pratapgarhi, who has termed the notice as “pressure tactics by the BJP government to silence opposition’s voice”, has been accused by the administration of allegedly provoking people of a particular community and fuelling enmity between two communities. According to him, the notice was issued on February 6.

Also, he has been asked to explain why he should not submit a personal bond of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties. Administrative sources stated that Rs 13.42 lakh is spent per day on the police and paramilitary forces, including one platoon of Rapid Action Force, half section of Provincial Armed Constabulary and police force deployed at the Eidgah. So, the eight-day expense adds up to Rs 1.04 crore.

Reacting to the notice, Pratapgarhi told TOI on Saturday, “I reached Moradabad on February 7. But, the notice was issued on February 6. Besides, I had informed the SP (city) as well as the administration of my visit so that they could provide me security. I reached the Eidgah directly. During my address, I also appreciated the police and administration for their support.”

“I have been participating in similar protests and sit-ins across the country, but not received any such notice. Lately, I was in Lucknow. And I addressed the people there. Local administration says that section 144 is in force. But, it is actually for those who are opposing the government. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya recently reached Moradabad and addressed a large gathering in support of CAA but for him section 144 is not effective,” he said, claiming that he was yet to receive a copy of the notice and will challenge the matter in court.

ACM Kumar, however, explained, “The sit-in organisers and Congress leader Imran Pratapgarhi have been issued notices. Since, section 144 is in force in the district any such assembly is unlawful. Police had informed us on February 6 about his arrival the next day. So, we had to issue the notice on the same date. Such notices are issued as precautionary measures to warn those people who may pose a threat to law and order. No further action will be taken until any untoward situation erupts at the protest site. We mentioned an amount of Rs 1.04 crore in the notice. Imran has been instructed to submit a personal bond of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties.”

Notably, the administration in Moradabad has issued notices to at least 12 individuals, which include Imran Pratapgarhi. The official further said that 11 of them had already submitted a personal bond of Rs 5 lakh each. Pratapgarhi was given seven days to respond which has now expired.

Security personnel patrol the premises of Taj mahal on saturday

AGRA: As part of his two-day visit to India later this month, US President Donald Trump is likely to visit the Taj Mahal on February 24.

Senior officials said that though no official programme has been announced by the White House so far, they have received a tentative date of his visit. According to the tentative schedule, Trump is likely to reach Taj city from Ahmedabad at 4.30pm on February 24 and spend over two hours there. The Ahmedabad-Agra route details are being worked out, sources claimed. They added that besides Air Force One, there could be VH 3D sea planes and White Hawks flying from Ahmedabad to Agra. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are likely to visit the world heritage monument in the evening and then depart for New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi would host a magnificent dinner reception for the couple.

Officials said that a high-level team from the US embassy is scheduled to visit Agra on Monday to discuss the modalities of Trump’s visit. The delegation would also comprise security experts who are likely to review the arrangements at Taj too.

On Saturday, a preparatory meeting, chaired by divisional commissioner Anil Kumar and attended by police and district administration officials, was held in connection with the proposed visit of the US President.

Earlier this month, the White House had announced that the US President and First Lady would visit India on February 24 and 25. Prime Minister Narendra Modi would host the couple in Ahmedabad and New Delhi. This will be Trump’s first visit to India as US President and will also be a state visit .

Late US President Dwight Eisenhower was the first Potus to visit the Taj Mahal over five decades ago. It was an open Cadillac ride accompanied by Jawaharlal Nehru in December 1959. Bill Clinton had also visited the monument of love in 2000.

240,['16/02/2020'],Maharashtra: 40 surya namaskars a day keep ‘101-year-old’ granny fit,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Laxmi Damle recently taught 10,000 schoolchildren surya namaskar

MUMBAI: Laxmibai Damle says she believes in keeping fit. For this the woman from Ratnagiri , who her family members claim is a 101 years old, does at least 40 surya namaskar every morning .

Days after she taught 10,000-plus Kalyan school kids surya namaskar, TOI met her at a relative’s home in Borivli. The petite woman was attired in a nine-yard blue saree and red blouse, her silver-grey hair was rolled into a neat bun. She has no teeth but her wrinkled skin glows. As Laxmibai is hard of hearing, her niece, Sulakshana Bodas, and husband Sarvottam, whose residence Laxmibai was visiting, played interpreter.

The day TOI met her this past week, she had already done 40 surya namaskar for the day earlier in the morning.

Asked if she would do a few more, Laxmibai readily agreed. Sitting ramrod straight on the floor, she crossed her legs and stretched her palms upwards. Adjusting the folds of her nine-yard saree, she tucked the loose end of her pallu around the midriff, bent forward to touch her feet, her red glass bangles cling-clanging. And then, in one fell swoop, she lunged forward and the next moment her body was in the plank position—parallel to the floor. All along, Laxmibai kept chanting ‘Om Surya Namaha’.

“Whenever we look at her, she’s doing the surya namaskar, especially when she feels a bit uneasy,” says Sarvottam Bodas. Days earlier, when he woke up in the middle of the night, he found her busy at her fitness mantra at that unearthly hour.

Laxmibai, who hails from Kolamabe village, says she learnt to do the surya namaskar when she was in school. “It was a Christian teacher at Agashe Kanya Shala in Ratnagiri who taught me the namaskar,” she says, admitting that she is not too educated.

Married at the age 13, her husband and his family never objected to her penchant for exercise. A light eater, Laxmibai has a weakenss for sweets. “But I have no ailments at all. Till today, I haven’t popped pills for any sickness. The surya namaskar is my medicine,” she says.

Even today, she helps with household chores, including shredding vegetables and preparing buttermilk with churner. “Just for timepass,” she says. Earlier, when she could hear properly, she loved watching Marathi serials on television, says Sulakshana.

“But she hates watching movies in cinema halls as she does not like to sit in the AC. She is not too fond of Hindi serials on TV either as she does not know the language,” Sulakshana adds.

Overall, Laxmibai is content with her life. “My family members take good care of me,” she says, still sitting ramrod straight. “At my age, there’s nothing I need, nothing I long for.”

Madurai: The city tour service started by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Madurai division, has failed to get many takers due to lack of publicity. Although the service is much needed, with many domestic and foreign tourists, thronging the city, not many are aware of the availability of such service.

TNSTC launched the service in the second week of January by utilising the buses connecting Ellis Nagar parking lot and Meenakshi Amman Temple. During Sabarimala and Pongal seasons, 20 TNSTC buses were operated connecting the temple and the parking lot. Now, around six buses are operated.

The service will take tourists to five spots such as Thiruparankundram, Thirumalai Nayak Mahal, Mariamman Teppakulam, Gandhi Museum and World Tamil Sangam at a minimum cost of Rs 125 per passenger. The launch of the city tour itself happened without informing the stakeholders or the tourism department officials.

“We get passengers enough to operate only two to four services in a day, that too because of canvassing taken up by the transport staff at the parking lot. Visitors are not informed about the availability of service, which could be a boon to them,” said a transport official.

J Sakthivel, a visitor from Salem said, “We spent Rs 1,500 on a taxi to visit a few places in the city. We were not aware of the city tour and nobody informed us about it when he inquired with the auto drivers. We could have utilized it, had we known it.”

When contacted, an official from the TNSTC said that they had erected a banner informing the facility at Ellis Nagar parking lot, but it was damaged by vandals. They are planning to erect the banner again. They are also planning to keep an advertisement board on buses to reach out to the visitors, he said.

Bara Bazaar in Nainital

NAINITAL: As the peak tourist season approaches, local residents of Nainital have asked the administration to clear the encroachments that have cropped up in and around the lake town’s markets. Residents said that vendors have been squatting on the pavements of Mall Road, as well as other prominent places like Tallital Market, Mallital and Bara Bazaar .

“Not only do they take up the space meant for pedestrians, they dispose of their waste right on the road,” said Neelam Kumar, the owner of Modern Book Depot in Nainital. Locals alleged that complaining repeatedly to the municipal council had yielded no results. “We keep making rounds of the municipality and the administration. However, the encroachment across town hasn’t changed,” Kumar added.

“The markets are less crowded these days but once the tourist season is here, the streets will be heavily crammed. Markets like Tallital and Bara Bazaar, where the lanes are not very wide, will get choked if the squatters are not removed,” added Aman Thapliyal, a trader.

The officials of municipal council when queried by TOI claimed that encroachments in the hill town will be cleared before the tourist season.

“We keep surveying the entire town from time to time to keep encroachments in check. If there are places that need to be cleared, we will do it soon,” said municipal council chairman Sachin Negi.

the start of the 3-day Chhattisgarhi Mahotsav on Saturday

NAGPUR: Six and half hours before the start of the 3-day Chhattisgarhi Mahotsav on Saturday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation issued work orders for the setting up of the stage and other facilities for the event at RTO Ground at Dipti Signal.

Even though the stage work was almost complete, there were doubts over the event being held after municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe raised several queries over the Rs 36lakh event. With the concerned departments fulfilling most of the riders, Mundhe gave the event the go-ahead.

Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane, who had proposed the fest, had already ensured that there would be no hiccups by asking the sports and cultural department to construct the stage even before work orders were issued.

Pohane told TOI that Mundhe cleared the work order on Saturday. Much of the facilities had been set up at the RTO Ground by Friday. Not just the stage, even the backdrop highlighting tradition of Chattisgarh was ready. Chairs, sofas, high posts to erect high-mast lights etc too were in place.

Pohane said work orders for some were issued earlier. “Stage work was done before the issuance of work order as it had post facto approval from the civic chief. The general body had approved the fest. Proposals were submitted to NMC three months ago but its departments delayed the process,” he said.

On Saturday, Pohane told TOI that Mundhe had stopped work orders for the event. Mayor Sandip Joshi said that administrative approval to works were approved by Mundhe’s predecessor Abhijit Bangar so the former “should not create hurdles”.

Like it was for the Akhil Bharatiya Natya Parishad and other events, it has become a practice for the civic body to get works done from private agencies, especially for cultural programmes, even before work orders are issued.

The NMC has continued to spend on various types of fests even after the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court passed strictures on it for spending funds on Nagpur Mahotsav. Then, the NMC had organized the Mahotsav by raising funds for two years only to abandon the event.

Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the event on Saturday evening. The performance of Padma Vibhushan awardee Teejan Bai, a renowned Pandwani exponent, on Sunday will be the highlight of the fest.

Ganga water has not been provided despite making several rounds to the Agra municipal corporation

AGRA: Despite repeated complaints to the civic body administration, residents of over 27 municipal wards in the city are yet to get Ganga water supply due to the absence of necessary infrastructure.

According to locals, the requisite infrastructure to supply Ganga water has not been provided despite making several rounds to the Agra municipal corporation. Paschimpuri resident Suresh Kumar said, “We have made several requests to the civic body administration seeking Ganga water supply. However, no action has been taken yet.” Shamshabad Road resident Vimal Mohan said, “The supply of Ganga water in the city was started around a year ago. However, a large part of the city is still not connected to the pipelines. The required infrastructure should be developed in a time-bound manner.”

Under the Gangajal project, Agra receives water supply from Palra headworks in Bulandshahr’s upper Ganga canal. Around 130 km of pipeline has been laid for the purpose. At present, Sikandra and Jeevan Mandi waterworks stations receive 140 cusecs of Ganga water on a daily basis.

According to data available with the civic body, only 18 municipal wards in the city have complete infrastructure for Ganga water supply. Mayor Naveen Jain said, “We receive a number of complaints from various parts of the city over Ganga water supply. We have directed officials to ensure that pipelines are laid and required infrastructure set up to provide adequate water supply to each and every household.”

Talking to TOI, Jal Sansthan officials said that a proposal has been sent to the state government for laying water supply pipelines in the said wards.

Meanwhile, residents claimed that leakage on water supply pipelines maintained by Jal Sansthan cause much wastage on a daily basis. Estimates suggest that at least 50 million litres daily (MLD) water is wasted in the city due to pipeline leakage.

Vadodara: In a policy decision, M S University will give instant justice to ‘copy cats’ from now.

Deciding to decentralize the current system where the ‘cheaters’ or students who are caught copying in exams are punished on case to case basis by the university level unfair means committee, the university’s syndicate members have decided that cases of small-time offenders should be dealt by the faculty itself.

In the earlier system, many students had to wait for months together as the appointed committee handles all such cases in bulk and submits its recommendations for approval from the university’s syndicate body.

“The university has taken this decision on a trial basis so that students who are caught in small time offences don’t end up waiting for months till the time university-level committee arrives at a conclusion,” said MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas.

The faculties will be asked to appoint their own observers and senior teachers to act upon such cases. “The idea is to take on the spot decisions.

Once, exams of students get over, the faculty level panel itself will decide on the type of punishment that the student who is caught cheating will undergo,” said Vyas.

While the role of the unfair means committee will decrease, the committee will still exist. “If the faculties come across any severe case of exam-related offence, such cases based on their severity will be reported to the committee,” said Vyas.

252,['16/02/2020'],"Nagpur: As city’s potholes grow in size, their repair cost too goes up","This story is from February 16, 2020

representative image

NAGPUR: A study by Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) has revealed that neglected potholes have cost the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) dear with the expenditure for repairs increasing manifold.

After the VNIT’s civil engineering department adopted a stretch of Hingna road for a year, a small pothole appeared in December 2016. If the NMC had repaired the pothole right away then the expenditure per sqm would have been in the region of Rs500-Rs700.

While the NMC failed to wake up from its deep slumber, the size of the pothole increased by February 2017.

However, three months later, in June 2017, the pothole became bigger and deeper and needed immediate repairs. The cost of repairs increased to Rs1,200—1,750 per sqm.

As the civic body continued to turn a blind eye, the small pothole turned into a huge crater by July 2017. This lackadaisical attitude proved costly for the civic body as now, it needs to relay the entire stretch at a cost of Rs50 lakh per km, the VNIT study revealed.

“It’s just the tip of the iceberg. With the city’s road network approximately 2,700km, the NMC needs to come up with a comprehensive road asset management system which can save wasteful expenditure worth crores of rupees,” said V Landge, head of VNIT’s civil engineering department.

The Central India’s premier institute has also submitted its study — carried out by Landge, Parag Deshpande, Udit Jain, Vivek Hokam and Abhay Tawlare — to the civic body.

“We have submitted a proposal to the NMC to launch the Nagpur road asset management system (N-RAMS) which will be a smart step for a smart city. Our service charges per annum would be Rs2 crore,” said Landge.

According to VNIT’s proposal, data collection will be done by traffic volunteers. They will use a mobile app to record details of faulty roads. VNIT has offered to develop the road severity index to help prioritize rehabilitation and also to strategize repair work within the limited budget.

The NMC has insufficient manpower to handle the city’s road network. The other concern is the limited budget for repairs and maintenance of roads.

Road maintenance is not based on measurable objective criteria but on ad hoc demands of elected representatives, stated the study.

Many a time, a bad road (especially in fringe areas) remains neglected while maintenance is carried out at locations where it is not required and the result is wasteful expenditure and deterioration of serviceability level of the overall road network, the study found.

The only solution is developing a comprehensive Road Asset Management System which will encompass the NMC assets, including roads, drains and related infrastructure, their condition (based on measurable technical criteria), its resources (budget, manpower, machinery) and contractor (quality of the work, history, reputation).

The NMC will not require permanent staff and hence, no need for additional investment as it can be done within the domain of the Smart City project.

About the implementation of the system, the study suggested geotagging of all roads, converting all roads into manageable road pieces of uniform sizes, assigning unique ID to each road, quantitative measurement to judge the quality of road in terms of defects and defect parameters, design algorithm to estimate repair cost based on defects and multidimensional analysis based on location, time, defect and contractor.

VNIT has offered to develop the road severity index to help prioritize restoration and simultaneously help to strategize repair work within limited budget.

Mayor Sandip Joshi appreciated VNIT’s study and said if NMC implements it then taxpayers’ money will be saved. “Next week a meeting between the premier institute and NMC’s chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar will be convened,” he said.

Madurai: The forest department in Theni district has announced a ban on trekking at Kurangani till further orders. The instruction came into effect from February 15 due to high possibility of forest fires as summer has begun. Trekking on the authorised and guided 11km stretch from Kurangani to Top Station through Central Station will resume after the climatic conditions turn conducive.

After the fatal fire that claimed the lives of 23 trekkers during an unapproved trek at Kurangani in March 2018, the forest department started authorised trekking from November 30, 2018. The department announced that as per the rules, trekking will be suspended annually for two months – from February 15 to April 15 – as the grass and bushes that are dried up during summer could catch fire. However, in 2019 it was suspended in the third week of January well ahead of the scheduled ban period due to non-conducive climatic conditions. A total of 69 people sought permission from the department for the trek in the less than two-month period. It is learnt that there were a few fires in and around Kurangani of which a couple of ones were on the approved trekking track.

District forest officer (DFO) S Gowtham said that it was reopened in August, after nearly seven months, as the climatic conditions were not favourable till then. This time trekking was permitted till February 15 due to conducive climatic conditions, unlike the previous year. Only around 200 people had sought permission for trekking at Kurangani from August till date.

Forest department sources said that they have drawn fire lines for about 150km in the forest under various schemes, created awareness among the locals and stakeholders and also restricted grazing in the forest to prevent fires. The department warned stringent action against those who try to trek during the ban period and those who set the grass on fire in the forest. They also asked people to report forest fires to the office of the DFO at 04546- 252552 or district disaster management unit at 1077.

AGRA: Preparation for UP Board examination for Class X and XII, scheduled to commence from February 18 are in full swing. State authorities are monitoring the preparations on a daily basis to ensure fair conduct of the exams. As part of the exercise, a photograph on the examinee’s admit card must match the one on the attendance sheet. However, the attendance sheets of several examination centres do not have any photo of the examinee.

To prevent any impersonation during the board exam, the Secondary Education Council had decided to place a fix a photograph of the candidate on the attendance sheet so that it can be matched with the admit card available with the student. But, so far, more than a dozen exam centres have found the photos of the candidates missing from the attendance sheet.

The exam centre officials have contacted the office of the district inspector of schools (DIOS), alerting it about the missing photos and the consequent problem that will arise during verification of examinees on the exam day.

Ravindra Kumar, DIOS, said, “Several cases of photographs of candidates missing from the attendance sheet have surfaced. The board authorities have been informed in this regard. Soon updated attendance sheet will be made available”.

Meanwhile, several other irregularities have also been detected in the admit card of the students. Some have errors in spellings of name of candidate and that of schools. Besides, all the subjects of the exam are not mentioned. Several teachers are complaining that they have been assigned duties at two exam centres on the same day. The DIOS office is addressing such complains every day.

Kolhapur: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Saturday issued a show-cause notice to a developer for levelling of the land in the flood-prone locality of Jadhavwadi.

Kalshetti, along with the officials of town planning department, visited the site and found that huge amount of murrum and gravels have been spread over the site. The town planning authorities said that height of the land has been increased to 3 ft which, according to them, is violation of the clause 53 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act 1966.

“The construction activities in the locality may lead to flooding in the nearby residential areas. I have asked the junior engineers to carry out the survey of the locality and check for more such activities. Also, the officials ignoring such activities will also be acted upon,” Kalshetti said.

Construction activities along the banks of Jayakwadi river are one of the reasons to aggravate the flooding situation in the low-lying areas.

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) on Saturday announced major changes in Group IV and Group II-A exams and candidates aspiring for posts of junior assistant, typist and assistant need to clear both preliminary and main exam. Till now, the commission selected candidates based on one exam for these posts.

After unearthing major scams in Group IV, Group II-A exams, the TNPSC in its meeting on Friday decided to bring major changes in the examination pattern and improve the security of answer sheets while being transported. “In the future, Group IV, Group II-A exams will have two stages — preliminary and main. To prevent impersonation, candidates need to be present at the exam centres an hour in advance,” a release from TNPSC said.

Candidates need to give their thumb impressions instead of signature on answer sheets. Details of candidates and answer sheets will be separated in the exam hall itself and sealed, and candidates need to sign on the seal. Changes have been introduced to avoid fudging of OMR sheets. “Candidates who do not know answers for multiple choice questions will have to shade a specific box provided for each question. They also need to mention the number of questions for which they used the additional box option at the end of the exam. If a candidate does not shade any of the boxes for a question, the answer sheet will become invalid,” TNPSC said. The commission has decided to allot an additional 15 minutes for filling the details.

“Transportation of answer sheets from exam centres to TNPSC office also will be strengthened. The vehicles will be GPS-tagged and CCTV cameras will be installed to monitor the answer sheets 24X7,” TNPSC added.

Following the complaints from candidates, TNPSC has unearthed major scams in Group IV and Group II-A exams. It also banned 99 candidates who wrote exams from Rameswaram and Keelakarai exam centres in Ramanathapuram district for involving in malpractices. According to the CBCID, the answer sheets of Group IV candidates were tampered with on a moving vehicle by middlemen, who shaded the correct responses for candidates from whom they had taken money. The CBCID has arrested more than 40 persons in connection with the scam so far.

TNPSC also plans to improve communication with candidates and will launch a special page on its website. “It will be helpful to receive feedbacks on new changes and help the commission know about malpractices,” the release said.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Milk tankers in contract with state-run dairy brand Aavin to supply milk to the city went into strike on Friday midnight as the management failed to float new tenders and continued to operate them at old rates for the past one year. More than 303 tankers have stopped bringing in not less than 12 lakh litres milk into Chennai. The management, however, assured that milk supply to city consumers will not be disrupted.

“We have roped in private tankers to bring in milk from various districts. There won’t be any disturbance in milk supply as all the tankers have started to come into Chennai,” said a senior Aavin official.

“Fresh tenders must have been floated a year back but were were not able to do it due to the local body elections. We will convene a meeting with the tanker operators on Sunday or Monday and try to get them to withdraw their strike,” said the official.

For Aavin, Chennai is the biggest market as the maximum amount of milk is sold in the city. Apart from retail sale of milk in Chennai and other big cities, Aavin has started selling milk in bulk as well. “Untill last year, we were converting excess milk into milk powder and that was not very profitable as the market for milk powder was not big. Recently, we started selling the excess milk in bulk to milk dairies in Tamil Nadu and other states. This has increased revenue,” said the official.

Madurai: Three Sri Lankan fishermen who entered the Indian territorial waters off Dhanushkodi in Ramanathapuram district were detained by the Ramanathapuram district marine police on Saturday. The trio was identified as Anthony Suganth, 26, Santhiya Thomas Luvis, 32, and Thavasin Dominic Sahaya Vinistro, 24, from Talaimannar, a coastal area in the north western part of Mannar district in Sri Lanka. The trio set off from Talaimannar in their fishing boat at around 4am on Saturday.

“They were found fishing about one nautical mile (1.85km) within the IMBL in Indian waters off Arichal Munai near Dhanushkodi,” marine police inspector for Ramanathapuram district S Kanagaraj told TOI. He said the IMBL is only 6 nautical miles (11km) from Arichal Munai.

The inspector said that the Sri Lankan fishermen were fishing about 5 nautical miles (9km) from Arichal Munai and crossed the IMBL around 5.45am.

Left with no other option, the Sri Lankan boat reached Arichal Munai and the trio was detained by the Mandapam marine police and picked up for questioning. Marine police sources said that inquiries are underway by the intelligence agencies and that a case was not registered till Saturday evening. Their boat and fishing gear were stationed at Arichal Munai beach.

Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: The state government is keen that the Kaalai Unavu Thittam — a breakfast scheme provided by The Akshaya Patra Foundation — be extended beyond Chennai corporation schools. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, while laying the foundation of the new centralised kitchen of Akshaya Patra at Mackey’s garden, Greams Road, on Saturday, urged the trust to extend the scheme to all schools across the state, so all students can eat nutritious and clean breakfast.

The 20,000sqft kitchen on Greams Road will process breakfast for around 12,000 children in corporation schools. Raj Bhavan had sanctioned Rs 5 crore for the facility and on Wednesday, governor Banwarilal Purohit donated Rs 2 crore to the foundation as the first installment from governor’s discretionary grants.

Apart from the Greams Road land, Palaniswami added that the corporation had leased a plot, measuring 35,000sqft, on Perambur Barracks Road to the foundation to set up another centralised kitchen. The kitchen will be able to prepare food for 25,000 children.

Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam said, “Akshaya Patra Foundation has been providing food for students in 16,856 schools across 12 states and two Union territories. More than 18 lakh children benefit from the scheme.”

The free breakfast scheme was launched last year by the governor when the foundation, working with the city corporation, set up its first centralised kitchen in Thiruvanmiyur. It serves nutritious breakfast to 5,785 students studying in 24 corporation schools.

“When I was told about the idea to start the breakfast scheme, I was elated and took no time to agree to inaugurate the scheme because in order to feed the mind, you must first feed the body. The success of this programme has convinced me to extend it to more than 12,000 corporation school students,” said Purohit.

VILLUPURAM: Police on Friday arrested seven people, including three women, on charges of lynching a 24-year-old youth in Villupuram district. They were produced before a Tindivanam court which sent them to jail. The victim was identified as R Sakthivel, a resident of Karai who worked in a fuel outlet.

Police said R Theivanai, 26, of Karai lodged a complaint with the Periyathatchur police station on Wednesday saying she had received a call from her brother Sakthivel saying a mob had tied him up and was assaulting him near Boothurmalai in the district.

She said she reached the spot with her relatives and found that a mob led by K Raja and his wife R Gowri of Nagar was assaulting her brother. People in the crowd were abusing and kicking Sakthivel on the head and chest; and some were hurling stones at him, she said in the complaint. Some in the mob claimed Sakthivel, a dalit, had sought sexual favours from a woman, while Sakthivel had said he reached a water body to attend to a call of nature when the woman spotted him half-naked and raised an alarm.Theivanai further said police teams from the Periyathatchur and Kanjanur stations reached the spot and rescued her brother from the mob. They directed her to take him to a hospital for treatment. Claiming that she did not have enough money to admit him to a hospital she took him to their house on a two-wheeler. Once there, Sakthivel lost consciousness and she called the ‘108’ ambulance service. A medical tema, which arrived in an ambulance, which reached the spot, declared that Sakthivel had died.

The Periyathatchur police registered a case against Raja and Gowri and five others, including two women, under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 294 (B) (obscene acts and songs), 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (2) (v) of the SC/ST (POA) and arrested seven people.

Meanwhile, Social Awareness Society for Youth urged the government to initiate action against Periyathatchur sub-inspector K Vinothraj for failing to admit Sakthivel to a hospital after rescuing him with severe injuries sustained in the mob attack.

The forum also demanded that the government provide adequate compensation to the victim’s family. It said neither the superintendent of police nor the collector visited the crime scene or the villages of the victim or the accused people to initiate a probe into the incident leading to the death.

Buses and cabs were not in the way, trucks were dutifully parked on the service road and vendors were told to steer clear. “We have been told to shut shop for the day as some important person was in the area,” a fruit vendor said as she packed up her stall.

“The governor is attending an event in the area and we have been told to remove encroachments and make sure the road is not blocked,” a constable on badobast duty said.

This zeal to cater to a VIP’s movement left regular commuters less than impressed. “Daily inconvenience caused to thousands is ignored by the authorities. However, once a VIP is around, the situation turns around 180 degrees,” Vishal Pawar, a frequent commuter, said.

Yash Jain, another regular, too was struck by the sudden change. “I rarely see so many police personnel on this stretch. The carriageway was completely clear, making for an easy drive. Police must take routine action here and not only when a VIP comes,” Jain said.

However, Hinjewadi traffic police inspector Sunil Dahiphale said they don’t always have the necessary manpower.

NAGPUR: The city-headquartered Central Citrus Research Institute’s (CCRI) model Regional Research Centre for Citrus (RRCC) set up at Biswanath Chairali in Assam has started farm training and evaluation of commercial varieties for development of the fruit in the Northeast region.

Authorities are calling its first big activity in the Northeast as a landmark during the CCRI’s 35th anniversary year in 2020.

The regional centre has started evaluation of commercial varieties with fertigation (injecting fertilizers). Apart from this, 51 citrus germplasms have also been planted for evaluation. RRCC has started training of farmers in the region. Demonstrations of citrus varieties in the fields of farmers have also started.

The RRCC has been set up to address all the issues regarding the crop in the North-Eastern region.

This centre will operate as a model centre of citrus technology dissemination in North-East region.

AKSingh, deputy director general (horticulture and science) ICAR, laid the foundation stone of the RRCC and its farm house building recently.

A 3–day “National Citrus Meet -2020” was organized at Biswanath Chariali, Assam from January 10-12 in collaboration with Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Assam, Central Agricultural University (CAU), Imphal and ICAR — Research Complex for North-Eastern Hill Region, Umiam.

Around 150 delegates, including citrus experts, horticulturists, state agriculture department officials, KVK specialists and programme coordinators, development agencies, university faculties, scientists, students and farmers participated.

CCRI director MS Ladaniya said the institute will provide first hand information and all details about cultivation, marketing and post-harvest management of citrus fruits in North-East region. “The central government is spending huge funds for growth and development of North-East region for creation of job opportunities to youth thereby improving the livelihood status of citrus growers and overall development of the region. The three-day meet included seven different technical sessions comprising various aspects from nursery management to post harvest management and socio economic aspects along with concurrent poster displays,” he said.

The meet’s chief guest, Dr KV Prabhu, said there was need to properly register the citrus varieties. He said that the North Eastern region being centre of origin for citrus, germ plasm collection and cataloguing should be the priority.

AK Singh said that the focus should be on productivity enhancement and value added products from citrus. He emphasized on green but low cost technologies for doubling farmers’ income.

Ladaniya said “The regional centre has started evaluation of commercial varieties with fertigation. Apart from this, 51 citrus germplasms are also planted for evaluation. RRCC has started trainings of farmers in the region. Demonstrations of citrus varieties in fields of farmers have also started.”

Madurai: Around 150 first-time volunteers sat a one-on-one reading session with 150 visually-challenged school students at Read Fest 2020 on Saturday at the Indian Association for the Blind, Madurai.

Organized by Lit the Light Trust, a Chennai-based voluntary service group, the exclusive reading session held for the first time in Madurai saw volunteers of different age groups enthusiastically read out to school students and discuss various subjects.

“The event is to create better awareness among people who are not exposed to the struggles of the visually-challenged. Despite the availability of technology like audio recordings and braille, visually-challenged students need support from volunteers as they grow up,” said S N Barath, one of the founders of Lit the Light. He is also hoping to organize more activities in Madurai.

The event was inaugurated by V Senthilnathan, district employment officer, Madurai, who himself also read to a student. “With the right support and hard work, differently-abled people can achieve anything. Opportunities are always open. However, it requires tremendous effort and patience. Such sessions with volunteers supporting definitely boosts their confidence,” said the officer. Many of the volunteers were students from colleges in Madurai and nearby areas and most of the visually-challenged school students who took part were from Classes IX to XII.

A Class X visually-challenged student, Ajay T felt that such reading sessions helped them understand subjects much better. “I struggle with braille especially when covering large portions. I always feel I can learn better listening and when it is a person reading to you, you tend to connect with what they say and can ask questions,” he said.

His reader, Pandiselvi N, a college student is simply happy to help. “I was overwhelmed as I read. Such volunteering also helps feel a sense of fulfilment, especially during difficult times personally,” she said.

HYDERABAD: When it hit the market in August 2019, Hitwicket SuperStars achieved more than just 1,30,000 downloads in 48 hours. It shattered gender stereotypes by featuring women players in a cricket game for the first time and sealed Hyderabad’s place as a rising gaming destination of the world. Back home in India, it joined the league of Bengaluru and Pune – the crème de la crème of this Rs 350 crore-worth industry.

“The game caught massive international attention with 30% of our current users being based in the UK, the US, Australia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,” said Keerti Singh, co-founder and VP (operations) of the city-based startup, Hitwicket. Launched in 2015, along with her friend Kashyap Reddy, this artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven gaming firm is among 150 companies, VFX studios, and academies that have compelled gamers globally to sit up and take note of Hyderabad.

US-based industry leader in games and interactive media solutions, Pole to Win International (PTW) recently announced that it will expand its base in the city, where it first set foot in 2016. It’s also planning to increase its workforce here, over the next four years. “We trained a team of gamers in Hyderabad last year who represented India on the international circuit at our first PUBG tournament in Milan. This was under our new esports team name – Orange Rock Esports,” said a company official from the city.

Today, Hyderabad has about 300 big and small successful games under its belt, with 100 (approx) more in the pipeline. Official data indicates that close to Rs 200 crore-worth of gaming content for India and outside is being developed in Hyderabad. Industry pundits say that the city will draw over Rs 700 crore in the next three years with a string of international players eyeing local market. The resource pool, too, may increase with a lot of local talent joining the industry that offers annual salaries between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.

“A lot of independent studios are also coming up in Hyderabad. The surge has been evident in the last few years. And this because Hyderabad is a big game consumer market,” said Chaitanya G, founder and CEO of Chennai based-Playtonia that conducts leagues across the world for popular e-sports like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive , FIFA 2019 and PUBG Mobile.

Apart from new-age computers, mobiles, and high-speed internet that are propelling the growth of the gaming industry everywhere, what’s working for Hyderabad is the number of engineering institutes training students in coding, thereby attracting students towards the development of apps, say experts.

“The number of game developers in the state is expected to rise 10-fold in the next five years. There is huge demand for vernacular content in gaming, animation and VFX and games are being developed keeping the local audience and themes specific to our country in mind,” said Rajiv Chilaka, president Cricket, TVAGA (Telangana VFX, Animation and Gaming Association).

“Cricket, games with mythological backdrops, those revolving around mental health and puzzles to stimulate the mind are some of the popular themes developed in Hyderabad,” he added. TVAGA is a non-profit association of the media & entertainment industry in Telangana, working in collaboration with the state government.

“She also had high blood pressure. Such patients are of high risk category,” Garvyal said. The CMS also said that the hospital lacks adequate health facilities. “There are no modern facilities available here. The hospital is also old. Ayurvedic and Homeopathy department runs from here too. So, enough rooms are not available for women,” Garvyal added. Earlier on February 3, Neelam Bora, a 26-year-old resident of Didihat, died after giving birth in the same hospital. There were two more maternity deaths in the hospital in December.

DEHRADUN: Uttarkhand lost 60 leopards and tigers , who were declared man-eaters, in over 19 years, according to forest department data. This year, two leopards — one in Haridwar and the other in Narendra Nagar — have already been killed after they were declared man-eaters. All these big cats, including 56 leopards and four tigers, were eliminated by shooters as they posed threat to human lives.

According to the data, in 2009, as many as 13 man-eater leopards were knocked down, the maximum in any year so far. This is followed by eight leopard killings in 2007, seven killings in 2016, and four killings each in 2019, 2014 and 2011. The data further reveals that all four man-eater tigers were killed in 2012.

Lakhpat Singh Rawat, a contractual shooter of forest department, claims that he alone has shot down 53 man eater big cats — 51 leopards and 2 tigers — in the state in between 2002 and 2019. “I had shot down a tiger in Sunderkhal, Ramnagar in Corbett Tiger Reserve in 2011 and my second tiger kill was on October 20, 2016. However, killing isn’t the only solution. Villagers should be educated about big cat movements and other things,” said Rawat. Notably, forest department data doesn’t verify his claim.

“Once a big cat is declared man-eater by any competent authority, it must either be tranquilized and captured or terminated,” says YV Jhala, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII).

It is worth mentioning that the state lost 58 lives to man-wildlife conflict incidents last year. Among these deaths, five died due to leopard attacks in Pauri Garhwal forest division. Senior officials cite human negligence as the major reason behind man-wildlife conflict deaths.

Meanwhile, Rajiv Bhartari, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, told TOI, “Deaths due to leopard attacks are avoidable and we are initiating awareness camps and voluntary protection force for sensitive villages.”

Koko Rose, DFO, Tehri Forest Division, said, “We are urging villagers to use torches during evening and night time. We also ask them to move in groups and construct toilets in their house.”

These measures assume significance as Uttarakhand boasts of a considerable big cat population in Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves.

Though family members of brave young girl Rakhi (11) who rescued her 4-year-old brother on October 4 from deadly leopard attack feels that more patrolling by forest department will only solve the problem, “In the hills, economy is totally based on agriculture and livestock we cannot avoid our routine duties. Forest department is grappling with severe staff crunch, it should first fill those vacant posts and also various announcements made by them to have volunteer village protection force etc. should see daylight at the earliest. Its own three people were killed in Corbett Tiger Reserve, what they have to say for it?” asked mother of Rakhi.

After National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) latest decision to disallow an outsider to shoot an animal and take permission from authority before radio collaring the wild cat, environmentalist feel justice is being done to the tigers and similar move should be taken for leopards too, “It is a nice move to seek adequate permissions from experts before taking life of any animal. We strongly believe that it is time now that India make stringent norms around leopards too rather knocking them down just because villagers’ have momentary anger after losing their loved ones.” said SS Badoni wildlifer from Haridwar.

282,['16/02/2020'],"Will pay up, but only SC relief can save us: Voda Idea","This story is from February 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: Embattled telecom provider Vodafone Idea is ready to pay the government dues related to the Supreme Court’s AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenues) judgment, but said that its ability to remain a going concern hinges on a leniency in the payment schedule for the telecom department’s demand of over Rs 53,000 crore.

The company, which has a debt of over Rs 1.1 lakh crore and appears to be the worst hit from the top court’s AGR judgment, said it is “currently assessing the amount that it will be able to pay” to the government.

“The company proposes to pay the amount so assessed in the next few days,” it said in a statement amid concerns on whether it will make the payment or not. However, it made clear that it needs relief as far as the payment schedule is concerned.

The SC order of October 24 last year had asked companies to deposit the amount in three months (by January 23), and the temporary relaxation handed by the telecom department received a reprimand by the top court on Friday.

The Department of Telecom said on Friday that it wanted the payments by the close of the day, though companies are now planning to pay it before March 17, the next date of hearing in the Supreme Court.

“As disclosed in the company’s financial statements for quarter ending December 31, 2019, the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is essentially dependent on a positive outcome of the application for modification of the supplementary order,” it said.

Vodafone Idea and its promoters — Vodafone group of the UK and India’s Aditya Birla group — have already said that the survival of the company hinges on a relief from the government, and the top court.

And while Vodafone mulls the amount that it will be paying, Sunil Mitta’s Airtel has already made clear its intentions to pay, as well as the schedule. Airtel, which faces payment dues of over Rs 35,000 crore on the AGR order, said it will pay Rs 10,000 crore by February 20, and the rest by the next hearing in the top court on March 17.

Tatas, which have sold their telecom business to Airtel, are also likely to deposit their dues of around Rs 14,000 before the Supreme Court’s next hearing.

And while the financially-stretched telcos find out ways and means to make the payments, the order has come as a bolt from the blue for many public-sector undertakings who have also been caught in the DoT-industry standoff on AGR. These non-telcos — which include Gail, Oil India , Powergrid and Delhi Metro — have also been asked to pay the government heavy dues on their overall revenues.

283,['16/02/2020'],Open two key trekking routes for foreigners too: Tour operators,"This story is from February 16, 2020

The Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul and Nelang-Badrinath trek

UTTARKASHI: Months ahead of the trekking and mountaineering season in Uttarkashi , local trek operators have demanded that two key routes in the region - Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul and Nelang-Badrinath - be opened to foreigners. The administration has restricted access to foreigners on these routes, which fall on the inner line of Indo-China border and are of strategic importance to the defence forces. Locals said that foreigners are instrumental in the trekking business, and the ban on them is affecting their income.

“The Gangotri valley region of Uttarkashi district is a hotspot of trekking and mountaineering activities, which attracts adventure lovers from all over the world. However, the administration has banned foreigners from going on two major routes, the Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul and Nelang-Badrinath trek. The restriction has deprived both foreign tourists and local tour operators,” said Jayendra Rana, president of Garhwal Himalayan Trekking and Mountaineering Association.

Tour operators said that the Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul route connects Himachal Pradesh and Uttarkashi and the administration of Himachal allows foreigners to access it. “Foreigners easily get access to this trek route (Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul) from the authorities in Himachal Pradesh. The ban on Nelang-Badrinath trek is understandable, as it is closer to the Indo-China border and has a heavy deployment of armed forces, but the restriction on the other route is unreasonable. The Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul trek attracts a lot of tourists, including foreigners, due to its enchanting beauty,” added Rana.

Bhagwat Semwal, another tour operator, agreed. “It is due to such restrictions that we are losing business to other hill states. Foreigners play a major role in the economy of trekking and mountaineering based activities in the district, but tourists would rather visit Himachal Pradesh or Ladakh. Instead of imposing restrictions, the administration should conduct intense security checks on tourists entering the inner-line areas.”

Sub divisional magistrate Bhatwari Devendra Singh Negi said, “The entry of foreign tourists in Harsil-Lamkhaga Pass-Chitkul trek and Nelang-Badrinath trek routes are restricted, as both the trek routes falls in inner line area of Indo-China border and have strategic importance. The issue is under the authority of the Central government and we are not allowed to take any decision on the issue. However, we have forwarded the demand of local trekking agencies to senior officials.”

Representative image

NAINITAL: Nainital town’s only hospital, BD Pandey Hospital , has received government funds after two years, as the funding to the 125-year-old hospital was blocked by the government because the hospital could not use Rs 55 lakh which was credited to it in 2012.

The hospital administration failed to disclose the head under which this fund was to be used. Therefore, the government stopped its funding for the last two years. “The hospital administration could not disclose where the money had come from or for what purpose it was to be used. Therefore, the money kept lying in its account since 2012,” read a document prepared by the district administration.

The BD Pandey Hospital is the only government hospital in Nainital and has recently completed its 125th anniversary. However, locals have raised complaints of lack of vaccines at the hospital and deteriorating infrastructure. “The pharmacy at the hospital is always lacking even the basic medicines. The walls are damaged and the pathology lab would be closed by noon. This all happened at the only government hospital in the town,” said Ramesh Bhatt, a local.

The officials of the district administration told TOI that the shoddy work done in maintaining the funds at the hospital were the reason for the shortage of medicines and the poor infrastructure. “Till a few months ago, the hospital didn’t even have the anti-rabies vaccines or antivenom used during snakebites. The condition at the hospital was so bad that the sewer line was flowing below the operation theatres and the work had to be stopped during monsoons,” said Nainital DM, Savin Bansal .

Bansal added that it was only after a fresh audit was conducted of the hospital’s accounts that the Rs 55 lakh was used along with additional Rs 50 lakh that the administration received from the government. “We conducted the audit of the hospital’s accounts and used that money. We also received Rs 50 lakh from the government and now the hospital has enough medicine and we have decided that the pathology lab at the hospital will remain open till 8 pm,” he said.

285,['16/02/2020'],First non-bailable arrest in GST case in Nagpur,"This story is from February 16, 2020

The first arrest under a non-bailable offence in a case involving GST evasion

NAGPUR: The first arrest under a non-bailable offence in a case involving GST evasion was made in Nagpur recently. This was in extension to an earlier action in which the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGSTI) had arrested three persons who were allegedly running shell companies.

The firms were formed with the purpose of issuing fake invoices for availing fraudulent input tax credit (ITC) worth Rs10.44 crore.

The three arrested earlier were basically daily wagers who are supposed to be acting as front for running the dummy firms, which ultimately benefited the mastermind who was held on Thursday. The trail finally led to the arrest of Raja Agrawal, the proprietor of M/s Raja Cement House, an iron and steel company in the city, which was availing ITC on the basis of fake invoices issued by such firms.

Apart from the three shell firms in Nagpur, Raja Cement was also getting purchase invoices from business concerns as far as Ludhiana to avail ITC.

The case holds importance because for the first time, an arrest has been made under a non-bailable offence, which is applicable for alleged evasion of over Rs5 crore. This means that the bail has to be secured form the court. Here, Agrawal has been remanded in judicial custody till February 27. This is the first such arrest in the entire Nagpur zone which extends till Khandesh and Marathwada, apart from Vidarbha.

Sources said DGGSTI units in the country are estimated to have made nearly 100 such arrests in different cases. It has been found that there has been a rampant practice of availing ITC through invoices from fictitious firms, leading to a major impact on the actual revenue collections. The modus operandi is simple. The firms’ addresses are traced to the least expected locations, said a source.

According to a press release issued by the DGGSTI Nagpur unit, the agency had conducted searches in different parts of the country. It was found that M/s Raja Cement had recorded supplies from firms located in Nagpur and Ludhiana.

However, it was found that these firms were fictitious and no actual supply was made. Preliminary search has found that fake invoices worth more than Rs100 crore were generated to get the ITC.

Chartered accountant Amit Agrawal said the act has been amended to cover the mastermind in such cases. Earlier, such persons could get away making poor people like their employees the scapegoat.

Representative image

MADURAI: A special training programme will be held next week for government high school and higher secondary school teachers in Madurai district , to train them to better take care of disabled students , district education officials said on Friday.

As part of the Inclusive Education of the Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) scheme under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the teachers will be prepared and sensitised to handle children with special needs in classrooms. “Differently-abled students, especially from class IX to XII, are prone to get discriminated against as schools tend to fret about the results. This training will guide teachers to help such students to perform well, instead of segregating and discouraging them because they are slow-learners,” said a district SSA official.

He further added that the training programme, which is being implemented across the state, is aimed at helping children with special needs feel normal and welcome in regular classrooms.

“The teachers will be sensitized about how to take care and teach children with special needs. Often teachers grow impatient without understanding what the child’s needs are and what he/she is going through. There are also different kinds of disabilities, with each requiring a unique approach by the teachers,” said the official. Some types of disabilities under IEDSS include, blindness, low vision, hearing impairment, locomotor disabilities, mental retardation, cerebral palsy and autism.

In Madurai district, a total of 604 children with special needs are undergoing formal education at government high school and higher secondary schools under the IEDSS scheme.

The special training program will be held for government high school and higher secondary school teachers from all four educational districts in Madurai-Madurai, Melur, Usilampatti and Thirumangalam. The venue, dates, number of teachers and trainers taking part are expected to be finalised soon.

287,['16/02/2020'],Opposition leaders lash out at police for using force against protesters,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Chennai: Opposition parties led by the DMK on Saturday lashed out at the police action against anti-CAA protesters in Chennai and sought action against the police personnel who used force against the agitators. On Friday, an anti-CAA protest had turned violent when a group of protesters clashed with police here, leaving four police personnel and several agitators injured.

The incident led to sporadic protests across Tamil Nadu, including at Washermanpet in the city, where the violence erupted, but protesters subsequently called off the agitation, following talks with city police commissioner A K Viswanathan. Agitators alleged that police used force against them without any provocation. Across the state, cases have been filed against several thousand protesters.

The police action also echoed in New Delhi where a group of people, including students of Jamia Millia Islamia, held a protest near the Tamil Nadu House on Saturday, condemning Chennai city police action against anti-CAA demonstrators.

In a statement, DMK president M K Stalin said the protests were being held in a peaceful manner and sought to know why police used force to disperse them.

“Lathi charge was done unnecessarily on the peaceful protesters for no reason and this prompted people across the state to take to the streets,” Stalin said and demanded that all cases registered in this connection should be withdrawn. He wanted action to be initiated against police personnel responsible for the untoward incident.

DMK Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi, in a tweet, blamed North Chennai police joint commissioner Kapil Kumar Saratkar for the incident. “A sensitive and sensible handling of yesterday’s agitation in North Chennai would have saved bloodshed and violence against protesters. Saratkar mishandled the situation, which led to violence. Kapil Kumar was the DIG when Tuticorin firing took place,” said Kanimozhi.

CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan accused the state government of stifling anti-CAA protests. He urged the government to permit protests as long as they remain peaceful. Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T T V Dhinakaran and MDMK leader Vaiko said using force against peaceful protesters was condemnable.

BJP national secretary H Raja, however, condemned anti-CAA protests and slammed the attack on police personnel.

MADURAI: Health officials on Saturday conducted an inquiry into the death of a 25-year-old woman and her foetus at the Usilampatti government hospital on Friday and submitted a report to higher officials after her relatives protested claiming medical negligence.

P Sangeetha from Reddiyapatti, a private school teacher, was taken to the Vikramangalam primary health centre (PHC) on Thursday morning after she went into labour. However, an hour later, the woman suffered complications and had to be taken to Usilampatti GH on a 108 ambulance. At the hospital, she underwent a C-section, but the foetus died while inside the womb. Sangeetha too died later not responding to treatment. Angry relatives blamed the delay in referral by the PHC staff for Sangeetha’s death and demanded action against those responsible. According to a senior health official, so far no lapses have been found on the part of the doctor and nurses at Vikramangalam PHC. “At the PHC by 12 noon on Thursday, when Sangeetha started showing signs of complications, she was immediately asked to go to Usilampatti GH. However, it has come to our notice that it took at least 1 hour for the 108 ambulance to reach the PHC for transportation. The victim and her relatives had also continuously tried reaching ambulance staff but were neither informed of the delay nor instructed to look for an alternative vehicle,” said the official.

Meanwhile, an official source at the 108 ambulance office claimed that the ambulance reached the patient as fast as possible. “When the woman was referred by the Vikramangalam PHC, we got information that the condition of the patient and foetus was stable. There was no issue in transportation. Even on reaching the Usilampatti GH, both the mother and foetus were fine. We did our best,” said the source. So far, no action has been taken against anyone in this regard.

NAGPUR: A former murder accused was killed in a road rage case after his bike was dashed by a speeding truck on Friday on Nagpur-Jabalpur road. The deceased, Arif Ansari Rehman, 40, was signalling the truck driver to stop, after the duo had got into a quarrel at a dhaba few minutes earlier.

A large number of women from different communities congregated at the Idgah Maidan in Majalgaon on Saturday.

AURANGABAD: The residents of Majalgaon turned up in large numbers at the Idgah maidan on Saturday to join the peaceful agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens, after the Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court quashed and set aside two orders passed by the additional district magistrate of Beed district and Majalgaon police station.

An activist had moved the HC against the Majalgaon police and Beed additional district magistrate orders denying permission to hold agitation against CAA at the Idgah maidan. The HC in its order stated that people wanting to agitate in a peaceful way “ cannot be called traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law.”

After the HC order, due permission has been granted for carrying out peaceful agitation in Majalgaon. Agitators belonging to different communities distributed sweets at the venue. The organisers read out the Preamble to the Constitution and pledged to legally contest against the implementation of CAA along with NRC and NPR.

Sources in the administration maintained that the issue cropped up after the additional district magistrate issued an order under section 37 (1) of Maharashtra police act that restrained the gathering of more than five people at a public place. While the Majalgaon police station, following the standard operating procedure, had issued a notice under section 149 of CrPC, which empowers police to take action to prevent a crime.

Agitated over being denied ‘written’ permission for holding a peaceful protest every evening for four hours at Idgah ground, Ifteqhar Zakee Shaikh, an activist, moved the HC.

Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar told TOI, “The Beed police was never against any kind of peaceful agitation and protests. In fact, the protests that are being held at private places in about half a dozen talukas in the district, they do not even require police permission.”

When contacted, Shaikh said the four-hours a day of agitation has been going on for about a month, while the matter was in court. “We are glad that permission has not only been granted, but also the HC order has cleared the air about peaceful protests.”

A Delhi Police barricade

NEW DELHI: A day after bank accounts of hundreds of New Delhi Municipal Council ( NDMC ) employees were allegedly hacked and money siphoned off, Delhi Police and the civic agency have swung into action.

The official statement issued by the civic agency on Saturday said, “NDMC came to know about the incident after the money went missing from several bank accounts. It appears to be a case of ATM fraud . The matter has been reported to Delhi Police.”

Police, meanwhile, claimed to have received only two complaints of online fraud from the employees, while the civic agency employees’ union claimed over 200 employees lost their money.

“We have received two complaints and forwarded it for necessary action. Prima facie they seem to be cases of forgery done by cloning of ATM cards,” said a senior police officer.

On Friday, the employees’ union wrote to the NDMC chairman raising the issue about its members losing money amounting to lakhs, which was withdrawn from ATMs at different locations, most of them from SBI accounts. “Fearing losing money, many people have surrendered their cards,” the letter mentioned.

The first incident came to light on February 9 when Amir Yadav registered an FIR at the Parliament Street police station saying Rs 15,000 was withdrawn from his salary account from an ATM at Munirka, while he was at home. Likewise, Ashok Batra, a resident of Gyan Khand (Indirapuram) claimed Rs 40,000 was withdrawn from his account on February 12. “I received an SMS alert about the transaction in the evening, while the ATM card was with me,” he said.

Madurai: Around 40 college students took part in a two-day national workshop on Saturday at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO), Madurai, to develop scientific temper when reporting and communicating societal issues. “Science does not mean just the research done in laboratories. Perception of societal issues changes when viewed with a scientific temper. This workshop will help train students to look at problems in society with a scientific outlook,” said Dr S Nagarathinam, professor and head, department of communication, Madurai Kamaraj University, who delivered the keynote address.

The workshop on, ‘Redefining science communication for masses in the age of convergence’ was organized by Media Research Forum, Madurai supported by Vigyan Prasar, Government of India. The event kicked off with Dr TV Venkateswaran, scientist F, Vigyan Prasar, delivering the inaugural address. The students from at least five districts, Madurai, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram, Karaikudi, and Trichy participated in the programme addressed by expert speakers from across India.

The organisers said that the workshop is for students, especially media students to develop their ability to present science in a nuanced manner on media platforms in the age of convergence. “Even in Sangam literature, there are many examples of how science was always conveyed in a simple yet clear manner to masses. In this era, there is a need to present science in the most-understandable form on media platforms,” said Dr Nagarathinam.

One of the key speakers of the workshop Dr B Satyanarayana, scientific officer H, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)/ INO will be addressing the students on Sunday.

The library was set up by a resident of Nainital named Mohan Lal Sah in 1933 after he provided a grant of Rs 5... Read More

NAINITAL: For years, the lake town’s only and the oldest library, Durga Sah Municipal Public Library, had been the centre for literary debates, meetings and discussions. However, a financial dispute between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and its contractor has led to the 87-year-old library remaining shut for over three years.

The library was set up by a resident of Nainital named Mohan Lal Sah in 1933 after he provided a grant of Rs 5000 and was named after his father Durga Sah.

City historians stated that Nainital’s only library was the hub for scholars and students. “We would go to the library every day. It had the best collection of books on almost every subject. Whether you were looking for books on Indian literature, Western literature, Philosophy or Science, you could find anything here,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, an environmentalist and former professor of the Kumaon University.

In 2015, the ADB was given the task of renovating the library along with almost a dozen other heritage properties which included several historical churches in the town. “The project was given in 2015 and the work on the library started in June 2016 when the library was closed for public use. However, in January 2019, a financial dispute between the contractor and the ADB led to the abandonment of the project and it has remained in this condition ever since,” said an official of the tourism department.

For Rawat and many others who have spent their lives in the town, the condition of the library and the response from officials has been disconcerting. “We remember how all of us would gather near it to listen to news bulletin by the All India Radio (AIR) every morning and evening. People from across the town would come to read newspapers, magazines, literature and even gazette articles which couldn’t be found in any other library,” Rawat said, while also crediting the town’s only library for giving the maximum number of forest officers from Nainital. “There was a time when most of the officials in the UP Forest Services were from Nainital. This was only because the library facilitates it,” he added.

When asked about the project’s progress, the ADB officials said that the older contractor has already been removed and new tenders have been floated. “We have floated the tenders and a new contractor will soon be chosen for the projects across the town. The overall facade of the library has already been repaired but some works like flooring and polishing are yet to be completed. We aim to finish the project within six months,” said HC Sharma, support engineer, ADB.

The entire Kumbh area is spread across 150 sq km covering four districts of Uttarakhand

DEHRADUN: For the Kumbh Mela set to take place next year, the state government authorities have hit the top gear. Officials said that the entire Kumbh area would be spread across 1,454 hectare - out of which 583 hectare has been reserved for parking and 874 hectare for camps. The entire Kumbh area would be divided into 41 sectors - nine sectors more than the previous Kumbh.

The entire Kumbh area is spread across 150 sq km covering four districts of Uttarakhand . Melaadhikari Deepak Rawat, who convened a meeting of the preparations at Haridwar on Saturday, said that in the previous Kumbh a total area of 650 hectare was used and keeping in mind the high number of devotee turnout, it has been increased to 1,454 hectare.

“The total area of the Kumbh is 150 sq km but effectively the area used would be over 1,400 hectare, which is nearly double the area used earlier. The number of sectors has also been increased. Many more such meeting on preparations would be held in the future,” Rawat told reporters on Saturday.

For the extensive exercise, the media centre, police line, traffic line, radio line, cultural tents, homeguard line, entertainment park, helipad, Ayush and Wellness centre would be made in the Kumbh area.

For physically-challenged persons, eco-friendly low-floor buses would be arranged and there would be a separate ghat for them. For the women devotees, the state would start pink seva e-rickshaw and auto, which would be driven by the women.

The dates for ‘Shahi’ snan (key bathing days) were announced earlier. They are: March 11, 2021 (Mahashivratri), April 12 (Somwati Amawasya), April 14 (Baisakhi Kumbh) and April 27 (Chaitra Poornima).

299,['16/02/2020'],Cheque cloning racket busted: Maharashtra’s first offence registered at Aurangabad,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad city police registered an offence and arrested one accused on Saturday after busting an inter-state cheque-cloning racket that is suspected to have cheated many banks and account holders of several crores.

This is also the first cheque-cloning offence registered in the state. All the previous offences were reported from northern India, especially the National Capital Region.

The arrested suspect has been identified as Bhagwan Bhausaheb Muley, a sarpanch. He has been accused of withdrawing Rs 16 lakh from the account of one Bablu Laxman Hari, a resident of Bhagalpur in Bihar, using a forged cheque.

Authorities concerned said the suspects were found using a forging technology so superior that the forged cheques could get past all physical or technological scanning measures and even the Cheque Truncation System (CTS) machines available with private and public banks.

Rahul Khade, the deputy commissioner of police (zone-II), told TOI: “We have arrested Bhagwan Bhausaheb Muley, a sarpanch. Our investigation indicates that he is the first person involved in the racket to have been arrested by us.”

The preliminary investigation has revealed that a Pune-based individual, who has an account in a public-sector bank, has also been cheated of Rs 97 lakh using the same technology. The police have already launched a manhunt for other suspects and have rushed teams to different places.

Talking about how the scam was perpetrated, investigation officer and assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said the suspected members of the gang would first identify the bank accounts that are either connected to outdated phone numbers, or do not have any phone number on record at all.

“The preliminary probe has revealed that the accused were aware of the amount available in their target’s bank account, the victim’s signature, cheque number and other relevant details. We are checking the source from where all these crucial, sensitive and secret details were acquired by the accused,” said API Sonawne.

An officer privy to the case said the accused would forge cheques from the very sequence available with the target, forge his/her signature and submit the cheque in the bank to get an account transfer done of the cash. When banks do not have the contact number of an account holder, they check the authenticity of cheques using CTS machines. And on confirming the authenticity of the cheque, they clear the cheque.

Using a similar modus operandi, On February 5, Muley submitted a forged cheque of a man from Bihar in the Karmad-based branch of a nationalised bank. As the bank did not have the contact number of the real account holder, it scanned the cheque in the CTS machine, and subsequently transferred Rs 16 lakh to Muley’s bank account. The amount was soon transferred to another bank account using RTGS and NEFT.

The incident came to light on February 11 after the Bhagalpur-based victim checked the balance in his account and discovered the transaction. The bank authorities alerted the branch in Karmad, following which records were scanned. It was then found that in addition to the Rs 16 lakh stolen in this case, an amount of Rs 97,000 was withdrawn in a similar manner on February 4. Another similar cheque of Rs 78.56 lakh was pending with the bank for clearance.

Sources in the bank said after the Karmad police refused to register an offence, the matter was referred to higher-ups in the bank, who approached API Sonawne. He carried out a preliminary probe, before bringing it to the notice of his seniors. They immediately issued directives for filing of an offence.

Based on the complaint lodged by 40-year-old Deepak Shreevas, the district coordinator of the nationalised bank, Jinsi police have registered cases of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, fraudulent execution of signature, against the accused members of the gang.

Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the three-day Chhattisgarhi Mahotsav

NAGPUR: City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari stated that Nagpur is known for unity in diversity. He announced that one of the events of Khasdar Sanskrutik Mahotsav and Khasdar Udyog Mahotsav will be held at Dipti Signal in East Nagpur.

Gadkari inaugurated the three-day Chhattisgarhi Mahotsav organized by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) at RTO Ground, Dipti Signal, on Saturday evening. East Nagpur MLA Krishna Khopde, standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane, who conceptualized the event, leader of the opposition Tanaji Wanve, chairman of city transport committee Balya Borkar, Lakadganj Zone chairman Rajkumar Selokar, former deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar, other office bearers, officials and corporators were present.

Appreciating the event, Gadkari said, “Nagpur is probably the only city which organizes the Chhattisgarhi cultural programme during Marathi-based events. Even programmes related to other languages and traditions are organized. It is because the city is known for unity in diversity,” he said.

The minister added that, “Culture, arts and sports help in grooming children. It is the need of the hour to showcase the importance of each and every tradition and culture to our children for their all-round growth. If not done, our children will be lost in the world of mobile phones,” he said.

Lauding the efforts of Pohane and others for hosting such a colourful event on an abandoned open space, Gadkari said, “I will ensure hosting one of the events of Khasdar Krida Mahotsav at this place. One of the programmes of the recently-announced Khasdar Udyog Mahotsav will be organized here. Nearly 5,000 youths from this area can learn ways to become self-employed from the programme related to the Khasdar Udyog Mahotsav,” he said.

Khopde said that in the past, Dipti Signal was infamous for being backward, but all that has changed because the area is now known for its vast development. “Developmental projects executed here have increased the value of property in Dipti Signal to a great extent. Chhattisgarhi Mahotsav is the first big event being organized here,” he said.

In his introductory remarks, Pohane informed the dignitaries about the programmes planned during the fest.

Sadique Khureshi conducted the proceedings of the programme while corporator Chetna Tank proposed a vote of thanks.

Immediately after the inauguration, a drama titled ‘Shirdi Ke Saibaba’ and based on the life of Sai Baba was performed. The performance of Padma Vibhushan awardee Teejan Bai, a renowned Pandwani exponent, will be the highlight of the fest on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: A major tragedy was averted at Park Hotel in Connaught Place on Saturday after a fire broke out in the basement around 9am. Though the blaze was doused by the hotel staffers, the smoke reached the above floors through the air-conditioning ducts. Guests panicked and tried to break open windows, and at least a couple of them sustained injuries. Some of them tried to jump out as well.Instead of informing the fire department and the police about the incident, the hotel authorities used their staffers to evacuate the guests from all the floors. As many as 12 people, including two staffers, who complained about breathlessness were taken to the hospitals nearby. Out of these, nine people were discharged after treatment. Three, including two foreign nationals, had to be admitted to Ganga Ram hospital.Both the Parliament Street police station and the fire headquarters are within a few hundred metres. But it was only around 12.30pm that the police were informed about the incident by the hospital authorities.Additional DCP, New Delhi, Deepak Yadav said that the hospital had informed the Rajinder Nagar police station after which an inquiry was initiated by Parliament Street station. The fire department was also informed. “Those admitted to the hospital for treatment include Abdi Bashir and Joshim Kvan from Norway and Kundan Rai from Gurgaon,” added Yadav.A spokesperson from Ganga Ram hospital said that around 11am, 9 patients were brought to casualty out of which seven patients were discharged after giving the first aid. “Two male patients from Norway have been admitted for breathing difficulty due to suspected inhalation injury,” said a senior official.An FIR has been registered in this regard and the cops are conducting an inquiry to establish the culpability.DFS chief, Atul Garg, said that five fire tenders were immediately pressed into service but by that time the fire was doused. “We issued a show-cause notice as several lapses were found in the fire safety mechanism of the hotel. A team will send a detailed report to the department concerned at NDMC after an inspection,” added Garg. It was later found that the fire had broken out due to a short circuit in one of the cables of the generator.In a statement, the hotel spokesperson said, “We are deeply concerned about the incident that took place at the basement. There was a short circuit that led to a minor fire. However, the situation was quickly normalised by our in-house crisis management team. Some of our guests were exposed to the smoke, and as a precautionary measure, they were sent to the hospital for a thorough check-up. Safety has always been our top priority and we assure that all our guests and employees are safe.

Students at a rally in Cantt area to curb use of single-use plastic

SECUNDERABAD: In order to strengthen the implementation of the ban on single-use plastic, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) will now circulate a special brochure, listing plastic and thermocol goods that have been banned for sale and use. The brochures will be supplied to shopkeepers as well as consumers.

Officials said the SCB could be the first Cantonment in the country to come up with a proposal to educate the public on these lines. The aim is to reach out to all shopkeepers in the area who use plastic extensively and frequently.

The SCB’s health and sanitation wing had already taken up awareness campaigns in noted shrines in the Cantonment area and on Saturday, the campaign was extended to schools in the area. Students took out a rally to raise awareness on the issue and pledged to do their bit.

SCB officials on Saturday kicked off the drive from a private school in Bowenpally in the form of a rally.

“The brochures are printed in two languages, Telugu and English, and will be distributed in over 15,000 small, medium and major commercial units in Secunderabad Cantonment. It is a six-page brochure which contains a list of banned plastic and thermocol items, penalties to be imposed against the violators and list of officials handling the plastic ban orders and along with contact numbers,” SCB solid waste management superintendent, M Devender told TOI.

Residents who find shopkeepers using plastic, despite the ban, can call on the specified mobile numbers to lodge a complaint. We keep the informant’ credentials completely confidential, he said.

Officials said that they would continue conducting raids by deploying special teams. “If banned plastic materials are found, heavy penalties will be imposed,” said the SCB official. “We have been conducting raids for over six months at various commercial units and sealed many of them. Once penalties were paid, we allowed them to resume operations,” a senior SCB official said.

303,['16/02/2020'],Haryana: Government staffers to get benefit of tenure in aided schools,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The services rendered by the staff in government-aided private schools of Haryana would be computed for assured career progression (ACP) and other pensionary benefits on their joining the regular government service. These benefits will be provided to the eligible employees in lieu of a verdict passed by a single-judge bench of HC in 2015 in Uma Devi’s case. The judgement has now been upheld by a division bench of the HC.

Division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shankar Jha and Justice Arun Palli has upheld the order while dismissing the appeal filed by Haryana government challenging the order passed in Uma Devi’s case. The bench has dismissed the appeal after the state failed to justify the 1,434 days’ delay in filing the appeal against the single bench order.

“Having examined the averments set out in the application we are of the considered view that explanation tendered to justify the delay that occurred in filing the appeal does not constitute a sufficient cause. Rather, upon an advice sought from the office of the advocate general as also the legal remembrance, it was opined that matter was not fit for appeal,” the division bench has observed in its order released this week.

With this order, the issue has attained finality and the period spent by employees in government-aided private schools will be counted for the purpose of ACP and other benefits, if such employees join regular government service subsequently.

In this matter, around 51 petitioners, including Uma Devi, had knocked the door of the court in 2013 through their counsel advocate Vikas Chatrath seeking directions to Haryana government to treat the services rendered by them in government aided schools countable towards the pension, pensionary benefits and as well as other consequential benefits.

The Haryana government, however, had opposed the plea on the grounds that their services cannot be counted because such employees have not made contribution towards the central provident fund (CPF) while rendering the service in government-aided schools and, therefore, the record cannot be verified.

Hearing all parties, the single bench headed by Justice Amit Rawal of the HC in its order dated July 24, 2015, had allowed the petition. To resolve the problem of non-availability of record of such staff, the HC had directed the employees to furnish the record of their service rendered in the aided schools and state was told to verify such record with the schools concerned. Court had asked the state to complete the entire exercise within a year. The state, however, had challenged these orders.

Talking about the ramification of the dismissal of state’s appeal, advocate Vikas Chatrath said although the state had in some cases implemented the 2015 orders, in some cases the petitioners had filed contempt plea in which the state was not implementing the orders, citing pendency of appeal before the bench.

Now, things are clear and the government staff who worked in private-aided schools prior to joining regular services would be benefited, Chatrath added.

Tea Post initially plans to invest Rs 2.5 crore in the Dubai venture. The startup is planning to explore the Australian market after establishing itself in Dubai.

Representative image

CHANDRAPUR: A tiger made yet another kill, this time in the buffer zone of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) on Friday evening. Victim Balaji Wagmare was heading for overnight vigil in the farm in the fringe of forest when the tiger attacked and killed him.

Wagmare was attacked and dragged to the thick shrubs by the animal. The incident came to light on Saturday morning when villagers looked for him and found his mutilated remains in the shrubs. Deputy director of TATR (buffer) Guru Prasad Prasad said they have given a cheque for Rs5 lakh to the kin of victim as ex-gratia, while the remaining part of the compensation will be paid as per procedure.

Sources said that a tigress with two cubs was seen frequenting close to the FDCM resort near Kolara gate of Tadoba since the last few days. While many tourists are learnt to have watched the tigress and its cubs, foresters were keeping a watch over them as they made forays close to the resort.

Prasad claimed that the villagers were quite aware of the presence of tigress and its cubs in the area. Despite being warned, the victim went alone to his farm in the evening.

However, Prasad said so far they have no confirmation whether the same tigress is responsible for the attack. He added that they would install camera traps to get further information about the tigress.

This is fourth human kill in Chandrapur this year. A tiger had killed one Sarita Pal from Morwahi in Saoli range on Friday while she was working in the farm. The predators had killed 23 people in Chandrapur district last year.

The shacks were mostly made of wood and plastic due to which the fire spread rapidly

NEW DELHI: Around 1,000 people were left homeless after a major fire broke out at a JJ colony in Rohini Sector-16 on Saturday evening. Officials said that 13 fire tenders were pressed into service and no casualties were reported so far.

However, the firemen would conduct a search operation after the area cools down to see if anyone was trapped inside.

The incident took place around 7pm when fire broke out at one of the shacks of Bangali Colony and spread rapidly. Firemen said that the slums were scattered in an area of around 1,500 sq yard. The shacks were mostly made of wood and plastic due to which the fire spread rapidly. The firemen managed to control the flames within an hour and were conducting cooling operations.

Officers said that initially it was difficult for the fire tenders to reach the site since the camp was located in an area that remained crowded with e-rickshaws and three-wheelers.

Residents said they heard loud explosions as the fire spread with cooking gas cylinders in other shanties exploding. Fire officials said they had to undertake a cautious approach since most shanties had cylinders which could explode. The officials also had a tough time getting into the narrow lanes of the JJ colony. People tried to salvage their possessions and suffered burns in the process.

Residents claimed that some children who were sleeping in the shacks were missing. However, police said that no one had approached them saying that their child was missing.

The area district magistrate and senior police officers who had reached the spot ordered that a medical team and a disaster management team be present at the spot to take care of injured persons and arrangements for food and tents be made. Water tankers and toilet facilities were provided by Delhi Jal Board. A case under Section 436 of IPC (mischief by fire or explosive substance) was registered.

309,['16/02/2020'],Edu officers stay in village to address parents’ concerns,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Koppal: Iliganoor , a remote village in Karatagi taluk of Koppal district, witnessed a unique education awareness campaign by senior officials of the education department.

A team of officials and teachers, led by Gangavathi block education officer (BEO) Somashekhargouda Police Patil, launched the 24-hour village stay from Friday morning to strengthen the bond between people and government schools. As block-level officials voluntarily stayed at the village, the move is said to be first of its kind in the state.

Villagers were thrilled to attend the grievances meeting, where parents had the privilege to sit on the dais, while the officials sat in the audience to listen to what parents want.

Police Patil told TOI that his village-stay programme was inspired by government school stay by education minister S Suresh Kumar. “We had scheduled different programmes from 7am. This event is aimed at knowing expectations of both teachers and parents. Normally, parents and teachers would blame one another in case of poor academic performance of students. If this gap is filled with mutual participation, then quality of learning will automatically be improved,” he added.

Villager Devendrappa Siddapur, also a former APMC chairman, said that village witnessed festive atmosphere as officials spent the entire day in the village. “The initiative guided both parents and teachers. Parent-teacher meeting cleared many confusions that normally prevail. Officials and teachers participated in prayer, jatha and meetings,” he said. Some cultural events were held in the evening.

Police Patil said that a team of 25 youths, who are pursuing PU or above courses, are made to teach basic concepts to schoolchildren. “Our teachers have trained those youths in teaching basic concepts of all subjects. They spend an hour a day teaching their juniors. Each youth has been assigned around 15 students so micro-teaching is ensured,” he stated.

Anjanappa Hanchi, a BA student, said it’s a joyous experience to teach his juniors. “As our village is backward, such initiatives will help school students improve their learning. Meanwhile it’s an opportunity for us to improve our communication skills and knowledge,” he asserted.

K Sharanappa, chairman of School Development and Monitoring Committee, said that around 50 teachers of Ulenur cluster participated in the programme.

Block resource person V V Gondabal, Primary School Teachers’ Association taluk president Amaresh Mailapur, Headmasters’ Association president Dayanand Babu and other officebearers of teachers’ associations, cluster resource persons and other officials also joined in this initiative and stayed in the government school overnight. A play on education presented by teachers enthralled villagers and children.

310,['16/02/2020'],Concrete investment plans lined up for next 5 yrs: Portugal prez,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Panaji: Portugal President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said here on Saturday that he was extremely satisfied with his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two countries deliberated and outlined concrete investment plans, which will be taken forward over the next five years.

“My long meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi was very fruitful—bilaterally and multi-laterally. We discussed concrete projects for investment—Portuguese investment in India and Indian investment in Portugal. This is for economic cooperation, scientific cooperation, technical cooperation and university and cultural cooperation for the next five years,” he said.

The Portuguese President said Goa, which shares a cultural link with Portugal, acts as a bridge between India and Portugal.

Sousa arrived on Saturday for a two-day visit to Goa, which was a Portuguese colony for over 450 years, and presided over the inking of several agreements between Goan entities and Portuguese bodies.

He has come with a 38-member strong delegation and is accompanied by a team from the Union ministry of external affairs.

Sousa, who is on a four-day visit to the nation, reiterated his country’s support to India’s long-standing ambitions to become a permanent member of the United Nation’s Security Council.

“You know that India has the full support of Portugal to become permanent member of the Security Council of the UN. We shall help India at the highest level in our next meeting of the Ocean conference in Portugal,” he said.

Regarding the ongoing debate over Goans applying for Portuguese citizenship and whether the issue was brought up during his meeting with the Indian officials, Souza said: “Everything that is good for mutual relations in any field is always a subject of attention of both Indian and Portuguese authorities.”

Sousa delivered the opening remarks at a conference on urban design where he stressed on the need to improve the lives of citizens. For this, said Sousa, nations had to design for the future without the baggage of the past.

“When we meet the future, we do not meet the past. We cannot have nostalgic vision of anything at any place,” said Sousa.

He also said that there were no first class and second class cultures.

“There are no first class cultures or second class cultures or first class civilizations. All cultures are first class cultures. That is what we have learned with our history and your history too. It is the dialogue between these culture and civilizations, armed with intelligent tools, that we can get improved synergies,” Sousa said.

NEW DELHI: There is a ray of hope for over 10 million people affected by Parkinson’s disease across the world. A Delhi University professor and his team have found an effective drug molecule for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. So far, there is no cure for the disease.The molecule developed by DU professor has undergone pre-clinical trial, and now been taken by an American pharma industry for further studies. Professor D S Rawat of the chemistry department and his team of seven other people were working on this project for the past eight years.Earlier, the team had developed a molecule for malaria treatment. The results of their experiment were published in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters in 2012.“During the same time, I came across a paper published by Sanders in 1987 in ‘Nature’ journal wherein he concluded that chloroquine, a drug for malaria treatment, can retard Parkinson progression. But no one carried forward that work. Since our compounds were better than chloroquine for malaria and had structural similarity with chloroquine, we thought of taking it forward,” DS Rawat told TOI.The team then got in touch with professor Kim at Mc Lean hospital at Boston in the USA. “We started collaboration with him and in 2014, MJ Fox Foundation funded this project. We got exciting results, and our molecule cleared pre-clinical trials, meaning it has an excellent chance to be developed as a drug,” said Rawat.“Out of 10,000 compounds, only one compound comes to market as a drug,” Rawat added while explaining the importance of the compound reaching the trial stage.The molecule developed by the team is based on a hybrid technology. “In this, a medicinal chemist joins two or more drugs for better efficiency than giving drugs in combination,” said Rawat.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74157222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-219779,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hope-for-parkinsons-patients-du-team-develops-drug-molecule/articleshow/74155417.cms

HYDERABAD: Milk procurement by state-run Vijaya Dairy has dropped from five lakh litres per day two years ago to less than three lakh litres per day now. There has been a 40% decrease in milk procurement by Telangana State Dairy Development Cooperative Federation (TSDDCF) which sells packaged milk and milk products.The reason behind this dip can be attributed to procurement strategies by private players, lower production of milk, among others. Taking a serious note of this, animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav has ordered an inquiry. “Despite the government extending support to the TSDDCF, procurement has dropped by 40% which is unacceptable,” the minister told officials. On the instructions of the minister, special teams have been formed to conduct an inquiry at state, district and village level. The teams will also speak to the dairy farmers at the village level and submit its report by the end of this month.Yadav said the government has distributed 65,000 buffaloes. “Instead of the milk production increasing facilitating a rise in procurement by Vijaya Dairy, the procurement has gone down. Also, probe the involvement of officials and if there is any role in helping the private dairies,” the minister directed the top officials of animal husbandry department.When contacted, TSDDCF managing director G Srinivasa Rao confirmed to STOI that the milk procurement has come down by 40 per cent due to various factors including aggressive marketing by private dairies and production coming down to climatic factors. “The production is low and also the milk powder stocks have exhausted. The private dairies were quick to offer a better price to the farmers to raise their procurement targets,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74159878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26017,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/talasani-orders-probe-into-dip-in-vijaya-dairy-milk-procurement/articleshow/74154539.cms
313,['16/02/2020'],"As tourists cancel Goa plans, CM says no terror alert, all are welcome","This story is from February 16, 2020

Panaji: A day after tourism stakeholders raised a red flag about tourists cancelling plans to come to Goa after Section 144 was imposed in North Goa, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday tried to allay the fears of visitors and said there was no “terror alert for the state”.

“People should not panic. It is just an administrative order. I welcome all tourists—international and domestic—to visit Goa,” he said.

Sawant also said the state government was considering withdrawing the notification imposing section 144 as there was “unnecessary panic due to media highlighting the notification”.

“This type of notification is issued regularly,” he said.

He also said tourists shouldn’t worry about visiting the state for the week-long carnival festivities, which begins on February 22, or who have made plans to come for holidays.

The state’s tourism sector, which has already taken a hit due to reduction in tourist footfalls, found itself dealing with cancellation of bookings due to the notification.

Hoteliers and agents have been receiving calls from Thursday asking if Goa has been placed under lockdown due to threat perception.

District magistrate (North Goa) R Menaka also came out with a detailed clarification of her February 10 order. She said though section 144 has been imposed, it doesn’t prevent assembly of four or more persons.

“The order is a precautionary measure only to step up the alertness, essentially to impose tenant verification on all the owners of residential accommodations, private guest houses, paying guest accommodations, etc, so that there is proper verification of antecedents before premises are let out on lease, rent or on hire basis,” she said.

“All tenants are required to be verified through their identity proof such as voter ID, driving licence, Aadhaar, passport, etc, and the verification form should be submitted to the nearest police station for record,” she said.

Menaka also tried to underplay the effect on tourism due to her order.

“The order doesn’t impact tourists, carnival, shigmo or other celebrations. The public should not panic as these orders have been routinely issued as part of general preparedness in the past too for the entire state by both the district magistrates,” Menaka said.

Incidentally, only North Goa district had put out a terror alert and imposed section 144, while South Goa has not issued any warning.

Hyderabad: Following a tiger attack on a cattle-grazer in Neelwai range of Mancherial ’s Chennur forest division on Friday, the forest department is closely monitoring the movement of the big cat. They are currently keeping a close eye on villages in the tiger corridor. Forest officials said that they had identified the big cat within hours after the attack, however, have decided not to reveal its identity.

“The tiger has been identified and we are taking all necessary steps to prevent such incidents in future. It was a random attack and it does not look like the tiger attacked this man intentionally. There is no chance that he could have survived otherwise,” said Mancherial district forest officer Shivani Dogra adding that K4, the tigress with a wire snare around its abdomen is not responsible for the attack.

“We do not want to reveal the identity of the tiger because that might have consequences and prove to be dangerous for the big cats surviving in these forests. The attack was not made by K4. There are quite a few tigers moving in this area and we are constantly monitoring their movement,” Dogra said.

Villagers have been asked not to venture out of the villages alone, especially during early morning or in the evening as that would be the time when these big cats are mostly active.

316,['16/02/2020'],‘Completed PhD to club photography with aesthetics’,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Passion led Mangesh Raut, 39, to pursue photography

Passion led Mangesh Raut , 39, to pursue photography , a field contrary to his family business, which is tailoring. His late father, Krishnarao, was a popular tailor and had a big shop at Yashwant Stadium. Raut calls his dad an artist who designs garments.

Mangesh too does the same, albeit with a camera. The world of lenses has not been a bed of roses for Raut, but what saw him through was his utter grit and determination to learn and to succeed, which he did by earning a PhD in photography at Nagpur University’s 2020 convocation. Raut shared his thoughts with TOI on the road ahead and the challenges as well.

Excerpts from an interview .

Q. What was the topic of your PhD and why?

A. My subject was ‘Photographic beauty and the beauty of photography analysis and appreciation’. My research was not for the common man and neither was it for a professional photographer. It was purely for the artiste who sees the beauty in his surroundings and clicks pictures.

Q. How would you define photography?

A. Photography can be divided into three parts — technical, artistic and aesthetic. While the technical part includes camera lenses and computers, the artistic part resides in every individual, primarily in the form of creative ideas. The aesthetic aspect pertains to beauty, the beauty of nature and all things and creatures that come along with it. The first step is aesthetic followed by artistic and then technical. For example, when we see with your eyes, the first thing that strikes you with its beauty is called aesthetic. After that, you start visualizing various angles to capture that beauty. It’s called artistic sense. The last part is technical which comes basically from knowledge. Behind every picture there are two important people — the one who produces it and the one who likes or dislikes it.

Q. What kind of hardships did you face along the way?

A. After completing my bachelors (BA in fine arts) from Government Chitrakala Mahavidyalaya (GCM) in 2004, I was very clear about pursuing a career in photography. My specialization was photography. I took my first step by going to Mumbai to work as an assistant. I was always fascinated by computers and the camera. In Mumbai, I struggled a lot, but the end result was very satisfying. My favourite teacher and mentor, Raja Mankar, who is now the dean of GCM, helped me immensely. It is only because of him that I met many established photographers in Mumbai and even got to assist them for two years in projects pertaining to jewellery and wedding photography.

Q. You achieved mastery in animation. You even combined it with photography. How did you manage to do that?

A. I got technical knowledge in college, but practical knowledge came my way while assisting established photographers. Photography is a costly affair. You need to invest a lot of money to buy good equipment like camera, lenses and lights backdrops. Actually, the list is endless. At that point in time, I wasn’t financially sound and, hence, I decided to focus on animation courses as computers were my second love. The other reason for pursuing animation was to get a job as most of my college mates were in Hyderabad. They were doing courses in animation and were also earning well. In 2006, I moved to Hyderabad from Mumbai and learnt animation and VFX. But my conscience didn’t allow me to take up a job in the field of animation as my first love was photography. I came back to Nagpur in 2007 and started my own institute. My childhood experience of doing jobs in an STD booth, a stationery shop, DTP, a photo copy centre and later photography in standard 10 to make ends meet gave me a lot of confidence. I did wedding photography and whatever money I earned, I used it to start my institute. A job wouldn’t have given me the freedom to do both animation and photography at the same time. I had a lot of time on hand and hence, decided to use it constructively by doing my masters in fine arts (2008-2010).

Q. When did you think of doing your PhD?

A. During my MFA days I was quite impressed by Dr Vinod Indurkar’s lectures on aesthetics. I took special permission from him to attend his lectures even after completing my masters. I wanted to club photography and aesthetics. Indurkar Sir went a step further by suggesting that I could do a research on the subject. We worked on it for quite some time and in 2013, I registered for my research under his guidance with my topic being ‘Photographic beauty and the beauty of photography analysis and appreciations.’ I did my research in Hindi.

Q. You even took up a job. Why did you quit?

A. After registering for my PhD in 2013, I joined as a lecturer in J J Institute of Applied Arts in Mumbai. I was there for two years with my wife Yogita. She is also an artist and like me, she too has done her masters in fine arts and even registered for PhD. Both of us got transferred to the Government Arts College of Design in Nagpur and I continued with the job till 2017. After that, I quit and started focusing on my PhD and my institute as I always felt that students from rural backgrounds need additional support.

Q. Are you happy with what you have achieved?

A. Today’s world is dominated by social media and with the advent of new technology, photographers are now feeling the need to enhance their skills to compete with the world. This realization has dawned on students. Many of them, especially from rural backgrounds, are approaching me to learn photography professionally. Even though my batchmates are holding high positions, I’m happy to guide youngsters.

Q. Are you not worried about the changing technology?

A. My father was a famous tailor and owned a shop at Yashwant Stadium. Twelve persons were working under him. With the changing trends in ready-made garments, his profession was short lived. But I’m sure that it won’t happen with photography as the world is depending a lot on visuals. Plus, the knowledge that I have acquired keeps me updated with the changing trend.

Q. To who would you attribute your success in photography?

A. My elder brother Nilesh, who is serving the country through the Border Security Force (BSF) on the Jammu & Kashmir border, has been a father figure after the demise of my father. I was also lucky to get a very helpful personality like Mayank Mishra, a neighbour and a businessman who himself is a very good photographer. He had a lot of faith in my abilities and gave me all his equipment to pursue my career in photography. He was the one who guided me and told me to work hard and honestly.

HYDERABAD: Over 70 lakh acres of the land on either side of major rivers Godavari and Krishna would be rejuvenated in the state soon if the efforts of the government are materialized. While the detailed project reports (DPR) are being prepared, which would be submitted to the Centre next month, the works are expected to begin in April.“The idea of the project is to improve the water quality and water flow and reduce sedimentation five km on either side of the both the rivers Godavari and Krishna. Various state government departments such as forest, agriculture, horticulture, rural development and urban development departments are being roped in the project. They have been asked to submit their proposals by March 10 including financials,” GRS Reddy , state coordinator for Telangana and senior scientist at Institute of Forest Biodiversity told STOI.After successfully taking up Ganga rejuvenation project, the Centre has decided to rejuvenate thirteen rivers falling under nine river basins for development. The Indian Council of Forest Research and Education has been tasked with the work, Godavari river rejuvenation was entrusted to Institute of Biodiversity (IRB) in the Telangana. The Centre wants to complete the project within five years (2020-2025). “Godavari river basin in the state covers about 60,270 sq kms spread, Krishna covers 7,420 square kms including tributaries. Main Godavari itself covers 509 km in the state,” the coordinator said.The state irrigation officials said the entire riverscape (five kms on either side of the rivers) would be divided into three layers — natural landscape, agroforestry landscape and urban landscape. The first one would be taken up by the forest department and include work such as protection, habitat management by taking up soil and water conservation, weed control and bio-mediation. The second, agroforestry, is mostly to promote agriculture and horticulture production. “The farmers would be guided with soil and moisture conservation works and planting of economic and fruit trees. The urban landscapes (will be) to develop eco-parks, riverfront development, avenue plantation and institutional plantation,” GRS Reddy said.While development activity would be taken up by government departments, the private land owners have liberty to seek the government help. If the farmers come forward, the government would help them by giving some incentives, officials said.

CHANDIGARH: A total of 40 toll plazas in Punjab and Haryana under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have achieved over 61% target of the collection of toll fee through FASTag.

The toll fee collection through FASTag has increased from 37% in December 2019, to 61% in the first week of February. The NHAI had started the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) through FASTag on December 15, 2019, at all toll plazas across the country. There are 20 toll plazas each in Punjab and Haryana under the Chandigarh regional office of the NHAI.

The Union ministry of road transport and highways has also taken a decision to waive off cost of Rs 100 for FASTag between February 15 and 29, with an aim to increase digital collection of user fee via FASTag. ETC aims to remove bottlenecks at toll plazas, to ensure seamless movement of vehicles and collection of user fee using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.

Highest collection of toll fee through FASTag in the first week of February was recorded at Bhavdeen toll plaza under in Hisar at 81.42 %, followed by Makrauli toll plaza in Rohtak at 80.50%, and Saini Majra toll plaza in Ambala at 79.43%. Whereas the lowest collection of toll fee through FASTag was recorded at Chollang toll plaza at 38.38%, followed by Usma toll plaza at 41.38%, and Chak Bamniya toll plaza at 42.52%, all three in Jalandhar area.

NHAI regional project director K L Sachdeva told TOI that on an average 250 FASTags were being sold daily from each toll plaza in Punjab under his jurisdiction. He said that around 40,000 vehicles pass through Dappar toll plaza everyday and around 72% of them now have FASTag affixed on their windscreens.

Taking note of the high cash transaction at four toll plazas each in Punjab and Haryana, the Union ministry had last month granted 30 days exemption to these toll plazas to convert a maximum of 25% FASTag lanes into hybrid lanes to collect cash from vehicles. The extended period came to an end on Saturday (February 15). Toll plazas exempted in Haryana included: Chandimandir, Gharonda, Panipat and Shambhu. Those in Punjab included were at Dapar, Ladowal, Berhampur and Dhareri Jattan.

Now single lane on each side of all toll plazas would continue to be cash lane. The NHAI officials did say that considering the rush of vehicles in the single cash lane, they can take decision to divide such vehicles in two lanes to avoid more inconvenience to commuters. Any vehicle user without a FASTag entering a dedicated FASTag lane at any national highway toll plaza will have to pay double the applicable fee.

320,['16/02/2020'],First for Punjab: Biometric attendance for students at Mansa government school,"This story is from February 16, 2020

The school is in the district’s Bhikhi village

MANSA: Government Senior Secondary School at Bhikhi village of Mansa not only became the first school in Punjab to install a biometric system for attendance, but it has also started a mobile message service to keep parents and guardians informed about the attendance of their wards.

When the students mark attendance on reaching, the parents will automatically receive a SMS about the same. This is first of its kind in any government school, claim the school authorities.

The idea of informing the parents about the whereabouts of their daughters came up when the school authorities were brainstorming after finding out that at least in two cases the girls had lied to their parents about being in school when they were not.

Soon after biometric system was established, mobile numbers of parents were fed into the school system, which now sends the message twice to the registered mobile numbers — when the students log in upon entering or leaving the school. If the student is absent for the day, this will also be sent after 9.10am.

This is being done on a trial basis at the moment. “We have asked the parents to provide only mobile number that they use regularly so that messages could be seen well in time,” newly joined school principal Preetinder Ghai told TOI.

Principal Ghai said the school was inspired by the upgraded government schools in Delhi. And in three months, it managed to spruce up its infrastructure to the point that now the school authorities feel that they are ready to compete with upscale private schools.

“The school has a science park with 16 working models. We have put CCTV cameras in every classroom. The school has wifi and seven projectors for students’ use,” said Ghai. The school library is also being stocked with books that would encourage students to look beyond school curriculum. School managing committee chairman Malkit Singh said, “We want our students to feel as if they are in private schools.”

Nitin gandhari

NAGPUR: Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday junked the criticism made by the MVA government on Mihan failing to generate jobs and said he will soon come out with a list of persons employed at Mihan and various other companies in the region.

Speaking to the media during announcement of three-day Khasdar Audyogik Mahotsav, which is scheduled to start on March 14, the city MP said Mihan has been growing at a rapid pace and many big companies have already started their operations. “I had assured to provide jobs to 50,000 persons of which 33 ,000 are working there. A majority of them hail from the areas like Umred, Kamptee and others,” he said.

Accompanied by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) director P M Parlewar, MLA Mohan Mate and others, Gadkari said the Centre is planning to launch a portal titled, ‘Bharatcraft’, on the lines of Amazon, Flipkart and Alibaba for selling products made in India. “We’re in talks with the post offices, which are now converted into Indian Payments Bank , to use its manpower for delivering goods at home and also use its offices for storing them like online giants. We’re also in process of launching a website where ideas for innovation and research will be invited.”

Explaining about Mihan, Gadkari said that AIIMS had already started its operations from the new campus and its world class infrastructure was out of imagination. “The Dassault Company has already started making its nine-seater Falcon aircraft which will be out by 2022. The company will also be making parts of Rafale fighter jets. Tata group’s Tal Manufacturing Solutions is making parts for Boeing and Airbus. I’ve spoken to Patanjali directors and they told me that work is in final stage.”

Speaking on promotion of Khadi, the minister displayed a wrist watch made entirely from Khadi and being sold at Rs5,000 per piece. “Except the machine of the watch, every other things have been developed by Khadi. We’ve tremendous potential in Khadi industry with innovative products. There are many success stories on Khadi industry in the region. The government has also launched various schemes to promote these products,” the minister said.

Elucidating on use of other products like honey and milk, Gadkari said both have big potential in the region if marketed properly and can provide huge employment opportunities, particularly in the tribal-dominated areas like Gadchiroli, Melghat, Gondia and Bhandara. “Now, SpiceJet is offering honey pouches with tea in their flights. Mother Dairy’s operations in the region have helped the milk producers to sell their products.”

Khasdar Audyogik Mahotsav from March 14-16

After a grand success of Khasdar Krida and Khel Mahotsav, now Gadkari has come out with another innovative concept of Khasdar Audyogik Mahotsav. “The mega event would be organized at SCZCC, MLA Hostel and Deshpande Hall where exhibitions on industrial products and discussions of experts on various topics will be held simultaneously,” MSME director Parlewar said, adding that it would be a regular feature in the city’s calendar every year.

Gadkari informed that industries minister Subhash Desai was invited for the event along with all MLAs from the region. “I would soon be conducting a meeting of all MPs and MLAs and request them to send youths from their respective constituencies for visiting the event,” he said, adding that youths will get employment opportunities through the event.

A mega national industrial expo will be the highlight of event where big industries and public sector units will be showcasing their products and technologies along with startups and MSMEs. Even IT/ITES industry along with research and educational institutions will be part of the expo.

324,['16/02/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Fear in air as new master plan takes wings,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Representative image

TAMIL NADU: Now that the state government has requested the civil aviation ministry to stick to the old master plan for the airport expansion project, for which 627.89 acres was notified, landowners are a worried lot as they fear the impasse would further delay their compensation. Most of them said the issue, as the state government fears, would lead to more litigations, stay on land acquisition and delay in settlement.

Earlier this year, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had conveyed to the state government that as per the new master plan, only 606 acres was required for the project, of which 6 acres fall outside the notified area. However, the state government had on Thursday shot off a letter to the civil aviation ministry, requesting it to stick to the original plan.

Narayani, a resident of Madurai , said his nine cents in block four was marked for acquisition in 2010-11 and that he was stuck in the (acquisition) process for the past nine years. “When the notification was issued in 2010-11, we were upset. But we agreed to hand over our land in March 2018, when we realized that we had no other option. While the new master plan won’t affect the acquisition of my land, I hope the state government won’t further delay our compensation, citing this as a reason.” He said he had called up the officer incharge of land acquisition last month to know the status of payment. “The officer said money is coming.”

Other landowners, especially the ones who have leased out their land, said the AAI was being unfair to them. P R Jagannathan, who owns a plot of land in block two, said, “They stuck to a single master plan for the past 10 years. How can they suddenly change the plan when the land acquisition process is on?”

Murugesan, a landowner in block four, said he was taken aback by the recent developments. “We can’t use the notified land to get a bank loan. Banks treat the land like it has no value. We pray that the recent developments don’t delay our compensation in anyway. I am pinning my hope on that amount to find a shelter for my family.”

Another landowner, who didn’t want to be named, said the AAI didn’t seem to understand the seriousness of the issue and how they were affected.

Many residents in the notified area who have already taken loans to buy alternate apartments and land in the vicinity, are also nervous about the changes in the master plan. They were betting on the compensation to pay off the loans. Ajay D, son of a landowner in block eight said, “The government is yet to specify the 28 acres to be denotified. If owners of that land have already taken loans, they have to now look for buyers. It will, however, difficult for them to find buyers given the uncertainty over land acquisition in future.”

Airports Authority of India (AAI) now says it requires only 600 acres

TAMIL NADU: While 628 acres of land had already been notified for the much-awaited airport expansion project, the Airports Authority of India ( AAI ) now says it requires only 600 acres of it. That’s not all. It requires another 6 acres outside the notified area for the project as per the revised master plan. This calls for acquisition of land adjoining block 9 and 10.

The move hasn’t gone down well with the state government and local administration minister S P Velumani, has taken up the issue with Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri. He wants the AAI to reconsider its decision as the state government has already initiated the land acquisition process for the notified 628 acres.

“We have begun compensating landowners in blocks 1,7 and 11 and allotted Rs264.47 crore for the same so far. The state-level committee has already approved land acquisition in another 13 blocks,” Velumani said.

The state government also fear that a change in plan would offer landowners an opportunity to seek compensation under the New Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Settlement Act of 2013.

“This would fetch an additional burden of 100% solatium on the exchequer, while the market value of land would go up by another 12%. The case would be same be it the owners of 6 acres additional land to be acquired, or the ones who have already consented to part with their land under the industrial purposes act. The huge burden on the exchequer will halt the entire process of land acquisition,” the minister said.

The government also fear more criticism from the landowners, who he thinks would stop cooperating with the district administration.

327,['16/02/2020'],Punjab: Lukewarm response to hiring retired doctors plan,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government’s plan to overcome shortage of specialist doctors at its facilities by offering re-employment after retirement has got a lukewarm response.

Grappling with a shortage of surgeons, gynaecologists, physicians and paediatricians, the government had decided to offer them re-employment up to 65 years of age, after attaining superannuation at the age of 60.

The department has got 27 applications, but it doubts if any of the applicants would join back as they will not be given a post of their choice or any administrative responsibilities. Rehired doctors will perform only clinical duties with no additional financial benefits. They will get remuneration equal to the last drawn salary minus pension.

Also, for a retired specialist, setting up one’s own facility or working with a private hospital is more lucrative.

Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said retired doctors were being offered jobs at places where there was a shortage of specialists and this might be the key reason for not many showing interest. “We will again invite applications and will make necessary changes in conditions if required,” said Sidhu.

Rural health statistics released by the Union health and family welfare ministry in January had pointed out shortage of specialist doctors. According to the report, Punjab was among three states in the country which recorded a decrease in the number of specialists. Against the sanctioned posts of 496 specialists doctors (surgeons, gynaecologists, physicians and paediatricians), only about 93 are occupied.

Only 32 of the 111 sanctioned posts of surgeon are occupied at community health centres (CHCs) in rural areas. Also, 98 posts of obstetricians and gynaecologists are lying vacant. Similarly, there is a shortage of 72 physicians and 70 paediatricians in rural CHCs .

Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) fears the situation could get worse as doctors who have completed 20 years of service, which made them eligible for post-retirement benefits, have started to resign.

PCMSA president Dr Gagandeep Singh said not many doctors were willing to take up jobs in government hospitals due to lack of benefits. “Recently, two specialists doctors – skin and orthopedics – resigned on completion of 20 years. More will follow,” he said.

Dr Singh said the government should make efforts for creating specialists within the existing workforce by giving incentives. “A delegation of the association last week met principal health secretary and took up issue pertaining to shortage of specialist doctors,” he said. The association submitted suggestions for resolving the problem.

The first session showcased the potential of the region as industrialists presented their perception.

PB Anand Padmanabhan, president, Shahi Exports, said he has seen three governments in the past five years but industrial policies have been stable. He appreciated the state government, saying elected representatives, irrespective of political affiliation, and officials have been very responsive about handling grievances. “I haven’t seen such a responsive attitude in any other state,” he added.

He said his company had 23 factories in Bengaluru eight years ago. “Now, we have 24 factories in other districts of the state. We have invested Rs 200 crore in North Karnataka in the past two years and now plan to set up five factories in Dharwad, Belagavi, Gadag and Ballari districts. We’ll also set up power plants in the region,” he added.

Aravind Melligeri, chairman and CEO, Aequs, Belagavi, said he set up the company in Belagavi to challenge China. “Everyone who had doubts about our future are now wonderstruck to know that every aircraft in the world is equipped with parts manufactured in Belagavi. Many talk about lack of logistics support in North Karnataka, but we deliver our product to Paris in 48 hours. Our clients, who thought we were in Belgium, today pronounce Belagavi with ease,” he said.

CHANDIGARH: From non-compliance of rules to shortage of medicines, the survey for implementation of programmes of National Rural Health Mission 2019-20 has painted a grim picture of district hospitals in Punjab .To ensure timely execution of key components of National Health Mission by the state, Union health ministry got a survey conducted in four districts — Sangrur, Mohali , Moga and Patiala —through population research centres of Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (Crrid) and Panjab University, for which field survey was carried out in November last year.In Sangrur district, monitoring was done in district hospital, community health centre, Bhawanigarh; primary health centre, Chajjli; and sub-centre in Bhattiwal Kalan . The report pointed out that against norms of NHM, a number of women were discharged early in cases of both normal or C-section deliveries due to shortage of beds in the district hospital. Also, women were made to share beds in the gynaecological ward.Part of the building of district hospital was found to be dilapidated. Shortage of essential drugs was found in all health facilities in Sangrur where sampling was done. Vitamin-A, antibiotics, painkillers and antacid injections were found to be in short supply in the district hospital. The CHC lacked Vitamin-A, Amoxyclav, Ranitidine injection and Ondansetron injection.The PHC did not have antibiotics. Highlighting poor quality, the report pointed out that the gynaecologist, orthopedician, eye surgeon and surgeon were utilising the same operation theatre for different operations, compromising norms of quality. The sub-centre was found lagging in segregation of bio-medical waste at source.Due to absence of security guard, the fear of being threatened by the patients and their kin, especially at night time, was affecting the smooth functioning of health facilities. Non-availability of guard at night led to chaos on many occasions, forcing the health authorities to call police for help.The public health centre in Landran , Mohali, was found to be operating from a shared building with veterinary hospital. With no partition, entry was common for patients and animals, thus exposing patients to infection. The community health centre in Mohali lacked proper cleanliness. The condition of the public health centre’s building was not good.A number of posts of medical specialists, like paediatrician, surgeon, gynaecologist, ophthalmologist, radiologist and physician, were lying vacant in all sampled districts.In the district hospital of Sangrur, only 3 paediatricians against 16 sanctioned posts were worker. While 13 posts of surgeon had been sanctioned, only 7 were filled. Dr Pyara Lal Garg, health expert and former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, demanded an audit of National Health Mission programme in Punjab. He said the government should fix accountability for irregularities.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74157393,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37513,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/survey-paints-grim-picture-of-health-service-in-rural-punjab/articleshow/74155398.cms
332,['16/02/2020'],Maharashtra government seeks legal opinion on forming SIT for Elgar case,"This story is from February 16, 2020

PUNE: State home minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday said the government had sought legal opinion from the advocate-general if a Special Investigation Team could still be formed to look into the Pune police action in the Elgar Parishad case despite its further probe being transferred to the National Investigation Agency.

He said, “We have sent a note to the advocate-general, asking him to give legal opinion on whether the state government form an SIT (Special Investigation Team) after the central government had transferred the Elgar case to the NIA. If the advocate-general’s opinion is ‘yes’, then the government will constitute an SIT.”

Deshmukh’s statement came in the wake of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s consent to a probe by the NIA despite alliance partner NCP’s opposition. NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday had expressed his disapproval of Thackeray’s consent to hand over the investigation into the case to the NIA.

Deshmukh made the statement in the presence of city police commissioner K Venkatesham and other senior officers while interacting with reporters during his maiden visit to the Pune police commissionerate.

“NCP chief Sharad Pawar had given a letter to constitute an SIT headed by a retired judge to inquire into the Pune police action because he had received several complaints and the nine activists arrested in the case were respectable citizens. We had reviewed the investigation conducted by the Pune police on January 23. On the next day, the central government issued a notification transferring the Elgar case to the NIA. We had opposed the decision of handing over the case to the NIA because the state government was not consulted before taking such an important decision,” he said.

Deshmukh said, “We had also opposed the transfer of the case to the NIA before the special UAPA court in Pune. The chief minister later overruled the decision taken by me. The NIA has now taken over the case from the state police and we now expect them to conduct a fair and proper investigation.”

On the 36 rioting cases related to Koregaon Bhima clashes registered with the Pune rural police, he said some of the cases were still being probed by the police and the chargesheets would be filed on completion of investigations.

It is the police’s case that the Maoists supported and funded the Elgar Parishad in Pune on December 31, 2017 as a part of a larger conspiracy to create social unrest and overthrow the government. Alleged provocative speeches and inflammatory statements at the Parishad contributed to the caste clashes at Koregaon Bhima near Pune on January 1, 2018.

333,['16/02/2020'],"At 100, Osmansagar’s tide hits an ebb","This story is from February 16, 2020

HYDERABAD: The picturesque Osmansagar , an engineering and architectural marvel, has turned 100. While it should have been an event for Hyderabadis to rejoice, ironically the reservoir across the river Musi has fallen on bad days in its centennial year.

Osmansagar was built in 1920 by the Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, as part of the two-pronged strategy of engineer-genius Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya to tame floods in Musi and provide drinking water to a million people in Hyderabad.

The foundation stone was laid by the Nizam on March 23, 1913, and the lake was ready, brimming with water in 1920. The Nizam VI, Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, had conceived the project soon after the devastating deluge in 1908 that had killed about 50,000 people (reported by Los Angeles Herald in its October 2, 1908, issue). The flood had affected over 4 lakh people and caused financial loss of Rs 20 crore, which, if compared to present-day price of gold, would be Rs 6.05 lakh crore. The devastation was huge and human bodies lay strewn all over.

The deluge was the result of unprecedented rainfall over a catchment of 860 square miles of Musi and its tributary Esi on September 28, 1908. The quantum of rainfall recorded at Shamshabad, where a rain gauge was available, was 12.8 inches in 24 hours and 18.90 inches in 48 hours. The flood discharge was 4.25 lakh cusecs and the narrow Musi could not withstand the flash flood, resulting in unprecedented death and destruction in Hyderabad.

The construction of Osmansagar had prevented flash floods in Hyderabad in the last 100 years. The occasional flooding in the city is not due to overflowing of the Musi, but encroachments on channels that drain the rainwater into the numerous lakes dotting the city and ultimately into Musi.

INTACH Hyderabad convener P Anuradha Reddy says Osmansagar is not a mere water body, it is part of the engineering and architectural heritage of the princely Hyderabad state. The survival of Osmansagar is essential for Hyderabad for many reasons. Apart from its environmental charm and benefits, Osmansagar is part of Hyderabad’s hydrological cycle. It was one of the biggest structures built in the British India. “Osmansagar is an engineering marvel. It speaks volumes of the genius of the father of Indian engineering, Sir Visvesvaraya , who took care of every detail of the dam. We presented the lake with INTACH award not only for its engineering superiority but also for the unique hydrological equipment it possesses,” she says.

Unprecedented planning went into the lake design and construction. Material was sourced from a special railway line laid for the project.

334,['16/02/2020'],Going green with herb-infused water in glass bottles,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Ahmedabad: When the Who’s Who of environment activists and political leaders from across the globe congregate at the 13th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS-COP13) at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar beginning February 15 their thirst will be slaked by HerbalH20, a herb-infused water in glass bottles. The brainchild of Vadodara-based entrepreneur, Prateek Patel, 30, the herbal water is giving a spirited fight to packaged water in plastic bottles and creating its own space among those concerned about health and environment. And to reach the tables at CMS-COP 13 is no mean achievement for a product that’s just six months old.

Patel launched his startup, Shrishti Lifescience, and his product, HerbalH2O, with a strategy to go green, after spending four years in management consultancy for pharmaceuticals and auto industries.

In recent seminars held by government agencies, Dholera Special Investment Development Authority (DSIRDA) and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation , Patel’s company served water in returnable glass bottles rather than using plastic bottles that are discarded after use. At these seminars, HerbalH20 used natural botanical extract of basil to flavour the water.

With the health and environmental appeal of HerbalH2O, Patel’s franchise-based business model and concept of circular economy is making quick inroads in the bottled water segment, a top sector of FMCG products. His herbal water in glass bottles has become a regular feature at government, NGO and corporate events.

“Our herb-enhanced water in glass bottles is a better alternative to water packaged in plastic. We have set up plants across the country with each plant having 1 lakh per day bottling capacity. Nine more plants are in the pipeline for Delhi, Indore, Nagpur, Raipur, Somnath and Udaipur among other cities,” Patel said.

“Drinking water can be used as a medium to deliver the compounds of essential herbs, which we generally do not consume due to lack of habit or ready availability. HerbalH2O gives you the option of drinking the goodness of herbs without additional efforts. The glass bottles reduce micro-plastic contamination of water and help mitigate plastic waste generation,” said Patel, adding that this thought was the primary driver behind his startup venture.

“Each 200ml plastic packaged water bottle generates approximately 11 grams of plastic waste. The glass bottle is the safest and most eco-friendly form of packaging as it doesn’t react with the product and can be reused. We follow the concept of circular economy of packaging. In the circular economy, nothing goes to dustbins. We buy back all used bottles for 30% to 50% of MRP. This makes the product safe from packaging contamination and prevents waste generation and reduces the packaging cost in the long run as packaging comes back instead of going to the dumping yard,’’ Patel added.

Patel claims that in the last six months, approximately 300 tonnes of plastic waste generation has been prevented with his venture of providing herbal-infused drinking water in glass bottles.

“We add extracts of herbs grown in-house in the drinking water. We have four variants for three seasons — Tulsi for monsoon, mint and fennel for summer, and ginger for winter,” Patel said.

“Previously one litre of water in India sold at the MRP of at least Rs 200 but his pricing is Rs 80 and if consumer return the bottle they get a cashback of Rs 30, that cost Rs 50 for glass bottled Enhanced Drinking. This cost will soon be reduced as volume will increase and it has a potential to compete with single use plastic bottled water in prices as well and I am working on it,’’ entrepreneur claims.

Patel claims that in the last six months, approximately 300 tonnes of plastic waste generation has been prevented with his venture of providing herbal-infused drinking water in glass bottles.

“Drinking water can be used as a medium to deliver the compounds of essential herbs, which we generally do not consume due to lack of habit or ready availability. HerbalH2O gives you the option of drinking the goodness of herbs without additional efforts. The glass bottles reduce micro-plastic contamination of water and help mitigate plastic waste generation.” Prateek Patel, founder, Shrishti Lifescience

PUNE: The global coronavirus outbreak is playing havoc with the prices of plastic and electronic toys in the city.These toys are imported from China, the epicentre of the global health emergency, and the consequent supply disruption has resulted in a 40% spike prices, sources from the Toy Traders Association of Pune said.“There is a 50% shortage of these toys in Pune, and the prices have been on an upward spiral since December 1, 2019, ever since the market in China was shut in the wake of the outbreak,” a source said.India’s toy markets are dominated to the tune of nearly 70% by Chinese imports, including electronic cars, musical toys, dolls, kitchen sets, toys for toddlers and remote-controlled toys, among others.Sachin Kulkarni, who owns a toy store on Laxmi Road, said the cost of battery-operated stuffed toys has gone up from Rs790-800 to Rs1,000 in the past month. “The sudden surge in prices could also be attributed to the stringent changes in Union government’s Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification and the recent announcement of a hike in import duty on toys from 20% to 60%,” he said.As per the recent notification issued by the Centre, imported toys will now need to be tested locally and must comply with BIS standards. “Non-compliant toys would have to be destroyed. Given the uncertainty regarding quality, many toy dealers have started to refrain from importing,” Kulkarni said.He added the local market was in a panic. “We expect a further 20-30% hike in toy prices,” he added. “No new consignment has arrived from China since the outbreak,” Rahul Chheda, owner of Ambika Toys on Laxmi Road, said.Bad news is in store for the furniture sector too. “Almost 35-40 % of the furniture is imported from China.

Ahmedabad: Cyber cell investigators were puzzled on encountering the case in which Jagdish Parmar, 56, and Manilal Maheriya, 64, residents of Saijpur Bogha with savings accounts in the same bank, lost money to cyber criminals.

Both complainants say they did not share bank accounts details or one-time passwords (OTPs) with anyone and yet cyber criminals managed to siphon off Rs 2.80 lakh from their accounts. Some of the money was withdrawn at ATMs in Delhi and some through online transfers.

Deputy commissioner of police, cyber cell, Rajdeepsinh Jhala said there has to be an insider involved for the thieves to have got the bank account and debit card details. “We have some clues and will soon crack both cases,” he added.

In a complaint registered on February 14, Manilal Maheriya, stated that on April 10, 2019 at about 11.35am he received a message from his bank informing him that Rs 20,000 had been withdrawn from his account from a ATM and another Rs 80,000 were transferred online to a certain account.

“Maheriya said he had never shared his bank details or an OTP with anyone but the money was still siphoned off from his account,” said an investigator.

In another complaint, lodged on February 15, Jagdish Parmar, 56, a wireman, stated that on the morning of January 19, he saw a message from his bank informing him that Rs 20,000 had been withdrawn twice from an ATM in Delhi.

Rs 40,000 had been transferred online to the account of one Rahul Kumar and another Rs 40,000 had been transferred to the account of one Rakeshkumar,” a cyber cell official said.

Cyber cell officials said Parmar also said that he had not shared his banking details or OTPs with anyone. “We have details of the ATM centre from which the money was withdrawn and the account numbers the money was transferred to,” an investigator said.

Pune: State home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Saturday that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government would amend the building bylaws to make it mandatory for builders to install CCTV cameras in new and old buildings.

“The buildings need to have cameras installed at vantage points on their premises, including entry and exit points. The building authorities should monitor the cameras and help police in gathering evidence, if needed,” Deshmukh said.

“We have proposed the installation of certain software, embedded with artificial intelligence, in CCTV control rooms so that they can detect the face of any criminal on record from images captured by the cameras. In such a situation, the concerned police stations would be alerted,” he said.

“Soon, a team would visit Telangana to study the legal aspects of women’s safety so as to expedite judicial processes against suspects involved in cases of crime against women. This is to avoid incidents like the one at Hinganghat in Wardha, where a woman was torched by a man,” Deshmukh said.

On shortage of manpower in the state police force, he said there had been a freeze on recruitment for the past five years, but now they have plans to recruit 8,000 policemen. He also reiterated that a two-member committee was investigating phone-tapping complaints put forth by politicians from different parties.

BENGALURU: A sports utility vehicle driver allegedly hit two bike-borne students and escaped on Friday night. While police were initially reluctant to register an FIR, friends of the students played Sherlock Holmes by tracking down the car within two hours of the accident .

The car has been seized by police but the driver is yet to be identified. The drama unfolded in front of Central Mall in Jayanagar around 11.30pm on Friday when the victims, Mohammed Murtaza Jamal and Naveen Kumar — both engineering students and residents of Kumaraswamy Layout — were headed back home after visiting a friend’s house.

A speeding SUV knocked down their two-wheeler and the driver fled with the car. Murtaza and Naveen, who suffered serious head injuries, were shifted to a nearby hospital by passersby and fellow motorists.

Murtaza’s brother Mujtaba Jamal told TOI he learnt about the accident within 10 minutes. “By the time I reached the spot, my brother and his friend were shifted to hospital. We looked around the accident spot and found a numberplate, which must have fallen off after the collision. We approached police to take up the case but they were reluctant. By then, Murtaza’s friends and classmates reached the hospital and the numberplate’s photo was shared with them. One of them claimed he had spotted a vehicle with a similar numberplate in his locality, near Banashankari BDA complex,” Mujtaba said. After searching for some time, the friends managed to identify the place where the SUV was parked.

They returned to Jayanagar traffic police and informed cops about the car’s location. Around 2am, police visited the house and seized the car. However, there was no information about who was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident.

Mujtaba, who made many rounds of the police station, eventually got the case registered at 2pm on Saturday. Meanwhile, Naveen and Murtaza underwent surgeries on Saturday. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic west) SK Soumyalatha said they have registered a case and probe is under way.

The caller told him to send himself a text with details of his card, including the CVV. Not long after, the man got a message that Rs45,000 was debited from his bank account.“The fraudster by then had access to my phone, so he could even see the one-time password (OTP) sent by the bank, which he used to make the transaction using my card details,” the professional said on condition of anonymity.This was just one among many similar cases of cyberfraud that have cropped up in the city. In the 46 days of this year, the cybercrime police have received 110 such complaints.“We are encountering this new phishing fraud all of a sudden, with almost 110 complaints from January 2020. Such frauds are increasing across India, including Pune. Such complaints started pouring in last December,” inspector Jayram Paigude of the cybercrime cell of the Pune police said.The cybercrime police suspect the involvement of gangs in Jamtara in Jharkhand and from West Bengal. Jamtara is notorious as the hub of phishing attacks in the country. “The fraudsters’ bank accounts are usually traced to northeastern locations,” Paigude added, advising, “People should be aware that no matter who claims to be calling them, they must not respond to such unknown calls that solicit confidential information. Our investigations are on and we plan to block the fraudsters’ bank accounts and mobile numbers connected with these cases.”Shweta Chawla, a digital forensic investigator and head of Pune-based SC Cyber Solutions, said this was a widespread trick. “People get calls claiming that their mobile wallet KYC is suspended. The fraudsters say that they would help the user update KYC information and take the user through a series of steps,” Chawla explained.“One of the things that they tell the victim to do is click on a remote-access software link sent by them, which helps them gain control of the victim’s cellphone. Then, while keeping the victim on the call, they start financial transactions through the victim’s mobile wallet or credit card associated with the wallet. The victim, being on call, may not pay attention to the OTPs sent by the bank. Since the fraudsters have access to the victim’s phone, they directly copy those OTP’s,” she added.Chawla further said most victims are not aware that the link could be dangerous and instead, misinterpret it as a patch or update from the mobile wallet company. “I have come across four or five such cases recently,” she said. “Such frauds seem to be ‘upgraded phishing attacks’, with one victim having lost Rs1 lakh, while another lost Rs50,000,” she added.Paytm Payments Bank, which has one of India’s most popular e-wallet, said it never calls or contacts any user for sensitive information. A spokesperson said, “We are at the forefront of building digital safety for online payments. Paytm doesn’t call nor message anything related to KYC.”The spokesperson further said the company constantly educates and informs customers to not fall prey to such messages and calls. “Our app alerts users to uninstall suspicious apps that give remote access to the user’s smartphone. Similarly, we have been working with telecom companies to block such spam messages and calls,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company recently filed an FIR against such fraudsters. “Our cyber cell is connected to police crime branches to effectively tackle fraud as and when it is reported,” the Paytm spokesperson said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74158020,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-389230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cyber-fraudsters-use-remote-access-app-kyc-bait-to-phish-for-money/articleshow/74155453.cms

Hyderabad: Except for a few years when the inflows were meagre, Osmansagar had provided drinking water to lakhs of people for almost 90 years. The last 10 years have, however, been problematic, as concretisation picked pace. In fact, it was the only mega source of drinking water in Hyderabad for seven years (1920-27) before another reservoir, Himayatsagar, was built across the Esi, a tributary of the Musi, in 1927.

When the foundation stone was laid for the dam in 1913, AT Mackenzie, then superintending engineer, irrigation branch of public works department (PWD), had announced that Osmansagar would be known for its purity, copiousness and permanence.

“It can challenge comparison with any town in the East. This is no light undertaking. In no part of the world would it be a small matter to dam up a river draining nearly 300 sq miles of country and subject to violent floods, with a wall 125 feet high, to transform it into a placid lake three or four times the area of the Hussainsagar, and capable of containing 10 times the quantity of water, to construct a covered conduit 12 miles long, and a pipe system for nearly a million people,” Mackenzie had said, adding that there have been big engineering works carried out in India, but Osmansagar in its boldness and width of view is as big as any.

The dam has a storage capacity of 3.9 tmc feet. The length of the dam is 6,300 feet with the masonry part extending to 3,400 ft. It has a flood discharge capacity of 92,100 cusecs.

Pune: The city police and revenue authorities on Saturday auctioned six four-wheelers of the developer, DS Kulkarni, who is in prison with other family members for a cheating case.

The auction generated a total of Rs39.45 lakh. It was conducted on the premises of the Shivajinagar police station on FC Road.

Tehsildar Sandesh Shirke, assistant commissioner of police Shivaji Pawar (crime) and inspectors Manisha Zende and Sunil Gawali overlooked the auction process. The

The Pune police had seized the 13 vehicles — including a high-end Porsche, two BMW cars an MV Agusta motorcycle — from DS Kulkarni in 2018 during the course of the investigation of the alleged Rs2,091 crore economic fraud of the developer and his firm. The vehicles were worth around Rs5 crore.

A special MPID court had cleared the auction of nine of the seized vehicles.

On Saturday morning, seven out of the nine vehicles were taken out for auction. But, there were no takers for the MV Agusta motorcycle. The six vehicles, all cars, were sold within three hours, a police officer said.

The Regional Transport Office (RTO) had estimated the cost of these vehicles to the tune of Rs33.15 lakh, Shirke said.

The highest bid of Rs9.3 lakh for a car was announced by Sampat Patil, a farmer from Kolhapur. The cheapest car was sold at Rs3.05 lakh, the police said.

A police officer told TOI that the motorcyle’s bid started from Rs26 lakh. But, none of the bidders were interested.

Around 60 bidders from across the city participated in the auction procedure. Majority of them were involved in the business of second hand cars.

346,['16/02/2020'],Rapping the truth,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Even to have a conversation with AR Rahman would be enough”. Sri Lankan- origin Canadian rapper Shan Vincent de Paul is on his first multi-city concert tour to India, called Oh Gawd, and he has a wish list, sort of. There’s the Indian food that he is looking forward to as he travels to Pune, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, apart from Bengaluru. But the one thing he hopes comes true is meeting music composer AR Rahman: A huge inspiration for Paul, so much so that his latest single, Best Friend, samples Rahman's iconic song, Mustafa Mustafa (from the 1996 movie, Kadhal Desam. More on this song later, first let’s get talking about Paul and his Mrithangam Rap series that has made him and co-collaborator Yanchan , familiar and much-loved faces in India, the Tamil community in particular.

Marrying mridangam and rap

Mrithangam Rap has Yanchan play the traditionally classical instrument, the mridangam, to Paul’s incessant rapping - mostly in English with a few Tamil words interspersed, one of the rap songs in fact has a popular Rajinikanth dialogue thrown in. The idea - of pairing mridangam with rap is, to quote a fan’s response on their YouTube page, “Brilliant, who would have thunk!” “The fusion is what makes it interesting. I grew up on American rap, Yanchan on Carnatic music, and Mrithangam Rap is about bringing these two worlds together,” says Paul about the collaboration which started as a simple jamming experiment. “We only rehearsed once before the camera started rolling, and then we just went with the flow,” he recalls about what transpired when they sat down to shoot the first video. Today, Paul is credited as the creator of Carnatic rap – ‘an entirely new fusion of classical Eastern instruments with Westerninfluenced rap’. Did he expect Mrithangam Rap to succeed? Yes and No.

“I expected it to do well. I remember telling Yanchan to wait till episode 10 by when it would blow up. The first one went viral and by the third, it had exploded. I was surprised by how quickly it took off,” he says. The series currently has six episodes, and Paul reveals that he and Yanchan will be playing a few of those songs in their concerts here. After all, the virality of the series was a major factor in them getting the gig at the VH1 Supersonic music festival in Pune.

Rap and racism

Paul’s songs talk about topical issues like racism, toxic masculinity, and immigration. Growing up in Brampton, Canada as son of Sri Lankan immigrants - they had migrated from Jaffna to Montreal as refugees, Paul was the only brown kid in his elementary school and so racism was something he’d had close encounters with. In fact, he admits to seeing systemic racism in Toronto even today. “Toronto is one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world but there is systemic racism and that had affected how I viewed myself for the longest time. It was only when I began to see myself as an artiste that I realised that my skin colour didn’t matter anymore.”

A song to celebrate male friendships

Now, back to the song, Best Friend, and Paul explains that the idea for the song came from a need to break stereotypes about male friendships. “When we talk about toxic masculinity, a lot of it starts with how men treat other men. When you read about rapes or sexual abuse, those things start with how men treat themselves. Boys are told not to cry, not to express themselves physically; there’s so much insecurity about holding hands among men! So the song, which is also a tribute of ours to AR Rahman, is about challenging society’s ideas of masculinity and loving your friend,” Paul explains.

348,['16/02/2020'],Osmansagar can meet water needs of 47 crore people for a year,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Osmansagar

HYDERABAD: How much groundwater is recharged by Osmansagar lake a year? It is sufficient to meet the drinking water needs of one-third of India’s population for a full one year. Sounds strange? Here are the calculations.

Estimates reveal that the quantum of water Osmansagar helps in the groundwater recharge is whopping 17,395 kilo lakh litres a year. This is sufficient to meet the drinking water needs of 47.34 crore people for a year or 52.60 lakh people for 90 years.

According to rainwater harvesting and conservation manual of the Government of India, 100 square metres of a porous ground will yield 80,000 litres of water per year if the annual rainfall is 800 mm. If this calculation is considered, Osmansagar, which is spread over 22 sq km, will yield 17,395 kilo lakh litres a year as the annual rainfall in Hyderabad is 800 mm.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has fixed drinking water standards at 10 litres per person per day. This translates to 3.65 kilo litres per year. Based on this WHO standard, the groundwater recharge done by Osmansagar (17,395 kilo lakh litres) is sufficient for 47.65 crore population (one-third of India) for 365 days.

Osmansagar is not a mere lake across the Musi. It controls the flood flow into the Musi downstream in Hyderabad, apart from recharging the groundwater table in the otherwise rocky terrain with a little porosity. The lake feeds the aquifers that replenish the groundwater table in the IT corridor, financial district and emerging residential and commercial quarters in western parts of Hyderabad.

It also supports vast biodiversity in the form of aquatic, terrestrial and avian fauna. If the lake dries up, the parts of Hyderabad that form the financial and IT capital of Hyderabad will lose the water table. The city will also lose its “reserve” drinking water body that would be helpful in times of emergency when Krishna and Godavari supplies are hit.

COIMBATORE: Residents of Immidipalayam village near Kinathukadavu are facing inconvenience as bus number 42, which used to ply four times a day, is now operating only once.

Due to this, 60 children, who study at the Kinathukadavu Government Higher Secondary School, have been denied transportation, the villagers said.

The bus, which operates from Pollachi till Devaradipalayam via Immidipalayam, used to conducts four trips to the village — at 8am, 2pm, 6pm and 8pm. “But now it comes only at 8am. This is causing severe inconvenience to the public. While adults who go to work come back in autorickshaws, children who go to school, have no other option but to walk back,” said A K Periyar Mani, an activist and a resident.

The issue has been persisting for over a month, said T Manikandan, a Class XII student. “In between, the officials let some buses to our area. But now, even that has stopped,” he said. “The school gets over at 5pm. We used to board the bus and reach our homes within half-an-hour. But now, we have to get another bus till Vadasithur and then walk from there for around 3km. It now takes about two hours to reach home from school.”

When they asked why the trips have stopped, Tamil Nadu state transport corporation (TNSTC) authorities told them that there was not much revenue from the trips, Mani said.

TNSTC officials have promised to look into the issue.

The university will set up a world-class research centre, ‘Kaani Nilam’, which will act as a one-stop destination for all possible information, research requirements and queries about Bharathi, professors of the university’s Tamil department said.

“The university has taken up the project to mark the centenary death anniversary of the poet, which falls in September 2021,” said S Chitra, professor, department of Tamil, who is also organising the project.

“We will collect documents, manuscripts, research and archival materials and make it available for all so that anyone can use it for their research projects on Subramania Bharathi. Also, any Bharathi lover can visit the centre to experience his works and life,” she said.

In an attempt to recreate Bharathi’s life and personality, the centre will have models of the houses he resided at various points of his life. Besides having visualisations from his masterworks such as Kannan Paattu and Panchali Sabatham, the centre would also have a model of ‘kuyil thoppu’ or ‘koel orchard’, which features in one of his masterpieces ‘Kuyil Paattu’ (The Song of Koel).

To gather original materials related to the poet, the university authorities have been speaking to his descendants, Chitra said. “We have spoken to his sister’s son who lives in Varanasi. He is 96 now. He has the poet’s harmonium, a pen and other things used by Bharathi. Some other relatives have approached us saying they have rare documents related to him. We are trying to source them. If not, we will try to bring models of them for the centre,” she said. The centre will also house a collection of published secondary literature and pop culture references the poet, she added.

On Saturday, the university officials, headed by vice-chancellor P Kaliraj, held a discussion with writers, scholars and prominent people from the city and presented the idea to them.

Panaji: Two years after Goa and Portugal inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for technical cooperation for water supply and waste water management, Aguas de Portugal (AdP) and public works department ( PWD ) signed a formal “Work Contract” to improve the Selaulim and Opa water treatment plants.

In September 2018, Goa’s public works department (PWD) entered into an understanding with the Portuguese government agency in Lisbon to upgrade the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at Selaulim water supply project and implement it for the Opa project. The project was to be implemented in a two-year period but instead suffered a two-year delay.

The arrival of Portugal president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa for a two-day visit offered the state government an opportunity to finalise the work contract, which was signed in the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar.

Aside from this, MoUs were signed between V M Salgaoncar Institute of International Hospitality Education and Turismo de Portugal, Govind Ramnath Kare College and University of Coimbra and IIT-Madras and INESC-TEC in the area of ports and waterways management.

“We in Goa can interact with the professionals from Portugal, on how to undertake urban development. The Portuguese have heritage cities that have been modernised while retaining their character,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant while speaking about the various MoUs inked.

Several additional MoUs were signed in the field of academics and scientific research. An agreement to establish academic, scientific and cultural cooperation in the framework of language and culture was also arrived at.

MoUs and letters of intent between the Portuguese Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC-TEC), under CEMENT (Cooperation for Excellence in Marine Exploration and Navigation Technologies) were also inked.

IIT-Goa, National Institute of Oceanography, National Centre for Polar and Oceanic Research (NCPOR), TERI - The Energy & Resources Institute and Goa Shipyard Ltd are part of the CEMENT initiative.

Goa Shipyard Ltd signed an agreement with Estaleiros Navais De Peniche (ENP) Portugal for collaboration and cooperation in the field of design, construction and supply of ships to African and Latin American countries.

SALEM: A special sub inspector (SSI) and a constable, both attached to Kannankurichi police station , have been placed under suspension for taking a bribe of Rs 1,000 from an autorickshaw driver to release his vehicle that was seized for violations of motor vehicles act.

It is to be noted that the SSI was caught for the same offence in 2018 and had served jail term for more than a month.

According to a police source, city police commissioner T Senthil Kumar placed SSI Subramani and police constable Ganesan under suspension after the auto driver submitted a video evidence of the duo accepting bribe from him.

The source said the incident took place on January 30 when the two were on a vehicle check in Periyakollapatty area on Hasthampatty-Yercaud stretch.

“They seized the auto as driver S Prakash, 28, didn’t wear uniform and failed to produce registration certificate of the vehicle and driving licence. The SSI asked Prakash to get the autorickshaw back after paying the fine before the court,” the source said.

Prakash subsequently paid the fine and approached the officers to claim his autorickshaw back. “However, they demanded Rs 1,000 to release the vehicle. Prakash paid them the bribe and videographed the same.” the source said.

He later forwarded the video to city police commissioner, seeking action against the SSI and the constable. Senthil Kumar ordered a departmental inquiry, which the deputy police commissioner (crime and traffic) S Senthil carried out. The inquiry revealed that the officers were at fault.

COIMBATORE: The city corporation on Saturday removed an indoor badminton court constructed on an open space reservation (OSR) land at GKD Nagar .

The space was reserved for a park and a shop, corporation officials said. The facility was also charging the users.

Corporation town planning officer Ravichandran told TOI that they removed 50% of the structure housing the court. “We will remove the entire structure in another day,” he said. “We faced no resistance from the residents, who were informed of the decision two to three days ago.”

The court was built by the resident welfare association of GKD Nagar on the park site a year ago. The association collected money from the people, who used it, on a monthly basis. That was when petitioner C K Varadarajan appealed to the Coimbatore corporation that the 36,272 sqft land marked for a park and 3,720 sqft marked for a shop, should only be used for that purpose.

The civic body issued the residents a notice on June 1, but no action was taken. It prompted Varadarajan to write to the Prime Minister’s cell, which in turn, directed the petition to the state chief secretary. That seems to have prompted the corporation to take the decision to demolish the structure.

Though the association defended building the structure, stating that it was built for public use, the petitioner said a park that has green cover would make it more useful for senior citizens and children.

Textile school students seek affiliation with central university

Coimbatore: Students of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management (SVPITM) on Avinashi Road in the city staged a sit-in protest on the campus for the second day on Saturday, demanding that the institute to be affiliated to the Central University of Tamil Nadu.

The institute, which functions under the ministry of textiles, is functioning like a private institution and there are no proper facilities, the protesters said. “There is no proper hostel facility for boys. Those who are from places afar such as West Bengal, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir, are forced to stay outside. In the girls’ hostel, 10 students are made to stay in one room,” said a protester. “There are no qualified faculty members with expertise in textile technology. There are also no proper laboratories on the campus,” he said.

There were talks that SVPITM would be made an incubation centre of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the protesters said. “We feel that things are moving in that direction. If that happens, we fear that our degrees would lose value,” said another protester. “The fee is much higher than that of any state or central university. Only if the institution is affiliated with the central university, it would get funds.”

The college offers three-year BSc course in textiles and two-year MBA courses in textiles, apparels and retail. It has 300 students and 12 teaching faculty members.

Repeated attempts to reach the director of the institution, M K Gandhi, went in vain.

358,['16/02/2020'],‘Modi government benefited telecom giants not users’,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Randeep Surjewala

CHANDIGARH: A day after the Supreme Court (SC) direction to telecom companies to clear the dues, All India Congress Committee communication head Randeep Surjewala on Saturday said the Modi government was only keen on lining the pockets of telecom giants while fleecing 112 crore Indian subscribers.

“Is the increase in mobile phone tariffs by 40% a means to recover AGR?” asked Surjewala. Surjwala also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to step down and take the moral responsibility of the scam which will directly hit 112 crore prepaid mobile phone users.

“He must step down, if he has any morality left. These allegations are not coming from us but are proved through statements made by government as well as Telephone Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). In fact, all this has been done to benefit major telecom giants, who are now facing the ire of the apex court and are bound to clear the dues,’’ he said.

Surjewala substantiated the allegations by elaborating on the chronology of events since October last year, when the apex court had directed telecom companies to pay Rs 1,02,000 crore towards the adjusted gross revenue under the Telecom Policy 1999.

“In November last year, the Union cabinet headed by Modi approved deferring Rs 42,000 crore spectrum auction instalment.

Following this, in December, the telecom companies had raised the tariff up to 40% and if you calculate the tariff to be recovered this will work out to little over 1.02000 lakh crore a year, if you consider 112 crore subscribers,’’ said Surjewala.

361,['16/02/2020'],Nirma charts inorganic growth story: cements its position among the top in India,"Ahmedabad: Homegrown Nirma Group once again grabbed the national headlines last week by acquiring the cement business of Emami Group for an enterprise value of Rs 5,500 crore. The acquisition has been made by Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Limited, which is a Nirma Group company.The deal involves buyout of Emami Cement Ltd (ECL)’s assets — cement plant and grinding units — with a total installed capacity of 8.3 million tonnes per annum. After the acquisition and the merger of its cement business in Rajasthan, Nuvoco will become one of the leading players in India’s cement industry with the installed capacity of 23.5 million tonnes and over 60 ready-mix plants dotted across East, North and West India.The man steering Nirma Limited’s inorganic growth is its managing director Hiren Patel, the younger son of Nirma founder Karsanbhai. Although he prefers to keep a low-profile, the 45-year-old second generation businessman leads from the front when it comes to charting growth trajectories for the group.The ECL acquisition is the second major clincher for Nirma under Patel’s leadership. In July 2016, Nirma had acquired LafargeHolcim’s India assets with 11 million tonnes per annum capacity for Rs 9,400 crore. Nirma then trounced biggies such as Ajay Piramal Group, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Cement as well as Mexico's Cemex and China's Anhui Conch Cement Company to bag LafargeHolcim’s India cement business.Patel helmed the entire transaction starting from identifying the opportunity to negotiating the deal with Lafarge’s top management. Lafarge’s India business was later renamed as Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Ltd, which is one of the top building materials company in the country. Patel is the chairman of Nuvoco.This time again, Nirma pipped strong contenders like Ultratech, Ambuja Cements and Germany’s HeidelbergCement to clinch the ECL.After completing his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering and MBA with specialization in finance and marketing from USA, Patel joined Nirma in 1998 as director and took over as its managing director in 2006, states Nuvoco’s website.Ever since the group made its first acquisition in 2005, Patel has led all the inorganic growth opportunities for the group. He has spearheaded the growth of the privately held group from being primarily in the consumer goods business to becoming a diversified conglomerate encompassing chemicals, cement, real estate and healthcare. At Nuvoco, he plays the role of mentor to the executive management.An active philanthropist, Patel is also a member of the managing committee of Nirma Education & Research Foundation, which runs the Nirma University with over 8,000 students across various disciplines, and Nirma Vidyavihar (K-12 schools).",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nirma-charts-inorganic-growth-story-cements-its-position-among-the-top-in-india/articleshow/74155501.cms

Representative image

BENGALURU: A 31-year-old woman died due to Rabies at a private hospital in Bengaluru on Saturday. A resident of Cox Town in east Bengaluru, she was bitten by a stray dog four months ago but was brought to the hospital only on February 12.

While doctors at Vikram Hospital confirmed the cause of her death, STOI could not immediately ascertain why she was brought to the hospital after so many months.

Doctors said her reports came positive from the Nimhans virology lab on Friday and that she succumbed around 10.30am on Saturday, adding that BBMP authorities were informed immediately.

“She was rushed to the hospital at around 3.30am on Wednesday with symptoms of breathlessness and disorientation. The family said she had suffered from psychiatric illness. But we noticed excess salivation. She refused to drink fluids and was afraid of drinking water, a clear sign of hydrophobia and a tell-tale sign of Rabies,” Dr Vijay Kumar Annayya Reddy, consultant, critical care medicine, said.

Doctors said her case was a bit misleading in the beginning, as she suffered from depression. They said she felt uncomfortable when the fan was switched on, which is aerophobia, another symptom of Rabies.

Although MRI and cerebrospinal fluid tests are the most confirmatory tests to be done in suspected Rabies cases, in this case, doctors could not do them as the patient was not in a condition to support this.

She suffered a cardiac attack after her admission and on resuscitation her condition only worsened.

While the family recalled that she had a dog bite four months ago when she brought home a puppy from the streets, they didn’t think it could lead to Rabies.

“They read on the internet and later understood the severity of the case. The victim’s 29-year-old younger brother was also bitten or scratched by the dog four months ago. We suggested that he be given anti-Rabies vaccination (ARV),” doctors said.

The 20 hospital staff, including housekeeping personnel, nurses and doctors who had treated or taken care of the woman have been given ARV. “While five doses of ARV have to be taken, so far two doses have been given to all the 20 members,” hospital authorities said.

Lamenting the lack of awareness among public about ARV, Dr Vijay said, “Had the patient taken ARV soon after the dog bite, she would not have died.”

Second Rabies death in BBMP limits this year

As per the data with the state health department, this was the fifth Rabies death in Bengaluru in 2020 — two involving dog bites within the BBMP limits, and three of patients who were treated in Bengaluru hospitals but were bitten by dogs elsewhere. A 40-year-old man from Hanumanth Nagar died due to Rabies Epidemic Disease hospital (isolation hospital) on Old Madras Road in mid-January, said Dr Ansar Ahmed, medical superintendent.

363,['16/02/2020'],Experts voice concern as Telangana HC gets new coat of paint,"This story is from February 16, 2020

HYDERABAD: The Telangana High Court is getting a fresh coat of paint, and its domes, which could be seen from a distance, appear even more prominent now. The light hue has been darkened, drawing flak from activists who are asking if heritage norms are being followed.

A maintenance incharge at the high court said the work was being done as part of centenary celebrations. “Routine work is being carried out wherever the paint has peeled off. Since there are no repairs being undertaken, we are not consulting with conservation architects,” he said. He added that an internal panel had given the go-ahead for the work.

Heritage experts are skeptical of the work. Referring to Regulation 13, a stipulation of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), Sajjad Shahid, historian and heritage activist, said, “There is a provision for a Heritage Conservation Committee which decides all matters regarding the conservation of structures. Any decision must be taken in consultation with the committee, which is not being done as it has been defunct for years.” Shahid said the committee must be reconstituted immediately.

Anuradha Reddy, convenor, INTACH, Hyderabad, said, “The domes have their own natural beauty, strength and colour, which must be retained. Paint reduces the breathability of the structure.” She added that the quality and content of the paint also matters, as it can affect the original material. “Besides this, paint can also be tough to take off once applied.”

Speaking about the need for a comprehensive management plan, she said, “The structure has already suffered unsuitable interventions over the decades. The high court, which has given several heritage-friendly judgements must consider bringing a conservation architect on board with the requisite expertise, experience and a proven track-record.” Conservation architect SP Anchuri said, “Any work must be done after preparation of the base structure. When there is paint, cracks might go unnoticed. Authorities must ensure that previous layers of paint are removed and build-ups and cracks are filled appropriately.”

364,['16/02/2020'],HC quashes Jayalalithaa-era defamation case against TOI,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Chennai: Terming it a direct invasion and attack on media freedom, the Madras high court has quashed criminal defamation proceedings initiated by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa against TOI and a Tamil daily in 2014.

“Derailing the print media from publishing content, which in no way could be termed defamatory, by initiating prosecution, is nothing but an attack on the rights enshrined under the Constitution,” said Justice M Dhandapani.

He was quashing the government orders authorising the Chennai city prosecutor to initiate criminal defamation proceedings on behalf of the then chief minister.

The case relates to reports on BJP leader Subramanian Swamy’s statement accusing Jayalalithaa of trying to usurp credit for release of some Indian fishermen from the custody of Sri Lankan authorities.

TOI and Dinamalar moved the high court to quash the proceedings.

Allowing the pleas, Justice Dhandapani said: “The action of the state in initiating prosecution against the petitioners for their act of carrying the interview of Dr Subramanian Swamy to print is a direct invasion into the right of freedom of speech and expression, which cannot be curtailed by the invocation of Section 499 of IPC.”

“The freedom of press to bring to the people the happenings in and around them forthwith is the fulcrum of a democratic functioning of the state. Clogging the said system by curtailing the right and freedom is nothing but a direct invasion on the freedom of speech and expression, which is enshrined in Article 19 (1) of the Constitution,” he said.

“While it was the duty of the court to safeguard interests of those persons holding public office from being defamed for discharging their public functions, equally, the citizens should also be safeguarded from the governmental machinery against malicious prosecution,” said Justice Dhandapani.

Pointing out that the reports appeared on September 4, 2014, whereas the defamation proceedings were initiated within 24 hours thereafter, Justice Dhandapani said: “The sanction for prosecution, according to the Court, has been granted at such a pace, i.e., in a span of 24 hours, in which haste cannot be definitely ruled out. Haste could also be concomitant to non-application of mind. Application of mind in the grant of sanction is the foremost necessity.”

The judge also had a word caution for the media. While holding that the media had not traversed beyond its limitation in the present case, Justice Dhandapani said: “The media has also to satisfy itself as to the details, which are to be carried in print, as the faith reposed by the citizens on the media should be the foremost consideration for a better democratic functioning, lest the same will not only have a detrimental effect on the common man, but on the functioning of the governmental machinery as a whole.”

365,['16/02/2020'],Desai asks Sena functionaries to step up,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Kolhapur: Shiv Sena functionary and minister of state Shamburaj Desai on Saturday asked the party’s local functionaries to initiate the programmes and events to gain the lost ground in legislative assembly election.

The Sena lost four seats in the assembly elections last year which it had won in 2014 elections. Sena won both the Loksabha seats in the district, however in the assembly election held immediately after, the party just won one seat in the district.

The local functionaries claimed that several factors were responsible for the defeat. They met Desai at Government Circuit House and discussed in length the programmes to be organised to gain the lost ground. “Many local leaders have several hopes from the government. I have asked to start the work from now onwards to win back the assembly seats. The local leaders should have proper coordination. I have assured them that I will act as the communicator between party workers and functionaries. They have assured to take the government programmes to the citizens and help the needy people,” said Desai.

Some of them raised concerns about several local issues. Desai assured them that all the issues will be resolved through proper channels. The lack of co-ordination among the local leaders were one of the major reasons for Sena’s debacle in assembly elections. For the functionaries from the city, Desai said that they have to work on their strengths to get corporators elected back in coming Kolhapur Municipal Corporation election.

Desai also held meetings with the district authorities to urge them to use the Rs 60 crore allotted grant for the development work. He said that officers should spend every single rupee before the end of the financial year. “The government will hold the district authorities responsible if the funds allocated remains unutilised and goes back to the state government,” said Desai.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan have barely been on talking terms, with even the Kartarpur corridor not free of barbs, but the countries held five meetings unmarred by differences in the past few months to deal with a common enemy - the deadly desert locust .This liaison will continue as there is a forecast of bigger invasion of “greater magnitude” from June this year onward than witnessed in 2019 when farmers of certain districts in Rajasthan and Gujarat faced damage to their standing crops.“It is also predicted that, invasion could occur in scheduled desert area (2 lakh sq km) of India in June 2020 with advent of Monsoon by spring-bred swarms from southeast Iran, southwest Pakistan and the Horn of Africa that may be of a greater magnitude than last year,” said an agriculture ministry’s note on locust attack.The short-horned grasshopper targetted both India and Pakistan, attacking the standing winter (Rabi) crop before being finally controlled by January. Five meetings between the two countries were held at Munabao in India and Khokhropar in Pakistan during June-December last year to exchange information on tackling the menace.Though Pakistan had to declare a ‘national emergency’ due to the locusts, India could minimise the damage by successfully checking breeding and forward movement. India’s effort recieved a compliment from UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) which keeps a constant eye on locust situation and issues forecast.Asked about India’s preparedness in view of the likelihood of a bigger invasion in June, minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary told TOI on Saturday that the Centre would procure 60 specialised sprayers (equipped with latest technology), use helicopters and additional drones for aerial spraying of pesticides.“We are fully prepared to control such situation in future. We have been in touch with home, civil aviation and defence ministries to enhance our aerial capabilities to deal with locust attack,” said Choudhary, MP from Barmer, one of the eight districts of Rajasthan vulnerable to locusts.The junior minister claimed “had India not controlled spread of locus effectively, it would have even reached Bangladesh” - as had happened in 1950 when then eastern Pakistan faced a massive attack and remained under locust influence for next 14 consecutive years.“There were five meetings held between India and Pakistani officials over the locust attack issue. We did not let it spread beyond five districts in India and FAO appreciated our efforts,” said the minister. He added FAO said India’s efforts could be showcased in African countries which are more prone to such attacks.FAO’s senior locust forecasting officer Keith Cressman , who visited India on January 16-17, noted India’s successful efforts in containing the outbreak. “Clearly if this had not been the case, tremendous crop damage would have occurred in Rajasthan that would have had significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in western India and beyond. There would have been a massive invasion of Pakistan and India by swarms originating in Rajasthan,” said Cressman in his report.India, which last faced such a situation in 1993, has more than 2 lakh sq km of vulnerable area (four times the size of Punjab) covering eight districts of Rajasthan and two of Gujarat. Globally, 30 countries (mostly African and west Asian) covering 16 million sq km are vulnerable to desert locust attack.Locusts inflict damage by devouring leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, bark and growing plants, and also by breaking trees because of their weight when they settle down in masses. An adult desert locust can consume roughly its own weight in fresh food per day.“One sq km size swarm contains about 40 million locusts, which eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people, 20 camels or 6 elephants,” said the ministry’s note.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74155829,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-219132,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-pakistan-may-face-bigger-locust-attack-this-year-both-to-continue-liaison-to-beat-common-enemy/articleshow/74155828.cms

KOLKATA: Offering a helping hand to youngsters appearing for their board exams , police commissioner Anuj Sharma announced that his force would attend to every complaint that examinees lodge against loud music or use of loudspeakers.

The commissioner took to social media to say Lalbazar would directly deal with the complaints. “Wish the students all the best for their exams. In case of any disturbance to your studies due to loud music, miking etc or any other issue #Dial100 or call/Whatsapp message to the following numbers,” Sharma tweeted, tagging CM Mamata Banerjee. The numbers are 9432610443, 9432610446, 9874903465 and 9432624365. Fines and even arrests might follow severe violations, cops said.

Officers said this would help in two ways: cops can keep tabs on violation of the ban on loudspeakers and secondly, it would ensure that the police headquarters were aware whether the local cops at all took any steps to address the complaints.

Several officers TOI spoke to said thanks to the top cop’s message, junior officers would also take such calls seriously. Police have also decided to identify around 12 stretches, which house a mix of schools and hospitals, like College Street and Park Street, where they will disallow honking and put a ban on loudspeakers during exam hours. Cops will ensure smooth flow of traffic so that motorists don’t need to honk.

Panaji: Hoteliers heaved a sigh of relief on Saturday after the state government clarified that the imposition of section 144 was part of general preparedness and there was no need to panic.

Some hotels received queries from agents and others whether travel plans need to be changed, but they were told there was no need to alter their Goa plans, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Savio Messias told TOI on Saturday evening after he spoke to some TTAG members.

“I could say that things are under control. There were calls in the first half with people wanting to cancel their bookings. But they are told that they need not do so following assurances by government officials,” he said.

The statement issued by district collector R Menaka was circulated among TTAG members so that they can inform their operators and agents about the ground reality, Messias said.

Members of the trade body could not meet chief minister Pramod Sawant as he was occupied with the visit of Portugual President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, on Saturday.

Messias said they would try and meet Sawant next week to ensure that such confusion doesn’t reoccur.

370,['16/02/2020'],"Delhi: Safe commute on mind, Mayur Vihar Phase-III residents seek metrolite link","This story is from February 16, 2020

Residents say autorickshaw drivers charge Rs 80-100 to go to the metro station

NEW DELHI: No matter what the time, 18-year-old Niharika Bhatt always sends her “live location” through GPS and WhatsApp to her parents or brother, who track her movements till she is safely back home in Pocket-D SFS flats, Mayur Vihar Phase-III . She takes this “safety step” because the closest metro station is 5-6 kilometres away. Residents of the area said that the stretch between the colony and the metro station is not safe, particularly for women.

“The nearest stations are Mayur Vihar Phase-I and Noida Sector 15 and it takes 30 minutes to reach them. The roads leading to the metro stations are unsafe, that’s why my family tracks my live location or keeps calling to ensure my safety,” Bhatt said.

Yukta Pandey, Bhatt’s neighbour, said, “Autorickshaw drivers charge Rs 80-100 to go to the metro station, depending on their whim. There is no other means of transport, unless a family member drops you by car or two-wheeler.” Poonam Mehan (45), a homemaker, whose daughter works in Gurgaon, said she spends Rs 200 to commute between New Ashok Nagar or Mayur Vihar Extension metro stations and her house every day.

Madhusudan Rai (55), a businessman, said he picks and drops his daughter, Jyoti, who studies in Dwarka, from the nearest metro station no matter how busy his schedule is. “The areas around Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake metro station are not safe even for men as mugging is not uncommon in the area,” he added.

Mayur Vihar Phase-III, which came up in the 1990s, is surrounded by six Blue Line and one Pink Line metro stations, but all of them are 5-6 kilometres away. In the absence of an affordable and safe mode of last-mile connectivity, residents are completely dependent on personal vehicles.

The residents of the area have been demanding better metro connectivity for years, but to no avail. Vinod Nair, convener of United Forum of Residents from Mayur Vihar Phase-III, Vasundhara Enclave and Noida, said, “If the Magenta Line is extended from Botanical Garden to Anand Vihar, which is an interchange for Blue and Pink lines, it will benefit more than five lakh residents of not only Mayur Vihar Phase-III, but also Vasundhara Enclave and Khoda.”

“It will be a boon for residents if a Metrolite corridor comes to the area. There were plans to start a monorail service many years ago and feasibility studies for light rail were also carried out in 2014. It doesn’t matter which political party is in power, no one has been able to bring metro connectivity to Mayur Vihar Phase-III,” Nair said.

In January, responding to the pleas of the forum to either extend Magenta Line or plan Metrolite, DMRC had replied that the suggested corridors fall mostly in Uttar Pradesh and the residents could take up the proposal with the Uttar Pradesh government.

The residents’ forum has planned a peaceful rally on February 16 from Pocket B-6 in Mayur Vihar Phase-III to Ramlila Ground in Vasundhara Enclave to protest against the apathy of the government and demand a metro station, extension of Barapullah till Ghazipur and better roads. “We expect over 3,000 residents to take part in the rally,” Nair said.

HYDERABAD: A former Andhra Pradesh Ranji player, who conned a CMD of a private company by impersonatingthe personal assistant (PA) of MAUD minister KT Rama Rao, was arrested by Central Crime Station sleuths on Saturday.

Joint Commissioner of Police (CCS) Avinash Mohanty said that the accused, Budumuru Nagaraju, introduced himself as Tirupati, a PA to KTR, when he contacted the CMD of a company.

The accused requested the victim sponsor one Budumuru Nagaraju, a cricket player from Andhra Pradesh and claimed that he had been selected for the U-25 World Cup in England besides being selected for a franchise in IPL.

The accused connned the victim by making him believe that if his company sponsored Nagaraju, their company’s logo will be printed on the kit used by the player and it will be handed over to Nagaraju by KTR himself.

Believing it to be true, the victim transferred Rs 3.30 lakh to the bank account of the accused.

Later, the victim realised that he had been conned as there was no response from the accused and lodged a complaint.

The accused was arrested based on his phone records and bank account details.

During the investigation, police discovered that he is a repeat offender and has been arrested previously for conning different victims.

Last year, Nagaraju was accused of impersonating BCCI chief selector, MSK Prasad and had been arrested by Andhra Pradesh police.

JIND: Even as many in India are vociferously declaring ‘Hum Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge’, some enterprising man in Jind has gone to town with his offer: birth certificates for Rs 2,500. The posters that are found all over Jind have created quite a buzz here and security agencies have lodged a complaint with the police regarding the same. Following this, Jind police have booked an unknown miscreant for cheating.

Station house officer of Jind city police station Surender Singh said, “The accused obviously is seeking to cash in on the panic over National Register of Citizenship. We are investigating the matter. No arrests so far.”

“Deputy civil surgeon, Jind hospital, Pale Ram Kataria, said the matter had come to the notice of health department as well. “I even called the number given in the poster and was told that I should go to Delhi to get the certificate. This is illegal. According to rule, one can get birth certificates free of cost within 21 days of birth. Between 21 and 28 days, registrars, such as primary health doctors, can issue the certificate. District registrar (civil surgeon) is authorised to issue for a year and after that deputy commissioner is the final authority who can issue birth certificates after a through investigation by revenue officers. This will cost Rs 50,” he added.

The legally issued birth certificates will need nine to 10 documents, including ration card, school record and hospital record of birth, deputy civil surgeon said.

Jaipur: Protest against the changing of the shape of iconic Chhoti Chaupar is showing results as its work has been put on hold. Further, authorities have decided not to interfere with the shape of Badi Chaupar, which is now being constructed in its original square shape.

The historical Chaupars of the Walled City were originally in square shape, but with the work of Metro , authorities constructed the outer portion of the Chhoti Chaupar in round shape. This was considered to be tampering with the heritage structure of the city and activists including the Walled City residents protested against it. Department has now decided to put the work on hold and is constructing Badi Chaupar in square shape.

An official of Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation on condition of anonymity said, “The original shape of Chhoti Chaupar is still square, it is just the outer boundary which was constructed in a round shape for traffic purpose. We had taken recommendations from traffic police as well before constructing it. However, public is sentimental regarding the issue so we have decided to put it on hold and have sent it to the heritage committee for inspection. Any change in the shape of Chhoti Chaupar will be done after the decision of the technical committee. Meanwhile, Badi Chaupar is being constructed in a square shape. But we can assume that the square shape will be a traffic hurdle for the commuters in such a busy market area.”

The Walled City was listed as a UNESCO heritage site in 2019 with the commitment to preserve its cultural and architectural heritage. Any change in the shape of any of its structures from a square to a circle in the presence of Heritage Technical Committee questions the seriousness of the state in sticking to its commitments.

375,['16/02/2020'],New mechanism for bldg permissions from Apr 2,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Hyderabad: In a month-and-a-half from now, Telangana will have a new mechanism to clear buildings and the way they are built. In a far-reaching move, the state government is planning to do away with permission for construction of buildings up to 75 square yards. Registration and ownership documents will be enough if one wants to construct a house in 75 sq yards.

Known as Telangana State Building Permission Approval And Self-Certification System ( TS-BPASS ), which will be rolled out on April 2, the government, under the new system, is also going to grant permissions to non-highrise structures (in about 600 sq yards). Online submission with relevant documents will be more than enough.

In case of more than 600 sq yards, the applicant will receive the permission through the single-window system. The town planning authorities will have to clear it within 21 days, failing which the plan is deemed to have been approved. Apart from penal action against officials, the government will have powers to dismiss staffers, under TS-BPASS, if they resort to corrupt means.

Also, under the new system, if any applicant or a building owner is found to have deviated from the plan, the structure will be demolished without any notice.

Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said TS-BPASS is being unveiled, on the lines of TSiPASS, to ensure a hassle-free building permission process for people. He asked officials to create an awareness on TS-BPASS among people by conducting sessions with residential welfare associations and ward committees.

“The government is working towards offering better services to the people. Decentralisation and formation of new districts, mandals and municipalities was one of the biggest achievements of the government after Telangana was formed,” KTR said while addressing district collectors and additional collectors. An orientation programme was conducted with the collectors and additional collectors on the proposed Municipal Act and Pattana Pragathi at MCRHRD Institute here on Friday.

KTR said he did not expect that Sircilla would become a district headquarters. “I can proudly say that no other state has brought in so many administrative reforms in the country in such a short span.” An effective implementation of the new Municipal Act would transform cities and towns in Telangana, he said.

The minister said that there would be challenges in the implementation of the Municipal Act initially. He said Pattana Pragathi would be launched soon on the lines of Palle Pragathi. “The best practices from some of the urban local bodies can be emulated and implemented across the state. Telangana’s towns should set a benchmark for the rest of the country,” KTR said.

Jaipur: A case has been registered against a man for tying a bull behind a tractor and dragging it for nearly 5 km in Bassi police station area on Friday.

While the accused fled the spot initially, police detained others who were present at the time of incident. By late evening the accused was also arrested from his village in Bassi. The cattle was taken to Hingoniya cow shelter where it is undergoing treatment. The video of the incident was also circulated on social media.

The accused was identified as Shola Ram who is said to be in his late 20s. The video showed that one leg of the bull was tied to the back of the tractor and it was lying on the ground while the accused drove the vehicle.

Bassi SHO Shiv Kumar Bhardwaj said, “A person registered a case against the accused and showed us the video. It does not appear that the accused was suffering from any mental issues and did this cruel act in a fit of anger as he thought that the bull was destroying the crop in his field.”

Following the incident, the bull was taken to the shelter by a few animal lovers where it was treated. The animal was injected glucose after which it managed to stand up, though officials said that it was still in critical state and there are chances that it would not survive.

“The accused absconded from the spot as soon the case was registered but there were a few others whom we called to the police station. We questioned them and got the accused’s location following which our team went and arrested him. Even if the animal was destroying the crops, this was not the way to deal with the situation. The incident is extremely brutal and we worked swiftly to catch the accused,” added the official. A case under animal cruelty act has been registered.

Panaji: The directorate of education (DoE) has instructed schools that for the upcoming 2020-21 academic year, the first term exam must end by October 10. This is in view of the 36th National Games the state will be hosting later this year, from October 20 to November 4. Schools have also been told not to schedule any internal examinations between January 1, 2021 and March 15, 2021, due to the Census 2021 exercise.

“As per directives of the ministry of home affairs, New Delhi, it is instructed not to have any school examination during the period of training and field operation of Census 2021, January 1 to March 15. This instruction is to be followed without fail,” schools have been told in a circular.

While declaring the academic schedule for the upcoming year, director of education Vandana Rao has inserted another new requirement for schools to meet.

“All heads of schools are to celebrate the occasions that are informed to them by directorate. All programs of the Government of India will continue to remain binding till the duration of the same. If any new event is to be incorporated in the schedule for the coming year, the same will be informed to the school from time to time,” Rao has said in the circular.

During the current academic year, teachers and even political parties have criticised the DoE, particularly Rao, for constantly issuing circulars, stating that Union government circulars are imposed on schools blindly.

Rao further came into conflict with teachers when she issued a show-cause notice to schools when institution heads failed to turn up for a meeting called for by the director to discuss implementation of various government of India programmes such as Fit India, Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat, 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary etc.

Schools said the circular was issued at too short a notice.

Hyderabad: Even as the dust on the central funds to Telangana is yet to settle down with industry minister KT Rama Rao picking holes in Union finance minister Niramala Sitharaman’s claims, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are embroiled in a tussle over funds released to local bodies to the tune of Rs 3,139 crore.

The dispute arose between the Telugu states after the Centre gave one instalment of funds to the successor state of AP in 2014. Though the dispute did not spiral out of control, Telangana has kept the pot boiling in the last six years in every meeting officials of both the states sat to iron out differences.

The instalment pertained to the second quarter of June. Till then, the undivided AP got the fund devolution as recommended by the 13th Finance Commission. Telangana said it was supposed to get Rs 3,139 crore. “Telangana’s contention is that the second instalment after the state was carved in 2014-15 had gone to AP. So, it argues that it needs to get 42% of the amount as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014,” highly-placed sources told TOI.

AP, on the other hand, has been dodging the issue on the grounds that there are other contentious issues which need to be resolved first. Reportedly, Telangana paid some bills of purchased power from AP as it did not get its due share in the local bodies’ funds.

While funds issue remained unresolved when TDP government was at the helm, present AP chief secretary is believed to have asked finance officials to work out reconciliation formula with their counterparts in Telangana.

Telangana is also demanding release of Rs 1,428 crore to local bodies as recommended by the 14th Finance Commission for 2015-20.

KOLKATA: Mayor Firhad Hakim on Saturday ordered to prepare a list of city’s parks that had remained out of bounds to citizens and assess the reasons behind keeping them shut so that measures could be taken to reopen them.

Hakim issued the instruction after he received a call from a senior citizen, who complained the Kalighat park had been shut for over two months. The caller, on the Talk-to-Mayor session, requested Hakim to look into the reasons for the “forced closure” and arrange for its reopening as soon as possible. The mayor told Debasish Chakraborty, director-general of the KMC parks department, to probe into the matter and take corrective measures at the earliest. The civic parks department looks after over 700 large and small parks located across 144 KMC wards.

According to a KMC parks official, this is not the first time that a complaint against closure of the Kalighat park had reached the civic headquarters. “Despite protests from residents, we had to take a sizeable area of the park for a water booster pumping station. It is really unfortunate that the rest of the park has been made out of bounds to residents, especially senior citizens,” he said.

KMC officials pointed out several other parks in the city had also been shut to locals. “We often receive complaints about park gates being locked for weeks together. We send our men and in most cases, the complaints turns out to be true,” said an official. A couple of months ago, civic commissioner Khalil Ahmed had told borough executive engineers to look after the health of the parks, borough-wise.

Areas, where the KMC needed to survey closed parks were Dum Dum, Chitpore, Arabindo Sarani, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Behala, Kidderpore, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and areas off Bypass, a civic official said.

Hyderabad: The city witnessed poor air quality on Friday with the index used to measure pollutants registering above normal records. The Air Quality Index , measured by the Central Pollution Control Board, put the city’s value at 145.

A good range lies between 0-60. The 145 figure falls into the ‘moderate’ category wherein there could be breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.

A similar measurement done by US Consulate’s air monitoring system showed a reading of 155 at 8.30pm. It indicated a peak of 272 earlier in the day. This falls in the ‘unhealthy’ category described as levels at which “everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.”

A source in Telangana State PCB said, “With cold weather conditions, pollution levels generally remain high because of inversion effect. The pollutants will not rise to upper layers of atmosphere leading to higher readings. Higher AQI levels would soon dip as temperatures soar.”

Pramod Sawant

PONDA: This year, only five dignitaries will garland the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the Farmagudi fortress during the state’s official Shiv Jayanti celebration on February 19. These are chief minister Pramod Sawant and MLAs of the four constituencies that make up Ponda taluka — Ramkrishna Dhavalikar (Marcaim), Ravi Naik (Ponda), Subhash Shirodkar (Shiroda) and Govind Gaude (Priol).

The rest of the dignitaries present at the function will offer flowers, but at the base of the statue.

This is the first time such a change is being made.

Priol MLA and art and culture minister Govind Gaude said that the change was mooted in a bid to reduce time spent on the garlanding ceremony and instead give more time for the performances put up by children.

A day-long celebration has been planned at the Farmagudi fortress to commemorate the 393rd birth anniversary of the Maratha king, Gaude said.

SALIGAO: The body of an eight-year-old boy, Sahil Salgaonkar, was found in the Chapora river below the Siolim-Chopdem bridge early Saturday morning.

Salgaonkar, a resident of Siolim , had been missing since Friday.

Anjuna police inspector Suraj Gawas said Salgaonkar was a child with special needs and had been suffering from epilepsy.

The missing complaint lodged by the boy’s father stated that Salgaonkar had gone to play with other children after returning home from school on Friday, but never returned.

Police suspect that he fell into the river while suffering an epileptic fit. They denied that it was a case of suicide.

Salgaonkar’s body was spotted in the river by locals of Bhatti-Oxel, who helped police fish it out. Gawas said the body was subsequently sent to the GMC, Bambolim, for an autopsy and that further investigation was under way.

NEW DELHI: Two children were found dead inside a drain in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri in the past two days.

Police said in both the cases, the children appeared to have drowned , but a probe was under way to rule out any foul play. The bodies have been sent for autopsy, they added.

DCP (North West) Vijayanta Arya said an investigation was underway by a team from the Jahangirpuri police station.

Police said the first incident took place on Saturday, when the locals spotted the body of an eight-year-old boy floating in the drain. The child had been missing for the past one week. Police were informed and the body was fished out and sent for a postmortem.

An officer said the child’s mother lived at a shack near the drain and had lodged a missing complaint a few days ago. A search was already being conducted in the area to locate him. Prima facie the incident appears to be a case of drowning. Police are awaiting the autopsy report to establish the exact cause of death.

The second incident was reported on Friday night when a girl of the same age was found dead in the drain on the same stretch. The girl’s mother had alerted the neighbours, who had begun the hunt for the child. They later spotted the body being stuck in the sludge and alerted the cops, who then fished the body out.

A team has been formed to probe both the cases, while the cops are also checking if the cases were related.

Of the 100 toilets visited by the agency in east Delhi, 76 were found to be unusable (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Two days after the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) came out with ‘Delhi toilet survey 2019-20’ in which huge number of toilets were reported to be unusable and dirty in the city — specially in east Delhi — the civic bodies raised objections and took up the matter with the ministry.

East Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner Dilraj Kaur claimed the survey was done in November and after that there was drastic improvement in the condition of toilets.

“We differ with the findings of the survey conducted by the agency empanelled with MoHUA in current circumstances. In January, we also got a survey done by CURE, another empanelled agency with the Centre and its results showed that 94% of the toilets were operational. On the basis of the result, we had applied for revalidating our ‘open defecation’ certificate and was granted the same after third party survey,” said Kaur.

“In these circumstances, how could we believe that our toilets were unusable or remained dirty. Despite running short of funds and resources, we have been putting best efforts to construct and maintain public conveniences,” Kaur said, adding that they had raised the matter at the right platform wherein their points were acknowledged.

As per the ministry’s survey report, of the 1,175 toilet units in the capital, 36% were found “unusable” while just 12.5% got the “excellent” tag. Of the five municipalities, EDMC scored less than 22% on factors like usable taps with no leakage, clean and polished mirrors, litter bins and availability of hand-wash soaps.

Of the 100 toilets visited by the agency in east Delhi, 76 were found to be unusable, 18 usable but dirty, five clean and one very clean. The agency had also found two toilets dirty, five unusable and 25 clean in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area.

Unsatisfied with the findings, NDMC officials had asked for details. “Though we differed with the report, we asked for the details of toilets surveyed by the agency. The idea is to know the reason and improve their condition before the final round of Swachh Survekshan to be conducted in March. Ideally these details should have been provided by now because not enough time is left,” said an NDMC official.

The civic agency said it had given directions to officials in engineering and electrical departments to visit each and every toilet complex in the area, fix the loopholes and make provision for other facilities. “We have also ensured that all toilets were located on GPS locator,” said the official.

The council has over 330 toilets. Of them, 290 were outsourced, six were maintained by Sulabh International and 37 by NDMC (mostly located in clusters or back lanes). Of them, the department claimed to have provided advance facilities at 84 toilets. These smart toilets meet the parameters of ODF++ category under Swachh Bharat Mission.

He told reporters on Saturday that although section 144 prohibits gatherings of four or more people, it will not affect tourism in any way.

Lobo said the restrictions have been imposed to prevent people from holding meetings wherein issues that polarise communities or create controversies are being raised. He was referring to meetings held to either denounce or back CAA and NRC.

“There will be no problem for tourism,” he said referring to fears that tourists may stop coming to Goa as they might not be allowed to gather at one spot or travel in groups. “The government has already made this clear to the tourism industry and the message has been spread through social media that visitors have nothing to worry about,” he said.

Panaji: Pay-parking begun in Panaji from Saturday on all the notified roads. Two- and four-wheelers will be charged a parking fee on nine stretches in the state capital.

Monthly parking passes will be given out to motorists at a discounted rate. The entire system has also been digitised. Parking attendants will check the vehicle number on the pass, scan it and issue electronically generated receipts.

“If someone has two vehicles, they must apply for a pass for both the vehicles,” said mayor Uday Madkaikar.

He said that the implementation of parking fee is not a move to harass locals, but an attempt to discourage double parking and haphazard parking. “This move will instill discipline in such parking practices. Gradually, we shall move to other streets in Panaji as well,” he said.

The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has instructed the contractor to train parking attendants to discourage double-parking, driving on footpaths, etc.

“There are hundreds of vehicles that enter the city on a daily basis. They can park their car at the multi-storey pay-parking at Patto and use other means to access the city,” he said.

He also said that the roads will be painted with ‘pay-parking’ demarcation after hotmixing. “Following the Carnival, we will start the work. We are going to hotmix nine roads by May,” he said.

Government vehicles are to be exempted from paying this fee, but CCP will make it compulsory for them after amending the notification.

“I appeal to people to cooperate and comply with the parking fee. Anyone that refuses will have to go through the course of law. This is not illegal cash collection; we are carrying this out within the framework of law,” he said.

CHENNAI: In a direct blow to the state machinery for attempting to curtail media freedom through criminal defamation complaints, the Madras high court has asserted that such attempts are a direct invasion of the right to freedom of expression and speech guaranteed under the Constitution.

Justice M Dhandapani , quashing two criminal defamation complaints registered against the Times of India and a Tamil daily, said, “While it is the duty of the court to safeguard the interests of those persons holding public office from being defamed for discharging their public functions, equally, citizens should also be safeguarded from the governmental machinery against malicious prosecution.”

The entire democratic polity achieves a high only when there is an uncompromising print/visual media which takes to the citizens of the country the happenings around them, he said. “Derailing the print media from publishing content, which in no way can be termed defamatory, by initiating prosecution, is nothing but an attack on the rights enshrined under the Constitution,” the judge added.

The criminal complaints against TOI and the Tamil daily “Dina Malar” were filed in 2014 by the AIADMK government led by the then chief minister, J Jayalalithaa , for publishing an interview of BJP member Subramanian Swamy .

Alleging that the newspapers were guilty of criminal defamation by publishing derogatory statements made by Swamy in the interview, the government lodged the complaint. Aggrieved, the newspapers moved the high court.

Allowing the pleas, the judge held that the government’s action against the petitioners for carrying the interview was a direct invasion of the right of freedom of speech and expression that cannot be curtailed by invocation of Section 499 (criminal defamation) of the IPC.

In the present case, the court said, the print media, having merely reported the interview of Swamy without adding anything to it, which is even evident from the government orders, cannot be said to have published material that has harmed the reputation of the office of the chief minister in respect of her conduct in the discharge of her public functions.

“Before parting with the case, one other important fact which has attracted the attention of this court also needs to be noted here. The government orders sanctioning prosecution against media houses were issued within a span of 24 hours of the news articles being published. This court, even at the outset, is not imputing any malice in the action of the prosecution. However, the speed with which such prosecution has been initiated is an issue which passes through the mind of this court,” Justice Dhandapani said.

“The mother dog was howling and did not even let anyone touch the pups even after they were dead,” said Arun Ganeshan, a resident of Surya Nagar colony. Photos and videos of the incident were shared on social media, triggering outrage among animal lovers.

“Some workers apparently wanted to clear the bushes in the area by burning them down. When we questioned them, they said that they did not notice the dogs,” said Lakshmi, a resident.

VIJAYAWADA: More than one lakh people have downloaded the Disha mobile application since its launch a week back. And the Disha control room has received thousands of calls from curious women testing the app.

The app, developed by Andhra Pradesh police , is part of a slew of measures initiated by the state government to step up women safety. Among these while the Disha legislation is yet to receive President’s assent to come into force, the app has not only elicited enthusiastic response but also led to people witness immediate police action against perpetrators of crimes against women.

The first case was registered after an excise official, who used the app after she was harassed by three unknown persons on a bus. After receiving the distress call, cops intercepted the bus near Eluru within ten minutes and apprehended the harassers. Police then issued a zero FIR and later transferred the case to the police station concerned.

In another incident, which was also reported at Eluru, a women used the ‘shake trigger’ feature after her brother-in-law molested her when her husband was away. The Disha control room received a video and audio footage of the victim on the app. The cops rushed to her rescue in less than six minutes and arrested her brother-in-law. Similarly, police came to the rescue of a girl, who complained about an unidentified person abusing her on phone, another girl being eve-teased regularly.

Advanced features such as shake trigger, track my travel, information about nearest safe places and police stations have struck a chord with women across the states, said director general of police (DGP) D Gautam Sawang. In fact, the app was also downloaded by people from United States of America (USA), Australia, UAE, Kuwait and other countries.

Speaking to TOI, Sawang said people from other countries are also downloading the app to take a look at its advanced features. However, the app will not work outside Andhra Pradesh as it is designed in such a way that the area is geo fenced and the SOS calls will initiate only when the mobile is within the boundaries of Andhra Pradesh, he said.

Cops are now working on improving the response time, which is 10 minutes on an average. “We have been analysing all the calls received so far and trying to reduce the response time by identifying the practical difficulties in deployment” he said.

Delhi CM-designate Arvind Kejriwal with his cabinet ministers during a dinner meeting

NEW DELHI: Determined to hit the ground after taking oath as chief minister , AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday discussed the roadmap for Delhi’s development with the six AAP MLAs who will be sworn in as cabinet ministers on Sunday.

The minister designates — Manish Sisodia, deputy CM in the previous government, and ministers Gopal Rai, Satyendar Jain, Kailash Gahlot, Rajendra Pal Gautam and Imran Hussain — joined the discussion followed by dinner at the chief minister’s residence on Saturday evening.

AAP has decided to repeat all the ministers because it believes that people voted it back to power because of the work done by the government and for continuing the work. “Hosted my Delhi cabinet-designate colleagues for dinner at my residence. Congratulated them on their victory in the election and wished them success for their term as ministers in Delhi govt,” Kejriwal tweeted.

The discussions revolved around boosting public transport, expanding the network of mohalla clinics, further improvement in education infrastructure and quality of education, cleaning of Yamuna, sanitation, fighting pollution, providing 24-hour water supply, etc.

“Kejriwal and the minister designates discussed initiatives on which action needs to be taken on priority in the next three months. The government’s focus will be on developing a roadmap for making Delhi a 21st century global city,” said AAP sources.

Priority will be given to bringing in more buses to boost the city’s public transport system. At least 1,300 electric buses, besides 3,000 CNG buses — 1,000 for DTC and 2,000 for cluster scheme — are expected to be procured in six months. A total of 1,000 cluster buses will be air-conditioned.

The previous AAP government had approved 4,300 new buses, some of which were brought in phases. Among these were 529 standard-floor buses with hydraulic lifts added to the cluster scheme fleet since August 2019.

Mohalla clinics, the basic healthcare facility for citizens, have been one of the most talked about projects of the AAP government. In the last five years, the government opened 451 mohalla clinics and seeks to open another 351 by April.

AAP has promised to reduce pollution by one-third. It will earmark funds for sanitation and other purposes so that the municipal corporations cannot divert the funds. The party believes that the pace of development will be very fast now as compared to the previous term, when a tussle with the Centre allegedly created obstructions in the functioning of Delhi government .

“Kejriwal asked all minister designates to work passionately on every point of AAP’s guarantee card immediately after taking oath,” Manish Sisodia said after the meeting. The guarantee card includes 10 points about education, health, women’s safety, etc.

A form prepared by the fact-finding committee is in two parts. The first part is for students of Gargi College or their friends who experienced sexual harassment during Reverie 2020. The second part is for students of the college to report gender bias that takes place in the college or around it.

The students had also demanded a written apology from the principal, Promila Kumar, or retraction of the statement of the principal made earlier to the media. Before the protest started on February 10, the principal had said there were no formal complaints made and the CCTV footage suggested no such case. Later, she issued a statement stating solidarity with the students.

The men broke open the door frame of the kiosk to drag out the ATM

NEW DELHI: An unguarded ATM of a private bank at southeast Delhi’s Tughlaqabad was uprooted , with the criminals fleeing with the entire machine with Rs 57 ,500 in it. Police said the men had turned off the CCTV cameras in the kiosk but were caught fleeing in an SUV in another footage from a camera installed outside.

The role of a Haryana gang that has a similar modus operandi is suspected in the crime. The role of an insider has not been ruled out since the criminals seemed to be aware of the mechanism involved in sealing the ATM to the ground.

The incident happened early on Saturday. The crime was discovered on Saturday morning by a private company responsible for replenishing the cash in the machine, who found the ATM missing.

Based on their complaint, a case has now been registered. There was no security guard at the time of the incident. The men had also disabled the alarm system and broke open the door frame of the kiosk to drag out the ATM machine.

It was stuffed into the SUV through the rear door after which the men drove off. Police suspect that they might fled towards Suraj Kund.

The forensic examination of the kiosk revealed that the men used cutters to remove the screws that hold the machine to the floor.

According to the company who filed the complaint, the ATM didn’t have a huge sum of cash, had the gang struck the next day, they would have made away with approximately Rs 15 lakhs.

Police have recorded the statement of the private company responsible for the security of the ATM. CCTV footage of the area is being scanned to ascertain the identity of the men behind the heist and the vehicle they used to escape from the spot. The cops are also probing if there were any security lapses on the part of the company or the bank. The involvement of local criminals is also being verified.

JODHPUR: In a joint operation by military intelligence and police, 54 liquor bottles were seized from a grocery shop near the defence area. The liquor had been obtained from the army canteen and was stocked up in the shop for sale at a premium. Police have arrested one person in the matter.

A police official from Mahamandir police station said that the raid was conducted after an input from the liaison unit of the Jodhpur Military Intelligence was obtained on Friday night. “The shop’s godown in Rasala area had 54 bottles of rum obtained from the army CSD canteen,” said the officer adding that the godown has also been seized following a suspicion on the quality of the grocery material stocked therein.

Police was also suspicious if the adulterated grocery items like ghee, tea and condiments were being supplied to various army units at the Jodhpur Military Station by the accused identified as Mahendra Singh. A team from the food safety department will visit the godown and will take samples of the goods stocked there.

According to the information, the accused has also been supplying condiments and other grocery items to the army for the past 20 years and has good contacts both in and ex-service men.

“Using these connections, he arranged liquor from the army canteen at a lower price and sells them in the open market in order to make quick bucks,” said the officer, adding that it would have to be investigated who all were involved in it and how long had he been selling the canteen liquor. A case under Section 19/54 of the Excise Act has been registered against the accused.

Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry on Saturday clarified there was no formal request from the protesters at Shaheen Bagh to meet home minister Amit Shah even though there were reports that a section of protesters said they were ready to meet Shah to raise their concerns over the Citizenship Amendment Act.

“So far no meeting with home minister is scheduled on Sunday as there was no formal request from anyone,” said a home ministry official. Shah recently said he was ready to hold talks with the protesters.

The protesters, largely Muslims and including a large number of women, have been staging a sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) for the past two months.

They allegedly said the protest was ""leaderless"" and it was up to the home minister to decide who all he wanted to call for talks. ""We are ready to meet the home minister. But he should make it clear how many people he wants to meet,"" Syed Ahmed Taseer, one of the organisers, said.

Mehrunnisa, who has been a regular at the protest, said the protesters would march to the home minister’s residence on Sunday.

“We would ask him to withdraw CAA-NRC-NPR,"" she said, adding that the protest would continue till their demand was met. In an interaction with Times Now earlier this week, Shah said anyone who wants to discuss issues related to CAA with him can seek time from his office. “(We) will give time within three days,” he added.

However, protesters have indicated that revocation of the CAA will be on the top of their charter of demands if they meet the home minister, which sinks possibility of a truce as Shah and other ministers have asserted that there won’t be any negotiations on the new law.

405,['16/02/2020'],"‘The heart remains matter of fact, brain adds the humour’","This story is from February 16, 2020

Since it was formed in 2015, comedy-musical show Aisi Taisi Democracy (ATD) has been making Indians everywhere laugh uneasily at themselves and the state of affairs of the country. Engineered by the trio of Rahul Ram (bass player and vocalist for Indian Ocean), Varun Grover (stand -up comedian, writer and lyricist) and Sanjay Rajoura (comedian and social satirist), the unapologetically political comedy show packs a punch and has been garnering fans everywhere. Their song, Hum Kaagaz Nahin Dikhayenge , with words penned by Grover, has become an anthem for the ongoing anti-CAA protests in the country. This Sunday, the trio is headed to Times Litfest Bengaluru to give Bengalureans a taste of their bitingly funny show. Grover took time out for an email interview with TOI. Excerpts:

From 2015 to today, there’s a lot that has happened and is happening in the country. Do you feel validated with the idea of having started ATD at the right time? What do you love most about being a part of ATD?

No time is wrong time in India for political satire and that has been the case for the last 70 years in my opinion. The thing I love the most is that there are three of us on stage and hence, there’s a 33% chance of survival if anyone shoots at us.

As observers and commentators of the country’s goings on, how do you balance between when to stay funny and when to tell it like it is during your performances?

My top priority is to stay funny always. The balance comes from the craft – the most hardhitting things also require humour to be put across. So the heart remains matter of fact and brain adds the humour.

As a team, how has the journey been in terms of understanding each other and finding a common ground? How noisy and open are your brainstorming sessions?

We constantly disagree on what to joke about and how. Whenever we write a new show, we meet and jam and discuss ideas to find the various topics as well as the flow of the show. But the real feedback comes after we hit the road and we keep refining it. There have been a couple of noisy fights – but there is strong mutual respect and that helps a lot in seeing the intentions behind the feedback.

Hum Kaagaz Nahin Dikhayenge has become sort of an anthem in the Anti-CAA protests. What were you hoping to convey when you wrote the song? And when you see it being sung in different parts of the country, do you feel overwhelmed? Does it give you impetus to write fearlessly?

I was just trying to convey that the artist is not dead yet, even though the times are depressing and the regime is unrelenting in its violence. I wrote it a couple of days after cops stormed the library of Jamia (Milia Islamia) and attacked unarmed kids. I am overwhelmed not by people singing it but just by the general resilience shown by the peaceful protesters everywhere in India, in the face of police violence.

In times of political correctness and people taking offense easily, how do you retain a sense of humour as a political satirist?

I have great faith in our country’s capacity to love, forgive, and overcome the toughest of challenges thrown at us. When we got independent in 1947, most of the Western thinkers and experts predicted this country will come apart into a hundred provinces in a maximum of twenty years. They couldn’t imagine a country with so much diversity and such a huge size could find a national consciousness. And seventy years later here we are – our size and diversity as our strengths and one of the most well-defined national consciousness in our jan-gan-man. This gives me hope and hope gives me strength to continue speaking the truth through comedy.

As a trio, Aisi Taisi Democracy has travelled around the country. What is the general reaction you get from audiences everywhere? And have there been times when your shows have been cancelled because of the political nature of your content?

The response has been magnificent all over and no shows have been canned because of politics, except one college show at NIT, Allahabad because we were talking about sex education.

How does the team handle the success of a show? And what do you do when a show doesn’t go as well as expected?

Drink, in both cases.

Finally, because you are performing at a literature festival, who are your favourite writers?

Too many to count. But a short list would be – Manto, Manohar Shyam Joshi, Arundhati Roy, Ismat Chugtai, Uday Prakash, and Stephen King.

406,['16/02/2020'],Rajasthan: Body of Jhunjhunu man stuck in Baghdad since January 28,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

KOTA: Body of a 45-year-old man from Nar Singhani village in Jhunjhunu district, who died on January 28, is since then stuck in Baghdad , where he worked, due to the complex formalities of the police and judiciary in Baghdad. The family of the deceased has been running from pillar to post to get his mortal remains but in vain.

While the state Congress general secretary Charmesh Sharma from Bundi was in communication with the Indian embassy in Baghdad to bring back eight other Indian youths from Bundi stuck in Iraq , the embassy officials informed him of the dead body of one Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat from Jhunjhunu district, kept in the mortuary of a hospital in Baghdad. Following that, Sharma submitted a memorandum in this connection to Bundi district collector, who on February 13, shot an email to personal secretary to the Prime Minister of India, requesting to initiate efforts to bring Shekhawat’s mortal remains back to his home in Rajasthan.

Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat had been working in Iraq’s capital Baghdad for last nine years and was to return home very soon due to his ill health. “I have also mailed a copy of the memorandum to the President’s office, Prime Minister’s office and the foreign ministry and have demanded high-level efforts to bring back Shekhawat’s mortal remains,” Charmesh Sharma told TOI. Depriving a body of last rites at home is a violation of international law and human rights that the Iraq government is committed to and now the government of India should immediately intervene in the matter and register protest to the ambassador of Iraq in India, Sharma said.

“We were informed of the death on the same day (on January 28) and we immediately fulfilled all the formalities to bring the body to India, including submission of the papers demanded by the concerned officials in Baghdad, depositing penalty of US $1,000 but many days have passed and yet the body has not been sent,” deceased Bhanwar Singh Shakhwat’s brother-in-law Vikram Singh told TOI on phone. Earlier, the judge of the local court in Baghdad refused to grant permission to send the body but following submission of required documents, he agreed for permission prior to submission of passport of deceased Shekhawat which was under the custody of local police, said Vikram Singh and added that when the police was contacted for the passport, they said to release the passport through court where the same judge reportedly again raised objection. “We wanted Bhanwar Singh to return earlier so that he could be given proper treatment as he had been ill, but we were suddenly informed of his demise on January 28,” he added.

“I have tweeted the complaint in this connection to concerned officials’ twitter handles and have spoken to the Indian embassy in Baghdad, but still the body has not reached here,” Singh added. The official at Indian embassy in Baghdad on phone said that they had no objection in sending the body and are ready to even bear the expenses for its transportation, but the judge at Baghdad court is raising objections at every step.

Kochi: The state government aims to achieve comprehensive development in all sectors and young professionals have a decisive role in supporting the government to achieve the goal, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. While inaugurating the Professional Students’ Summit 2020 at the Cochin University of Science and Technology ( Cusat ) on Saturday, he said that the youths will not have to go abroad in pursuit of jobs as Kerala will have plenty of opportunities in the coming years to meet the dreams of aspiring professionals.

“The investor’s meet held in Kochi recently has witnessed many major companies, the global giants which have no presence in Kerala in the past, expressing their willingness to invest in the state. The government has been taking necessary steps to promote investments. Kerala is a peaceful state with prosperity in all sectors. Besides literacy, the state is now a leader in imparting quality higher education. All these factors will persuade global companies to invest in Kerala, which in turn will increase job opportunities . We are on the path of creating a new Kerala and the support of the youngsters will be crucial,” Vijayan said.

Higher education minister K T Jaleel said the students pursuing professional courses need to put into practice the knowledge and skill they acquire but they do not get enough chances for that. “The state government is revising the educational system in such a way to address this issue with the help of Additional Skill Acquisition Programme ( Asap ). Innovative ideas of students will be promoted by the government through various programmes,” he said.

The summit was organized by the higher education department in association with Asap. Nearly 2,000 students pursuing professional courses in various institutions in the state participated in the summit.

Translational Health Science Technology Institute executive director Gagandeep Kang delivered the keynote address. Higher education secretary Usha Titus and Cusat vice-chancellor K N Madhusoodanan were among those present.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi University student , who hails from Doda region of Jammu and Kashmir , has alleged that he was denied a room at an OYO hotel near DU North Campus which he had booked for his father and sister. The student claimed that the hotel authorities told him that they do not give rooms to residents of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Despite him showing the necessary address proofs, they refused to allot the room claiming it to be a company policy.

OYO said that it will investigate the issue, and has temporarily suspended its partnership with the hotel.

The law student said that he had booked a room at the OYO-partnered hotel in Vijay Nagar on February 14. “The booking was from February 15 to 17 as my family was arriving on Saturday morning,” added the student who wished to remain anonymous.

“However, when I arrived at the hotel, the hotel management told me that they cannot provide room to people from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Despite me telling them that I am from neither of these countries and I have multiple identification documents, they denied me the room as I was from J&K. They said that they were following OYO rooms policy,”claimed the student.

The OYO customer care executive, however, told him later that there was no such policy and the hotel denied him room on its own.

Despite many attempts, the hotel was not available for a comment.

However, when the student called the hotel in the evening, a staffer claimed that they were asked by police not to give rooms to people from J&K.

Delhi Police, however, said that no such order was issued by it. An OYO spokesperson later said: “OYO Hotels and Homes is committed to bringing quality living experiences to all our guests, irrespective of their religion, race, caste and gender. Any such action that tantamounts to discrimination is a serious violation of the basic principles of OYO’s ethos of doing business.”

The spokesperson added that they have initiated an inquiry into “the asset partner’s unilateral actions which resulted in the inconvenience caused to the customer. We have temporarily suspended operations with the asset partner. We sincerely apologise for this unfortunate experience.”

NEW DELHI: A multi-layer security will be in place around central Delhi for the swearing-in ceremony of CM-designate Arvind Kejriwal at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday. More than 5,000 securitymen from different units will be deployed at the venue in the morning.

Sources said the biggest challenge for police would be controlling the huge crowd that is expected to gather there since the ceremony is open to the public. A three-layer security cordon will be put in place to prevent anyone from reaching the areas allotted for VVIPs. Parking for cars will be allowed inside and behind Civic Centre.

Police said more than 12,000 AAP supporters and volunteers, who will be attending the programme, have been issued barcoded entry passes to verify their identity. Passes have been issued for each enclosure created for visitors. Police have advised the visitors to reach the venue early to avoid problems during security check. The area around the stage will be inaccessible to outsiders.

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has ordered an audit and inspection of a school on government land in Chanakyapuri.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar took a grim view of the allegations that the private school (playschool and pre-primary) running on the land leased out by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) in 2012 was ignoring norms specified under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

“So far as the allegations regarding violation of the Right to Education Act and non-holding of inspections and audits of the school are concerned, respondents shall ensure proper implementation of the Act, and carry out inspections and audits,” the bench told NDMC and the Centre’s L&DO. It added that the government authorities must carry out necessary audits and proper verification with respect to the school. The Wonderland School operates inside the upscale gated New Moti Bagh Colony in Chanakyapuri, which houses senior bureaucrats and even judges.

The court was hearing a PIL by a former employee of the school alleging several violations of not just RTE, but also the licence deed executed with NDMC, which governed its day to day functioning and other discrepancies in payment of the licence fee.

Appearing for the petitioner, advocate M Sufiyan Siddiqui cited that several RTI replies received from NDMC revealed that there had not been any audit or inspection of the school since 2012 even though it charged lakhs in fee annually. While the plea also raised issues of alleged failure to pay proper licence fee and encroachment, the court refused to examine them saying it couldn’t give directions without “proper establishment of facts” and left it to the government to take a call.

The bench noted that in a writ petition “we cannot arrive at a final conclusion about non-payment of appropriate licence fee or about a contract entered between the respondent and the school on allotment of land or the ‘so-called encroachment’ by the school on public land — all of which have been alleged by the petitioner.”

The school, however, rebutted the claims saying after the employee’s dismissal, “all wisdom has suddenly befallen the petitioner about the school having indulged in illegal activities.”

Garbage along Lawson’s Bay beach in Visakhapatnam on Saturday

Visakhapatnam: The untreated sewage and toxic industrial effluent directly being released into the sea in Vizag city will affect marine life, the livelihood of fishermen and consequently public health, said Bolisetty Satyanarayana, national convenor of Jal Biradari. He was on a visit to the coast near Jalaripeta on Saturday where the untreated sewage is being released into the sea.

Satyanarayana said that successive governments had failed to address the issue despite it having been raised it several times in the past. Rajendra Singh, popularly known as waterman of India, had also visited these drains in December 2019 and requested the authorities to look into the issue. Later, Satyanarayana wrote a letter to chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on the issue.

“Untreated hazardous waste and toxic chemical effluents from pharma companies in Parawada and Bheemili, and most of the untreated sewage with garbage , has been flowing into the sea. The authorities, instead of addressing the issue, are hiding it to get awards for the city. This is damaging both the livelihood of the fishermen community and the health of Vizagites. This act of negligence by GVMC and Pollution Control Board amounts to infringing the constitutional right of people under Article 21 (Protection of Life and Personal Liberty),” Satyanarayana said in his letter.

Kochi: Many novels have been born out of photographs and paintings but to transform an entire novel into a set of photographs is no mean task.

D Manoj, a photographer based in Vaikom, for the past 20 years had been zooming in on Malayalam literary fiction with the sole aim of documenting real incidents and characters that might have influenced the authors. At the Krithi International Festival of Books and Authors, set to conclude on Sunday, Manoj is exhibiting around 150 photographs based on the novel ‘ Theekadal Kadanju Thirumadhuram ’ written by C Radhakrishnan.

Manoj works with still images but has the eye of a documentary filmmaker. He has documented an oracle from Kudalloor in Palakkad to portray folk incidents that influenced Ezhuthachan’s life. Another photograph is that of a martial artist performing Changambally Kalari, the traditional Kalaripayattu style performed in Mamangam festival. He also pays attention to the specific locations that are part of the novel’s historic background. As per the lore, the head of a 15-year-old boy was cut and thrown into the Mamangathara at Thirunavaya. This place has been captured by Manoj along with the beauty of its verdant setting.

Manoj says changes in climate was a major challenge while documenting the novel. He made repeated visits to some places to get good photographs in the same time frame as mentioned in the novel. In Shokanashini river, Manoj waited one whole night for the moon to be visible from the clouds and to get its reflection on the river.

His first photo-document was conceived in the year 2000 on the novel ‘Khasakkinte Ithihasam’ written by O V Vijayan. He studied the book to identify the most important events and travelled to the place to take the photographs. In 2006, he captured photographs based on the novel ‘Mayyazhipuzhayude Theerangalil’, written by M Mukundan and Punathil Kunjabdulla’s novel ‘Smarakashilakal’ in 2008.

Later, in 2009, he adapted the novel ‘Naalukettu’ by M T Vasudevan Nair. Photographs based on ‘Theekadal Kadanju Thirumadhiuram’ is his fifth project. Manoj feels that his presentation style has now found acceptance in the literary world. “I wish this book should have been my first work,” he said.

Radhakrishnan feels that it is the photographs that give people conviction that novels are rooted in reality and not just imagination. “Communication of the content becomes more reliable and forceful. It validates the narration of the writer. He has effectively captured the mood and emotional content in Ezhuthachan’s life. I wrote using alphabets, he wrote it using his camera,” said Radhakrishnan.

Kootagal’s distinctive boulders trace their origins to a story of two lovers who wanted to be united for ever.... Read More

BENGALURU: The next time you visit Ramanagara to appreciate its rocky terrain,where movies like Sholay and Shalimar were shot, take some time to drive further into the countryside. About 10 km away from the famous Ramadevara Betta – which is now a vulture sanctuary –is a hillock worth a visit: Kootagal.

As you get out of the bustling town of Ramanagara and drive towards Magadi, the sound of cars and trucks slowly subsides, replaced by the occasional puttering of a two-wheeler. The village at the bottom of Kootagal is picturesque by itself. With a vast lake in the background, the village is dotted with mango, coconut and banana orchards.

Once you negotiate the narrow lanes of the village, visitors are greeted by the chirping of birds. Driving through the serpentine road cutting through huge boulders is an experience in itself.

As you park your vehicle at the end of the concrete road atop the hill, a vast spread of rocky outcrop welcomes you. And from there you get to see two huge rocks adjacent to each other. They look like a couple about to embrace – before deciding to draw back, as if they just noticed an observer. They give the name to the village (Kootagal means ‘union of rocks’ in Kannada).

If you are game for hiking, you can reach the bottom of the two rocks from where you have a majestic view of them.

The most interesting part of this rocky region nestling in the lap of greenery and the birdsong is the legend attached to the twin rocks. Villagers say that hundreds of years ago, there was nothing at the place where the two rocks stand now. The village had a washerman (Agasa in Kannada) and his wife who were in deeply in love with each other.

In fact, everyone in the village envied the bonding the couple shared. But destiny had something else for them. The couple entered a phase of life where they had to drift apart. The couple, however, was not ready to part. Instead they decided to end their lives by jumping off from the hill top. All of a sudden, a saint appeared before them and stopped them from taking the extreme step.

The couple prayed to the saint to turn them into rocks so that they could at least stay together as rocks. Legend has it that the saint blessed them with the wish and the couple remained frozen in time as rocks. As though to celebrate the eternal love of the washerman and his wife, the place also plays host to many young couples during weekends.

Just like the rocks elsewhere in Ramanagara, the huge boulders here also have a large number of holes which once played home to vultures. Though the place is devoid of large winged scavengers, the shrub forest here hosts many tiny birds whose chirping rent the air, especially during mornings and evenings. Many birders and photographers throng the area quite often. Understanding the diversity of the flora and fauna here, the Karnataka Forest Department has declared the habitat as mini-forest and maintaining it.

Kootagal hill is also famous for the temple of Thimmappaswamy or Venkataramana, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The old temple has been renovated in the recent years, losing its old world charm to painting and concrete . Some colourful designs and patterns on the pillars of the temple built in Mysore style does look special though. There is an old Kalyani (step well) with two lion sculptures next to it . Every Saturday, the temple is thronged by villagers and other devotees – many of whom cover long distances – to pray to the deity.

Kootagal is about 60 km from Bengaluru. From Ramanagara, one has to take a right turn towards Hanubhoganahalli (7 kms) and from there further journey of 3 kms would take you to Kootagal. Private buses ply to Kootagal from Ramanagara.

Jaipur: The Centre has approved a labour budget of 30 crore persondays under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ) for the financial year 2020-21 in the state .

It also gave an assurance to approve 3 crore more persondays (labour budget) for 2019-20, making it 33 crore persondays (labour budget) for this financial year, which would be the highest since the inception of the scheme.

This would mean sanctioning an extra budget of Rs 660 crore for the last two months of this financial year, i.e. up to March 31.

The Centre had in December revised the labour budget to 30 crore persondays for the financial year 2019-20, sanctioning an additional fund of nearly Rs 1,500 crore. Initially, the labour budget for 2019-20 was 23 crore persondays.

“Of 30 crore persondays, the state has already generated 29 crore persondays for this financial year (2020-21). We will also be completing 5 lakh works this year having already completed 4.5 lakh works. If 33 crore persondays are generated, it will be highest since the inception of the scheme,” said state’s MGNREGA commissioner P C Kishan.

Visakhapatnam: With Visakhapatnam set to become the state’s executive capital and the metro rail project getting underway, residential rentals in localities along NH-16 are witnessing a steep appreciation. While the average appreciation rate for flat rents in Visakhapatnam is 8-10 per cent, in the last two months rents have increased by as much as 15-20 per cent in some localities.

“In January last year, I had taken a two-bedroom flat on rent on the Madhurwada highway for a monthly rent of Rs 9,000. This year the owner has suddenly increased the rent to Rs 15,000. After a massive search I managed to find a two-bedroom flat for Rs 12,000, but it’s about a kilometre away from the highway,” said KV Prasad, who works with a private insurance company.

As per Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) estimates, around one lakh people from other areas of AP and other states migrate to Vizag every year, primarily for work and education. Most of these families look for rental accommodation. Many have even made Vizag their permanent home and have been living here for decades.

Experts said the increase in rents has come much earlier than expected. They say they expected the increase only in November or December 2020, but flat owners in some localities in the city have already started increasing the rent anticipating a rise in demand. “In fact, to some extent you can blame the tenants for this demand. Whoever is looking to rent a house on a long-term basis is eyeing localities close to the proposed metro rail stretch. The idea is to take a house on rent early while the rents are still low and extend the contract so that the rent appreciation is low even after five-six years,” said DK Raju, a property broker.

It seems even owners have caught on to this and many are reluctant to sign fresh agreements with the present tenant. The reasoning behind this move is simple. With the old tenant, the rent can only be increased by 10%, while for a new one it can be much higher.

“I had purchased my second flat on loan and am spending Rs 10,000 per month as EMI. Till now, whatever I was getting as rent, I used that to pay the EMIs. I see no problem in hiking the rent if I can save some amount for myself after paying the EMI,” said K Pravakar, who owns a flat in Carshed area.

AHMEDABAD: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said in Ahmedbad on Saturday that the rising population of our country is a cause for concern. He was speaking on ‘India’s Role in Global Context’ after inaugurating the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s new Gujarat headquarters — Dr Hedgewar Bhavan — in Maninagar on Saturday.“Our resources are limited but our needs are unlimited. Our population is going out of control. Gandhiji used to say that the world has enough for everyone’s need but not enough for everyone’s greed,” he said.He said that despite increase in comforts and materialistic pleasures, everyone is unhappy and is staging agitations. “Be it owner or servant, a party in opposition, the common man, students, teachers, everyone is unhappy and dissatisfied,” Bhagwat said.Stressing on the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is a family), he said India never invaded any country. “India needs to be powerful in all spheres to bring the world in order once again. India has to give ‘dharma’ to the world so that knowledge spreads but humans do not become robots. We have always talked about the concept of global family but not global market,” he said.The lecture was organized by ‘Madhav Smruti Nyas’, an organization backed by the RSS.Bhagwat lamented that Indian youths are “not ready to accept the knowledge power of the country, and think that whatever good in India has come from other countries”. He urged people to make India stronger “because the world listens only to the strong”.“US and Russia are super powers. China would become a super power too. Now, what super power nations did to others? They just took control of other countries for their selfish agenda. These super powers gave it back only when they were asked to do so. Otherwise, they never gave anything to others,” said Bhagwat.The new headquarters has been built at a cost of Rs 5 crore after demolition of the previous RSS building, which was around five decades old.The new complex has two basements for parking.

Indore: Nine gram panchayats of Indore district will soon turn into Swachhscape like Indore city with district administration planning to implement cluster-wise waste management system to streamline and upgrade services. With this one-of-a-kind initiative, these ‘semi-urban’ gram panchayats will bid adieu to stinky open drainage system and haphazard garbage collection and also see plethora of sustainable Swachh initiatives.

According to zila panchayat CEO Neha Meena, a survey carried out for developing cluster-wise waste management system in Manglia revealed that these nine gram panchayats of vicinity generate around 16 tonne solid waste daily. “Some gram panchayats have resources for door-to-door garbage collection and segregation but the rest under the cluster lack arrangements to lift garbage and dispose it properly,” Meena told TOI.

She added that proposed cluster-wise waste management system — which first-of-its-kind initiative in state — also includes faecal sludge management (FSM) system to treat sewage water for reuse, especially in irrigation.

“The cluster-wise system will ensure door-to-door garbage collection from around 12,247 households and some 2,000 commercial establishments of nine gram panchayats facilitating around 65,000 population of the area,” said the CEO, adding the system will be developed on public-private-partnership (PPP) model, where gram panchayats will collect Swachhta Tax and ensure door-to-door garbage through vehicles while tenders will be invited to assign work of segregation, processing and disposal of garbage.

Administration will have no financial burden for starting cluster-wise waste management system while the firm, which will be assigned the work, will generate income by selling manure for farming and processed garbage as raw materials to different industries.

“In next part, we will install a system to recycle faecal sludge and water from it to be used for agriculture and industry purposes while rest will be used to produce biogas, biodiesel or electricity,” she said.

Currently, nine gram panchayats of Manglia cluster including Manglia, Budhibarlai, Pirkaradiya, Dakachya, Lasudiaparmar, Sullakhedi, Dhabali, Rampiplia and Kailodhala generate around 25 lakh litre of gray water (kitchen waste) daily while generation of black water (sewage) was yet to be ascertained.

NEW DELHI: A man was beaten to death after he brushed against another person at a park in Khyala. The accused had got into an argument with the deceased for brushing against his shoulder and called his friends to “teach the man a lesson.” The gang thrashed the victim with baseball bats and pelted stones on him due to which he suffered head injuries. He later succumbed to them.

The man’s brother-in-law, who tried to save him, was also injured.

The incident was reported from B-2 Block in Raghubir Nagar area on Tuesday. The deceased, Saurabh, and his brother-in-law, Tarun, had gone for a stroll to the park after dinner. While walking on the paved path, Saurabh accidentally brushed his shoulder against a person coming from the opposite direction. This led to an argument between them. Soon, the scene turned ugly and the person called a few more friends from the locality, who started pushing Saurabh and Tarun.

When they resisted, the youth attacked them with bats, metal knuckles and beer bottles. Tarun managed to escape and reach home to inform the other family members about the attack. When he returned, he found Saurabh lying on the path, bleeding profusely. The family members took both Saurabh and Tarun to a government hospital nearby where Saurabh was declared dead on arrival. A case of murder was registered with the Khyala police station.

Police suspect role of local criminals to be involved in the murder and a manhunt has been launched to nab them. Sources say that some of the attackers have been identified from the CCTV footage installed in the area.

429,['16/02/2020'],Kochi Metro completes trial run to Petta,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Metro train enters Petta station on Saturday morning as part of the trial run from Thykkodam

KOCHI: Kochi Metro , which is gearing up to start commercial operations along the Thykoodam-Petta stretch, conducted a trial run on the route on Saturday. This is the last stretch of the phase I of the project.

Senior officials from Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) attended the test run conducted in the early hours of the day. The test run started at 7.40am from Thykoodam and the train reached Petta at 8.00am. Officials inspected the functioning of the track and traction system. The return trip started at 8.20am and reached Thykoodam at 9.00am.

“The trial run was a success. In the coming days, further trial runs will be conducted. Once the trial runs are completed, the commissioner of metro rail safety (CMRS) will conduct and inspection and KMRL will proceed with commissioning of the stretch,” said KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

Trail runs are conducted to identify flaws in the system. Signalling trials will be conducted on Saturday and Sunday night for track data checking. The Metro will also conduct load test to ensure that safety standards are met.

“As it is a small stretch, the trial runs will not be conducted for a long period of time,” said a Kochi Metro official, hinting at the possibility of opening the stretch without much delay.

The opening of the Thykoodam-Petta stretch is expected to increase Metro’s ridership. According to KMRL, ridership crossed two million in December 2019 and January 2020. During the month of December 2019, ridership touched an all-time high of 21,08,108 while it was only 12,48,874 in December 2018. The trend continued in January 2020 with 20,74,430 travellers opting to commute in Metro.

KMRL has maintained that since the opening of the stretch till Thykoodam, the agency has witnessed a steady increase in ridership.

However, sources pointed out that the relaying of Sahodaran Ayyappan Road and widening of Vyttila-Petta Road has led to an increase in the use of private vehicles. Many commuters had migrated to Metro when the roads in the city were in a bad shape.

“The opening of Vyttila and Kundanoor flyovers will ensure smooth movement of traffic through the roads. So, it needs to be seen how commuters would respond to the Metro. At the same time, it can be expected that the traffic congestion in Tripunithura and the Metro construction along the Petta-Tripunithura stretch could encourage more people to opt for Metro services,” said a transport expert.

Indore: High court dismissed a public interest litigation seeking quashing of an internal correspondence between the state government and UPSC for appointment of Director General of Police.

A division bench of Justice Rohit Arya and Justice Shailendra Shukla while dismissing PIL filed by Sheran Sheikh said, “PIL seeking quashing of internal correspondence between home department, State of Madhya Pradesh and Union Public Service Commission, New Delhi at instance of petitioner is not maintainable. It is not justiciable”. The petitioner had claimed that the state government, by rejecting a panel of three names recommended by UPSC for appointment of DGP after holding it for three months, hadn’t adhered to apex court judgement in the case of Prakash Singh and others Vs. Union of India in 2006.

Additional advocate general Ravindra Singh Chabhra while opposing the maintainability of petition said, “PIL in the context of public employment, particularly in appointment of highly sensitive post of DGP with vague allegations and narrations without facts is a misuse of process of law.” Petitioner in this case shouldn’t be considered ‘person aggrieved’, said Chabhra. He told court that appointment on such high post shall be made in accordance with law and with due regard to the orders of Supreme Court. The court accepted arguments of AAG over locus of the petitioner in the case. The court observed that petition with omnibus statement, assertions in facts and circumstances, appears to be motivated. Petitioner cannot be said to be 'an aggrieved person' to maintain the petition, added court. TNN

436,['16/02/2020'],Venus Circus tragedy and the rings of fire,"This story is from February 16, 2020

There is something macabre about a circus fire – and the Venus Circus fire was among the worst of its kind

BENGALURU: Quite often, disasters are proof of our own failings, man-made transgressions of order, of throwing caution to the winds. By far, the biggest fire tragedy in Bengaluru’s memory is of the blaze on February 8, 1981, which sent the tent of Venus Circus crashing down on hundreds of people and took a toll of about 80 lives.

It was past 6.45 that evening and the afternoon show, a special one for school children, was to end soon. Trapeze artiste Basheer, after flinging himself from swings, had just descended and taken a bow. Moments later, cries of “Benki, benki!” echoed from the tops rows in the gallery. In the horrifying pell-mell that followed as the burning roof crumbled and the lights went off, adults jumped off the seats on the top, some throwing aside chairs and stamping everything in their way – planks, broken chairs, bags and footwear. Children staggering to their feet were caught in the stampede and, as reports put it, it was the pandemonium more than the fire that took the lives of the young ones. By next afternoon, the toll had crossed 70.

The circus crew was largely safe, reports said, except for Ayub, a stunt motorcyclist who performed inside the “Globe of Death”. Other than the spherical cage in which Ayub rode, most equipment and belongings were charred. The fire didn’t touch the menagerie so much, but for two horses and a hippopotamus who were injured. Alert rescuers had cut the tether that held some animals. Initial reports said: “Elephants and hippos were believed to have broken loose after being either injured or scared. Lions and tigers were found huddled in the corners of their cages.”

Outside on the busy road leading from the railway station to Rajajinagar, hundreds had gathered before the firemen could make their way in the dark. Amidst the wailing children and distraught parents, passers-by and autorickshaw drivers joined others in trying to save lives. Subramaniam, a 40-year-old teacher from Bapuji Teachers Association Middle School who had accompanied hundreds of students, rescued many. The papers also said another woman who had left the show just before the fire broke out, rushed back in to pull out three children but “fell victim herself”.

Rescue work was challenging, not only because it had to be done in the glare of the headlights of police and fire brigade vehicles, but also because of the location. The circus tent was pitched on a patch of parthenium-infested wasteland bound by an elevated railway track, a busy road, and a drain. In the eastern neighbourhood was the Gethsemane Lutheran Church. Today, this is the site of the Okalipuram eight-lane corridor.

Voluntary efforts weren’t found wanting. Camps sprung up outside the accident area and near Victoria Hospital . Charitable organisations worked overtime to collect blood and secure drugs. All India Radio too chipped in with frequent appeals for help.

As is common now, theories about the cause of fire did the rounds. Did it start in the circus kitchen? Was it because of a carelessly-thrown cigarette butt? Or was it because of the sparks from high-tension wires that ran pretty close to the tarpaulin-roofed tent? The rumour mills were abuzz too: word spread that the horses had bolted towards Majestic, a lion was prowling in the vicinity and a hippo was bounding the railway colony.

The city hadn’t suffered a tragedy of such scale in the past decades. The government – headed by R Gundu Rao -- ordered an inquiry, but members of the opposition wanted to know why the circus company was issued a licence to operate in such an unsafe place. D Devaraj Urs, Congress (U) president, sought suspension or transfer of all officials involved in the issuance of licence to the circus, to leave no room for tampering of records. Why weren’t the records with the circus company seized? And why, he asked, did a top police official inaugurate it? “I can understand a politician doing such things as inaugurating a project even before it is sanctioned because he is under pressure, but how can an official undertake the inauguration of a circus show without a licence?” Urs said. An inquiry later pointed to the high-tension wires in the circus area.

Within a week, reports noted that the circus had moved to Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu. But the questions remained: Was it a tragedy waiting to happen? Was the fire-fighting equipment adequate for a city then inhabited by 25 lakh people? Could fire hazards elsewhere be prevented, to begin with around the many “tent-cinemas”? A TOI report reminded authorities of how only two years ago, on Diwali day in 1979, a fire that broke out in a cracker shop had killed over 20 people.Indeed, there are lessons to be learnt from every accident. In our memory, the circus tragedy is a wound that still bleeds.

439,['16/02/2020'],VMRDA to spend Rs 150 crore to develop one cent layouts,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The state government has accorded administrative sanction to Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( VMRDA ) to expend Rs 150 crore towards development of one cent plot layouts for distribution to housing scheme beneficiaries.

As reported in these columns earlier, the government had entrusted the responsibility of developing around 6,100 acres to the VMRDA, land pooling for which is in progress. In return, the VMRDA will get a 15% share of the land. Around 1.5 lakh beneficiaries have been identified by district officials under ‘Pedalandariki Illu’ (housing for the poor) scheme, where the beneficiaries will get one cent land each.

VMRDA had sent proposals to the tune of Rs 1,400 crore for development of all the proposed pooled land, including farmers’ share and its own share of 15%. But it has received sanction for only Rs 150 crore for development of the one cent layouts with quarry rubbish roads for the 1.5 lakh beneficiaries. The one cent layouts will be developed in nearly 3,000 acres, officials said, while the remaining land will be earmarked for VMRDA as well as for farmers.

While the assignees will get 900 square yards land for one acre, the tenants/encroachers without any documents will get 450 or 250 square yards.

VMRDA has estimated that jungle clearance, land levelling and other basic works will cost them about Rs 2.2 lakh per acre in the one cent layouts, while the development of layouts for farmers as well as for the urban development authority will cost about Rs 52 lakh per acre.

VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said their first priority is to develop the one cent layouts for distribution to the homeless. “As per the earlier government order, we have a time of four months to hand over the developed plots to holders of land pooling ownership certificate after the pooled land is given to us,” he told TOI.

A government order released on Friday has accorded permission to the VMRDA commissioner to immediately invite tenders in view of the urgency to cope up with the time-bound flagship programme.

The government plans to launch the housing site distribution process during Ugadi.

Ahmedabad: “The city of Ahmedabad has rich heritage and the potential to become a globally known art destination,” said Kiran Nadar. An eminent art collector from New Delhi, Nadar pioneered the trend of private art museums.

She is in the city for the world championship team-selection priors organized by the Bridge Federation of India. Nadar, also a professional bridge player, often visits the city for her passion for bridge and art.

“Art is my first love and so is bridge and both keep bringing me to Ahmedabad,” said Nadar, who is regarded as the champion of art in the country. “Currently, two of my art projects are running in the city. First, Kiran Nadar Museum of Arts (KNMA) — my decade-old art museum — has lent its collection of Madan Mahatta’s photographs for an exhibition tilted ‘Delhi Modern: The Architecture of Independence’.” The show at Livavati Lalbhai Library at Cept University will be on view till February 28.

Second, Nadar said, KNMA has sponsored a solo art project by Vishal K Dar titled ‘Sites of Ruin and Gatherings’. “The project aims to creatively conserve the grandeur of architectural marvels of stepwells of the country,” she said. “The artist, who perceives stepwells as inverted towers, is researching on the structures in and around Ahmedabad.” Nadar added that new art spaces in the city have heightened awareness. She said a new set of younger art collectors are coming forward and investing in emerging artists and contemporary art. She said the trend was heartening.

“Art is not an exclusive preserve of the elite,” said Nadar, who has been tirelessly working to help people appreciate art. “For me, opening my private art museum meant sharing my passion and my possessions with the public,” she said. Nadar owns two art museums in New Delhi and her third space near Noida will open up in the next couple of years. “I never planned to open a private museum but my collection was growing and I needed more space to house and exhibit it,” she said.

Kochi: Chief secretary Tom Jose asked the district administration to speed up the works under Operation Breakthrough . He reviewed the progress of the works at a meeting convened on Saturday.

Currently, 36 works worth Rs 64.5 crore are going on as part of the first phase. The remaining 201 works will start immediately. But the respective departments should generate fund for the works to be done by them. A meeting will be held in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday to discuss about the future course of action in Operation Breakthrough.

District collector S Suhas informed the chief secretary that removing obstructions in canals is going on.

Meanwhile, a mapping of network of canals in the city will be done to identify the points of obstacles. The map will be in 2D version.

“The chief secretary told us that the state government will provide fund for undertaking rest of the works. But the fund will be channelled through different departments,” said an official.

Operation Breakthrough, which was launched last month, is scheduled to be completed by March 31. The operation, which is aimed at cleaning the canals to find a solution to the waterlogging issue, was launched after heavy rain led to waterlogging in various parts of the city on October 21 last year.

The Kochi corporation came under criticism of the high court over its inaction to clear drainage.

A committee, comprising officials from irrigation, LSGD, PCB and Kochi corporation, was formed in November to carry out the works.

Kochi: The capabilities of the city police are set to go a notch higher with the launch of a slew of projects aimed at bettering policing in the city on Saturday. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday inaugurated the Cyberdome , the cybercrime police station, and the regional forensic science laboratory, among other things on Saturday.

With the launch of the app Yodhav, one among the major projects, residents can now report to the police anonymously about drug crimes. The messages can be sent to WhatsApp number 99959-66666.

Police can receive the messages but they will not be able to access the identity of the informer. Launching the app, CM Pinarayi expressed his dismay over the rise in the use of drugs among youths and urged people to cooperate with the police and excise departments to curb the menace.

CM said the Cyberdome has the additional responsibility of creating awareness about cyber security, apart from its primary aim of protecting people from cyber criminals.

The state-of-the-art facility would assist the police in identifying and taking pre-emptive actions against cybercrimes.

BENGALURU: From struggling in the past few years, Maneesha Ramakrishnan (50) has progressed to liking her feeble, hoarse voice. Her presence at home is marked by her breathing through a tracheostomy tube (for oxygen) on her neck. “To breathe is a luxury. Now, children laugh as they hear me breathe. My voice sounds funny to them and that’s joy for me,” she says.

She is one of the survivors of the Carlton tragedy that shook Bengaluru. She was working in a private company on the seventh floor of the building. The toxic fumes she inhaled changed the course of her life. “My vocal folds and windpipe got stuck to each other. The larynx was affected equally. I lost my voice. That’s why I struggle to speak,” says Maneesha, whose smile is still infectious. “I had thought I would be given some injections or medicine and go home to see my child. But I ended up being in ICU for three months, and was in hospital for nine months, undergoing nine surgeries,” says Maneesha, whose weight was just 25 kg when she was brought home back. She underwent laser surgeries to remove the fibroids forming on her windpipe.

Sitting at her house off Hennur Bande Road on the outskirts of the city, Maneesha finds absolute peace in feeding over 25 stray dogs in her vicinity, apart from her two pets at home. “I don’t call myself a victim. I have braved it all through. I was never depressed. There was help pouring in from everywhere, even from across the globe,” she says.

Maneesha worked in an MNC after a year after the fire tragedy, but could not continue for more than 15 months. She changed her job to work with an NGO, dabbled in cooking and serving, worked as a counsellor. But she didn’t get into a full time job. “It’s self taught meditation that has brought peace,” she adds.

If all goes as per plan, then in two years from now, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams will inaugurate a replica of Lord Venkateswara temple in J&K. The temple is likely to come up close to the Vaishno Devi shrine along the Jammu-Katra highway. The J&K government will allocate a 100-acre land to TTD to construct the replica temple, a kalyana mandapam, a Vedic school and a hospital.

A special TTD delegation recently held talks with the J&K government, followed by inspections of two proposed sites for the new temple at Dhummi and Majin. Last December, the TTD trust board had resolved to construct two temples , one in Jammu and the other in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency, Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh.

It has also built the Lord’s temples in Haryana, New Delhi and Maharashtra.

At present, construction of temples by TTD is underway at Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar.

NAGPUR: Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government of being anti-reservation and anti-SC/ST, Congress on Saturday said it would do everything, including filing a review petition against the Supreme Court ’s recent verdict that states were not legally bound to grant reservation in promotions.

“The BJP government is following RSS ideology of ending reservation. The SC’s orders came in a petition by the Uttarakhand government where the saffron party is in power. The party’s government at Centre didn’t oppose the move. This is an attack on fundamentals of the Constitution,” said newly appointed Congress spokesperson Anshul Avijit , who was accompanied by party’s city spokesperson Atul Londhe .

Stressing that deprived sections of the society have fundamental right of reservations, Avijit, who’s son of former Speaker Meira Kumar, said the BJP and RSS were against it since the beginning and their leaders’ statements proved it beyond doubts.

“RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and senior leader Manmohan Vaidya had spoken about how reservation is dividing the country. Our forefathers had implemented reservation for benefits of dalits and poor and to stop their discrimination and humiliation. In 2017, over 33,208 cases of atrocities were registered which means 108 incidents per day, which is alarming,” he said.

Describing how caste-based discrimination is still rampant, Avijit, who’s grandson of former deputy PM Babu Jagjivan Ram, said they were not allowed used water in wells in rural areas. “We still need reservation to remove this discrimination. It was in 1995 that an amendment was made for reservation in promotion, as lawmakers of that time thought it was a fundamental right. However, the SC’s decision put the ball in states’ court which will be implementing it as per their whims and fancies,” he said.

Terming SC’s decision as a “conspiracy” by the BJP government, Avijit said Congress was very disappointed with the verdict and would raise voice against the government on every platform. He, however, declined to comment on the issue of some states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu breaching 50% reservation quota as set put by the apex court stating that it was sub-judice.

Londhe said the SC itself had stated that if backward class commissions of states submitted a report that particular sections of the society were backward and need reservation, the 50% quota can be breached.

CM Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar at the award function in Jalgaon

NASHIK: A day after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar termed the state government’s move to hand over the probe of the Elgar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as improper, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday asserted that there was no rift whatsoever within the tri-party Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) government.

Thackeray, who shared the dais with Pawar at an agricultural award function at Jalgaon, said: “There is no problem between the alliance partners of this government. The central focus of the MVA government is to ameliorate the plight of the farming’ fraternity in the state”.

Speaking at another function in Muktainagar in Jalgaon on Saturday, which too was attended by Pawar, Thackeray dared the BJP to bring down the MVA government in the state.

“BJP has been claiming that our government will not last. I dare BJP to bring down the government. It will be unsuccessful as our government is strong and there is perfect understanding among the three alliance partners,” he said.

At a press conference in Kolhapur on Friday, Pawar had said that it was “not at all proper” for the state government to grant its consent to hand over the probe to NIA. Though-Pawar had said that it was the CM's prerogative to take the call, on Saturday, his party leader and state home minister Anil Deshmukh said that his office has sought legal opinion to know if a special investigation team (SIT) can still be formed to look into Pune police action in the Elgar case.

The developments have already fuelled speculations that all is not well within the MVA. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said that by handing over the Elgar case to NIA, Thackeray has send a message to Pawar’s party that he will not succumb to its pressure.

On Saturday, both Thackeray and Pawar did not make a mention of the Elgar case in their speeches, which were focused on the farming-related issues. Thackeray said government is working out modalities to provide adequate water and power to the farmers.

Vijayawada: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy returned to the state on Saturday after his two-day visit to the national capital, during which he held meetings with Union home minister Amit Shah and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.

Jagan submitted a representation to Prasad on Saturday, urging him to take an early decision on the legislative council issue. The CM explained to him the background to the proposal of shifting the high court to Kurnool, and requested him to speed up the process. Citing the historic Sri Bagh pact, which was signed by senior leaders of the state in 1937, the CM said making Kurnool the judicial capital will honour the sentiments of the people of Rayalaseema. He requested Prasad to ensure that the abolition process of the legislative council is cleared before the budget session of the state assembly in March.

The chief minister also explained his government’s proposed decentralization initiative, which is aimed at developing the three regions of the state — Rayalaseema region by making Kurnool the judicial capital, north coastal Andhra by setting up the executive capital in Visakhapatnam, and coastal region with the legislative capital in Amaravati. He also reminded him the 2019 election manifesto of the BJP, which had supported decentralized development of the state, and requested Prasad to fulfil the promises.

Jagan also briefed the law minister about his meetings with the Prime Minister on Wednesday and home minister on Friday, where he represented the same issues. He told Prasad that both Modi and Shah promised him the fast-track the high court and legislative council issues. He also explained the salient features of Disha Act and its functioning in the state.

As Prasad also holds the portfolios of IT, electronics and communications, Jagan requested him to extend financial and other support to the state in IT promotion. He said that his government is holding talks with various IT companies and requested the minister to promote IT in Andhra Pradesh.

TIRUPATI: A suspect in the recent signature forgery case attempted to commit suicide after being questioned by the police at Chinnamandem in Kadapa district on Saturday. It may be recalled that Teneti Vanitha, minister for women development and child welfare, had lodged a complaint with home minister M Sucharitha and DGP Gautam Sawang two days back, alleging forgery of her official letterhead and signature by a person from Kadapa.

In her complaint, Vanitha stated that one M Reddeppa of Devalampeta village in Chinnamandem mandal of Kadapa district had submitted a forged letter to the district collector seeking 1.2 acres of government land to set up a small-scale industry. Following the complaint, Chinnamandem police registered a case against M Reddeppa who is absconding. Meanwhile, the police summoned Kiran, a close associate of Reddeppa, for questioning on Saturday.

“He pleaded not guilty and requested us to allow him to stay at his home as there was a possibility Reddeppa could get in touch with him. So we allowed him to go back but sent a police constable with him to keep watch,” the police said, adding that Kiran and Reddeppa had approached the minister together and that he was very much a part of the forgery.

After Kiran reached his home in Devalampeta village, he tried to commit suicide by consuming hair dye. However, the alert police constable immediately rushed the suspect to a nearby hospital. He is now recovering and out of danger, police said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: BJP national secretary Sunil Deodhar on Saturday made it clear that both YSRC and TDP are political rivals of BJP and there is no proposal of an alliance with either of the parties. Addressing reporters, Sunil, who is also the in-charge of BJP affairs in AP, said there was no proposal of an alliance with the YSRC “either through front door or back door”. He said he came to know that one of the ministers had commented that YSRC is ready to join the NDA government at the Centre.

“BJP already has an alliance with Jana Sena and we will jointly contest the local body polls. We will not go for any alliance, neither with YSRC nor with TDP. We are quite clear on this. We don’t want any debate, discussion or comments on this issue,” he asserted, while adding that “both YSRC and TDP are playing mind games in AP”. Sunil also accused both YSRC and TDP of indulging in corruption. “TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu committed irregularities during his tenure, now chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy is committing the same mistakes. Even though the state is reeling under revenue deficit, the YSRC government has been announcing freebies. The state will be in deep trouble due to this kind of practice. There was no corruption when NTR was the CM. It was Naidu who introduced corruption in AP,” he alleged.

He also claimed that the Centre is yet to give its consent to the three capitals proposal.

Details will also be uploaded to the Mumbai railway police website too.There were 2,514 railway accident victims, whose bodies were unclaimed, and their families were not traced in 2017-19.The initiative was introssduced earlier this month after Mumbai crime branch, after 10 months, solved the case of Aarti Rithadia (17), who went missing from Nehru Nagar on March 30, 2019, and died that day. She had met with a train accident between Tilak Nagar and Chembur stations on the Harbour line, and her father committed suicide seven months later as he could not find her.Mumbai railway police commissioner Ravindra Sengaonkar told TOI, “The app will have information about missing persons cases registered with police stations. Rithadia’s case has nothing to do with introduction of the app. A test run is being done for internal purposes. It will be accessible to the public and city police within a fortnight.”Sengaonkar said the moment railway police get information about a rail accident, the officer should upload at least five photographs of the victim to the app.“After reporting and registering the matter with railway police, the officer must send the body to the hospital for post-mortem. The officer has to collect details like identity marks and upload it to the railway server using the app. The data will be relayed to missing persons bureau, with which the app will be integrated,” he said.Sengaonkar has instructed in-charges of railway police stations to gather information on unclaimed rail accident victims’ bodies cremated in 2017-19 and try to track down their families. “We will try to add data of previous untraced rail accident victims to the app, if proper photographs are stored,” he said.Railway accident data showed 3,014 accidental deaths in 2017 and railway police have tracked down family members of 2,115. In 2018, 2,981 died in rail accidents, while 2,090 where traced; and 2,691 died in 2019, while 1,967 were traced.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74155928,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384469,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-soon-check-app-if-missing-person-dead-in-railway-mishap/articleshow/74155912.cms

A 2018 photograph of the controversial 16-acre plot in Dahisar

MUMBAI: City police commissioner suspended four policemen on Saturday and wrote to state home department, recommending action against two assistant commissioners for alleged involvement in a multi-crore land scam at Dahisar. The home department on Friday granted sanction to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to prosecute the six for allegedly forcibly evicting the developer of a 16-acre plot in 2017. State police had written twice to the home department against granting of sanction to prosecute them.

A complaint had been lodged by Jude and Dominic Romell, directors of Romell Housing LLP, alleging police high-handedness. They had purchased the plot from two private firms and Kamruddin Shaikh.

Shaikh's family owned the land since 1971, but after his death, his grandson Salim approached police in April 2017, accusing Jude of dacoity, trespass and theft. Jude, arrested and subsequently released on bail, moved Bombay high court against the grandson and police. The HC directed the police commissioner to conduct an inquiry. A probe by a joint commissioner of police gave a clean chit to the cops. The HC expressed displeasure about the probe being transferred to CBI. The HC order was challenged in Supreme Court, but the apex court did not interfere.

CBI will submit a charge-sheet against the accused under sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 182 (false information with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to injury of another person), 192 (fabricating false evidence), 196 (using evidence known to be false), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure) and 298 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment) of IPC.

Those suspended were inspector Sanjeev Tawde, assistant inspectors Anand Jadhav and Kakasaheb Shinde and sub-inspector Rekha Sayakar. ""Orders for suspension of assistant commissioners of police Prashant Mardhe and Subhash Sawant will be taken by the home department,"" said the officer. After the allegations surfaced, Mardhe was transferred to the main control room, while Sawant was posted with Force1. Tawde is with special branch, Jadhav is with VP Road police station, and Shinde and Sayakar are with the Local Arms Unit.

The home department had given sanction to prosecute the six police personnel on Friday. The sanction had been sought by CBI mid-September. Police had written to the department against giving sanction. ""The case is scheduled to come up for hearing in the HC, and the government does not want to take chances of the court pulling it up for causing a delay,"" said an official.

Malda: Two children died and two are fighting for life at a hospital in Malda after they fell unconscious while playing near their home in Kadamtali village on Friday evening. Doctors suspect the children, aged 3-7, had consumed a poisonous wild berry . Residents said they were playing in an orchard. When they did not return after sunset, their guardians found them lying unconscious amid a bamboo thicket.

Thinking an evil spirit had cast a spell, the villagers took the children to soothsayer Rafik Ojha. He reportedly advised them to take the children to a hospital. By the time they reached Malda Medical College and Hospital, Firoj Ali (7) had died. Safikul Islam (5) died shortly after admission. The two others, sisters Sabnur (5) and Kohinur Khatun (3), are critical and being treated in the isolation ward. The sisters had vomitted on Friday night, which might have saved them.

Medical college vice-principal Amit Dawn said: “The delay in bringing them to hospital proved fatal.” A team led by the block medical officer of health was sent to the village on Saturdat afternoon.

462,['16/02/2020'],Mitra: Bengal’s revenues increased 3-fold in 10 yrs,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Kolkata: State finance minister Amit Mitra has told the assembly that Bengal’s own revenues have registered a steady growth over the years. He added that the Centre’s devolution to states has grown following recommendations of the Finance Commission.

While responding to CPM MLA Sujan Chakrabarty, Mitra showed how the state’s own revenue had increased from Rs 21,500 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 65,806 crore in 2019-20 under Mamata Banerjee’s regime. The state’s revenue generation is pegged at Rs 70,807 crore, with a projected three-fold increase in the 10 years since 2010-11.

Mitra then explained why state revenue as a percentage had fallen, as pointed out by the CPM MLA. “The state tax percentage is calculated as a component of central devolution, which is always greater for all states. A small increase in central devolution nomination always surpasses the increase in individual states’ revenue generation. It is si-mple arithmetic that the percentage falls if the increase in denominator (central devolution) is more than the numerator (state tax),” he said.

Mitra told the assembly the central devolution to states had grown from 32% during the 14th Finance Commission to 42% during the 15th. The central devolution includes a portion of CGST, IGST, corporation tax, income tax, union customs and excise duties, service tax and central grants.

The greater devolution with sounded fiscal management in the state has promp-ted the Bengal government to keep a lower debt repayment liability compared to the revised estimate of 2019-20. The loan repayment for 2019-20 was Rs 56,541 crore while the budget estimate for 2020-21 keeps it at a lower Rs 51, 047 crore. The state has also subsequently reduced the borrowing target for the next fiscal.

Mitra also claimed during his reply that though the state’s total debt stock has gone up, that should not be considered in isolation. “What is important is the debt to GSDP (gross state domestic product) ratio. This has gone down substantially over the years,” he said.

The ratio was 40.65% in 2010-11 when Banerjee came to power. It fell to 34% and is projected to fall further in 2020-21 to 32.90%.

Mitra said in his reply th-at the state has mostly repaid 10-year bonds taken during the Left Front regime. “We have repaid Rs 2 lakh crore of principal and Rs 1.5 lakh crore interest of Left regime.”

KOLKATA: Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus that has taken more than 1,300 lives across the world so far, could turn endemic in India like the seasonal flu and strike again with devastating consequences, fear experts.A similar pattern has been noticed in at least two of the common coronaviruses that affect people.And, without a drug or a vaccine to counter the deadly virus , another outbreak could have a considerable impact, though there could be fewer deaths.“It is indeed one of the three major possibilities,” said K K Aggarwal, former president, Indian Medical Association (IMA). “While it could be a ‘hit-and-run’ case or a one-off outbreak, there is a high chance of the outbreak recurring. This has been observed with other strains of coronavirus. And if, indeed, the novel strain turns endemic, it will be no different from the common flu. It could turn out to have seasonal behaviour, flaring up in winter like the flu,” he added.The epidemiological definition of ‘endemic’ is ‘something that is characteristic of a particular population, environment, or region’.While early studies into novel coronavirus seem to indicate that it may burn itself out in a few months, if it turns endemic, it would come back next winter. That happened with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which hit the world in two seasonal waves.The only saving grace would be that a second attack will have a lesser impact, said Aggarwal. “It should cause fewer deaths when it recurs. In any case, the coronavirus doesn’t have a mortality rate of more than 2% to 3%, which is the same as that of any other seasonal flu. The only big difference is that our immune systems can’t fight it yet, unlike the other flus,” he explained.Irfan Akhtar, a specialist in the infection control department of the Czech Rehabilitation Hospital in Abu Dhabi, also felt that there was a possibility of the virus turning endemic. “It could be dangerous, since our immune systems are not geared to fight the virus yet. It will take time to develop an antibody. It is highly contagious, which makes it spread faster than the other strains, and leads to death. That is why we need to develop an antiviral drug soon. A vaccine, too, will eventually have to be developed,” he said.The novel coronavirus will not be any more dangerous than other coronaviruses once it can be countered with drugs, added Akhtar. “Any virus of the group eventually attacks the lungs or the kidneys. A repeat outbreak could be deadlier, since there is nothing as yet to counter the virus. That is why we need to develop a medicine for novel coronavirus, or a vaccine.”It could take two years to develop a vaccine while an anti-viral drug could be developed even sooner, said Aggarwal. “Once we have a vaccine and a drug, it will be like any other flu,” he said.It will take six months to a year for the virus to be studied and an antiviral drug to be devised, said consultant Arindam Biswas. “But the human system will eventually develop an antibody in due course. It happened at the time of SARS. We had two outbreaks — in 2003 and 2015 — but the virus has since fizzled out. It hasn’t turned endemic. I don’t think novel coronavirus will, either,” he said. But there is a persistent danger as long as the virus is active and being transmitted, he added. “The worrying aspect is that 40% of those affected are between 50-55 years of age, who are not immuno-compromised. This means the virus can affect people who are perfectly healthy. Usually, the largest number of those to be affected by viruses have immune deficiency,” he added.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74156595,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-168748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-19-outbreaks-may-turn-endemic-fear-docs/articleshow/74155728.cms
464,['16/02/2020'],West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh links CAA protests to ‘biryani &amp; funds’,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Dilip Ghosh

KOLKATA: West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh raked up yet another controversy on Saturday by taking a dig at the “uneducated, unaware, poor people” who are “paid and fed biryani with foreign funds” for continuing with protests in defiance against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Ghosh’s comment drew a scathing criticism from Trinamool Congress.

Ghosh, speaking on the role of the party in power in Bengal and other opposition parties who don’t have public support, said: “The ruling party and others have taken to the streets but they don’t have public support. Some uneducated, unaware, poor people have been lured with money and are being fed biryani with foreign funds to continue with the protests.”

Speaking at BJP’s organisational meet, Ghosh said this while narrating the falling standards of Bengal from the heyday of Ram Mohan Roy, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Syamaprasad Mookerjee.

Trinamool senior and state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said Ghosh has taken Bengal’s political narrative to a new low. “Is this how a party leader should speak? People are the best judge. But I believe that the BJP leader is deliberately targeting a particular community for narrow political ends,” Chatterjee said. Ghosh had made similar offensive comments earlier, saying that 50 lakh Muslims will be chased out of the country.

On Saturday, explaining the Shaheen Bagh-Park Circus narrative, the Bengal BJP president pointed out how they have become the must-reach destination of the opposition. “Park Circus has become a must-visit place for Brinda Karat or Chidambaram. They do not want to address others. Only some burqa-clad women with children in their laps are their sole audience,” he said.

Ghosh also didn’t spare intellectuals and students participating in the countrywide protests, from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi to Park Circus in Kolkata.

“These people are writing poems asking people not to show papers. But you have seen during the Delhi assembly polls how the protesters flashed their voter ID cards. They show papers at airport, railways stations and examination centres, but ask people not to do that. I was surprised that the person who wrote kagoj dekhabo na (won’t show papers) is the first to show his papers when he goes to claim official benefits,” he said.

The BJP state president, taking a dig at state universities, said: “Now the state universities prohibit the entry of Union ministers and the governor in the name of autonomy. They won’t do that to Rohingya. All these are part of a plan to create a constitution within the Constitution and a country within a country. It appears that someone is willing to take West Bengal out of India like Muslim League leader Jinnah took away parts of Bengal.”

465,['16/02/2020'],Amit Shah set to visit Kolkata as BJP gears up for civic elections,"This story is from February 16, 2020

Union home minister Amit Shah

KOLKATA: Union home minister Amit Shah will come to Kolkata on March 1 to set a tall target for Bengal BJP as it warms up for the coming municipal polls.

Five years ago in 2015, BJP finished the civic race as a poor fourth, lagging behind even Congress. Congress had won 187 seats, while BJP won only 81 of the total 2,094 seats. The target this time is to make BJP the second party, if not the first. BJP functionaries present at the organisational meet at ICCR on the second day on Saturday held that there has been a massive change in ground reality since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, which makes the target “achievable”.

A cursory look at the 2015 results in select municipalities shows that the situation in 2020 is different. In a host of municipalities in North 24 Parganas like Barasat, Bhatpara and Bongaon, BJP couldn’t even open its account. In the Barrackpore civic polls, the party could bag only a single seat. BJP had no representation in seven municipalities of Hooghly such as Tarakeswar, Serampore, Bhadreswar and Bansberia. The situation has also undergone change in north Bengal.

Bengal BJP has carved out a two-pronged campaign strategy for the municipal polls. It wants to make full use of CAA and earn confidence of the dormant sections otherwise invisible on the streets of Kolkata. BJP will pursue the CAA agenda as a long-term (polarisation) strategy. “The Union home minister is coming to Kolkata on March 1. He may lead a pro-CAA rally or hold a meeting in the city. BJP president JP Nadda may accompany him,” BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said. According to Basu, the rules under CAA would be in place ahead of Shah’s Kolkata visit.

BJP has appointed Mukul Roy as convener of the municipal poll committee to use his organisational experience. BJP will dovetail CAA with general development, an issue that it learnt the hard way in the Delhi assembly polls. “Pursuing the development path as we see in other places such as Bangalore, delivering a corruption-free municipality and using MPLAD funds of BJP MPs for area development are some of our campaign points,” Basu said. At the same time, BJP will campaign for central projects like Ayushman Bharat and Amrut, denied entry in the state.

Party office-bearers have set the guideline for selection of candidates. “The candidate should have a clean image, s/he should have potential to win polls,” a state BJP office-bearer said. BJP units at the grassroots have been asked to send names of candidates to the panel. The state party will directly monitor elections to corporations such as Kolkata, Bidhannagar, Howrah, Asansol and Siliguri. BJP district units will be in charge of the municipality polls.

Cold, sick and unable to move from the wet blanket she was lying on, the hapless pooch was nearly dead. But thankfully, someone who lives nearby noticed the sad plight of this dog and notified animal welfare groups. And that was how Varsha found a name, a home and nine ‘moms’. “Her image was shared on our WhatsApp group. Two of our group members, Shashank Gupta and Priyanka Nagam , immediately reached the spot around midnight and took her to a hospital. The doctor said that had we been even two hours late in getting there, she wouldn’t have survived,” recalls Pratima Sagar , one of Varsha’s moms. Though the doctors managed to provide immediate medical aid, they were not very optimistic about Varsha’s survival.“But we were not ready to give up yet. We named her Varsha since she was found in the rain. A WhatsApp group called ‘Varsha’s Moms’ was created, which included Srilu Bhopal, Mayura Ratkalkar, Radhika Om Prakash Wakharkar, Aparajita Sinha, Alka Panday, Shirali Ratkalkar, Rebecca Gupta, Surabhi Sagar and me. Everyone pitched in to provide her with medicine, proper diet and everything else she needed. and now, here she is,” says Pratima, petting Varsha, who wags her tail happily.“It was Varsha who brought us all together,” says Mayura Ratkalkar, one of Varsha’s mothers. Though she was in Czechoslovakia when Varsha was rescued, Maurya was one of first persons who reached out to help Pratima with financial support for the treatment.Today, 15 months on, Varsha — who was just skin and bone when she was found — is a well looked-after, fluffy St Bernard, who’s happy to cuddle up with her foster moms all she can. But she’s more than just a cuddly pooch. She has also unwittingly become a mascot to spread the pertinent message — ‘Don’t shop, adopt’.“When we found her, she was paralysed below the waist. There was no fur on her skin, she was like a bag of bones, and had almost every kind of illness a dog could possibly have. It was evident that she was dumped in that state by illegal breeders who had no use of her anymore as she could no longer give birth. I can’t even imagine what the breeders must have done to her for her to be in that state,” says Pratima, her voice trembling with emotion.It took months of treatment for her to start walking again. “But she is a fighter, our girl...,” beams Srilu Bhopal, another proud mom of Varsha, who has been instrumental in getting 500 stray dogs sterilised at her own expense. Today, every time Varsha’s story is shared, it goes out with a strong message to pet lovers to stop shopping for pups from breeders. It is cruel, it’s illegal and these voiceless creatures are put through untold miseries at the hands of breeders who use the dogs as puppy making machines, say Varsha’s foster moms. “the illegal breeding scene in Hyderabad is quite horrendous. Despite the law prohibiting it, we still see advertisements on sites like OLX and Facebook announcing sale of pedigree pups,” says Mayura Patil, who has been trying to fight illegal breeding in Hyderabad for years. elaborating on the plight of these animals, she says, “These dogs are not given food and water because that would mean that the breeders will have to take them out for walks to attend nature’s calls or clean up if they dirty the place. They are usually locked up in crates and left on roof tops even in extreme heat or rain. Many are tied up in rooms without ventilation for days together and don’t even see daylight.”Taking advantage of the laxity of law enforcement and attitude of authorities who turn a blind eye to animal abuse, a lot of unqualified people are getting into breeding to make a quick buck. “Trust me, 99 out of 100 breeders do not care two hoots about the laws. Worse, they have no sympathy for the animals either. Even college kids start doing this as a side business, because it is easy money. Nobody cares about the ethics of this profession, except maybe a handful,” rues Aparajita Sinha, an animal lover who fostered Varsha.Every time you succumb to the desire to own a cute ‘pedigree pup’ and go to a breeder to ‘buy’ one, you are contributing to this vicious trade and helping illegal breeders thrive. “Instead, adopt..” says Mayura. “Varsha is just one of the many, many dogs left in an abysmal state after being used and abused. Once weak, they are just left to die, without even the kindness of euthanasia,” she adds.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/from-a-hapless-victim-of-illegal-breeding-to-a-mascot-for-dont-shop-adopt-this-st-bernards-come-a-long-way/articleshow/74150874.cms

But she’s more than just a cuddly pooch. She has also unwittingly become a mascot to spread the pertinent message — ‘Don’t shop, adopt’. “When we found her, she was paralysed below the waist. There was no fur on her skin, she was like a bag of bones, and had almost every kind of illness a dog could possibly have. It was evident that she was dumped in that state by illegal breeders who had no use of her anymore as she could no longer give birth. I can’t even imagine what the breeders must have done to her for her to be in that state,” says Pratima, her voice trembling with emotion.It took months of treatment for her to start walking again. “But she is a fighter, our girl...,” beams Srilu Bhopal, another proud mom of Varsha, who has been instrumental in getting 500 stray dogs sterilised at her own expense. Today, every time Varsha’s story is shared, it goes out with a strong message to pet lovers to stop shopping for pups from breeders. It is cruel, it’s illegal and these voiceless creatures are put through untold miseries at the hands of breeders who use the dogs as puppy making machines, say Varsha’s foster moms. “the illegal breeding scene in Hyderabad is quite horrendous. Despite the law prohibiting it, we still see advertisements on sites like OLX and Facebook announcing sale of pedigree pups,” says Mayura Patil, who has been trying to fight illegal breeding in Hyderabad for years. elaborating on the plight of these animals, she says, “These dogs are not given food and water because that would mean that the breeders will have to take them out for walks to attend nature’s calls or clean up if they dirty the place. They are usually locked up in crates and left on roof tops even in extreme heat or rain. Many are tied up in rooms without ventilation for days together and don’t even see daylight.”Taking advantage of the laxity of law enforcement and attitude of authorities who turn a blind eye to animal abuse, a lot of unqualified people are getting into breeding to make a quick buck. “Trust me, 99 out of 100 breeders do not care two hoots about the laws. Worse, they have no sympathy for the animals either. Even college kids start doing this as a side business, because it is easy money. Nobody cares about the ethics of this profession, except maybe a handful,” rues Aparajita Sinha, an animal lover who fostered Varsha.Every time you succumb to the desire to own a cute ‘pedigree pup’ and go to a breeder to ‘buy’ one, you are contributing to this vicious trade and helping illegal breeders thrive. “Instead, adopt..” says Mayura. “Varsha is just one of the many, many dogs left in an abysmal state after being used and abused. Once weak, they are just left to die, without even the kindness of euthanasia,” she adds.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74150857,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-160284/74150857.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/hyderabad/from-a-hapless-victim-of-illegal-breeding-to-a-mascot-for-dont-shop-adopt-this-st-bernards-come-a-long-way/articleshow/74150857.cms

GHAZIABAD: A 15-year-old girl allegedly strangled her mother to death, a head constable with Delhi Police ’s PCR cell, in their house in Ghaziabad’s Brij Vihar colony last Friday. The teenager was detained for questioning on Saturday after her father, who was away in Bihar, lodged a complaint against her.Police believe the teenager and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Jitendra, attacked the woman (44) together, throttling her with a rope till she choked to death. Jitendra has been arrested. The duo had tried to make it look like suicide; both left the house after the murder and the girl returned after a while, feigning shock at the discovery of her mother’s body and raising an alarm for help. Neighbours helped take her mother to GTB Hospital in Delhi, where doctors declared her brought dead.The chain of events that led to the alleged murder began in the morning on Friday when the head constable found her daughter talking stealthily to someone over the phone, police said. On being questioned, the teenager told her mother she was talking to her boyfriend and he had gifted the phone to her a few days ago. This led to a heated exchange and snowballed. Jitendra came to the house and they attacked the woman together, police said, based on what they have learnt so far during questioning.The woman and her daughter had been living in the rented house for 15 years. The girl’s father, a farmer, spends most of his time at his hometown in Bihar. Devendra Singh Bisht, the SHO of Link Road police station, said they received a call from GTB Hospital around 6pm on Friday and started an investigation. “When we reached the hospital, we found that the deceased woman was a head constable with Delhi Police,” Bisht said.The SHO said though autopsy reports were awaited, doctors at GTB Hospital suggested it could be a case of murder as there were strangulation marks on the woman’s throat. “There was also a deep wound in the head, as if she had been hit with a blunt object. But the daughter kept telling us her mother had committed suicide. There were discrepancies in her statements and this raised our suspicion. We detained her for questioning,” Bisht added.Following sustained questioning, police said the girl admitted that she and her boyfriend had killed her mother. Quoting from the girl’s statements, investigators said when her mother came to know about her relationship with Jitendra, she chided her for not concentrating on her studies.“The mother was angry as the youth was from the neighbourhood. She allegedly slapped her a few times and went to the youth’s house to talk to his parents. There, she was told that Jitendra was not at home and would return after two to three hours. The woman asked his elder brother to send Jitendra to her home once he returned,” the SHO said.Jitendra went to meet the cop at her house around 1.20pm. As soon as she opened the door, an argument broke out, followed by a scuffle. “There was a container full of chilli powder lying nearby. The daughter passed the container to Jitendra and he threw the chilli powder into the woman’s eyes. She was caught off guard. Jitendra then hit her on the head with a blunt object. The woman fell unconscious. The two strangled her to death with a piece of rope,” said the SHO.To make it look like suicide, the girl went to a jewellery shop to get a gold chain repaired and Jitendra left the house, police said. According to SHO Bisht, “she returned home around 2.30pm and raised an alarm, saying her mother was lying motionless on the bed and had not responded to repeated calls from her”.Jitendra was arrested early on Saturday. A school dropout, he works as a helper at a grocery store in Delhi. The girl is supposed to appear for her Class X boards from open school.The murdered cop’s husband said he was in Bihar since early January. “All along, I was in Bihar and had no inkling about what was happening here. I had left Ghaziabad in the first week of January,” he sobbed. Jitendra is believed to have told cops he was in a relationship with the girl for over a year. “On the basis of the complaint lodged by the woman’s husband, an FIR has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC,” SHO Bisht said.",ghaziabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74155952,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206509,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/teenage-daughter-her-boyfriend-strangle-delhi-constable-to-death/articleshow/74155624.cms

Lalit has been sent to jail

GREATER NOIDA: A 25-year-old man was arrested for allegedly slitting the throat of his father with a reaping hook and killing him at their home in Jarcha . Primary investigation has revealed that the accused would blame his father for his impotence and killed him because he thought the latter had not done much to get him treated.

The deceased was identified as Rambhool Singh, a farmer from Kalouda village, where he lived with his wife and two sons — Arun and Lalit. While Arun had a wife and son , Lalit had separated from his wife a few years ago, apparently over his health condition.

The family came to know about the alleged murder around 7am on Saturday, when Arun, who stayed on the first floor, came down to check on his father and found him dead in his room. A police team reached the spot and sent the body for an autopsy. Lalit, who slept with his father in the same room, was missing.

DCP (zone 3) Rajesh Kumar Singh said Rambhool’s family had told them that the farmer had gone to sleep with Lalit on Friday night. The next morning, a bleeding Rambhool lay dead on his cot and the reaping hook lay nearby. “We started looking for Lalit, as he was the prime suspect. He was nabbed from the neighbouring Ghodi-Bacheda village and was taken into custody for questioning,” he said.

Police said Lalit had admitted to have killed his father as he would not let him go out of the house because of his condition. “As of now, the accused appears to be mentally unstable. So, the family, especially the father, was overprotective. Lalit has told us that they would keep him confined to his room as they felt he would leave the family or get into fights,” Singh said.

According to police, Lalit was being treated by doctors in Meerut and Aligarh and would get irritated easily after his wife left him. “He would blame his father for his condition,” the DCP said. Lalit has been booked for murder. He was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.

GREATER NOIDA: Police on Saturday imposed Section 144 in the district for a month due to upcoming festivals and board exams. The move comes against the backdrop of protests by farmers and several social outfits.

A circular was shared by additional DCP (law and order) Ashutosh Dwiwedi. The circular says the decision has been taken keeping in mind the protests and rallies over the past few weeks. “It is impossible to identify anti-social elements beforehand. That is why imposing Section 144 was required,” the circular read.

It further said no rallies or protests can be organised without permission from the authority concerned and no loudspeakers can be used during this period. The circular specifies that people should circulate videos or messages on social media with caution. During this period, there will be a ban on celebratory firing and consuming liquor in public places. Police have also got orders to immediately arrest those found making public speeches that can potentially hurt the sentiment of a particular community.

“Those found violating the norms made in the circular will be booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and may also face imprisonment along with a fine,” said the circular.

472,['16/02/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: Registry fee hike worries builders in times of slump,"This story is from February 16, 2020

GHAZIABAD: The UP government’s decision to hike property registry fees has left both homebuyers and developers disappointed. They feel the new rate will lead to higher property prices, thus further dampening the investor sentiment at a time when the real estate sector is going through a slump.

Earlier, the registry fee was Rs 10,000 for properties up to Rs 10 lakh and Rs 20,000 for properties over Rs 10 lakh. The new rates — a flat 1% of property cost — came into effect on February 14.

This means that if the cost of a flat is Rs 50 lakh, the owner will have to shell out Rs 50,000 against Rs 20,000 earlier. And if the stamp duty at 7% — which would be Rs 3.5 lakh — is added, then the owner will have to shell out about Rs 4 lakh extra for that Rs 50 lakh flat.

Animesh Choudhary, a potential homebuyer, said, “For the time being, I may have to abandon my plan to invest in a ready-to-move-in flat worth Rs 75 lakh. The change in registry fee will definitely put the burden on the middle-class looking to buy a flat.”

Manoj Gaur, national vice-president of developers’ body CREDAI, said, “The projects in NCR are already dwindling and there are not many takers, and in this backdrop the government’s move that increases the price of a flat is definitely not a good one. It will further dampen sentiments. Instead, efforts should be made to improve the situation in the real estate sector.”

The move will also have a bearing in housing schemes by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and other agencies such as the UP Housing Board.

“There are about 62 commercial properties worth Rs 400 crore and about 4,000 flats of the same worth, which the GDA is struggling to dispose of as there are very few takers for the same,” said Alok Kumar, member of the Federation of Apartment Owners Association (Fed AOA).

MUMBAI: A commuter survived after he was pushed out of the luggage compartment of a moving train at Nahur station on February 13. Amit Tak (25) boarded a Dombivli-bound train from Bhandup to go to his Mulund (W) home, but got into a scuffle with two commuters who demanded Rs 100 from him at 1.43pm, he claimed in the FIR.

A case under IPC sections 34 (common intention) and 307 (attempt to commit murder) was filed against unknown persons. “We are going through CCTV footage from stations to identify the two,” said a Kurla railway police officer.

Tak said in his complaint, “The two, seated in the luggage compartment, demanded Rs100. I refused and went to the footboard.” Police said the two followed Tak, argued with him and pushed him out when the train slowed down at Nahur. “Tak, who was traumatised, left with his family after lodging a complaint,” senior inspector M A Inamdar said.
