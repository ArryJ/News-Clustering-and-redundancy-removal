ALLAHABAD: Four FIRs were registered against four persons from two communities for allegedly posting objectionable comments about religion and deities on social media between January 31 and February 3 in Allahabad.

The four have been charged under section 153 A (attacking religion, language etc of any particular group\community) and 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66 of Information Technology (IT) Act.

SSP (Allahabad) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, ""Protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) already underway at New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and Allahabad’s Roshan Bagh, such posts could act as a trigger for untoward incidents. The cybercell is maintaining a close watch on photographs, posts and messages posted on social media. A 10-member team under the supervision of SP (crime) is using different software for monitoring developments"".

Police said the crime branch and cybercell have stepped up vigil and are monitoring social networking websites which might spark trouble.

The agitation against the new citizenship law at places like Shaheen Bagh, Roshan Bagh and at Lucknow’s Clock Tower have been garnering attention from across the country. Hundreds of women have managed to brave cold and police action to stand their ground at the protests.

""Police have already registered four FIRs with different police stations, including Colonelganj, under sections 153A and 295 of the IPC and section 66 of IT Act in the past four days,"" he added.

""We would be looking for tangible information about the posts and updates made on social media through our informants. A strict warning has been issued to social media users asking them to refrain from posting objectionable comments,"" the SSP said.

SSP made it clear that citizens should refrain from misusing social media or they may attract strict penal action. Blogs and social media accounts of some people have also been taken under the scanner.

It is no wonder, then, that the show’s air time was extended by two weeks from its regular 100 days. The credit, naturally, goes to the final set of contenders, who had viewers hooked even as they supported their favourites with their votes. TV actor Shine Shetty emerged as the winner, beating comedian Kuri Prathap and musician Vasuki Vaibhav who bagged second and third place, respectively.

6,['4/02/2020'],More Questions Than Answers,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Panaji: There is little doubt that Sergio Lobera is FC Goa ’s most successful and popular coach. That wouldn’t mean much if you consider Goa has had only two coaches since the start of the Indian Super League ( ISL ) in 2014. But that Lobera has zoomed ahead of Brazilian legend Zico is quite an achievement.

Zico took Goa to the semifinals in his debut season and was three minutes away from winning the ISL title at home in 2015. His teams played attractive football , won plenty of fans, although his third season was a disaster – not entirely his fault – as the team finished at the bottom. When the club parted ways with the Brazilian at the end of the season, nobody shed a tear.

Lobera’s sacking came out of the blue. Club sources suggest they mulled over the decision for a long time, but when they decided to pull the trigger, expectedly all hell broke loose.

The timing, not surprisingly, is questionable. Goa are three wins away from securing a cherished spot in the AFC Champions League, a first for any Indian club. For a side which has seemed in control of the title race –except setbacks against Bengaluru FC and ATK – the development left everyone shell-shocked.

Fans are spewing venom on social media. Some shed tears when they came face-to-face with the man who made tiki-taka a way of life here and others drove to the airport late in the night to say goodbye. More tears flowed.

So why did Goa take such a huge risk and do what no other club has dared? What was the compulsion to upset the equation at such a late, crucial stage? With top spot within handshaking distance, what forced Goa’s hand to show their most successful coach the door?

On record, there are no easy answers as officials have maintained stoic silence. Their parting of ways statement was general, expectedly vague, even though Lobera and his staff made it abundantly clear that they were unhappy at being forced out.

Maybe, they are all tied by confidentiality clauses, included in most termination contracts, so neither Lobera nor the club management can tell the fans the truth. What we do know is that there was an issue with the dressing room – possibly involving a select group or more players – and that there was disagreement over an out-of-contract bonus announced for topping the league. There should be other compelling reasons but, at least on record, nobody is saying a word.

“In the end, what matters are the players. We don’t want them to be distracted. At this stage, that will be disastrous. It’s all in their hands now,” said one official.

Lobera made it a point to meet the players at the team hotel before his departure. A couple of players had a word with him separately too. Some of them cried when the Spanish coach spoke and later hugged them. These players are professionals, so there’s little doubt that they will put their best foot forward when they take the field for the remainder of the matches this season.

As for the truth, never mind the clauses, will someone come on record?

7,['4/02/2020'],"Clifford is interim coach, Derrick TD","This story is from February 4, 2020

Panaji: Clifford Miranda will be the interim coach for FC Goa in the Indian Super League (ISL) after the organisers refused to approve Derrick Pereira ’s appointment to that role.

Clifford, currently doing his internship with RB Leipzig in Germany as part of his final module for the Pro Coaching Licence course, was assistant to Sergio Lobera this season and is expected to land in Goa on the morning of the club’s clash against Hyderabad FC on Wednesday.

Since parting ways with Lobera as chief coach with three matches left to be played, Goa had handpicked Derrick to step into that position and guide the team. Among India’s best-qualified and successful coaches, Derrick was assistant coach to Lobera in 2017-18, but returned to his position as technical director with the club for the last two seasons.

According to sources, the ISL organisers told Goa that rules did not allow any official to take over the coaching role, even on an interim basis, if he was not associated with the current team. Derrick’s credentials as India’s more-successful coach did not cut much ice. He will, however, be allowed to occupy the technical bench during matches.

“Clifford will be the interim coach under the mentorship of Derrick,” the club said in a statement on Monday.

Spaniard Roma Cullinera has been appointed as the club’s strength and conditioning coach. Having worked under various coaches in Spain, he was last working for KAS Eupen under Claudio Makelele in the Belgian First Division.

“We are confident in the abilities of our coaching staff to lead the team to a successful finish to the campaign. Derrick and Clifford have been with FC Goa for a few years and possess a deep understanding of the club and our philosophy. They have demonstrated the same with their past performances in the first team as well as at the youth levels,” said club president Akshay Tandon.

Derrick is expected to address the media on Tuesday with star striker Ferran Corominas by his side.

It is rare to witness the biggest political names of the country come together under one roof unless it's a political event. But as Rajya Sabha member and senior advocate Vivek Tankha hosted a dinner to celebrate the upcoming wedding of his son Varun Tankha with Tanya Prasad, political discussions were kept at bay. While the dinner witnessed the likes of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and current Information & Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar were among the few who arrived early to extend their wishes to the couple.Vivek Tankha, who was seen mingling with his guests, said, ""Despite it being the day when the Union Budget was presented, everyone came and this is when I was not able to speak to them personally on the day. I had no time. Whoever I met at the Parliament today, I requested them to come in the evening. Rajnath. I was running from pillar to post but people came on their own and they are all dear friends."" And were there any political discussions amongst his friends tonight? ""No, no politics tonight,"" added Tankha.Other political bigwigs present at the dinner included Chattisgarh's Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Madhya Pradesh’s Chief Minister Kamal Nath and former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram also made an early appearance at the do, but left long before others came to bless the couple.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73901887,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-459131,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/political-bigwigs-keep-politics-aside-at-this-pre-wedding-dinner-in-delhi/articleshow/73901888.cms
10,['4/02/2020'],The story behind Anil Kapoor’s tattoos in 'Malang',"Anil Kapoor, who plays Anjaney Agashe, a police officer with grey shades in ' Malang ', will be seen sporting temporary tattoos — a skull on each arm — in the film. Although his screen presence and acting chops are enough to make his character look convincing, tattoos were added to his look as a part of the narrative. Anil shares, “I met a local tattoo artiste in London, who asked me a lot of questions about my past and present, which intrigued me. I didn’t know that tattoo artistes dig so deep to know you as a person, before deciding the design. Eventually, it didn’t work out with her, and we got someone from India. Finalising the design for my character wasn’t an overnight decision, it went through a lot of thinking. The tattoos are crucial to the character as they take him to his past, gives him energy — positive and negative — and a reason to live.”So, were the tattoos added to lend his character a more menacing look? The actor replies, “It is more internal. The character is layered and is not someone who will wake up in the morning, do his hair, shave or grow his beard to look menacing. Whatever he does, comes organically to him. I have not used the tattoos as a prop. It just helps me to get into the character.”Interestingly, Anil does not have any permanent tattoo. Talking about why he never got one, he reveals, “I wanted to, but Sunita (his wife) was against it and warned me that I won’t be allowed in the house if I got inked. Harsh and Sonam are the only two family members who have tattoos. Harsh has got both his sisters’ names — Sonam and Rhea — etched on his back. I joke with him that his girlfriends and wife will get scared of them. Sonam was in Singapore when she got inked without informing anyone.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73905405,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-176286/73905405.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/the-story-behind-anil-kapoors-tattoos-in-malang/articleshow/73901504.cms
11,['4/02/2020'],"Tahira Kashyap Khurrana: If I celebrate the fact that I had cancer, I’m not celebrating the disease, but the way I fought it","In 2018, filmmaker-writer Tahira Kashyap Khurrana’s life met with a roadblock when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. What followed was painful sessions of chemotherapy, medication, mastectomy and reconstruction, and while all of it could have crushed her spirit, Tahira emerged from the experience, stronger, braver and more positive. On the World Cancer Day , today, she speaks to BT about her battle with carcinoma, surging ahead as a filmmaker and why it’s important to live every day of your life to the fullest. Excerpts...I’ve evolved over the last three years. Had it been the earlier me, I would have had anxiety and stress. I would have felt defeated and cursed my husband ( Ayushmann Khurrana ) because we tend to blame the spouse for everything that goes wrong. It’s a common tendency in people. But I changed when I discovered what I was suffering from. It makes you feel bad, but you have to find the resilience to deal with it. Today, as a filmmaker, I’m game to knock on doors till people hear me. Now, I am more determined to make it happen than I ever was. There’s a feature film I am working on and with that, I plan to make up for lost time. I need to prove myself. If I get success on a platter, it will probably be because of my husband. He has struggled on his own for years and achieved what he has. This (her journey of making films) is my struggle and it has to be mine, entirely. I’m glad that I’m on a journey of my own.I’m not a bechari, and I have never played the victim card. In all these years, I’ve never asked the question, ‘why me’ and I don’t want to go there now. Probably the reason I suffered is to spread the word, make people more aware, and normalise the conversation around breast cancer and its early detection. I’m a science student, educated and I still didn’t pay heed to the symptoms. In many cases, the detection happens at a much later stage.If I celebrate the fact that I had cancer, I’m not celebrating the disease, but the way I fought it. While undergoing treatment, I’ve even walked the ramp. If I had allowed myself to feel like a victim, I don’t know what I would have done. We all have problems in our lives, but we don’t get labelled as survivors of that. Then, why label one as a cancer survivor? When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I didn’t know the outcome, and I refused to harp on the kind of pain one goes through. In fact, I did a lot of pre-production work while I was undergoing chemotherapy. The day you stop blaming yourself or anyone else for what happens, people will stop seeing you through that prism. As a writer-director, when I walk into a room today, people see me as a professional, not a cancer survivor playing the sympathy card.Some people trolled me because they thought that I was getting treated at some fancy hospital in the US. But I got myself treated in Mumbai. Having said that, even if I was getting treated abroad, why should I be judged for it? I was trolled for seeking publicity post my treatment, for being a trophy wife and a social climber. I’m not guilty of these things, so they didn’t affect me. I remember, I was trolled for going bald during chemo. That exposed me to insensitivity of another kind. But with all this came prayers, good wishes and love, too, and I chose not to hide behind walls. When I started growing my mane again, they called Ayushmann and me brothers and said, ‘do bande chale aa rahe hain’ on social media. I’d be lying if I said these things never affected me, but I’ve learnt the art of pulling up my spirit. Social media can also be a pleasant place. Someone wrote to me in the middle of chemo that I look hot with the bald look. Several women feel so conscious after undergoing mastectomy and reconstruction. When I went through it, I realised this is not what defines me or any woman. How does the size of the breast define who I am? Women are much more than that.Ayushmann and I go a long way together. We did theatre together for 10 years, after which he became a radio jockey, a TV host and then an actor. I stuck to a corporate job, and wrote and directed plays on the side because I didn’t have the conviction to make a career out of it. I come from a family of educationists, and we’re taught to make stability the premise of life. In both our families, no one had ventured into this business. Ayushmann made his way with his conviction and achieved what he dreamt of. He had found his calling while I dabbled in jobs that I wasn’t happy with. I was full of doubt and insecurity about where I was headed. When a partner becomes successful, people know you through him. The onus is yours to change that. Today, my name goes as Kashyap-Khurrana. I’m evolved, confident and in agreement with who I am. It would have been the easiest for me to ask my husband to start a company for me or to get me work but that won’t make me happy. It’s not me. I’ve been trying to make a feature for long. Even when I made my first short, Toffee, which was partly sponsored by Ayushmann, I was very restless till someone bought it over and everyone got their money back. People take a long time to invest even Rs 500 in your work. The lull can be demotivating.At home, we’re equals but professionally, he’s my senior now. He may want me to direct him, but I also have to be in a position to do that. I have to earn it, and he has to like my script. It doesn’t seem right to start my feature with him in it just because he’s my husband.I respect my man and he respects me, too. I want to give him the space to grow while I find my way and he wants to give me my share of that space. When two people in a relationship believe in giving, the relationship blossoms. It’s not the tag of marriage that holds Ayushmann and me together, we’re companions. When I was pregnant and almost disconnected from the world around me, my partner did everything to keep me abreast with things. Till date, he shares his music with me, and I tell him which books he should read. When struggles and success are shared, relationships shine.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73905488,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-42176/73905488.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/tahira-kashyap-khurrana-if-i-celebrate-the-fact-that-i-had-cancer-im-not-celebrating-the-disease-but-the-way-i-fought-it/articleshow/73905322.cms
12,['4/02/2020'],"Conscious commute: Carpool, cycle, walk or take an e-bike","From car-free days to odd-even and dedicated cycling tracks, over the last few years, NCR has seen a number of initiatives aimed at making commuting more sustainable and eco-friendly. But one doesn't always have to wait for administrative diktats and schemes to be more sustainable. There are a number of ways individuals can contribute to the green cause and reduce the carbon footprint of their daily travel.The easiest way to make your commute more sustainable is to reduce the dependence on one's private vehicle as they are among the biggest contributors of toxic gases. Gurgaon-based businessman Manas Fuloria says, ""It's been over a year since I drove to work myself. I either use public transport or take cabs. Public transport system in Delhi-Gurgaon is expanding and availing it is quite easy. The only drawback is the time factor. It does take slightly longer than if you are driving.""While NCR does have a robust public transport system, it is not always possible to depend on it completely because of the longer travel time. An easy way to get around that is by carpooling, particularly with colleagues or friends with similar routes. There will be still cars out there but instead of four people taking four cars, it will be one car for four people. That reduces traffic load. ""I have been carpooling to work from Rohini to Noida with my brother and two of his colleagues every day for the last year and a half,"" says Ankita Singh, a marketing professional, adding, ""Apart from the obvious environmental benefit, it is also less tiring as we take turns to drive. Instead of driving 80km every day, I do it every fourth day now.""Ditching the car and relying on public transport like bus and Metro means one is faced with the issue of last-mile connectivity. Many have found a way around that by utilising one of the many e-bike or scooter rental services available. Shekhar Mendiratta, a software engineer, says, ""I used to drive to my office in Gurgaon daily, but last year, in a bid to be more environment-friendly, I switched to the Metro. The last Metro station was a few kilometres from my office, but the good thing is that there are so many app-based bike and e-bike rental services, I just rent a bike. It's easy on the pocket and sustainable, too. I have not driven to Gurgaon once in eight months now.""An increasing number of people in Delhi have now substituted cars and motorcycles with bicycles as the primary mode of transport. Yash Ahuja, a corporate executive from south Delhi does a round trip of 35km every day on his cycle to his Barakhamba Road office. ""Minimising the use of personal vehicles is the most effective way to lead a more sustainable life. Cycling in Delhi's traffic is tough but not impossible and once you plan your route, it actually takes less time than the car because you avoid jams,"" he says.However, many cyclists say that an absence of solid infrastructure for cyclists – including lack of dedicated tracks and chaotic traffic conditions – deter them from cycling long distances. ""Unless that is improved, many people will be turned away from cycling regularly,"" says Manas Fuloria, who used to cycle every day to work but shifted to car pooling after a new flyover on NH48 increased his travel time.It may come as a surprise but government figures show that 32% of Delhiites prefer walking to any other form of transport while commuting to work. Experts say that while this figure is bloated because of the presence of several daily wage workers who cannot afford to pay for any expensive mode of transport, it does show the potential Delhi has.""For smaller distances of even up to 2 kilometres, I prefer walking,"" says Gayatri Sharma, an advertising executive from the capital. She adds, ""Except in peak summers or heavy rains, when it is too taxing to walk, Delhi is perfect for walking. In fact, if you plan your commute well, it is the best mode for last mile connectivity. I usually take the Metro to the station closest to my office and then walk the rest of the way, which is 1.5km.""",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73897363,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-135967/73897363.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/conscious-commute-carpool-cycle-walk-or-take-an-e-bike/articleshow/73897453.cms

In the episode aired on Sunday, he was once again accused of hiding the fact that he has a child from his previous marriage. But this time around, Rashami made another shocking allegation, saying said that she wasn’t even aware of his previous marriage. So, what does Arhaan have to say about this? “Rashami knew about my marriage before she entered the house. She didn’t know about the child, though. I would have told her at the right time,” he says.Arhaan is also upset with Rashami’s friends Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Arti Singh talking ill about him and targeting him on the show. He says, “They don’t know me well to say such things about me, but it’s more hurtful to see Rashami take it quietly. She should take a stand for our relationship and it should not be subjected to insult and mindless scrutiny. I have been projected as a villain and it’s humiliating. I am sure that her actions or silence could be a result of circumstances and situations inside the house. I feel a lot of things pertaining to our relationship, which put me in the dock, could have been averted had Rashami spoken up.

14,['4/02/2020'],Allu Arjun: I have a sweet affection for Hindi cinema and I would like to be a part of it,"South star Allu Arjun flagged off 2020 with Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo , which has reportedly made its way to the top five films in Telugu cinema, ranking second after Baahubali: The Conclusion. The actor, who is at the cusp of making his foray into Hindi cinema, spoke to BT about kick-starting the New Year on a high, competition and what keeps him stimulated as an actor. Excerpts...This film was worth the wait. I took a break because I wanted to do a film in the mass entertainment genre. Everything I was offered at that time was from other genres, and I decided to wait because I hadn’t done something like this in a while. From where I see it, the film’s music worked very well with the audience. Usually, everyone goes into an unrealistic, over-the-top space in this genre, but we chose to keep it very candid. We were honest with our storytelling and that must have struck a chord with the audience, I guess.When we started off, we knew that Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo was a quintessential Telugu film. Also, we could not dub the movie in multiple languages because of time constraints. However, it has a Hindi satellite dub, which will come out soon. We also plan to release my next film in multiple dubs across India.The year has started off well and my line-up of Telugu films is quite interesting. While Trivikram Srinivas (director of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo) and I have cracked another idea, which we’re happy about, I also have Sukumar’s AA 20 to look forward to. I’ve enjoyed working with Trivikram and after the box-office success of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, it was challenging to find something that interests us and will also hopefully meet the audience’s expectations. I have a sweet affection for Hindi cinema and yes, I would like to be a part of it some day. Right now, I am just looking for that perfect project with a good director to start off with. My first move in this industry will matter a lot. A lot of actors from the South have done films in Hindi and I learn from everything that they have done. Content is extremely important. I’ve been working in Telugu cinema for 16 years now, but I will be making my debut in Bollywood. So, it’s a totally new terrain for me. I want to enter Bollywood with a film backed by content, with a producer-director team, which has a track record of delivering crackling content. I’ve seen a lot of people’s works and for me, Rajkumar Hiraniji tops my wishlist of directors to work with in Bollywood. I love all his films. I also like Shoojit Sircar Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Aanand L Rai , they have a brilliant body of work, too.Telugu has more density, while Hindi has more volume. The reach of Bollywood is much more than Tollywood. Telugu cinema has more ardent cinegoers, who are cinema-loyals. In terms of storytelling, we should appreciate the beauty of both industries. Bollywood is a content-oriented industry, which is bold, has a new-age take and balances commerce and art beautifully. Telugu cinema has great stories, too, which are more rooted in our culture, with superior command on action dramas and technology-driven storytelling. The industries have unique identities and that’s the best part of the story.That is a wonderful thing. The Hindi film industry has tapped a huge audience in the South. At the same time, the Hindi market has opened its doors to the talent and stories from the South. It’s cool that without eating into each other, the industries are growing together. Ultimately, we have to acknowledge that Bollywood takes the lead. It’s an identity for all of us, especially when we travel abroad. For people there, Indian cinema is Hindi cinema, making Bollywood a flag-bearer. It fills me with pride that they recognise our cinema. As an actor and an individual, so many Hindi films have inspired me. The songs, the scenes, performances, direction, story — the list is endless. The first Hindi film that I saw was Karan Arjun (1995) and I enjoyed it. So, commercial cinema is something that has always appealed to me.I think it’s my passion for work. Background or no background in cinema, your passion decides how far you can go. It’s like the fuel in the car. No matter what car it is, the fuel in its tank decides how far it can run. I can’t deny the fact that I am a third generation from my family in this business. My grandfather was an actor, and dad is a producer. Yes, people like me have had it easier than the others, who came from outside the industry. But I have immense respect for them because they’re just as passionate about cinema and their craft.My search and my desire to excel. For me, good is never enough, my aim is to deliver a great product each time. It doesn’t matter if it’s a hit or a flop, I am proud of the fact that even though the audience has rejected some of my films, they’re all beautiful cinematically. No actor can decide the fate of a film, but every actor can try and make a great film.Competition has always existed and will continue to do so. What matters is the internal journey of every individual; what’s important is how good I was in my film and how good my film was. It’s important to do your work with blinders on. For me, my biggest competition is my mindset. So many of my colleagues are my friends or relatives. We socialise and we are there for each other, but at work, we have to be smart. It’s not about my comfort zone. I may have a personal relationship with people but when I am at work, I will not compromise. There’s nothing personal about it, but I will not take a step back to make another colleague shine. I will encourage them and even help them, but they everyone has to earn their shine. As the son of a producer, I know that it’s my responsibility to deliver a great product each time because money and people’s work are at stake.I have a family background in production, so I understand that space and I could look at going there. But my greatest strength lies in my acting skills.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73906086,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-232169/73906086.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/allu-arjun-i-have-a-sweet-affection-for-hindi-cinema-and-i-would-like-to-be-a-part-of-it/articleshow/73906142.cms

16,['4/02/2020'],"CAG flags lack of rations, gear for soldiers in Siachen, Ladakh","This story is from February 4, 2020

File photo

NEW DELHI: There are huge shortages and grossly inadequate reserves of specialised winter clothing, snow goggles, multi-purpose boots and other equipment for Army troops deployed in high-altitude areas like Siachen , Ladakh and Doklam , with the soldiers also not getting proper rations sanctioned for the requisite calorific intake, says the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

The defence ministry, on its part, told CAG that the deficiencies in the high-altitude clothing and equipment were in the Army HQs reserves, “which will be made up in due course of time” despite budgetary constraints, but they “did not exist” at the level of troops deployed in the field.

An Army officer, in turn, said, “The CAG audit covers the period from 2015-16 to 2017-18. Things have improved since then. By and large, there is no dearth of clothing and equipment for soldiers deployed in areas like Siachen, where posts are located at heights ranging from 16,000 to 22,000-feet.”

With it taking around Rs 1 lakh to clothe a single soldier for the forbidding Siachen heights, the Army is also trying to “upgrade as well as indigenise” specialised extreme winter clothing and gear, the bulk of which is imported as of now, said the officer.

But the CAG report, tabled in Parliament, said there are 24% to 100% deficiencies in the authorised holdings for different items in the Army HQs reserves, which must be always maintained for any exigency.

Soldiers, for instance, had to make do with recycled multi-purpose boots, which protect feet at temperatures up to minus 55 degree Celsius, because they were not available from November 2015 to September 2016. Similarly, the stock level of all-terrain goggles was “critically low”, ranging from just 5.6% to 16.1% against the authorised levels.

On the ration front, the audit watchdog said special scales of ration are authorised for the troops to meet their daily energy requirements. “But sanctioning costly substitutes in lieu of basic items on same cost resulted in reduced quantity of calorie intake, ranging between 48% to 82.75%, of the troops. Provision of rations at reduced scales with lesser calorific value would have impact on the health and fitness of troops posted at high-altitude areas” it said.

Asking the MoD to take strong action against those responsible for lapses, the CAG said: “Delayed procurements and delayed receipt of contracted items led to an acute shortage of essential clothing and equipment and timely issue of the same to troops. Sub-standard items like face-masks, jackets and sleeping bags were procured of old specifications, which deprived the troops from the benefits of using improved products.”

17,['4/02/2020'],"PM Modi: Shaheen Bagh, Jamia are a plot to destroy harmony","Prime Minister Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched an attack on continuing anti-CAA agitation at Jamia Millia, Shaheen Bagh and other places, saying they marked an effort to disrupt harmony by protesters who were using the tricolour and Constitution to mask their real intent.He said the protesters’ professed allegiance to the Constitution was a deception aimed at distracting attention from the real intent of the conspirators and called upon voters in Delhi to support BJP to stop the anarchy from spreading further.“Jamia ho ya Shaheen Bagh, pichhle kai dino se, citizenship amendment act ko leke pradarshan hui. Kya ye pradarshan sanyog hai? Ji nahin, ye sanyog nahin, ye prayog hai. Iske pichhe rajniti ka ek aisa design hai, jo rashtra ke sauhadra ko khandit karne ka irada rakhta hai. (Whether it is Jamia or Shaheen Bagh, anti-CAA demonstrations have been going on for the last few days. Are these demonstrations random events? No, they represent a politics that is designed to destroy national harmony),” said the PM as he asked voters in Delhi to thwart the “mentality” which , if not checked, can cause similar blockades elsewhere too.The PM’s aggressive remark came as he addressed his first campaign rally in Delhi and were in sync with BJP’s attempt to rally the public opinion against the sit-in at Shaheen Bagh which has gone on for over 50 days now and sparked resentment in adjoining residential areas.“Look at the huge inconvenience it has been causing to people who commute from Delhi to Noida. People of Delhi are watching. They may be silent. But they are seething with resentment over this display of politics of vote-bank. This mindset has to be checked here itself. For, if the conspirators get powerful, more roads and lanes will be blocked similarly. We cannot allow Delhi to be pushed in the throes of anarchy. We have to stop this and every vote for BJP will help its spread. Only BJP can do that,” he said in the backdrop of an attempt by the party to blame its rivals AAP and Congress for the Shaheen Bagh blockade.The focus of PM’s attack on Shaheen Bagh, which drew loud cheers from the large crowd, was aimed at undercutting the legitimacy that the protesters have sought to garner by displaying the tricolour and carrying copies of the Constitution. The PM suggested that the display of faith in constitutionality at anti-CAA protest sites was just a stealth tactic. “Else, they would have heeded the spirit of a series of pronouncements from courts where they have stressed that protests should not result in violence, loss of public property and difficulties to people. After all, courts derive their authority from the very same Constitution,” he said.Modi also alleged that AAP and Congress were the reason why the protests have persisted. “These should have been called off after the government’s assurance (that the CAA will not deprive anybody of citizenship and implementation of NRC is not on the table yet) . But AAP and Congress are playing politics and all these things have now been exposed.”As BJP’s aggressive election campaign enters the last leg, Modi sought votes by referring to the central government’s initiatives for the country and the city and put spotlight on protests over CAA. Modi will address the second rally in Dwarka on Tuesday.The PM said Delhi’s development will get a major boost after BJP comes to power in Delhi. Delhi will become free of water tankers and get better sanitation. Modi urged people to come out in large numbers and vote for BJP and NDA in Delhi elections. “Each vote polled for BJP candidates will boost my strength also. Time has come to change Delhi,” he said adding that in the 21st century only the politics of development will work not politics of hate.Taking a swipe at Congress and AAP, Modi said those who questioned the Batla House encounter are now saving people who raised 'tukde tukde' slogans. The PM also slammed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who had raised questions on the surgical strikes carried out by the Army.Aware that the tans Yamuna area where the rally was held is home to a large number of 1731 unauthorised colonies, Modi listed out the Centre giving ownership rights to over 40 lakh people living in such colonies in different parts of the city. Without naming the AAP government, the PM said it was done despite obstacles being created. The development of these colonies will get a boost after BJP comes to power in Delhi, he said.The PM said all those living in slums in Delhi will get ‘pucca’ houses equipped with toilet, gas and electricity connection. In an indirect attack on AAP government which has not implemented Ayushman Bharat Yojna and PM Awas Yojna in Delhi, Modi said they will continue to obstruct welfare projects till they are in power because they know nothing other than politics. Modi touched on national issues like abolition of Article 370 , construction of Ram Temple and CAA for giving citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He said the BJP believes in positivity and keeps the national interest supreme.In Video: 'Political design' behind anti-CAA protests at Jamia, Shaheen Bagh, says PM Narendra Modi",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73917325,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1688509,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shaheen-bagh-jamia-are-a-plot-to-destroy-harmony-pm-modi/articleshow/73917319.cms

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party is poised to sweep the Delhi assembly elections winning between 54 and 60 seats in the 70-member house, a poll released by Times Now on Monday said. BJP is projected to get 10 to 14 seats and Congress at best two.Interestingly, the same poll shows that if a Lok Sabha poll were to be held now, BJP would win all seven seats in the Capital, just as it did last year. The poll, conducted by Ipsos, gave AAP a 52% vote share against BJP’s 34%, an 18-point lead in an essentially bipolar contest that would prove crushing. These vote shares represent a minor shift from the 2015 assembly polls, with AAP losing 2.5 percentage points and BJP gaining 1.7 percentage points.For the hypothetical Lok Sabha polls, 46% picked BJP and 38% AAP, but even this relatively smaller gap was enough for a clean sweep by the saffron party. Narendra Modi remains the clear favourite for the PM’s post, with 75% of those surveyed picking him. Rahul Gandhi came a distant second with 8%.On the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) issue, 71% felt the government had done the right thing. Not surprisingly, 52% were against the Shaheen Bagh blockade and only 25% agreed with the protesters, the remaining 24% not expressing any definite opinion on the issue. The IPSOS survey had a sample size of 7,321 respondents selected randomly from across Delhi. Samples were collected between January 27 and February 1 across socio-economic strata.

MUMBAI: The Tatas appear to be moving closer to a decision to bid for Air India (AI) in partnership with Singapore Airlines and have already started working on the structure for such an acquisition — including a merger of AirAsia India, in which they hold 51%, and Air India Express, a 100% subsidiary of the government-owned national carrier.Not just that, the Tata Group is reliably learned to have approached Tony Fernandes, the Malaysian entrepreneur who holds 49% in AirAsia India, for his approval to acquire AI Express. The shareholders’ agreement stipulates that the Tatas cannot invest more than 10% in another budget airline without Fernandes being willing to waive the covenant.People close to the development said a new agreement is expected to be signed soon. In lieu of the waiver, the Tatas have proposed to combine AirAsia India and AI Express. “The merger will give Fernandes a bigger play in Indian aviation; so, it’s a win-win for both partners,” said a person with knowledge of the discussions.AirAsia India took to the skies in 2013 as a joint venture between Tata Sons and Fernandes’ airline company, heralding the return of India’s largest conglomerate to aviation, a business it had pioneered through Air India before the carrier was nationalised. Tatas also operate Vistara, a full-service carrier, as a 51-49% JV with Singapore Airlines. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran has in the recent past told TOI that the company “will not run a third airline unless we merge”. A combination of Air India and Vistara would give the Tatas a monopoly in the full-service space.AI Express flies to 20 Indian cities and 13 international destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia with a fleet of 25 Boeing 737s while AirAsia’s fleet of 29 Airbus A320s services 21 cities across the country.AirAsia India has been waiting for permission to fly overseas. The wait may get longer as Fernandes, R Venkataramanan, a Tata nominee on the AirAsia board at the time, and a number of others have been named in criminal conspiracy and money laundering cases. Fernandes has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate on February 5.It is yet unclear whether Fernandes or AirAsia India will be part of the Tata-Singapore Airlines alliance’s bid for AI; the cases against him could be an issue, according to some people.Nevertheless, a Tata-Singapore Airlines bid will be based on the understanding that the budget carrier business would be run by the Tatas and Fernandes, a person in the loop told TOI, adding that Bombay House’s arrangement with Singapore Airlines is only for a full-service carrier.

21,['4/02/2020'],SC starts process to frame norms to define equality in religious practices,"This story is from February 4, 2020

NEW DELHI: A nine-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court on Monday started the process to lay down constitutional guidelines for examining equality in religious practices.

As the first step, a bench of CJI SA Bobde and Justices R Banumathi , Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, Mohan M Shantanagoudar, S Abdul Nazeer , B Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant brushed aside fervent pleas against broadening the scope of the issue arising from the controversy over the SC permitting entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple to similar gender bias in religious practices in Islam and among the Parsi and Dawoodi Bohra communities.

The court held firm that a five-judge bench had referred the issue of laying down guidelines for scrutiny of such controversies arising in different petitions and that it was within its jurisdiction to deal with the same. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said counsel for different parties had met but failed to agree on framing of issues for arguments. “However, none of the counsel raised any objection to the competence and jurisdiction of the nine-judge bench to hear the larger issue. I do not know why some of them are opposing now,” he said.

After hearing lawyers Fali S Nariman, K Parasaran, A M Singhvi, Kapil Sibal, Rajeev Dhavan , Rakesh Dwivedi , Ranjit Kumar, Shaym Divan, Indira Jaising, Joydeep Gupta and the SG, who argued for and against the SC laying down comprehensive guidelines, the bench said it would try to keep it to the “narrowest path possible”. Singhvi supported the nine-judge bench taking up the broader issue after framing of questions.

The bench said, “We are going to confer among ourselves and frame the issues. We will let the counsel know about the issues thus framed during a short hearing on Thursday. On that day, we will decide allocation of time for the counsel and commence hearing on Monday, February 10.”

Nariman said it was impermissible for a five-judge bench, while hearing petitions seeking review of the Sabarimala judgment which had earlier been decided by another five-judge bench, to refer issues to a larger bench.

Representative image

PATNA: A recent study conducted at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) has held ticks and mites responsible for rickettsial infection, which can lead to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in children. Over 150 children in the state, primarily in Muzaffarpur district , died of AES last year.

A research done by PMCH paediatrics department head Dr Anil Kumar Jaiswal, as a part of study under Indian Council of Medical Research, revealed that around 20% children suffering from AES had rickettsial infection. House dust mites and ticks are the carriers of the germ which causes this infection which led to AES in some of the kids.

“Ticks and mites are the vectors and can be found in blankets or dust in the house. These are the carriers of the germs, which causes rickettsial infection,” said Dr Jaiswal.

The research study has also been published in International Journal of Contemporary Paediatrics.

Samples of 400 children suffering from AES were sent to King George’s Medical College in Lucknow for the test, which was done by Dr Anita Jain. In around 20% of the samples, rickettsial infection was found to be the cause behind AES in kids.

“Symptoms like fever, convulsion and alteration of senses happen in rickettsial infection, which are found in kids suffering from AES,” said Dr Jaiswal.

He added: “AES is not a disease, but a symptom which happens due to various reasons. One of it is Japanese Encephalitis. There is also a theory that it occurs due to toxin from litchi, for which there are no medicines. But the good thing is that we have medicine to fight rickettsial infection and it has been included in the protocol of the state government.”

However, paediatricians also said rickettsial infection cannot be termed as the universal cause behind AES as it had been established in only 20% of the samples. Indian Academy of Paediatrics vice-president Dr Nigam Prakash Narain and Dr Jaiswal said: “Hypoglycaemia was the common cause in all the cases and children who were malnourished and from lower income group were the common sufferers. There is also a theory that toxin from litchi had caused AES which is true in few cases. Hence, rickettsial infection does not hold true for all the AES cases.”

AES outbreak in June last year had killed over 150 children in the state. Though various reasons have been tabled till now, small kids from poor family have been dying every year in summer due to it.

This was a unique marriage ceremony where besides band, baaja and baarat, there were bovines too.

SURAT: This was a unique marriage ceremony where besides band, baaja and baarat , there were bovines too. At a swanky party plot located in posh Vesu, a couple took ‘saath pheras’ in the presence of two cows and two calves.

Rohit Garodia, 29, who is pursuing PhD in business administration, married Abhilasha, 28, a chartered accountant, with Hindus Vedic rituals. The cows and the calves were kept near the wedding mandap where the duo took the marriage vows.

Before the wedding, a procession was taken out in Vesu area, which was led by the cows and the calves. The first entry at the wedding venue was given to the cows and that the invitees and the couple followed them.

The wedding ceremony was based entirely on green concept. The marriage invitation cards were made digitally and sent through WhatsApp and email to save paper. Also, the guests at the wedding were served with water and other refreshments in kulhars. There were steel utensils to serve food to the guests.

Rampal Garodia, father of Rohit, said, “Tradition of marriage in the presence of cows is very old and we followed the same. We hope that people in our community will follow this tradition by giving a special status to the cows in marriage ceremonies.”

Garodia added, “All our invitees are happy that we started this new tradition of marriage. I met many of our relatives and friends who are so inspired by the tradition that they have decided to perform the marriages of their sons and daughters in the presence of cows.”

Sudhadevi Garodia, mother of Rohit, said, “Our wish has come true after all these years. We were waiting for this day for last many years. Me and my husband decided to perform marriage of our son in the presence of cows more than 10 years ago.”

Sushil Agarwal, textile businessman and a relative of Rohit, said, “It was a very different experience to attend a marriage ceremony in the presence of cows. I have seen cows munching over leftover food after marriage ceremonies. Here, they were not only given fodder to eat, but a separate space near the mandap for showering their blessings on the newly wedded couple.”

26,['4/02/2020'],Bihar to aid in branding and promotion of export items: Sushil Kumar Modi,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi addressing during State Credit Seminar at Gyan Bhawan in Patna

PATNA: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) on Monday said that the state government would “actively intervene” to promote exports from Bihar, which currently languishes at a miniscule 0.05% of the total exports from the country. The state would help in branding of products from various districts to create demand for them in the international market, he added.

“PM Narendra Modi has asked the state governments to make necessary interventions to promote exports of products and items from their respective areas,” SuMo Modi said, referring to a recent meeting addressed by the PM in which he had participated.

SuMo was the keynote speaker at seminar on ‘State Focus Paper 2020-21’ related to the annual credit plan prepared by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). He said, “8.74 lakh metric tonne (MT) of food items worth Rs 1,748 crore were exported from the state in 2017-18 was, but it could be increased to Rs 9.35 lakh MT valued at Rs 2,500 crore.”

SuMo drew the attention of the bankers at the seminar to the annual credit plan that had allotted Rs 292 crore for disbursement among exporters from the state. “Come forward and assist them, so that more products and items could be exported from the state, which, in turn, would also increase the state’s share in the total exports from the country,” he told the bankers.

The deputy CM added that one product or item would be identified from each district for branding and its “pull-value” in the international market would be created. Among the items that he cited for identification were ‘katarni chawal and chura’ from Bhagalpur, fruits (shahi litchi, Bhagalpuri silk and ‘malda’ mango) and sweets as well as handicraft items and Madhubani paintings.

Currently, the largest share of exports from the state belongs to non-basmati rice (32%), followed by maize (29%), cereal (9.3%), wheat (6.1%), ‘makhana’, as well as fresh vegetables and honey. “The need is to do proper branding and maintaining their quality,” SuMo said.

Animal husbandry department’s principal secretary, N Vijayalakshmi, said production of fish in the state has recorded highest growth in the recent years.

“For long, Bihar remained a fish consuming state for which varieties of fish used to come from states like Andhra Pradesh, but the state is now turning into a fish producing state,” she said, adding, the gap between fish import and production in Bihar was merely 44,000 tonnes which would be overcome in the next fiscal..

NEW DELHI: In a bid to woo the traders and middle-class voters, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated a major part of his speech to the tax reforms undertaken by his government in the Union Budget The Budget will help the youth of the country, women, traders, middle and lower-middle class people and the poor. It will open new avenues of development and employment in the capital, the PM claimed. “Earlier, businesses with a turnover of Rs 1 crore had to be audited, but now no audit is required for all businesses with a turnover up to Rs 5 crore,” Modi said, adding that it was an example of the government’s trust in traders and entrepreneurs of the country, including those in Delhi.The trading community in the capital, traditionally BJP supporters, holds immense sway and is an influential voting bloc. They are believed to be unhappy with the government post demonetisation and the hasty implementation of the GST has left many traders high and dry. The PM, in his rally , appeared to be healing the old wounds of the traders.For the first time, the PM said, the IBC legislation has been passed to give entrepreneurs a dignified exit from businesses. “It has been BJP’s efforts to reduce problems of traders and enable them to carry out their work freely,” he said.The Prime Minister assured the people that multiple provisions have been made in the Budget for tax holidays for startups and that middle-class taxpayers save money. He stated that the central government has also addressed previous complaints from the traders about tax authorities giving them a harrowing time. “Our government has started indirect tax settlement scheme, which has saved countless traders from legal cases,” Modi added.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73922066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-412207,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/budget-took-care-of-citys-traders-modi/articleshow/73916203.cms
28,['4/02/2020'],Taxpayers approach CAs to understand new tax regime,"This story is from February 4, 2020

PATNA: Chartered Accounts (CAs) in the state capital are busy explaining the new two tax regimes to the taxpayers in the state following announcement by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech last Saturday.

The CAs claim people were asking about the difference between the newly introduced flat tax regime, which offers lower tax rates and the itemized deduction system being followed at present.

Rajesh Kumar, a chartered accountant, said: “I have received more than 40 queries in the last two days. People are not sure whether to switch to the new tax regime or stick to the old one. Those who have just started their career should definitely consider switching to the new tax regime and start fresh as they do not have much to lose.”

Amit Bhatacharya, chairman of Patna branch of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said: “If we compare both the slab rates, the previous one is better for people who have made long-term and big investments.”

Terming the new slab rates as an “eyewash”, ICAI (Patna) vice-chairman Mukul said: “Earlier, investments like in LIC were promoted in the country. Not only did it benefit the common people but the government as well. With the change in slab rates, people will stop investing in policies like LIC. It is not good for the economy.”

He added: “Earlier, people had options to use their investments for paying loans, in case of losing jobs. Now, they do not have any such option.”

Meanwhile, many taxpayers are still struggling to understand the new tax regime and making a choice. “Even after going through the Budget 10 times, I couldn’t figure out what’s exactly the point of making so many changes. The government should have taken measures in profitable sectors instead of making common people, who have invested 75% of their earnings, rethink about their decision,” said Amish Kumar, manager of a private firm.

“Earlier, demonetisation and now the new income tax regime. The government, with its every step, is showing its approach towards common people. The optional income tax regime came as a shock as it would completely kill investments. Being a mutual fund investor, I am not able to understand what step to take next,” said Uma Shankar Prasad, a businessman.

Gyan Prakash, an adviser in LIC, said: “Those who have made big investments should stick to the old tax slabs. However, people with small investments should go for the new one. The older regime will result in lower tax outgo compared to the new regime with lower rates.”

Ram Shankar, chairman of Patna branch of Central India Chartered Accountant Students Association (CICASA), said: “The most important scheme this time is the “Vivaad se Vishwas”, which is the tax dispute settlement scheme, under which a taxpayer who pays the disputed taxes before March 31 this year would get renunciation of interest and penalty. Besides, there are pre-filed tax returns for individuals in the new tax regime.”

The 44th International Kolkata Book Fair , which is being held at Salt Lake’s Central Park, has something for everyone. From bringing back memories of lost heritage to highlighting the current political issues, the fair has once again ticked all the boxes. And cops are keeping an eye out for troublemakers so that every guest at the fair has a good time.

Walking postbox

There was no mistaking the giant inflated postbox walking around at the book fair. At a stall put up by the postal department, officials said that efforts were on to popularize India Post through innovative schemes — including shaking hands with the postbox, posing for a photograph for a postage stamp and buying bottled gangajal. One can even buy silver pendants engraved with motifs. Officials were spotted trying to explain to visitors why it is “cool” to buy books at the fair and “speed post” them to friends and family living out of state. Even postal savings schemes were being advertised. “These are times of targets,” an official explained. On Monday, a special postal cover and cancellation, a special envelope cover and metal seal to commemorate the 44th book fair were released.

Books on current situation

The rhetoric against NRC and CAA was palpable at the little magazines pavilion where a large number of publishers had come out with special books and magazines on the citizenship issues. Two volumes published by the People’s Study Circle — ‘Nijer Deshe Refugee Hobo’ and ‘Ei Banglar Udbastu’ — have caught on with the public. Among the other stalls, Akinchan, Ayna Nagar and RB Enterprise drew a lot of visitors for their anti-CAA books and journals on Monday.

Push for peace

It was heart-warming to see camaraderie between people managing the stalls of Viswa Hindu Parishad and Ahmadiya Muslim Jamat — located opposite each other. Waqar, one of the managers at the Jamat stall, held up a Bhagvad Gita that he bought from the VHP stall. “We are trying to promote peace here. All religions teach the same thing and, to us, our Quran is just as important as the Geeta,” said Shahbaz Munim.

Kids try story-writing

On Monday, school children took up the open air arena set up by Janapriya Prakashani, a yesteryear kids’ publication, to read books and try their hand at writing stories. There was a quiz on books and other fun sessions too, along with prizes for the participants.

Two held for harassment

Two men were arrested from the book fair on Monday for misbehaving with women. The victims raised an alert, allowing cops to nab the accused immediately. Officers said they were keeping watch on the gathering every day and monitoring the area through CCTV cameras. Cops said they will deploy more woman personnel in plain clothes who will mingle with the crowd and be ready for any untoward incident.

Cuffs on pickpockets

Six pickpockets were arrested from inside and outside the book fair since Sunday. Two were arrested from the grounds while the rest were picked up from the bus stand nearby. The accused, cops said, usually targeted women who were carrying large bags. Cops said they suspect the accused could be part of a Mullickbazar-based gang that frequented fairs and functions. Officers said raids against such criminals would continue at the fair.

30,['4/02/2020'],KMC reclaims Dhapa for scientific waste disposal,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Kolkata: Unable to find an alternative ground to dump waste as large as Dhapa , the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to continue with the existing facility but after scientifically reclaiming it in phases.

Adopting multi-pronged strategies to combat the ill-effects of hazardous waste at Dhapa, the civic solid waste management department has started reclaiming portions of the dumpyard, so that those areas could be reused after creating sanitary landfill, said Debabrata Majumdar, member, mayor-in-council, overseeing the department.

During a visit to Dhapa, TOI found multiple machines scooping out chunks from high piles of waste and taking them to a compost plant, where the waste is recycled into fertilizer. “We have started reclaiming a part of the Dhapa ground since January 16. These scooped-up chunks are transported to a factory, where the waste is screened and segregated. After segregating plastic and the likes from biodegradable waste, the latter is sent to a separate unit to produce organic manure from it,” said a KMC solid waste management official.

As the KMC is determined to reduce health hazards from the Dhapa dumping ground, a search for an alternative land is also on. “Going by the present rate of reclamation, it will take much long to reclaim the entire 23 hectares of Dhapa. We need an alternative land that could be set up with a sanitary landfill facility to take the load off Dhapa,” a KMC official said. The civic body has stopped dumping waste on 12 hectares of land in the crore Dhapa area. The portion has been beautified and a green zone created there.

A civic official pointed out that the capacity of the compost plant would be enhanced soon. “In the first phase, we are recycling 300 tonnes of garbage a day. The capacity of the compost plant will be increased to 900 tonnes a day in three months,” he said.

The official said 100 tonnes of manure were produced from 300 tonnes of wastes every day. This apart, the compost plant, set up on a PPP model, receives 500 tonnes of biodegradable waste collected from Kolkata households every day.

A section of KMC officials, however, felt the success of the project of reclaiming the Dhapa ground would depend on fruitful implementation of waste segregation at the ward level. “We have recently started waste segregation at households in 20 KMC wards. The number will go up by another 100 by the end of the year. Only then will we be able to prevent the pollution being generated from the hazardous waste dumped at Dhapa,” said a KMC solid waste management official.

Surat: Of the approximately 60 ,000 street vendors and food cart owners in the city, only 28 ,000 have got themselves registered until now. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is planning to end the chaos caused by vendors and food cart owners at many places in the 326 sq km area under its limits. SMC has drawn up a plan to accommodate 1,000 vendors in Rander zone, Katargam zone and Limbayat zone under National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM).

A town planning officer said, “The issue of street vendors is complex. We will be appointing a consultant to carry out a survey before allotting space to registered vendors in 2020-21.”

Jaylal, president of Jagte Raho, a non-government organization, said, “SMC is bent upon choosing wrong locations to allot space to the vendors. A vendor must be located at a place which saves a consumer’s time, fuel, money and also helps reduce traffic congestion. If a vendor is located on a road which is near consumers’ houses or offices, they can buy the required things on the way.”

As per the street vending law, one third portion of footpath in a specific area can be allotted to street vendors on a permanent basis. The problem is the vendors refuse to move out from the place where they are located on the premise it will affect their business.

Jaylal said, “All food carts must be located at consumers’ doorsteps. They could be allotted spaces on ancillary roads near the residential localities. For a critical issue like this, town vending committees must be set up. SMC has constituted arbitrary committees without proper representations of people concerned.”

34,['4/02/2020'],"BPCL partners Kinetic &amp; IIT M, enters EV space","This story is from February 4, 2020

Chennai: State-owned oil refiner BPCL on Monday said it has forayed into electric vehicles space in partnership with Kinetic Green energy. BPCL will use its vast network of nearly 12,000 fuel stations to offer fully charged automotive batteries for e-vehicles on a swappable basis.

In this model, to begin with, the three wheelers would be owned by Kinetic Green while BPCL will provide Lithium Ion batteries under support from IIT Madras.

Three wheelers would be sold without batteries by Kinetic (to begin with in Lucknow and Kochi).

“The three wheeler (autorickshaw) cost without batteries will be Rs 1.3 lakh as against a CNG powered one which costs Rs 2.2 lakh. It will be lower than Internal Combustion Engine vehicles. The cost of a diesel delivery rickshaw is Rs 3.5 per km while that of battery operated will be just 50 paise,” said Sulaja Forodia Motwani, CEO, Kinetic Green Energy.

“Today we have forayed into EV space with e-drive in Kochi and Lucknow. It is the first of its kind in India and opens up a new customer segment for BPCL. The batteries, charging stations, IT infrastructure, mobile tech have all been developed by IIT Madras. It will be a new revenue stream and business potential for BPCL,” BPCL’s CMD D Rajkumar said.

Surat: Palkesh Patel , one of the accused in a graft case and husband of Congress municipal councillor Kapila, was arrested by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) sleuths on Monday. Palkesh and his wife were on the run since December 10, 2019 after a businessman was caught accepting bribe on their behalf from a builder.

Palkesh surrendered before ACB sleuths after which he was arrested. In his complaint, the builder earlier alleged that Kapila and Palkesh had demanded bribe from him. Police had arrested Hitesh Patel for allegedly accepting the bribe on behalf of the couple.

Kapila, a municipal councillor of ward 18 Anjana – Khatodara area, had filed a complaint in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) against the builder seeking demolition of his construction project for alleged violation of norms.

The accused demanded bribe from the builder to withdraw the application but he was not willing and approached ACB.

“Palkesh had earlier approached sessions court and high court for anticipatory bail, but didn’t get compelling him to surrender,” said an ACB officer.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday came down heavily on revenue officials over widespread illegal structures on encroached government plots and also pulled up the state government for being in deep slumber while its own land was slipping out of its hands.

Addressing the state government, the bench cautioned it against being misled by officials. “Do not rely on whitewashing techniques of these revenue officials who try to get away with evasive replies as and when such irregularities surface,” said Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan while dealing with a PIL by K Krishna Goud on the failure of officials in preventing encroachment of 3.22 acres of government land at Gandhamguda area in Gandipet mandal of Rangareddy district.

When revenue department counsel Bhaskar Reddy said that officials were planning to survey the land to ascertain if there was any truth in the allegations, the bench of CJ Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy said: “Whenever a PIL is filed on encroachments, officials tell us that they too have realised about the illegality only now and that they would act on it soon.” Describing this as an official eyewash to get out of sticky situation, the bench added: “The less said about such techniques of these officials, the better.”

The bench also brushed aside the contention of the counsel for the revenue department who was insisting on 3 months to complete the survey of government land in Gandipet area. It gave the state a month to complete the survey.

“Officials know that state land is being occupied and illegal structures are coming up,” the CJ remarked and sought to know from the state what steps were being taking to arrest this malicious trend which has led to scores of illegal buildings sprouting in various parts of Hyderabad.

Ranchi: Sixteen female hockey players from USA, who had come to Ranchi from the US to bond with their tribal counterparts at a six-day special hockey training camp, on Sunday went back to their country and took back with them what they termed as “cherishable” memories with them. The hockey eves, accompanied by a female coach from Middlebury College of Vermont was in Ranchi as a part of sports-based training-cum-awareness camp which was jointly organised by the US Consulate General in Kolkata and Shakti Vahini, a Delhi-based NGO working in the field of anti-trafficking.

The purpose behind the exchange programme, according to officials, is to sensitise tribal girls against issues of human trafficking and gender-based violence using sports as a means. The six-day camp, which concluded on Saturday, was held at South Eastern Railway Sports Association (SERSA) stadium. Sharing her experience, one of the visiting players, Joan Viera said, “It was a very good experience to play and bond with the girls here. We learnt several new things about their sports, culture, practices etc. We also shared many sweet memories and made many new friends.”

Another girl, Grace Harlen, said, “It was an entirely new experience for me to be in a completely different place and spend time with girls here. It will always be a memorable trip for me and we are going back with a lot of cherishable memories.”

Assistant secretary of US Department of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) Marie Royce, who was present during the concluding ceremony of the programme said, “We believe that the power of cultural exchange through sports is transformative. Participation in sports also teaches leadership, teamwork, and communication skills that help young people succeed in all areas of their lives.”

As many as 110 tribal girls, many rescued after being trafficked, from districts like Chaibasa, Khunti, Simdega and Gumla, attended the camp. Officials informed that five of the participants from the 110 girls will be awarded scholarships to travel to Middlebury College in April 2020 to participate in field hockey matches under a cultural exchange programme.

A Class X student, Priya Kerketta from Simdega, said, “The camp was fun-filled and I enjoyed a lot. I learnt many new techniques of the game from them.” Poonam Toppo from Gumla said, “I always wanted to play hockey. During the camp, I learnt new ways of rolling and different types of passes.”

Another Gumla girl, who was rescued a year ago, said, “I now go to school regularly and aim to become a hockey player so that in the future, I can get a job through sports quota and also play for the state or the country.”

41,['4/02/2020'],Year-round policy sales point to lower tax impact,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Rachel Chitra | TNN

Bengaluru: Sales of life insurance policies may not be hit as badly as feared due to the Budget announcement allowing assessees to opt for a lower rate of tax by foregoing tax breaks on investments such as insurance. Industry experts say tax breaks for investment under Section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act are no longer the driver and buyers are choosing insurance for protection and tax-free returns on earnings.

One indicator of the dependency on investment tax breaks is the bunching up of purchases around March 31. This has gone down over the years, as investors now have a wider variety of tax-saving investment options available.

In 2015, over 35% of the premium from new policies came in the quarter ended March. This has dipped to 27% in 2019, indicating sales are more spread out.

The fourth quarter of 2019 saw Rs 73,089 crore (27%) sales in the first-year premium from the new business out of total premium of Rs 2.67 lakh crore. This compares to fourth-quarter new business sales of Rs 44,142 crore (34%) of the total premium of Rs 1.24 lakh crore.

If one looks at the month of March only, the volume of business done has dipped to 14% of total sales in 2019 from 18% in 2015. Tax will not be the only deciding factor, say companies. PolicyBazaar CEO Yashish Dahiya says, “Our insights tell that consumers don’t buy these products for tax benefit alone. This Budget will validate these insights, as we believe it’s time the middle class bought insurance for its real benefit, which is protection.”

There are others, who say they will most likely retain their client base as the old tax regime would prove more beneficial to them. “Our initial analysis suggests that it is beneficial for taxpayers to continue investment in life insurance policies for claiming tax exemption under Section 80C as it would be beneficial with less tax outflow in the year in which premiums are paid. Additionally, tax exemptions under section 10(10D) of Income Tax Act would continue against the amounts received from life insurance companies,” says Prashant Tripathy, MD and CEO, Max Life Insurance .

Tax planners also say it is unlikely millennials would opt of insurance for a few thousand rupees in tax savings. “Most people in their 30s and 40s would already have an ongoing life insurance policy for Rs 20-30 lakh. Some even take Rs 1-crore policies. Now for a tax-saving of Rs 10,000, it is unlikely they will opt out of policies and lose the benefits on them,” says S Neelakandan, a chartered accountant and tax planner.

“People new to insurance might go for the new tax regime. But the majority of the salaried class — whatever else they opt out of (mutual funds, FDs, PPFs) — life insurance they are unlikely to. This is a life risk — and a very personal decision. The money is whatever they are leaving for the family if something happens,” adds Neelakandan.

42,['4/02/2020'],NGO unearths ‘violations’ in MSEDCL underground cabling,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: Civic Action Guild Foundation (CAG), a non-profit organization from Dharampeth, has alleged substandard work in cable laying work done by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd ( MSEDCL ) across the city.

In a letter submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in New Delhi, CAG stated that MSEDCL is laying underground cables across the city from last three years but it is not being done as per the Indian Standard (IS) norms. “The PMO has asked the Maharashtra principal secretary to look into the matter,” CAG member Nachiket Kaley said.

The underground cabling works is being carried out under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) of Government of India and standard operating procedure needs to be followed as per IS-1255 (1983) specifications.

“On inspecting some sites, we observed that the norms are not being followed. This was brought to the notice of top officials of MSEDCL, Nagpur. MSEDCL constituted a two-member committee, re-dug only three sites and reported that the works all across were carried out as per the norms,” Kaley said.

According to Kaley, when the NGO registered a strong objection, the authorities agreed to open up sites of their choice. “In the presence of authorities and the contractor’s representatives; we reopened a site in front of high court,” Kaley said.

The joint survey revealed substandard work. MSEDCL’s spokesperson too admitted that many discrepancies were found in the work done by the private contractors.

The excavation of trench was not done as per the norms laid down under IPDS. The trench dug up was found to be 27 inch deep while norms says it should have been 54 inch deep. Even the RCC done for covering the cable was of substandard quality.

The joint study also found sand was missing from the trench. As per IS 1255, it is necessary to place 75mm sand bed under the cable and 75mm above. This was totally missing at the site, pointing to negligence by the executing contractor.

The back filling was carried out with the excavated soil containing material not permitted in the norms as they might damage the cable in the near future.

MSEDCL spokesperson claimed that the shortcomings have been had rectified through the said contractors. This, however, exposed that MSEDCL engineers, who were supposed to monitor the work, are ignoring their work. The spokesperson said that if they again receive any complaint they are ready to inspect the sites.

* Excavation of trench not done as per the norms laid down under the IPDS scheme

* Even the RCC done for covering the cable was of substandard quality

Mumbai: The insolvency professional (RP) for troubled housing finance company DHFL has rejected a Rs 4,100-crore claim submitted by Prudential International Insurance Holding — the bankrupt company’s partner in life insurance and erstwhile partner in asset management. The RP while releasing the list of admitted claims said the claim was rejected as no documentation was submitted for substantiating the claim.

Pramerica Life Insurance India is a joint venture between DHFL Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DHFL and Prudential International Insurance Holdings. The rejection of the claim indicates the US insurer has not been able to resolve the shareholder issue in its life insurance JV — Pramerica India. Prudential has been trying to find a new partner in place of DHFL, which had turned insolvent following its inability to meet its debt obligations.

“Nor was any explanation on the basis of which the claims have been calculated is provided. The factors considered in determining the claim amount are speculative in nature and do not meet the requirement prescribed under the applicable law,” the RP said.

In the previous year, Prudential Global Investment Managers (PGIM), the US insurers asset management arm bought out DHFL from its mutual fund joint venture. However, a similar buy-out was not possible in life insurance, which is subject to foreign limits. DHFL also had a non-life insurance company, which was promoted by its promoter Wadhwawan Holdings. The promoters exited the non-life business by selling out to Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal for around Rs 100 crore.

Former Indian Overseas Bank MD R Subramaniakumar, the RBI appointed administrator for DHFL, had verified claims amounting to Rs 86,035 crore of which around Rs 5,000 crore were from fixed deposit holders. The administrator has sought bids for DHFL either in entirety or any one of three parts of its business. The parts include retail loans, SRA projects and wholesale loans.

Union home minister Amit Shah at an election rally in Karala on Monday

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said the Delhi assembly election is a clear contest between patriots under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and people who oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act and support Shaheen Bagh .

Speaking at a public meeting organised in support of Master Azad Singh, the Mundka BJP candidate and brother of former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma, Shah said, “Desh par jo ungli uthayega, usko munh tod jawaab Narendra Modi sarkar degi (Whoever points a finger at the nation, the Modi government will give a resounding answer to them).”

“When people of Delhi go to vote, they should keep in mind that this election is between two ideologies. On one side are Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal , who do appeasement politics for vote bank and are with Shaheen Bagh. On the other, there is BJP under PM Modi, which is a group of patriots who want to ensure the development and security of Delhi and the country,” Shah added.

Promising to remove Lal Dora and development in unauthorised colonies once voted to power, the BJP star campaigner said, “Modiji has a plan ready for these colonies. But we need to be in power in the state to make it a reality. In Delhi, people living in jhuggis will get two-room flats built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There will be paved roads, streetlights, proper drainage, gardens and libraries. But for that we need a BJP government in Delhi.”

“We will give scooters to poor college-going girls, bicycles to primary and secondary school girl students and flour to poor at Rs 1 per kg up to 5kg per person. We don’t make false promises. We say it and we do it. Our government is going to form in Delhi and I assure you that both the central and state governments are going to make Delhi the best capital in the world,” the home minister said.

Shah also addressed meetings at Sadar Bazar, Rajendra Nagar and Chirag Dilli and attended a roadshow at Karol Bagh. At Sadar Bazar, he assured that CAA was not meant to take anyone’s citizenship.

“These people (Congress and AAP) instigated our Muslim brothers and sisters that your citizenship will go away. I have said this many times. Citizenship will be given to refugees under CAA, not taken away from anyone. These people (refugees) have as much right here as you or me. You tell me whether we should give them citizenship or not,” Shah said, stressing on the fact that in Delhi, one-third of the people are refugees from Pakistan.

Attacking the AAP government, Shah said all development claims by them were lies.

RAJKOT: The alleged ‘bribe-for-publicity’ scam that has rocked the Rajkot collector’s office has exposed the dirty underbelly of politicians, media and administration nexus that has almost become an accepted norm. While the Rajkot collector and the BJP insisted that there was no wrongdoing in handing out hefty payment cheques to local scribes as advertisement payment, the opposition Congress has alleged that government itself was openly promoting corruption and demanded a detailed investigation.

The Rajkot collector’s office had allegedly distributed cheques of Rs 50,000 each to eight print media organization and some of them were issued in name of individual journalist of concerned media organisation.

The payment, according to district officials, was made with intention to get publicity of it’s state level event organized to celebrate the Republic Day. The three-day state level function had started from January 24.

District collector Remya Mohan could not be contacted for comment but addressing media persons on Sunday, she had said, “Cheques were issued from fund raised through public participation to celebrate a public function. There was no government grant used in making payments to the media houses. The amount was given through account payee cheques to publish the three days schedules of the events and get good coverage.”

“The intention was to get wider publicity of the program scheduled to obtain maximum public participation during the state level Republic Day function,” she had added.

However, according to sources no proper procedure was followed to place an advertisement in the publications like issue of release order. It has also been alleged that district administration tried to publish ‘paid news’ in the newspapers by giving ‘bribes’ to the journalists.

Rajkot city Congress president Ashok Dangar said, “This is open corruption. Chief minister (Vijay Rupani) himself had admitted last month that corruption was highest in the revenue department. Rajkot collector has now proved it.”

“The district administration had forcefully collected the fund for the Republic Day celebration from the builders and contractors and used it the way they wanted without being accountable,” alleged Dangar, demanding independent probe in the matter.

However, BJP spoke person Bharat Pandya reiterated that there was no bad intention behind the decision. “All payments were done through cheques. The relation between the administration and media is based on trust and co-operation. The district administration tried to maintain transparency in the process. The Congress has no right to make allegation,” Pandya said defending the Rajkot district administration.

TimesView The expanding lion’s population is a wake up call for the forest department to carefully monitoring their movement as it’s a challenge to provide them passage through the towns and human habitats. The forest department is already engaged in lion conservation, but the second step is to make a long-term plan to ensure landscape management to accommodate expanding lion population.

Tourists throng Madhavpur

RAJKOT: Asiatic lions have caused a major scare near Madhavpur, one of the sought-after beaches of Gujarat , barely 60 km from Porbandar.On Sunday morning, a lion, believed to be around 5-7 years old, preyed on a green sea turtle that had come to lay eggs on the sea shore of Madhavpur. Madhavpur is an import turtle breeding and conservation centre.While the incident happened some eight km from the actual beach, wildlife experts and forest department officials said chances are strong that the lions could come well close to Porbandar.Interestingly, forest officials said that the lion crossed the coastal Mangrol town to reach this beach. The lion was sighted somewhere between Madhavpur and Antroli in reserve forest area.Talking to TOI, deputy conservator of forest, Porbandar, DJ Pandya said, “A pride of lions has made a permanent home along Mangrol and Veraval coast. We believe that this lion has came here after crossing the urban habitation in Mangrol town. It has likely walked nearly 25 km to reach this spot.”Priyvrat Gadhvi, a member of state wildlife board, said, “This is the fall-out of expanding lion population. In the last five years, increasing number of lions are venturing near human habitations. First it was only farms, but now they have also started crossing town.”“It’s only a matter of time that lions may soon identify dogs are their potential prey,” he added.According to experts, lions might be exploring a new territory or merely searching for prey.Chief conservator of forest (wildlife circle) DT Vasavada said, “This is the second time in the last six months that lions have ventured in this area. We are tracking their movement and activity to ascertain if the pride wants to make this a new habitat.”The Madhavpur beach, 60 km from Porbandar, is extremely popular among tourists, mainly because of its mythological importance. It’s believed that Lord Krishna married Rukmani here. The local Mer community members also organize a fair every year to celebrate this marriage.",rajkot,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73914663,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132683,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lion-scare-on-beach-near-porbandar/articleshow/73914665.cms

BENGALURU: Chinese smartphone player OnePlus has emerged as the leader in the overall premium smartphone category (handsets of over Rs 30,000), taking over the market dominated by US major Apple and Korea’s Samsung for the last two years. OnePlus had 33% market share in 2019, while Samsung trailed with 26% and Apple with 25%, according to data from Counterpoint Research.Chinese smartphone marker Xiaomi (28% share), along with three brands owned by BBK Electronics — Vivo, Realme and Oppo (combined share of 35%) — already rule the overall smartphone market as they focus on the Budget segment competing with the likes of Samsung (21%). OnePlus is also part of BBK Electronics, which lets its brands operate independently with separate teams.“Given that a large share of the consumer segment in India still remains heavily offline based, we are working towards extending OnePlus’ unique premium brand experience to retail customers through OnePlus Experience Centers, which have played a crucial role in the brand’s growth,” OnePlus founder Pete Lau told TOI. The company plans to expand the total number of OnePlus stores from 30 to 100 by end of the year, as it looks at the offline segment to drive further growth. It also has a presence in another 2,000 stores through retail partners.While India’s overall smartphone market has seen its growth slow from 10% in 2018 to 7% in 2019, the premium smartphone segment is growing faster. While the ultra-premium segment, smartphones over Rs 45,000, grew at a record pace of 63% partly because of increasing iPhone shipments the premium segment also saw a 29% growth. This comes at a time when India has emerged as the second-largest smartphone market in the world, next to China. It overtook the US in 2019. At around 158 million smartphone units shipped in 2019, India beat US’ shipments of 153 million by a margin of 5 million even as China is experiencing declined in shipments, according to Counterpoint.OnePlus said that it shipped over 2 million smartphones in 2019 in India, helped by increasing new launches and entry in the ultra-premium segment. According to its India head Vikas Agarwal, 20% of the demand for its products came from users shifting from iPhones to Android OS. The country accounts for a third of the revenues for the brand, which has also made India an R&D hub, which it plans to scale up from 250 employees to 1,000 in the next 2-3 years.“Apart from being the largest market for OnePlus, India also has the most vocal user-base. India has always exceeded expectations and we have undertaken several India-first initiatives,” added Lau, pointing to OnePlus TV and operating system features.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73928862,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oneplus-leads-in-premium-segment/articleshow/73916131.cms

RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

PATNA: Politics of Bihar has virtually shifted to Delhi where JD(U) is contesting two seats while RJD is in the fray in 4 out of the 70 assembly constituencies going to the polls on February 8.

CM Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav are camping in Delhi. HAM(S) and LJP are also testing electoral waters there.

JD(U), which is contesting with BJP and LJP, has fielded Shailendra Kumar from Burari and Dr SCL Gupta from Sangam Vihar. RJD is also in the fray from Burari besides Kirari, Uttam Nagar and Palam in alliance with the Congress. LJP is contesting from Seemapuri reserved seat where it has fielded Santlal Chawaria.

JD(U)’s Shailendra Kumar, from Sampatchak in Patna district, is pitted against AAP’s sitting MLA Sanjeev Jha, a native of Madhubani in Bihar, and RJD’s Pramod Tyagi, a local.

Gupta is fighting against Congress’s Poonam Azad, also a Bihari and wife of former BJP MP Kirti Jha Azad, and AAP’s sitting MLA Dinesh Mohaniya. Gupta was elected from Sangam Vihar in 2008 on a BJP ticket.

Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, along with LJP chief Chirag Paswan and BJP president JP Nadda (who is born and brought up in Patna) addressed a joint public meeting in Sangam Vihar on Sunday. Later in the evening, Nitish and Union home minister Amit Shah addressed a separate meeting in Burari.

Besides Nitish, more than half a dozen of his ministers are camping in Delhi to woo the voters of Bihar origin.

“Besides our ministers, majority of JD(U) MPs from Bihar and senior party functionary are campaigning in Burari and Sangam Vihar,” JD(U) national secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI over phone on Monday. He said JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi would campaign in Burari on Tuesday.

RJD’s Raghuvansh Prasad Singh on Monday campaigned in Burari, while Tejashwi held a roadshow in Palam on Sunday and is scheduled to hold an election rally in Burari.

KOLKATA: The special all-women patrol — Winners — that has played a pivotal role since 2018 in curbing crimes against women on Kolkata streets has arrested close to 400 people who harassed women. Following their example, two police divisions — the eastern suburban and south suburban — have now introduced special drives to combat such crimes at specific locations in the city. Police said, of all the arrests made by the Winners, 362 were related to making public spaces safe for women. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma shared a post on Twitter, congratulating the team over the weekend.

“Initially, we had asked two women cops to patrol the streets of Ultadanga . Both were in plain clothes with their male colleagues providing back up. The response was phenomenal and we extended drive to Narkeldanga, Beliaghata and Entally. Now this campaign will become a regular evening feature across important police stations in the eastern suburban division,” said DC (ESD) Ajoy Prasad.

Police sources said crimes against women tackled by the Winners have been varied. A few of the accused were trying to obtain the phone numbers of the women and persisting for links to their Facebook accounts when cops nabbed the accused. Several bikes were flagged down and checked. Some of the accused were arrested based on random checks at malls, offices and parks — areas which are seen as such criminals’ primary zone of operation. Police are investigating CCTV footage from these areas to develop a water-tight case against each of these accused.

Officers said initially, the Winners squad are concentrating on south and south suburban Kolkata, but they will soon expand their zones of operation with additional personnel joining the team. “We are expecting to efficiently use them across the city. The raids will be kept secret till the last moment and we will be scaling up operations as we head towards Valentine’s Day,” said an officer.

Commissioner Anuj Sharma had sent out a tweet last month asking citizens to report all incidents of women in distress by dialling 100. Cops said all efforts were being made to popularize the concept among Kolkatans and lately, #dial100 has been trending on Twitter.

Police have also asked all citizens to forward to the cops anything they find objectionable on the internet. “It is important that we stop trolling. It is harassment on the internet. Our social media team has been asked to respond to all complaints,” said an officer.

The test beds in New Town

KOLKATA: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), with the help of IIT Kharagpur , is setting up 12 test beds in New Town’s Patharghata area to test the quality of the compost that the NKDA authorities are producing by recycling organic waste. Officials and a research team inspected the spot last week.

Two composting machines — one at Street 45 near the market and another at the NKDA market in Action Area IC — process organic waste from the township. After processing, the brown, odourless substance is bagged for sale. However, authorities have noticed there are hardly any takers for the organic compost.

“The farmers seem to be hesitant to change their established practices of using conventional compost. They do not want to take a risk without carrying out any field trial. Only a few farmers have agreed to test a few bags of the organic compost to see if the product helped in plant growth,” said an official.

Each test bed will be 9m×9m. The entire process of analysing how well the compost helps in plant growth will take about three to four months.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said the Delhi assembly election is a clear contest between patriots under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and people who oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act and support Shaheen Bagh Speaking at a public meeting organised in support of Master Azad Singh, the Mundka BJP candidate and brother of former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma, Shah said, “Desh par jo ungli uthayega, usko munh tod jawaab Narendra Modi sarkar degi (Whoever points a finger at the nation, the Modi government will give a resounding answer to them).”“When people of Delhi go to vote, they should keep in mind that this election is between two ideologies. On one side are Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal , who do appeasement politics for vote bank and are with Shaheen Bagh. On the other, there is BJP under PM Modi, which is a group of patriots who want to ensure the development and security of Delhi and the country,” Shah added.Promising to remove Lal Dora and development in unauthorised colonies once voted to power, the BJP star campaigner said, “Modiji has a plan ready for these colonies. But we need to be in power in the state to make it a reality. In Delhi, people living in jhuggis will get two-room flats built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There will be paved roads, streetlights, proper drainage, gardens and libraries.

57,['4/02/2020'],Budget took care of Delhi's traders: PM Modi,"This story is from February 4, 2020

PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: In a bid to woo the traders and middle-class voters, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated a major part of his speech to the tax reforms undertaken by his government in the Union Budget .

The Budget will help the youth of the country, women, traders, middle and lower-middle class people and the poor. It will open new avenues of development and employment in the capital, the PM claimed. “Earlier, businesses with a turnover of Rs 1 crore had to be audited, but now no audit is required for all businesses with a turnover up to Rs 5 crore,” Modi said, adding that it was an example of the government’s trust in traders and entrepreneurs of the country, including those in Delhi.

The trading community in the capital, traditionally BJP supporters, holds immense sway and is an influential voting bloc. They are believed to be unhappy with the government post demonetisation and the hasty implementation of the GST has left many traders high and dry. The PM, in his rally , appeared to be healing the old wounds of the traders.

For the first time, the PM said, the IBC legislation has been passed to give entrepreneurs a dignified exit from businesses. “It has been BJP’s efforts to reduce problems of traders and enable them to carry out their work freely,” he said.

The Prime Minister assured the people that multiple provisions have been made in the Budget for tax holidays for startups and that middle-class taxpayers save money. He stated that the central government has also addressed previous complaints from the traders about tax authorities giving them a harrowing time. “Our government has started indirect tax settlement scheme, which has saved countless traders from legal cases,” Modi added.

58,['4/02/2020'],Patna Municipal Corporation strike: Roads strewn with garbage,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Heaps of garbage were seen on the roads as the daily wage sanitation workers of PMC went on strike on Monday

PATNA: Heaps of garbage were seen on the roads as the daily wage sanitation workers of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) went on strike on Monday.

The workers who even staged dharna at Maurya Lok Complex, neither went for door-to-door garbage collection nor did they sweep the roads on Monday. Hence, around 700 tonnes of the garbage produced daily in the state capital remained in the city roads and lanes. The garbage collected from the city households and shops is dumped at Ramchak Bairiya.

“I was waiting for the vehicle to come for garbage collection, but no one came in my locality today,” said Prabhakar Kumar of Sheikhpura. Same was the problem shared by Mehndi Nagar resident Tarannum Imam. “Every morning, a vehicle comes in my locality for collecting garbage from households. In fact, I am used to waking up to its music. But today neither the garbage was collected, nor our locality was swept,” she said.

Apart from household garbage, trash remained on the roads. Some of the demonstrators even threw garbage on the roads and made the situation even more pathetic. One of the passersby, Santosh Gupta, near Dak Bungalow crossing said, “After a long time, I am seeing such a pathetic situation in the state capital.”

Around 4,500 daily wage workers went on the strike against a letter issued by Urban Development and Housing Department to all the urban local bodies to stop availing their services from February 1 and, instead, rope in outsource agency. However, UDHD issued a fresh letter on Monday in which it extended the deadline for availing the service of daily wage workers till March 31. However, workers were in no mood to call off the strike even after the extension of the deadline.

Patna Nagar Nigam Staff Union president Chandra Prakash said the government was trying to make them fool by just extending the deadline of their service. He said, “PMC board had taken a decision to regularize those workers who have been working for over 10 years. In fact 112 of them have been regularized and 400 are in the process. Now, all of a sudden, they are saying to rope in private agency instead of taking the service of the daily wage workers. This decision will badly hit people belonging to Dalit and other extremely backward community.”

Another worker, Mani Paswan, said, “I have been working for PMC since 2007 and now all of a sudden the decision has been taken not to take our services. What will I do?”

UDHD, in the letter issued on January 28, stated that the Lokayukta, in the inquiry conducted in Darbhanga Municipal Corporation , found group D employees on daily wages as a perennial source of corruption. The municipal bodies not complying with its order were even asked to submit an explanation to the Lokayukta.

However, Patna mayor Sita Sahu expressed displeasure over the letter issued by UDHD. “I fully respect the decision taken by the Lokayukta, but I feel they were not given proper information. We will take up our side now,” said Sahu.

PATNA: Altogether three impersonators, including one in Patna, were caught during frisking on Day 1 of the Intermediate examinations on Monday. As many as 91 students were also expelled in 22 districts for using unfair means during the exams, which are conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB).

According to a statement issued by the BSEB, the maximum number of examinees (13) were expelled in Nalanda, followed by 12 in Arwal and nine in Gaya.

“Exams in both the sittings were conducted in a fair way amid tight security. Altogether 5,03,934 students of the science stream wrote the physics paper in the first sitting and 5,01,607 took the history exam in the second sitting. Besides, 569 students appeared for the BR Hindi examination on Monday,” the BSEB stated.

Similarly, the 70 marks’ paper contained 42 objective questions and the students had to solve 35 of them. The BSEB had also prepared 10 different sets of questions to avoid unfair practices.

BSEB chairman Anand Kishor visited some examination centres on Day 1 to inspect the ongoing process. He instructed the magistrates and invigilators on duty to ensure fair exams at all the centres. He also told them to punish those who are found using unfair means.

60,['4/02/2020'],"More cops, CCTVs to protect protest sites","This story is from February 4, 2020

Kolkata: Police on Monday decided to step up security in the anti-CAA protest zones, including Park Circus. An ACP-ranked officer, along with 40 cops in mufti during the day and 15 during the night, will be present at the sites with local cops. This will be in addition to CCTV surveillance and field intelligence inputs from the various venues.

A senior officer said, “We had been keeping watch on the situation. However, the back-to-back incidents in New Delhi have given us a reason to augment security further. The local police stations are constantly coordinating with the organizers. In addition to this, we will be increasing manpower and surveillance — both physical and technological.”

Those protesting the new citizenship law in Kolkata felt the best way to respond to the hate campaign against them was to reciprocate through love and sympathy. “If they fire bullets, we will retaliate with flowers,” said an organiser at one of the sit-ins a day after another attack at Jamia Millia in the Capital. On Sunday night, a youth on a two-wheeler allegedly fired bullets at students of Jamia Millia. A minister and several BJP functionaries in the Capital have been heard raising slogans which “instigate” people to “shoot the traitors”. Since January 29, there have been three attacks at Jamia Millia and Shaheen Bagh.

Organizers of the protests in Kolkata have appealed to those opposing the CAA and the National Register for Citizens (NRC) to not react to provocation, which may be a ploy to malign the movement, declare it as a violent one and give it a religious colour.

Asmat Jamil from the Park Circus Maidan said she was aware of the oppositions those protesting against CAA and NRC have to face. “I always knew it would not be easy. They will try to scare us in every possible way, but we will not get scared. Whatever is happening in Delhi is unacceptable — bullets are being fired at unarmed people and the administration is just a mute spectator,” said Jamil.

Arshad Parvez Khan, one of the organizers at the sit-in at Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore, said the best way to respond to hatred is with love. “These people who are going around firing at protesters in Delhi have been brainwashed and radicalized against one section of the society. They need to be dealt with love and sympathy,” Khan said.

The organizers are also taking adequate security measures to prevent any untoward incident at the demonstration venues. “We are keeping tabs on people who are coming in big groups from other areas to join the protests. We have also requested the police to enhance security around the venue. Our volunteers, too, are very active,” said Jamil.

On Zakaria Street, volunteers have been taking videos of the area earmarked for “floating” protesters. “A portion of the place is cordoned off for the women. In other pockets, our volunteers are making videos at regular intervals to identify anybody engaged in any suspicious activity,” said an organizer.

61,['4/02/2020'],An academic’s menu on the Union Budget,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Chennai: Government of India’s own estimate of its income and expenditure called the Union Budget determines the future of many institutions and individuals. The annual budget’s number crunching exercise has many times seen quotes of Thiruvalluvar and this time Avvaiyar, Kalidasa and Dinanath Kaul.

The mix of numbers, themes, poetic verses and occasional humour make the budget a good economic recipe. The 2020 Budget has all the ingredients of a tasty recipe, now the ministries and institutions have to cook it the best way. A hot-and-sour appetizer, which intentionally comes after the main course, is the issue of exemptions.

Many analysts see the education plate as having only rice and dal (school and higher education), not realising that there is much more that makes it a gastronomic delight. Among the other servings are allocations to department of science and technology, department of biotechnology, department of scientific and industrial research, besides funds for skill development and entrepreneurship. These departments form the backbone for higher education research and the combined allocation to higher education with these departments take the total Budget allocation to `56,950 crore from the 2019’s revised estimate of `53,593 crores, an increase of 6.3% and not 4% as quoted by many.

New items on the menu include a special and much needed scholarship scheme for Jammu and Kashmir with an allocation of `225 crore. Some have been made sweeter or spicier — as the case may be — doubling allocation for Startup India initiatives in higher education institutions, internationalisation and study in India schemes. Other items on the menu are the regular ones with increases and decreases based on the appetites of the stakeholders involved.

Overall, the spread is full and filling. The budget’s trinocular themes are an ‘à la carte’ of sorts — an aspirational India, economic development and a caring society — throwing open a world of opportunities for educational institutions to choose from, based on their capacity and capability. They can work on a spectrum of schemes in collaboration with various agencies to achieve these objectives. With this rich spread, it is the institutions’ choice to starve or have a feast. The menu cannot be blamed at all. Besides these on the main course, exotic items for dessert — extended commercial borrowings and FDI shall be served only when ready and served to all. Till then, no comments. Buffet or à la carte, the recipe is fine.

Now to the hot-and-sour appetizer. Trusts, Societies or Section 8 companies running educational institutions carry exemptions under Sections 10(23C), 12AA and 80(G) and such exemptions are the appetizers for educational institutions without which none can survive. This is not only an appetizer for the educational menu but for all charitable activities irrespective of the cuisine. Budget 2020 amendments to Sections 12AB, 10(23C) and 80G enforcing renewal once in five years and terminating the mutual co-existence of 12AA & 10(23C) recognition are the dual concerns seeking remedial rethink.

The Supreme Court and many judicial authorities have rightly upheld the harmonious co-existence of registrations u/s 10(23C) and 12AA. The present amendment in the Finance Bill fails to understand the basic conception that an ""institution"" under Section 10(23C) can be part of a Trust/Society under Section 12AA and both can co-exist. The budget amendment denies exemption granted to an institution registered under Section 10(23C) since the larger Trust enjoys exemption u/s 12AA and the proposed insertions are against the basic tenets governing exemptions leading to avoidable chaos.

Second, it was only after careful consideration and through budget amendments between 2006 and 2009, 12AA registration was made permanent with a power to cancel if found violative. To go back to the historic ages of renewal once in five years will create unease as against the promise ease. At best, to eliminate dormant trusts, a unique registration number may be assigned online to existing and active Trusts and Societies on a self-submission or approval basis. When powers to cancel registration are abundantly manifest with income tax authorities, applying for renewal once in five years will lead to avoidable disarray. The exemptions under Sections 10(23C) and 12AA are germane to the philanthropic and charitable capital of India and provides the appetizing starter for the menu of public work that non-governmental organisations undertake.

The finance minister has been very considerate on the basis of trust to provide path-breaking reforms in company law. Trusts are also trustworthy and the same consideration is solicited to make the budget menu delicious from start to end.

Surat: Fire and emergency services department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) sealed over 100 shops in textile markets at Moti Begumwadi here on Monday. Ten shops are located in Riddhi Siddhi Market, 83 in Arihant Market and 10 in Manish Market at Moti Begumwadi in central zone of the city. These markets were surveyed for fire safety measures and notices issued to their owners. The shops won't be allowed to open unless their owners promise to adhere to fire safety norms, sources said.

The shopkeepers had been given a week’s time earlier to install proper fire safety systems under Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act.

Chief fire officer Basant Parikh said, “All these markets have shops in basement and a single staircase with no emergency exit. They don’t have any fire emergency plan either. The owners have made assurances again, but we have asked them to come up with proper planning by architects before they could be allowed to reopen their shops. There are many such markets and each one of them would be made accountable.”

Civic officials said there are at least 50 textile markets in this area and all have been issued notices for poor fire safety measures.

64,['4/02/2020'],PE/VC deals see a 13% y-o-y dip in Jan,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Chennai: PE & VC investors invested $1.97 billion across companies in January, down 13%, owing to VC funds exercising caution in early-stage deals and PE investors taking a break from infra deals, which dominated the scene in 2019. In January 2019, the investments were at $2.24 billion.

“Considering venture funds, there is a clear sign of cautiousness, while later stage deals — series C and higher — witness brisk activity. Indian investors are mirroring the cautious behaviour of their global counterparts, who started tightening purse strings once Softbank’s investee companies’ performance dipped. Only well-established models are attracting interest,” said Arun Natarajan, MD, Venture Intelligence.

He added that PE deals are seeing a dip because the fund houses who had pumped in record funds in 2019 on the infrastructure sector have given a brief pause. Notably, infra deals were absent from the list of top 5 investments.

Exits, on the other hand saw a rise in value, although down by number. During January 10 exits worth $821million were recorded, while last year saw 16 exits at $301 million. Top exits include some investments in Byjus at $200 million and Narayana Health at $39 million. The standout deals in the PE and VC space include Varde Partners and Goldmann Sachs putting in $567 million in RattanIndia Power, edtech platform Byjus raking in $200 million from Tiger Global and Zomato seeing $150 million from Alibaba. Among VC deals, InterviewBit and Mamaearth saw the highest at $20 million and $18 million respectively

Surat: A 20-year-old engineering student ended life by hanging himself in his hostel room on Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) campus on Udhna Magdalla Road here on Monday. The student in his suicide note said he was fed up of life. Dipak Boricha was a third year engineering student at Bhagvan Mahavir College. He had been securing first class in engineering studies and the exact reason why he committed suicide is still not known, police said.

He was not answering phone calls of a friend after which the latter went to check on him in his hostel room at Samras Hostel because midterm examinations are on in the university. Boricha’s friend informed hostel officials when he did not open the door. The hostel officials broke open the door at around 10.30am and found him hanging from the ceiling fan with a bed sheet. He had written 7.40am atop his suicide note. Police suspect that he may have committed suicide after that.

Boricha’s brother Yogesh, a bachelor’s of commerce student, lives in the same hostel. He told police that he was not aware why his brother was upset. “They had dinner together in the hostel last night after which they went to their respective rooms. Dipak expressed his love for family and friends in the suicide note, but didn’t mention the reason why he was ending his life,” said a police officer at Umra police station.

“The hostel staff was informed by a friend of Dipak that he was not opening the door. Our staff broke open the door of his room and found him hanging,” said an officer of hostel administration.

Dipak was a native of Bhavnagar. His family members are expected to reach the city by late night. “We have not found any reason behind his suicide. There was no pressure on him because he was good in studies. He neither had an affair and nor was facing any financial crisis,” police said.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das (Photo:: Reuters)

MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das ’s moves to regulate non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) without hand-outs has won him the title of Asia-Pacific’s central banker of the year .

The award has been instituted by a publication — The Banker — to celebrate the officials that have best managed to stimulate growth and stabilise their economy. In a note, The Banker said the RBI has faced a series of challenges, from non-performing loans to issues around fraud.

“Faced with these challenges, Shaktikanta Das, governor of RBI, has taken steps to bring banking in India up to standard via a restrained approach to governance,” the statement said. It also acknowledged Das’s measures to tighten the rules around shadow banking, and bring lenders outside banking under greater scrutiny.

“Das has been outspoken on the lack of governance in banking, calling for tighter rules for the state-owned banks, which comprise 60% of India’s banking sector. To make the banking system more robust, the central bank is to set up a college for supervisors with the aim of improving supervisory skills,” the note said.

In the past, former governor Raghuram Rajan was felicitated as central banker of the year (global and Asia-Pacific) in 2016 for his role in weathering the risks arising out of US tightening in 2015.

The construction of levees during the TDP’s regime was incomplete and as a result, failed to control flood waters from inundating the areas.The government sanctioned funds to complete the works after requests from the Irrigation department and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC). YSRC Vijayawada east incharge Devineni Avinash, who oversaw the rally, said Jagan was keen on developing Vijayawada. Ministers Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and Botsa Satyanarayana attended the rally.“The TDP government ignored the welfare of Krishna Lanka. Floods in the monsoon season highlighted the need for retaining walls. Jagan listened to the problems of the locals and sanctioned a huge amount for their welfare,” Avinash said.Meanwhile, Telugu Desam slammed YSRC leaders and asked them to stop making false claims. Vijayawada East legislator Gadde Rama Mohana Rao said the project was given top priority during the TDP regime and a major portion of the works was completed. “YSRC leaders deceived the public by hiding facts. The project proposed during YS Rajasekhar Reddy ’s regime was ignored by the Congress-led state government. It is Chandrababu Naidu who prepared the revised estimates for the project and sanctioned Rs 135 crore under the first phase,” Gadde said.

PATNA: Bike-borne criminals shot dead the incharge of a customer service point (CSP) of SBI and looted Rs5.42 lakh from him near Bedwalia on Raipura-Marhaura road under Bheldi police station in Saran district on Monday. In another incident, Rs13.38 lakh was looted from the managing director of an LPG agency at Makhdumpur in Jehanabad district earlier in the day.

CSP incharge Krishna Rai was returning to his office at Bansdih village after withdrawing money from Garkha branch of the SBI on his motorbike. Saran SP Har Kishore Rai said Krsihna was a resident of Jahri Pakri under Amnaur police station in Saran district.

In Jehanabad, the incident took place around 10am when Gagan Bhushan Prasad, the managing director of Prasad Inden Gas Agency, was about to alight from his car on the Bank of India gate at Makhdumpur to deposit the cash. Four criminals on two motorbikes accosted Prasad and looted the bag containing cash at gunpoint. “They threatened me to shoot. I had no option but to hand over the bag,” Prasad, who is also associated with JD(U), told the senior police officers who reached the spot to inquire into the daylight robbery.

Prasad revealed that the cash was stocked in the office as the bank remained closed for three days due to the strike. The robbers also opened fire in the air to terrorize the local residents and shopkeepers when he raised an alarm after the incident, Prasad said, adding that the criminals escaped towards Tehta on the Gaya-Patna road.

SP Maneesh said a dedicated team of police officers has been formed to nab the criminals. He said there was no CCTV camera at the bank gate. Even the security guard of the bank didn’t intervene when the robbers opened fire, he added.

This is the third cash loot case under Makhdumpur police station area in the last one month. Earlier, a Bandhan Bank employee was robbed of Rs36,000 after being shot at near Paltu Bigha on Sagarpur-Makhdumpur road, followed by a loot of Rs65,000 from incharge of a customer service point (CSP) of a nationalized bank near Nandpura Bypass in January.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) on Monday unveiled the state’s annual credit plan (ACP) for 2020-21 financial year, pegging it at an ambitious Rs1.36 lakh crores for loan lending purposes in the eight priority sectors.

NABARD chief general manager (CGM) Amitabh Raj said the ACP for 2020-21 has been increased by over Rs7,000 crore, as it was Rs1.29 lakh crore in 2019-20. “It is hoped that the increase would help in doubling the farmers’ income by 2022 and also increase the state’s credit-deposit ratio from the existing 44% compared to the national average of 77%,” Raj said.

Of the eight priority sectors, Rs52,243.53 crore of loan is to be given in the areas of crop production, maintenance and marketing, while Rs17,851.66 crore has been fixed for term loan for agriculture and allied activities. Further, Rs5,587.27 crore would be given against agriculture infrastructure and Rs6,262.08 crore for ancillary activities.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi released the 2020-21 ACP for the state at a seminar at Gyan Bhavan. Finance department principal secretary S Sidharth, rural development department principal secretary Arvind Chaudhary, RBI regional director Dewesh Lal and SBI CGM Mahesh Goyal also spoke on the occasion.

Modi said the number of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) holders had been falling. Besides, the crop loan disbursed in 2015-16 was to the tune of Rs24,500 crore, when the number of KCC holders was 26.15 lakh. Loan disbursement has also come down to Rs19,445 crore.Lal also asked the bankers to sustain the SHGs, because they had emerged as major driver of local economic activities at the micro level.

Representative image

MARGAO: Fatorda police on Monday arrested Arjun Maruti Kajidoni, 30, a native of Karnataka, on charges of murdering two persons near the SGPDA market in Margao during the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

The deceased have been identified as Ravi, 20, a casual labourer, and Bhim, 30, a ragpicker, police said. Kajidoni worked as a driver and stayed at Madel in Fatorda.

Briefing reporters about the double murder , South Goa SP Arvind Gawas said that the two died following a scuffle with the accused over sharing of drinks.

“Bhim, Ravi and Sunil Sawant were drinking outside a bar near the SGPDA market late Sunday night. Well past midnight, Arjun came to the bar and on finding the shop closed, asked Bhim to share his drinks with him. When Bhim refused to do so, a scuffle ensued between the four,” Gawas said.

While Arjun hit Bhim’s head with a laterite stone, which apparently led to his instantaneous death, he hit Ravi and Sawant with empty liquor bottles. Ravi also died instantly, but Sawant was grievously injured.

Sawant lay there bleeding till Fatorda police reached the spot around 9 am on Monday after being informed by locals and shifted him to Hospicio in Margao. Sawant is out of danger, police said.

Gawas said that the needle of suspicion pointed to Kajidoni as he was minutely observing police movement at the crime scene from a distance. Constable Avinash Naik attached to the Curchorem police station picked him up for interrogation. Upon sustained questioning, he admitted to having killed the duo.

With the case cracked within 12 hours, IGP Jaspal Singh has announced a reward of Rs 25,000 to the investigating team led by DySP Serafino Dias, Gawas told reporters.

The day also marks completion of 20 years of Naveen Patnaik as chief minister of Odisha.

Though details of the programme are yet to be finalised, the regional party has decided to organize two mega rallies in the state.

While one rally will be held in Cuttack, where the ancestral house (Anand Bhawan) of the legendary leader is located, another rally is likely to be organised in the western Odisha (mostly likely in Bargarh), said official sources. Naveen would attend both rallies.

“The birth anniversary of Biju Patnaik will be celebrated across the state. Several important programmes are being planned and it would soon be finalised. Apart from March 5, there will be week-long programme to mark the occasion,” said BJD general secretary (headquarters) Sanjay Das Burma.

In power for the past 20 years, Naveen had assumed charge as chief minister of Odisha on March 5, 2000, three years after formation of BJD following the death of Biju Patnaik. With a robust organisational base, pro-people schemes and Naveen’s clean image, the party stormed to power for the fifth consecutive time in May last year.

Senior leaders of the party from various districts met here at the party headquarters to discuss plans to celebrate the day. As March 5 is also celebrated as Panchayati Raj day by the state government, several programmes are being planned. Das Burma said the women’s wing, youth and students wings of the regional party will be involved during the week-long celebration in all 33 organizational districts.

Workshops on the success and achievements of BJD government in the past two decades, particularly in poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, sports promotion and disaster preparedness would be organised.

Youth and student conclaves and meetings on various pro-people policies of the government would be organised during the week-long celebration, said BJD insiders.

BJD insiders said the seven-day programme would be a people-connect exercise to further consolidate the party’s base in the state.

Vijayawada: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) list declaring 7,000 people ineligible to receive pension is making the former beneficiaries run from pillar to post seeking answers.

At the special grievances redressal session conducted by civic authorities here, a number of people were seen waiting at ward secretariats to know the reason they were put on the list.

The state government introduced ward and village secretariat systems to take up door-to-door survey under Nava Sakam. Ward volunteers knocked on every door for data to prepare a preliminary list of beneficiaries of pensions, rice cards and other government schemes.

Around 7,000 pensioners in the city were declared ineligible and were asked to show documents to prove their eligibility to seek pension. Opposition parties in the city strongly condemned the move of the state government.

“The state government is deceiving the poor in the name of Nava Sakam survey. The government which introduced ward volunteers system to ease administration is now making senior citizens wait outside ward secretariats. Around 2,500 senior citizens and widows have been declared ineligible citing silly reasons,” said Gadde Ramamohana Rao, Vijayawada east TDP legislator.

A few pensioners were taken off the beneficiary list for using more than 200 units of power per month and some pensioners were removed for residing in ancestral property of more than 900 square feet, he said.

CPI city assistant secretary G Koteswara Rao demanded the the state government give one month’s time for the beneficiaries to respond to the objections raised by the government.

Krishna district in-charge minister Peddireddy Rama Chandra Reddy condemned the allegations made by the opposition. He said the TDP was trying to create unrest by spreading false news on pensioners.

However, authorities of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation said that they had raised objections on around 7000 pension beneficiaries in the city and issued around 8,000 new pensions in the city.

Solar panel on the rooftop of Maharaja’s College boys’ hostel

KOCHI: Educational institutions in the city are taking the green path with many colleges and schools, both government/aided and unaided, now working on rooftop solar projects to decrease the dependence on conventional sources of energy and reduce carbon footprint. Also, several institutions are planning to increase the capacity of their existing solar projects and aim to become fully solar-powered.

Among the latest developments, around 11 government educational institutions, including Maharaja’s College, will soon launch rooftop solar projects within two months as part of the solar project worth 1MW capacity in governmental buildings envisaged by Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) under the SmartCity project. Besides CSML’s project, rooftop solar panels are under construction at St Albert’s College and Rajagiri Public School. Sacred Heart College, Thevara, is also mooting plans and expects to be fully solar-powered by next academic year.

Under the CSML’s project, Maharaja’s College will have a 70kW solar project, of which solar panels with capacities 50kW and 20kW are installed on the rooftop of boys’ hostel and Britto building on the campus. Works are in final stage and the project is awaiting inspection by electrical inspectorate followed by commissioning.

“Maharaja’s College is the only college under the CSML project, which is expected to cut the electricity consumption of the college to nearly half of the current consumption. This will help the college save around Rs 65,000 monthly. Though the capacity could have been increased much higher than 70kW to fulfil the whole requirement of the college, lack of enough strong roofs in the old building and the green cover inside the campus was a challenge. But with two new buildings coming up, expansion of the capacity is possible in future,” said a college official.

The other educational institutions where installation works are proceeding under the project are GGHSS Panampilly Nagar (25kW), GGHSS Chittoor Road (30kW), GHSS Edakochi (25kW) and GHS Edakochi (20kW), Vennala GHS (40kW), Punnakkal GHS (40kW), Kunnumpuram GHS (20kW) and GHSS (20kW), Edappally GHSS (35kW). The works are in different stages and are expected to be commissioned within three months.

The existing solar project at Sacred Heart College fulfils nearly 20% of the college’s power requirements. “We were the first college in Ernakulam to initiate rooftop solar project in 2011. The present system has 33kW capacity and we are planning to be fully solar-powered in the next academic year. It will help us save around Rs 1.75 lakh per month. Many companies have conducted studies, and negotiations of final terms are on,” said college principal Fr Prashant Palakkappillil.

Rajagiri Public School principal Fr Varghese Kachappilly said that the installation works of solar panels in the school have been completed and are yet to be connected to KSEB’s power grid. “The project will cover 60% of the school’s power needs. It will be ready during the summer vacation,” he said.

While Sacred Heart CMI Public School, Thevara, and Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, already have existing solar rooftop projects, of which they are planning to increase the capacity in the coming years, Bharata Mata College, Thrikkakara, and ToC-H Public School, Vyttila, are fully solar-powered.

Ramesh Patwa (35) busy completing a painting in Siddharthnagar district jail

Gorakhpur: A jail inmate serving life imprisonment for killing his wife for dowry has added beautiful colours to the walls of Siddharthnagar district jail with his paintings.

Ramesh Patwa (35), a resident of Shohratgarh area in Sidsharth Nagar district killed his wife for dowry in 2011 and is serving life sentence in Siddharthnagar jail since 2013.

Jail superintendent Rakesh Singh said that Ramesh has changed a lot after he started painting. He also helps doctors in the jail as before coming to jail he was assistant to a private doctor and also did a course in pharmacy.

“We always encourage jail inmates to get involved in positive activities and there is no doubt that art has the power to change a person. After he started painting we noticed a huge change in Ramesh. He has become kind and compassionate and always helps doctors and patients. Subjects of his paintings vary from deities to nature and even portraits. Jail provides him colours and brush,” said Singh.

For Ramesh painting is his atonement of sins. He said that he learned painting from a jail inmate Feroz, a native of Basti district. In the jail Ramesh met Feroz who was given the responsibility of colouring walls of the jail. From Feroz, Ramesh learnt to hold brush and paint.

80,['4/02/2020'],Tourism dept to rejuvenate Akkulam lake at Rs 64 crore,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: A decade after a project worth Rs 17 crore to dredge Akkulam lake became a non-starter, even inviting a vigilance probe, the tourism department is set to launch a comprehensive rejuvenation plan for the lake. Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) has given approval for the project worth Rs 64.13 crore.

The project report was completed with technical assistance from Barton Hill Engineering College. The project aims at the revival of Akkulam lake and channels from Kannamoola.

The rejuvenation plan will be executed using eco-friendly technology and detailed project report was prepared by the Transitional Research and Professional Leadership Centre, Bartonhill Engineering College. The plan is to remove the trash and algae accumulated in the water body. The elevated areas near Akkulam lake will be converted into green islands and natural water cleansing mechanism will be implemented in such places.

The first phase aims at removal of unwanted aquatic plants, waste and removal of bund under Akkulam bridge. The works on deepening the boating channel will also be done as part of the first phase.

While new plans are being drawn for Akkulam lake, no questions had been asked regarding crores of rupees wasted on dredging till date. The earlier project, which was conceived in 2009 and launched in 2010, aimed at attaining a depth of 2.2m in Akkulam lake, below mean sea level. The quantity of earth to be dredged to attain this depth was fixed at 7.4 lakh cu.m. The project took off in 2010 and was set a deadline in 2011.

The quick verification report of vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB) and project documents had proved that the state government embarked on the Rs 17 crore worth project to dredge nearly 7 lakh cu.m silt from Akkulam lake without having any idea where and how to dispose the huge volume of matter being dredged. The quick verification report of VACB revealed that even the items in schedule of works pertaining to disposal of silt had been revised. Initially there was a plan to construct a bund using dredged material and form an island in Akkulam lake. However, this was changed to provision for having dumping yards. Six dump yards were determined only after framing the agreement.

Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran said that revival of Ulloor canal, Pattom canal and Medical College canal for a limited distance will also be implemented. The rest of the canal will be cleaned and revived under Smart City project. The minister said that boating will be resumed and adventure sports items will be introduced with a view to attracting visitors to Akkulam. Central government PSU Wapcos has been chosen as the special purpose vehicle for implementing the project.

Yavatmal: Anti-Corruption Bureau sleuths of Yavatmal and Amravati have in a joint operation on Monday caught deputy commissioner of social welfare department Jaya Vinod Raut (42), senior clerk in her office Nitin Kade, and their tout Savan Prakash Chaudhary (38) red-handed while accepting a bribe of Rs1.5 lakh from a complainant. The ACB sleuths arrested Jaya Raut and Savan Choudhary and seized the bribe amount.

Nitin Kade managed to escape.

The complainant is a teacher and needs caste verification certificate from the District Caste Verification Committee headed by Jaya Vinod Raut, who is a class I officer.

The accused duo demanded bribe of Rs2 lakh for issuing the caste verification certificate.

They named tout Savan Chaudhary as the person to whom the teacher should give the bribe amount. The complainant then lodged a complaint with ACB Amravati regarding the deal.

A trap was laid in the Yavatmal office of Jaya Raut, and the complainant sent with bribe of Rs1.5 lakh as advance.

ACB sleuths had put original currency notes of Rs15,000 and Rs1.35 lakh duplicate notes from a children’s board game, and the bundles were handed over to the tout Savan in the office of Jaya Raut on Monday.

The waiting ACB sleuths then sprang into action and seized the original and duplicate notes worth Rs1.5 lakh from Savan and arrested him. Savan confessed to having received the amount on behalf of Jaya Raut and Nitin Kade.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar campaigns in Delhi’s Wazirpur

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday attacked the Aam Aadmi Party dispensation in Delhi for concentrating on “false publicity and distributing freebies” to be in the limelight rather than then doing “real development”.

Blaming chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for “non-performance” on the development front in the past five years, Nitish asked the voters to give a chance to the BJP-led NDA to form a government in Delhi for overall development like Bihar.

“Making civic amenities free (electricity and water) will never lead to the development of the city. Real development comes with real improvement in infrastructure facilities. Looking at the condition of the city, it is hard to believe that this is the national capital,” Nitish said, while highlighting various projects taken up in Bihar since 2005. He added, “We were never worried about publicity of the projects because their success spoke for them.”

Addressing an election rally in Wazirpur for BJP candidate Mahendra Nagpal, Nitish compared the development works of his government with Delhi. Hundreds of people, mostly Poorvanchalis, had turned up in large numbers to attend the rally.

“AAP claimed that it worked a lot in the education sector by constructing a few hundreds schools. In comparison, we constructed 22,000 primary and 19,000 middle schools in Bihar, but never looked for publicity. After Class V, poverty-ridden people were not sending girls to school, so we introduced the poshak yojana. We wanted girls to study till Class IX, so we introduced cycle yojana,” said Nitish.

The Bihar CM said while Delhi government was only concentrating on electricity supply, Bihar had set a target for replacing all dangling and damaged wires in all cities and villages. “Delhi government is busy offering free electricity. These dangling old wires led to fires in factories and workers, who were natives of Bihar, lost their lives,” he added.

Nitish attacked Kejriwal for his controversial statement in which he had said that people came from Bihar with a railway ticket of Rs 500 and got free treatment in hospitals up to Rs 5 lakh. Agreeing with MoS (home affairs) Nityanand Rai, Nitish blamed Kejriwal for not providing permits to Bihar State Road Transport Corporation for plying buses up to Delhi.

GUNTUR: Prices of the famed Guntur and Teja varieties of chilli has dropped by nearly 50% at the Guntur market yard, the biggest chilli marketplace in the country. The sharp fall has largely been triggered by the coronavirus outbreak in China, one of the largest importers of Indian chilli. The neighbouring country has suspended imports since the virus outbreak, leaving chilli farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh worried.The prices have dipped to between Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in recent days. The chillis, known for their high heat quotient, were commanding a price of between Rs 9,000 and Rs 12,000 till a fortnight ago.In fact, prices of the Teja variety touched between Rs 16,000 and Rs 20,000 per quintal in December, thanks to demand from China and Bangladesh. Bangladesh exports this chilli to China after purchasing the stock from India.The fall of Teja price has affected prices of other low-quality varieties as well. While Rs 8,000 per quintal is considered remunerative for growers, it was hovering between Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000 per quintal for ordinary varieties.The Teja variety is considered the highest quality stock and commands high price chiefly in China. Interestingly, Teja stock which comes with very high pungency, is not a favourite stock for many other importers as they prefer varieties that sting the palate a little less.“We are closely monitoring the situation. It looks like a temporary halt. We will take appropriate measures to bail out the farmers if prices go down further,” agriculture market committee chairman C Yesuranthnam told TOI.“China uses the Teja variety to make many products which are then exported,” chilli exporter P Suresh Reddy told TOI. He added that traders involved in international businesses have urged merchants in Guntur agriculture yard to go slow on purchase following restriction on exports.

86,['4/02/2020'],Evicted Nilgiris farmers want to put up shops again in R S Puram market,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Coimbatore: As many as 23 farmers from the Nilgiris district who were evicted from R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai on Monday came to the district collectorate and urged collector K Rajamani to allow them to put up their shops in the market again. While the collector asked the deputy director in charge of agricultural marketing to investigate into the matter, he also directed the officer to ensure that Coimbatore farmers be given priority over farmers from other districts.

The farmers, who displayed identity cards stating that they are members of the RS Puram Uzhavar Sandhai, said they had been setting up shop in the market between nine years and 20 years.

“Some farmers have started selling in the market when it was started 20 years ago. We mostly sell vegetables produced from our family farms. Once we run out of stock, we buy vegetables from neighbouring farmers and sell them,” Sivanandham Bhojan, one of the farmers, said. “As per the rules, we only sell a maximum of three vegetables each. For example, I sell only carrot and beans,” he added.

On Monday, the farmers brought fresh vegetables and began setting up shops when they were suddenly evicted by agriculture officers and police, they said.

Another complaintant said earlier, shop allotments were done by a lot system. Slowly agriculture officers began allotting ‘permanent shop’ to six or seven id card holders and allowed them to sell any number of vegetables.

“When we questioned about this, the authorities evicted us,” Bhojan said, adding, “We now want to be reinstated in the market or to get back our vegetables that we left in the market.”

While the farmers were upset that the collector questioned what Nilgiris farmers were doing the market, Rajamani, however, said priority should be given to local farmers. “I don’t deny that Nilgiris farmers were brought and placed in the Uzhavar Sandhai 20 years ago, when the concept was still new, to ensure adequate supply to the local people.

However, they are forming a lobby in uzhavar sandhais in the district now and are not allowing local farmers to set up shops,” he said.

Besides, none of the complainants are pure farmers as they sometimes act as traders when they buy produce from other farmers. “I am clear that only farmers should be given priority. Traders should either not be allowed or only considered as the last preference,” he said.

However, I have asked the agriculture marketing officer to investigate into all the issues and give me a report within a fortnight, he added.

Thiruvananthapuram: The construction work of Kazhakkoottam flyover has gathered momentum following the traffic diversion in the Kazhakkoottam Junction–CSI Mission Hospital stretch from February 1. Though the traffic curbs affected free movement of vehicles in the initial days, motorists said that the situation has improved now.

Though National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has made significant progress in works along the Kazhakkoottam-Technopark stretch of the flyover, it had to wait till traffic diversion came into effect to start piling works in the Kazhakkoottam-CSI Mission Hospital stretch. Still, unexpected hurdles have cropped up.

Sources in NHAI said that the presence of a temple on the road side is affecting the work. “The authorities of the nearby Shasta temple have approached high court and secured an interim stay against land acquisition in the area. As per our understanding, the temple is located on government land and thus they are not eligible for compensation. However, we have informed that court that compensation could be given if they could prove ownership,” said NHAI sources.

Meanwhile, traffic diversion is expected to be in place for six months.

Kazhakkoottam assistant commissioner Anil Kumar said that there are no major traffic issues due to the diversion. Vehicles, which arrive in three lanes, have to proceed in one lane from the area where traffic is diverted. That is causing some delay during rush hours,” he said.

Rajeev Krishnan, executive member of Pratidhwani, a socio-cultural organization of employees of companies based in Technopark, said that traffic diversion was an issue only on January 31, when trial run was conducted. “The motorists were caught in the traffic for two-three hours on the day of the trial run. After that, the situation has improved. There is no major traffic issue in the area now,” he said.

Anil Kumar said that the situation will further improve once the work of the service road in the area is completed. However, sources in NHAI said that construction of service road would take some time as they are yet to shift the utilities. “Utilities such as water pipelines, KSEB posts and telecom cables have to be shifted before construction of service road in the area,” said sources.

Once launched, the crèche would be the first of its kind in any government establishment in the state. “At least 70 women work in the state police headquarters in different sections. We plan to start the crèche for their benefit soon,” DGP Abhay said.

IGP (modernization and provisioning) Rekha Lohani said the crèche would start functioning in the next few weeks. “Work on it is under way. We will engage one or two women home guards to take care of the children who will be placed in the crèche by their mothers. The crèche will have all facilities for children,” Lohani said.

Employees welcomed the announcement and said it would take a load off their mind. “We (working mothers with small children) are often stressed as we always think of how our children are faring. A crèche at the workplace will help us balance our work and childcare,” an employee said.

At present, some police stations and district police offices, including in Gajapati and Keonjhar, have child-friendly rooms for women employees and visitors.

“Our district police office and two police stations — Paralakhemundi and Garabandh — have facilities for children,” Gajapati SP Sarah Sharma said.

In October last year, the state human rights commission had expressed displeasure at the state government for not providing crèche facilities in its offices in Bhubaneswar and the districts. According to the the national minimum guidelines of the ministry of women and child development, every establishment with 50 or more women employees should have crèche under the Maternity Benefit Amendment Act, 2017.

The state women and child development and Mission Shakti department said efforts were on to provide crèche facilities in the secretariat and big government establishments in Bhubaneswar and across the districts.

“We have written to all government offices to start crèche services at the earliest,” department secretary Anu Garg said.

GUNTUR: Prices of the famed Guntur and Teja varieties of chilli has dropped by nearly 50% at the Guntur market yard, the biggest chilli marketplace in the country. The sharp fall has largely been triggered by the coronavirus outbreak in China, one of the largest importers of Indian chilli. The neighbouring country has suspended imports since the virus outbreak, leaving chilli farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh worried.The prices have dipped to between Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in recent days. The chillis, known for their high heat quotient, were commanding a price of between Rs 9,000 and Rs 12,000 till a fortnight ago.In fact, prices of the Teja variety touched between Rs 16,000 and Rs 20,000 per quintal in December, thanks to demand from China and Bangladesh. Bangladesh exports this chilli to China after purchasing the stock from India.The fall of Teja price has affected prices of other low-quality varieties as well. While Rs 8,000 per quintal is considered remunerative for growers, it was hovering between Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000 per quintal for ordinary varieties.The Teja variety is considered the highest quality stock and commands high price chiefly in China. Interestingly, Teja stock which comes with very high pungency, is not a favourite stock for many other importers as they prefer varieties that sting the palate a little less.“We are closely monitoring the situation. It looks like a temporary halt. We will take appropriate measures to bail out the farmers if prices go down further,” agriculture market committee chairman C Yesuranthnam told TOI.“China uses the Teja variety to make many products which are then exported,” chilli exporter P Suresh Reddy told TOI. He added that traders involved in international businesses have urged merchants in Guntur agriculture yard to go slow on purchase following restriction on exports. Sources said that many Indian companies handle exports to China via Bangladesh due to ease of doing business and low taxation.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73921103,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185339,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/coronavirus-scare-hits-chilli-exports-from-ap-t-to-china/articleshow/73914949.cms

KOZHIKODE: Kerala’s water bodies which have been heavily contaminated due to dumping of various kinds of waste were cleansed during the flooding events which hit the state in 2018. It had a positive effect on the surface water quality in the water bodies, says a study conducted by the researchers of Kochi-headquartered Central marine fisheries research institute ( CMFRI ).

The devastating floods led to increased freshwater flow into the estuaries. The surface waters were sampled from ecosystems, viz. lower end of estuaries, intertidal waters of beaches, mudbank region and inshore waters, from some districts in the state.

“We conducted the water quality assessment during August-September 2018 in a few selected coastal marine ecosystems viz. lower end of estuaries, intertidal waters of beaches, mudbank region and inshore waters from Malappuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Kollam,” said D Prema, principal scientist, fishery environment management division (FEMD), CMFRI.

The surface waters were sampled to analyze selected water quality indicators using standard protocols and analytical methods.

The results revealed that, in comparison to the pre-flood period, there was increased content of nutrients, especially the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the Vembanad and Ashtamudi lakes. The major share of DIN was from the content of total ammoniacal nitrogen. Total suspended solids (TSS) was higher in Ashtamudi but not so in Vembanad lake. In both the lakes, the chlorophyll content was higher compared to the pre-flood period.

Similar trends were seen for nutrients and chlorophyll in the samples collected from the intertidal waters. The mudbank region showed increased nutrients, chlorophyll and TSS. The nearshore regions off Kochi and off Neendakara also showed increased nutrients, chlorophyll and TSS.

Prema said that the study clearly indicated that the ecology of the estuary and coastal waters is impacted by floods which can affect the fishery resources and community strictures of these habitats. The researchers compared the findings with the existing data on water quality.

“This should indicate that there would have been changes in the biodiversity of the systems. Such increase in nutrients could have helped the phytoplanktons which are food for the organic life in the water bodies, including fishes,” Prema added.

VHP president Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje talks to mediapersons on Magh Mela ground on Monday

Allahabad: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) president Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje said on Monday that since the organisation’s top agenda of constructing Ram temple in Ayodhya has almost been achieved, it will now focus on bringing ‘samrasta’ (harmony) among Hindu communities by eradicating caste system to ensure unity among all Hindus.

Briefing reporters about the three-day Samajik Samrasta meet held at the ongoing Magh Mela, Kokje said, “Since our prime motto of construction of Lord Ram’s temple is over, we will launch samrasta campaign on a war footing across the country and will focus on new generation for eradicating caste system and bringing unity among all Hindus. We will include religious discourses (sat-sang) and stress on restoring the old glory of our culture, and will provide all kind of assistance to deprived.”

“Just holding ‘sah bhoj’ (community feast) would not bring samrasta. There is need of constructive measures to eradicate caste system,” he added.

“Ram temple had always been top priority of VHP and now since the court has ordered construction of temple in Ayodhya, we are now focusing on samrasta among Hindus. Efforts are being made since ages to break unity and we need to check such elements,” said Kokje.

“There is no conflict on the temple’s model, but hope that the trust formed by government also considers VHP model. Around 60% of stone carving for a two-storyed temple is already done and VHP model has become popular. We will give suggestions if the trust asks,” he added.

Kokje, however, demanded that only Ram bhakts (devotees) should be included in the trust.

Referring to the ongoing protests against the new citizenship law, he said, “It’s an attempt to disrupt the Union government’s functioning and many groups are behind it. Muslims are venting their frustration over recent developments like abrogating Articles 370, 35 A, banning triple talaq and court’s nod for Ram temple.”

Kokje, however, claimed “Today Muslim women are staging anti-CAA protests, the day is not far when these women would start a fight for their fundamental and moral rights which would be a befitting reply to those who have instigated them to join the agitation.”

Dehradun: The residents of Selaqui and Shishambara on Monday protested at the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) office. The protesters claimed that the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) is running the waste plant without a NOC from UEPPCB for the past five months. They demanded that the UEPPCB close down the waste plant and sue the DMC for violating norms.

“The waste plant has made the lives of locals miserable. It was just a matter of time before we started protesting at every government office involved in the waste management plant. Our protest was at the UEPPCB because the board had given a NOC to the municipal corporation which expired in August 2019 but the waste plant continued to operate anyway. UEPPCB officials are not giving any proper explanation as to why they let this happen,” said Satpal Dhaniya, one of the protestors at UEPPCB’s office.

“We have given them (UEPPCB) a memorandum, where me mentioned that 6,000 locals staying in the vicinity of the waste plant have suffered from dengue while 8,000 have respiratory problems. Also, 12,000 locals have been affected by skin-related issues. We have warned UEPPCB officials that if they do not renew the waste plant’s NOC, we will protest on a large scale,” added Dhaniya.

UEPPCB officials confirmed to TOI that they had received the memorandum but declined to comment any further on the issue. It has been more than four months that locals have been protesting for Shishambara Waste Management Plant to be shifted.

Kochi: The state-level monitoring committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has criticized Maradu municipality secretary for failure to implement direction of the committee regarding debris removal at the four sites in Maradu.

SLMC chairman A V Ramakrishna Pillai, who visited the sites on Monday, noticed that there were no sprinklers, surveillance cameras and barriers set up at the sites. Using sprinklers, installing CCTV cameras and barriers are mandatory under Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules 2016. SLMC warned the municipality that failure to implement the directions will invite huge fines.

The chairman rapped the workers at Golden Kayaloram site for retrieving steel without sprinkling water on concrete slabs. “We had instructed them to implement certain rules during debris removal at the four sites. But nothing has been implemented so far. So, we have asked the pollution control board to monitor the implementation of directions and submit report to the SLMC every week. Using motor pumps will not solve the problem arising out of dust. If they use sprinklers, it will evenly distribute water on the debris and settle dust,” Pillai said.

A PCB official said the board had sent letters to the municipality several times directing to implement the C and D rules at the four sites. But it said it has neither received any reply from the local body nor from the debris removal agency. PCB will install air ambient quality monitoring station near the four sites on Tuesday to ensue air and sound pollution is within the limits. From Wednesday, daily monitoring would start.

Meanwhile, Prompt Enterprises, the debris removal agency, has been asked to submit waste management plan and details of land where they plan to store the debris.

Agra: Following the lackadaisical approach of the irrigation department officials, boundary wall of Chambal canal in Pinahat block broke for the third time in past three months.

A major crack in the boundary wall of the unlined canal has caused water-logging in over 25 acres of farmland which has damaged wheat and mustard crop. At least 12 farmers claimed to have suffered crop loss. They are demanding compensation from the district administration.

Last month, boundary wall of Chambal canal had broken in village Rajora of Pinahat block. After the farmers complained, the irrigation department made a temporary arrangement to stop the flow of water into the fields.

On Monday morning, 25 acres of fields submerged in water after boundary wall of the canal broke again on Sunday morning. Even after the complaints of traders, irrigation department officials didn’t come forward to help. Local resident Vijay Singh said, “We had informed the irrigation department officials about the damaged canal and the water flowing into the fields. At least 12 farmers have lost their wheat and mustard crop. We will urge the district administration to provide us with compensation for the crop loss.”

Farmer Hariom said, “The irrigation department hardly does any repair and maintenance work on the canal. The canal broke thrice in the past three months. The irrigation department makes temporary arrangements but this time, we want a permanent solution to this problem.”

Executive engineer of the irrigation department Sharad Saurav Giri said, “Our team has started repairing the damaged part of Chambal canal. It will be completed by Tuesday. Required arrangements will be made to ensure the canal is not damaged again.”

Representative image

CUTTACK: The Orissa high court on Monday indicated that tabling of the Justice C R Pal Commission report in the assembly was not mandatory under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, and that it was up to the state government to decide if it wanted to do so.

The Justice C R Pal Commission was appointed on March 11, 2008, to study and report on the appropriateness of setting up high court benches in other parts of the state. It submitted its report on March 31, 2014.

On January 14, a high court lawyer, Shivsankar Mohanty, filed a petition requesting the court to direct the government to place the report in the assembly. Acting on this, the court on January 20 asked the state counsel to take instructions from the government on whether it (the government) had the power to not place a judicial commission report before the assembly.

When the petition came up on Monday, Mohanty cited a Supreme Court judgment that had ruled that Section 3 (4) of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, made it mandatory for the government to place a judicial commission report in the assembly within six months of the commission submitting it to the government.

However, the division bench of acting chief justice Sanju Panda and justice S K Sahoo said a couple of judgments by different high courts had held that placing of a judicial commission report in the assembly was not mandatory for the state government under Section 3 (4) of the same Act.

The bench adjourned hearing of the petition to February 10, while allowing Mohanty time till then to go through the cited high court judgments by then.

The PIL is significant as the Justice Pal Commission report on the feasibility of high court benches has been gathering dust for nearly six years. The government is yet to table it in the assembly in spite of growing clamour for high court benches in different parts of the state.

File photo of joggers jogging with their dog covered in warm clothes on Pashan Road

PUNE: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has for the first time since 1928 started issuing separate weather forecasts for Pashan and Lohegaon areas.

The IMD has been recording and maintaining temperature, rainfall, humidity and other key weather parameters measured at its Shivajingar, Lohegaon and Pashan stations since the past several years. The IMD’s headquarters, with records of all data, was shifted from Shimla to Pune in 1928.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune, said a five-day advance weather forecast was now being issued for Lohegaon and Pashan using weather information mainly gathered from its Shivajinagar weather observatory.

“Though there are minor variations in temperature values recorded at Shivajinagar, Pashan and Lohegaon (Pashan is cooler from time to time, while Lohegaon is slightly warmer than Shivajinagar), the separate forecasts will ensure accuracy in the localized forecasting,” he told TOI.

These warnings (issued at least 24 hours in advance and are updated from time to time) will help the local administration take measures and plan activities to deal with a weather-related adverse incident.

Weather forecasts through SMSs and WhatsApp from the IMD would also be available soon for these areas, in addition to its display on its website, an official said.

The IMD currently issues such weather warnings, or now updates, for 380 cities or towns in the country.

Kashyapi said the IMD has now started taking round-the-clock weather observations for Lohegaon and Pashan as well. “Earlier, round-the-clock observations were only taken for Shivajinagar in Pune. As a result, the number of daily observations for Lohegaon and Pashan has also increased,” he said.

Last year, Pune had witnessed extreme weather (rainfall) events during the latter part of monsoon, when several areas in the city were flooded with intense and heavy rainfall for many days. It was thus felt that location-specific weather warnings would help citizens and authorities deal with such adverse events better. An official said separate weather forecasts for Pashan and Lohegaon, along with Shivajinagar, were now being issued under the advice of IMD DGM Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.

BJP members protesting at at Samvidhan Square on Monday

Nagpur: BJP activists led by former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule staged a protest at RBI Square against state finance minister Ajit Pawar’s move to reduce allocation to the Nagpur district planning committee ( DPC ) by Rs225 crore.

Addressing party workers, Bawankule said that if the allocation was reduced, it would severely impact the development of Nagpur District. “Every sector will be hit, including rural roads, water conservation, drinking water supply and special works of the gram panchayat,” he added.

The ex-minister demanded that Pawar increase the allocation by Rs100 crore to Rs850 crore. “The BJP government had doubled Nagpur DPC allocation in five years and this government is reducing it. I have sent a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urging him to not take this decision,” said Bawankule.

City BJP president Pravin Datke, district president Arvind Gajbhiye, MLC Anil Sole, former MLA Sudhakar Deshmukh, MLC Girish Vyas, MLA Sameer Meghe, MLA Vikas Kumbhare, MLA Mohan Mate, former MLAs Milind Mane, Sudhir Parwe, DM Reddy and Sudhakar Kohale and others were present in the protest.

Pawar’s decision has given BJP a stick to beat the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP. Its leaders were demoralized after the loss in the Nagpur zilla parishad (ZP) election but now have got an important issue to attack the government. They point out that the three cabinet ministers of the district — Anil Deshmukh, Nitin Raut and Sunil Kedar — could not prevent the cut in the allocation.

Pawar’s decision makes no political sense. The ZP is now controlled by Congress and NCP. The cut in funds will create problems for the leaders of these parties.

CPM also criticized the claims that the budget focusses on agriculture sector. “There are new projects to revive agriculture and industries sectors. There is a proposal to reduce subsidy for fertilizers,” said the statement.

The budget also ignores Kerala’s long standing development needs in railways and health sector and has taken a stand against cooperative sector, said CPM.

Yogi Adityanath

NEW DELHI: Upping the ante manifold against AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal , UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Monday called him “a toy in the hands of anti-India anti-social elements”. He also blamed “Kejriwal and company” for trying to delay the hanging of the Nirbhaya case convicts and playing politics over the “honour of daughters and sisters”.

Yogi said that UP has much better roads than Delhi, whose infrastructure development has been obstructed by Kejriwal. He also alleged that Kejriwal was sympathising with people who work against India and raise anti-India slogans like “Afzal hum sharminda hain, tere katil zinda hain” and those who attacked soldiers in Pulwama.

“Kejriwal sympathises with people who chant Bharat tere tukde honge. You are not sharminda (ashamed) when you deprive the people of Delhi of basic amenities. Our jawans entered Pakistan to carry out a strike and this man asked for proof,” Yogi said.

A large part of Yogi’s day on Monday was spent canvassing in west Delhi. In the evening, he visited Yogmaya temple before addressing a gathering at Gorakhnath temple in Mehrauli. He said the country would have never got subjugated if it had identified “poisonous snakes” that keep inserting poison in the country’s arteries. “These traitors have divided the country on various grounds like caste, language and creed,” he added.

Remarking that the Shaheen Bagh protest was illegal and people sitting there didn’t know why they were sitting there, Yogi said, “Azadi slogans are being raised in Shaheen Bagh. This is the same JNU-wali azadi, Kashmir-wali azadi. Kejriwal is supplying biryani and doing all the work that is against the country. The real intention behind Shaheen Bagh is to prevent India from becoming prosperous and powerful.”

Pakistan yet again featured in the UP CM’s speeches during which he alleged that there was a nexus between the neighbouring country and Kejriwal. “When Article 370 was removed, Kejriwal spoke the same language as Imran Khan. Now that elections are happening, a Pakistani minister is issuing fatwas in Kejriwal support,” he said, pointing towards a tweet by Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhary.

“Kejriwal does not trust the people of Delhi, that’s why statements are being issued by Pakistan. Is Pakistan our well-wisher? Will Pakistan decide whom we will vote for? Should we do any work that pleases Pakistan? Will Pakistan be happy with the progress of India?” asked Yogi.

Meanwhile, AAP MP Sanjay Singh on Monday met the deputy election commissioner alleging that BJP was trying to vitiate the environment before elections. Yogi’s statements were also submitted to the poll body. “The EC assured us that they will take action,” he said.

Representative image

CUTTACK: The Orissa high court on Monday indicated that tabling of the Justice C R Pal Commission report in the assembly was not mandatory under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, and that it was up to the state government to decide if it wanted to do so.

The Justice C R Pal Commission was appointed on March 11, 2008, to study and report on the appropriateness of setting up high court benches in other parts of the state. It submitted its report on March 31, 2014.

On January 14, a high court lawyer, Shivsankar Mohanty, filed a petition requesting the court to direct the government to place the report in the assembly. Acting on this, the court on January 20 asked the state counsel to take instructions from the government on whether it (the government) had the power to not place a judicial commission report before the assembly.

When the petition came up on Monday, Mohanty cited a Supreme Court judgment that had ruled that Section 3 (4) of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, made it mandatory for the government to place a judicial commission report in the assembly within six months of the commission submitting it to the government.

However, the division bench of acting chief justice Sanju Panda and justice S K Sahoo said a couple of judgments by different high courts had held that placing of a judicial commission report in the assembly was not mandatory for the state government under Section 3 (4) of the same Act.

The bench adjourned hearing of the petition to February 10, while allowing Mohanty time till then to go through the cited high court judgments by then.

The PIL is significant as the Justice Pal Commission report on the feasibility of high court benches has been gathering dust for nearly six years. The government is yet to table it in the assembly in spite of growing clamour for high court benches in different parts of the state.

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the police need no permission from the state government to register UAPA cases. It is the Centre which decides on handing over a case to national investigation agency ( NIA ) and the state government has nothing to do with this, he said.

In a reply given to MLA Parakkal Abdulla, in the assembly , the chief minister said that eight UAPA cases registered under the LDF rule have been taken over by NIA. “The Centre has the power to hand over the case to NIA if any offence come under the scheduled offence category of the NIA Act. For this the Centre need not consult the state government,” said the chief minister. The last such case taken over by NIA was against two students Allan Shuhaib and Twaha Fasal who were arrested by the state police in Kozhikode for allegedly distributing pro-Maoist pamphlets. The arrests were made soon after the gunning down of alleged Maoists by the Thunderbolt forces in Attapadi forests. The duo was charged with UAPA.

As per police statistics, 151 cases have been charged under UAPA since 2014. Initially, UAPA sections were slapped in a large number of cases but the government gave sanction to prosecute only a few of them. Investigations into many of the cases could not gather enough evidence to convince the review committee for retaining the UAPA charges against the accused.

CHANDRAPUR: Firebrand Hindutva Leader and president of Antarashtriya Hindu Parishad Pravin Togadiya on Monday launched a scathing attack on PM Narendra Modi-led Central government for its failure on economic front. Togadiya was in Chandrapur to take part in a programme.

He claimed country’s economy had collapsed and it was now on oxygen. More than 10 crore youths were unemployed, while additional six crore had lost their jobs. While half of the small scale industries had closed down, dollar had grown strong over rupee, he said.

Exports had come down and NPA of banks risen manifold, Togadiya said charging that PM Modi had not taken any concrete step to deal with these burning problems. He said Modi was not made prime minister to stage Howdy Modi show in the US but to provide employment to youths here. How would employment grow in country by staging Howdy Modi, he asked.

On Hindutva, Togadiya claimed that thanks to awakening among Hindus, it had become difficult for BJP to take their votes. That was the reason BJP lost elections in states like Haryana and Jharkhand, he alleged. On Shaheen Bagh, Togadiya claimed that the agitation had given an issue to BJP in the Delhi election. Muslims at Shaheen Bagh had awakened the Hindus and this was helping BJP gain votes. It looks like Muslims were marketing BJP through Shaheen Bagh, he said.

Speaking on ongoing protest against Citizenship law, he claimed that everybody had a right to state their stand in democracy. Some speak in favour, while others speak in opposition. However there should not be any violence, he emphasized.

Kochi: State police chief should issue a circular within one week directing police officers to take action against illegal flex boards , banners, and flags, the high court has directed.

The order was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran after hearing arguments on three petitions seeking action against the menace. The court’s direction came after noticing that local bodies are not able to implement the ban ordered by the court due to threats from political parties and influential persons.

Contention of the government that the state police chief does not have the power to issue such a circular was dismissed by the court. Responding to the court’s directive of January 15 that the state police chief need to issue a circular, government had informed the court that the circular was not issued as police does not have any jurisdiction or power to deal with the removal of unauthorized boards, banners, and flags. Such power is vested with the road safety commissioner, under Road Safety Authority Act of 2007, government had argued.

While disagreeing with this argument, the court cited the various legal provisions that makes it the duty of police to act against those who erect illegal flex boards, banners, and flags. The court said in the order, “I am, therefore, firmly of the opinion that… the State Police Chief must issue the circular as ordered therein within a period of one week from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.” When it issued the directive of January 15, the court was under the impression that the state police chief was aware of the statutory obligations on police, the latest order said.

It is without doubt that the provisions in Highway Protection Act, Kerala Police Act, Indian Penal Code, Kerala Municipality Act, and Kerala Panchayat Raj Act vests specific powers on police with regard to protection of streets and public places and to ensure that accidents and mishaps are averted, the court said.

Police have to maintain law and order and prevent danger as per Sections 42 and 120(c) of Police Act, the order said. Section 120(c) includes defacement of public spaces, covering of traffic signs or signboard, thus reducing its visibility or readability. Any board, banner or flag placed on public street, which is tied to a pedestrian handrail or road medians, so as to cause danger, need not only be removed by police but necessary prosecution needs to be launched against the entities or persons who have placed it illegally, the court’s order said.

The IPC provision on mischief (section 425) is wide enough to cover any action intended or causes damage to the public or any other person or property, the court said. If such mischief makes traveling unsafe, it is punishable with imprisonment up to five years as per Section 431, the court added. Sections 283, 290, and 291 of IPC also allow police to fine a person causing damage or injury to any other person in public way or public line of navigation, with subsequent offence punishable with imprisonment up to six months, the court noted.

Provisions in Municipality Act (section 550) and Panchayat Raj Act (section 252) require police officers to communicate commission of any offence under these Acts to the municipality or panchayat officials and to assist the officials in taking action, the order stated.

Thiruvananthapuram: Throwing to wind the uncommon camaraderie they exhibited during the initial days in the fight against Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), UDF and LDF locked horns in the assembly on the first day of discussion, on Monday, over the thanksgiving motion on the governor’s address.

The opposition questioned the integrity of the government in the fight against BJP and Sangh Parivar forces. They cited the government refusal to stand with the demand for calling back the governor as the basis for such an allegation. “We have no personal grudge against the governor. The protest against him is symbolic. Protest against the governor is the protest against the BJP government at the Centre and its policies,” IUML leader KNA Khader said. Vengara MLA also warned the House against simplifying CAA as a minority issue. “This is not something of a concern only to a single section. It’s not a problem faced by Muslims alone. It’s rather a political issue which, if it goes unchecked, would have its pernicious impact on a large section of people in the country,” Khader said.

CPM MLA S Sharma, who presented the thanksgiving motion, termed as “unfortunate” the opposition decision to withdraw from joint protests against CAA. “Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was the first among country’s chief ministers who spoke boldly against CAA, National Population Registry and National Registry of Citizens. The opposition should rise above parochial views and stand up with the state government for a joint resistance against the Union government’s actions and policies,” he said. CPI leader and Chadayamangalam MLA Mullakkara Ratnakaran, supporting the motion presented by Sharma, said the country was passing through an unusual state of affairs and only unusual comradeship among the secular forces could yank the country out from the danger it’s slipping into.

“We should not miss the point. Our target is not the governor, who stands affront with a piston without balls. Our target is the Modi-Shah duo who have taken a stance with a ready-to-fire Patton tank, behind foot soldiers,” Mullakkara said.

Poonjar MLA P C George, however, asked the LDF and UDF to put an end to the practice of organizing anti-CAA meetings across the state.

The discussion on thanksgiving motion over the governor’s address would continue on Tuesday.

Nainital: More than a year after the 20-m stretch of Nainital Mall Road collapsed in Naini Lake, the Public Works Department ( PWD ) has finally been asked to collaborate with the IIT Roorkee to come up with a solution.

On Monday, a team of district administration officials, PWD and the Nainital civic body inspected the road after which the PWD was asked to collaborate with IIT Roorkee, said a PWD official.

A press release by DM Savin Bansal said that PWD will submit a work plan of the project and further decision will be taken after that.

As reported by TOI earlier, the Mall Road had collapsed in August 2018, and the administration had put up some pillars and sandbags to prevent further damage and built a road over it as a temporary measure.

However, even after over a year, the retention wall on the stretch has not been built. Residents said that there is a constant fear that the road may collapse again.

113,['4/02/2020'],Builders still await clarity on September 20 circular,"This story is from February 4, 2020

PUNE: Many developers already in receipt of occupancy certificate are finding it difficult to register their properties in the state for the past five months for want of MahaRERA registration, in contravention of the provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.

As per the rules, projects with occupancy certificates (OC) are not required to register with Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). But, a revenue department circular of September 20, 2019, insists on registration of such projects with RERA before registering them with sub-registrar offices in the state.

Against this backdrop, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) has demanded the withdrawal of the revenue department’s circular to check confusion. “When the RERA rules state that any project having completion/occupation certificate before the registration of sale deed is exempted from RERA registration, the revenue department circular is uncalled for as it only creates more confusion,” state Credai president Rajiv Parikh said.

He said the developers’ body had held numerous meeting with the ministers and government officials for the last five months, requesting them to withdraw the circular. “We will meet revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat next week, seeking the withdrawal of the circular for the benefit of developers and citizens at large. Due to this confusing circular, developers across the state are severely affected,” he said, adding that the body had raised the issue with NCP chief Sharad Pawar too.

Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said he was expecting the details within a fortnight. “I have directed them and hopefully they will revert,’’ he said.

RERA & revenue department not on same page

Basically, the entire confusion and chaos boils down to two bodies — the RERA and the revenue department. While RERA officials have clarified that projects in receipt of OC do not require RERA registration, the revenue department officials insist on RERA registration, citing the last year circular of the erstwhile state government. “Unless the circular is withdrawn, our hands are tied,” a senior official of the registration department said.

As the real estate sector is still facing challenges, the prevailing confusion is counter-productive. “We went twice to the registration department with the builder for registration of our project, but had to return empty-handed,” a homebuyer said, whose project is in receipt of OC.

To iron out issues

A senior revenue department official said there were some technical issues that needed to be ironed out. “A joint meeting was held recently and the revenue minister has directed (all those concerned) to resolve the issue at the earliest,” he said.

If a builder or developer has readied the project with his/her own funds and is in receipt of the OC, does s/he still need to register under RERA? When asked about it, he said “We have sought clarification for on this too from the housing department, which will further send it to RERA.”

Residents protest against the CAA in Roshan Bagh on Monday

Allahabad: Four FIRs were registered against four persons from two communities for allegedly posting objectionable comments about religion and deities on social media, between January 31 and February 3, in Allahabad. The four have been charged under section 153 A (attacking religion, language etc of any particular group\community) and 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66 of Information Technology (IT) Act.

SSP (Allahabad) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “Police said with protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act already underway at New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and Allahabad’s Roshan Bagh, such posts could act as a trigger for untoward incidents. The cybercell is maintaining a close watch on photographs, posts and messages posted on social media. A 10-member team under the supervision of SP (crime) is using different software for monitoring developments.”

Police said the crime branch and cybercell have stepped up vigil and are monitoring social networking websites which might spark trouble.

The agitation against the new citizenship law at places like Shaheen Bagh, Roshan Bagh and at Lucknow’s Clock Tower have been garnering attention from across the country. Hundreds of women have managed to brave cold and police action to stand their ground at the protests.

“Police have already registered four FIRs with different police stations including Colonelganj under sections 153A and 295 of the IPC and section 66 of IT Act in the past four days,” he added.

“We would be looking for tangible information about the posts and updates made on social media through our informants. A strict warning has been issued to social media users asking them to refrain from posting objectionable comments,” the SSP said.

PUNE: Have you ever looked at your cellphone touchscreen and wondered how signals are transmitted by mere touch? A layer of indium tin oxide or silver nanowires underneath the touchscreen does the trick through electrical conduction.

Till now, India had almost zero footprint in the printed and flexible electronics but not anymore. The CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory has developed a technology for manufacturing precision silver nanowires at 1/12th of the cost it is currently available in the market.

Speaking about the technology, Shekhar Mande, director general, CSIR, who inaugurated the pilot plant for continuous flow manufacture of silver nanowires on CSIR-NCL campus on Friday, said, “With the help of this technology developed by a team led by senior scientist Amol A Kulkarni (from the chemical engineering and process development division), Indian industries will be able to manufacture electronic chemicals.”

The price of the silver nanowires of different sizes (20 nm to 100 nm diameter) varies from 250USD to 600USD per gram, while the ones manufactured by NCL costs $8 per gram.

“This technology development was carried out under the Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) initiative by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). We have been working on this for the past three years. The applications of this technology are huge -- from touch screen, conducting inks, thermal coatings, IR shielding sector (defence) etc,” said Kulkarni.

Stating that India was not doing well when it came to electronic chemicals, Kulkarni spoke about the need to enter the tightly controlled market. “There are a few companies which dominate the electronic chemicals market. For example, it is difficult for outsiders to penetrate the touch screen manufacturing business. We are trying to start from the basics and hope that the quality of our product, efficiency of the process along with a super attractive process economics will help our industries make headway in this field,” said Kulkarni.

117,['4/02/2020'],BPCL launches e-Drive initiative in Kochi,"This story is from February 4, 2020

BPCL team with the e-autorickshaw in Kochi on Monday

KOCHI: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( BPCL ), a Maharatna public sector company in the oil and gas sector, announced its entry into the electric vehicle (EV) space on Monday with the launch of its ‘ e-Drive ’ initiative in the city. ‘e-Drive’ is an innovative electric vehicle mobility model based on battery swapping, initially being rolled out in Kochi and Lucknow for the first time in the country.

In the model, launched in collaboration with IIT Madras for technological support and Kinetic Green as a mobility partner, around 20 taxi e-rickshaws, owned by Kinetic Green, will be deployed here. Drivers from the society formed by the drivers of Kochi Metro e-rickshaws will be driving these autorickshaws. BPCL, with support from IIT Madras, will provide smart lithium-ion batteries.

Drivers can approach the nearest BPCL retail outlets for exchanging their EVs’ discharged batteries with charged batteries. This helps drivers who are facing difficulties owing to the upfront cost of electric vehicles , vehicle’s range limitations and the time spent on charging of the vehicles. BPCL swapping stations are situated at its outlets at Edappally, Palarivattom and Kadavanthra and each battery has a mileage of 60km. More stations will be launched in future.

This model provides multifaceted benefits — the driver does not have to invest in buying a vehicle; inexpensive, clean and hassle free mode of transport is provided for the first and last mile connectivity to riders; and through battery swapping, the waiting time for vehicles to recharge is eliminated.

The project was launched by BPCL chairman and managing director D Rajkumar from Chennai through videoconference. Launching the initiative, Rajkumar said: “Electric vehicles would be having an increased share of the urban transportation canvass in the years to come. With in-depth studies on the challenges, and further taking cognizance of available technology, demand, government regulations and the overall direction of energy transition, BPCL has embarked upon a new and unique model for EV mobility, the first of its kind in the country, ahead of competition.”

119,['4/02/2020'],Maratha Light Infantry to observe 350th anniversary of Sinhagad battle,"This story is from February 4, 2020

The Tanhaji Malusare memorial at Sinhagad fort in Pune

PUNE: The Army’s Maratha Light Infantry (MLI) regiment will commemorate the 350th anniversary of the ‘Battle of Sinhagad’ through various programmes at their battalions across the country on Tuesday.

The battle was significant for the Maratha empire, which recaptured the then Kondana fort on February 4, 1670. Colonel Commandant Lt Gen PJS Pannu (retired) started celebrating the day as a ‘regimental day’ of the MLI from 2016.

Tanhaji Malusare, the military assistant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , fought like a mighty warrior and made supreme sacrifice in the battle. “The regiment adopted Sinhgarh the regimental marching tune dedicated to the gallant Maratha warriors who recaptured Kondana. With the regimental motto being duty, honour, courage -- the three tenets displayed in the battle by Tanhaji -- it stands as a testimony to the unparalleled courage and loyalty, which the MLI proudly upholds till date,” Pannu told TOI on Monday over the phone from New Delhi.

“The proud legacy of the Maratha empire is at the core of the MLI today,” Pannu added.

The commemorative programmes are being held under the current Colonel of the regiment Lt Gen Asit Mistri.

The fort was under the administration of then Mughal emperor Mirza Raja Jai Singh who appointed his relative Udaybhan Rathod as a fort keeper. “Rathod had placed a canon (artillery gun) on each turret of the fort. However, one turret was left unguarded as it was on the top of a steep cliff. Tanhaji and his brother Suryaji received intelligence inputs about the ‘chink’’ in the opponent’s armour. Besides, they were aware of a party, organised by the Mughal’s troops, on the night of the battle. They struck at night when the Mughal army was busy at the party and caught them off guard,” said history scholar Pandurang Balkawade .

“With the help of a monitor lizard (ghorpad), over 300 Maratha troops climbed the most treacherous cliff and reached the fort. The sudden attack caught Mughals unawares and before they could inflict a counter attack, the Marathas killed a sizeable number of them. Meanwhile, a fierce fight took place between Tanhaji and Rathod in which the former’s shield got damaged and he was seriously injured. Though this had an adverse impact on the Maratha soldiers’ morale, his brother, Suryaji, boosted their confidence and won the battle,” Balkawade said. Thereafter, they could successfully recapture the remaining 22 forts.

Sheetal Malusare, whose husband Shivraj is the 12th direct descendent of Tanhaji, said, “There was very little awareness about the battle among the people in the past. But after the Bollywood movie, Tanhaji, many have come to know about his bravery, dedication and contribution to the Maratha empire.”

The renovation work of Tanaji’s memorial at his native village Umrat in Poladpur tehsil of Raigad is in the final stages and it will be inaugurated on February 17, said Sheetal, who completed a PhD on Tanhaji in 2017 from Karnataka University.

120,['4/02/2020'],Friendly bugs to help coconut farmers fight whitefly scourge,"This story is from February 4, 2020

COIMBATORE: The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) is planning to use two beneficial insects to tackle rugose whitefly (Aleurodicus rugioperculatus), an invasive alien insect ravaging coconut plantations across the state.

The university plans to multiply Chrysoperla and Encarsia that will act as parasitoids (insects that eat other insects) and supply them to coconut farmers.

Director of the Centre of Plant Protection Studies at TNAU K Prabakar said the university has facilities in Coimbatore and Aliyar to multiply the parasitoids, but not enough to cover the whole state. “So, we have proposed a Rs 50 lakh-project to the Coconut Development Board to multiply the parasitoids and distribute them to farmers. We also plan to tie up with the agriculture department to train personnel for parasitoid breeding stations in all districts,” he said.

Rugose whitefly, an invasive pest from Florida, was first detected in the state in 2016. “It was first seen in Pollachi and then spread to other states,” Prabakar said. “The pest has also been reported in Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , among other states. It has affected 15% of the 4.4 lakh hectares of coconut plantations in the state, affecting yield.”

TNAU had come up with an integrated pest management method to control whitefly. It includes placing sticky yellow polythene sheets that attract the insects and act as traps, placing light traps, releasing parasitoids as a biological control method, spraying water on the leaves to wash the pest away, and, if the attack is heavy, spraying neem oil on the affected leaves. Of these, thrust is on the parasitoids.

The presence of the pest also brings in sooty mold, which turn the leaves black, said Prabakar. “On seeing this, farmers spray pesticides, killing the parasitoids.”

Coconut farmers should grow yellow flowers that have nectar to attract parasitoids. “An increase in parasitoid population will be beneficial,” Prabakar added.

As many as 300 coconut farmers from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh attended a workshop on whitefly control at TNAU on Monday.

121,['4/02/2020'],Rare gun found on AU campus to now grace city museum,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Allahabad: A rare 17th century single-barrel gun found in a cellar on Allahabad University campus around 15 years back would now have a pride of place in Allahabad Museum.

The Mughal era gun was found in a cellar, located beneath the stairs of AU ’s medieval and modern history department by a peon. The peon, Syyed Ali, also found two iron fireballs along with the gun. University officials handed over the antique firearms to the museum on Monday.

Ali had been taking care of the antiques ever since he chanced upon them.

The gun is around five feet in length and weighs around 20kg and its barrel is around two inches in diameter. Due to wear and tear over time, some parts of the gun like the barrel and the iron click are now covered with rust.

“The gun is from somewhere around the 17th century. The iron fireballs were portable and were used for attacking objects nearby,” said Allahabad Museum’s deputy curator OA Wankhade. Wankhede said said that the gun could help the museum officials know more about the artillery from the medieval period. “We have enough information about big cannons, small pistols and guns used, but this gun is the missing link between the two. It could tell us a lot about how heavy fixed artillery paved way for more portable firearms.”

Talking about the two iron balls, he said, “The iron balls are a rarer find than the gun because these were used to store gunpowder. The heavy and thick walls of the iron balls would protect the gunpowder from exploding if it fell on the ground accidentally,” he added.

.“The antique gun is a priceless antique and will now be kept on display in the museum for visitors,” said head of AU’s medieval and modern history department Yogeshwar Tewari

Chennai: Even as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are battling charges of bribing Tamil Nadu government officials including the CMDA (Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority) in a court in the US, a lawyer has moved the Madras high court to order CBI to probe into the allegations.

M L Ravi has in his plea alleged that Cognizant had paid a bribe of Rs 23 crore to state government authorities, including CMDA officials, to obtain planning, environment and other permissions for its KITS Campus in Chennai. The petitioner submitted that he had made a detailed complaint to the DVAC and CBI to register a case and probe the allegations under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Since the agencies have failed to act on his complaint, he has approached the high court.

Admitting the plea, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha directed the centre and state governments to file their responses by March 9.

When the plea came up for hearing, the bench referred to the complaint lodged by the Security Exchange Commission of the United States of America with the United States district court, district of New Jersey, and an order passed by the commission dated February 15, 2019. The bench said, “It is to be noted at this juncture that the proceedings of the security commission is available in the public domain and therefore, it may not be necessary to lodge any specific complaint and that it is also open to the CBI and the DVAC to initiate appropriate inquiry.”

According to the petitioner, CTS has entered into a contract with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) for construction and operation of its KITS campus, encompassing 2.7 million square feet in Chennai.

KOCHI: The ridership data of Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) shows a steep increase in the number of riders from last year. The ridership doubled in the last five months of 2019 compared to that of 2018. During December, the ridership touched an all-time high of 21,08,108 while it was only 12,48,874 during December 2018 — an increase of nearly 69%. The trend continued in January 2020 with 20,74,430 travellers using the Metro.

Since the opening of Thykoodam stretch, there is a steady increase in ridership, said a statement from KMRL. “We are witnessing heavy rush during peak hours. To cater to the needs of commuters, we have reduced the headway to six minutes during peak hours. The trend suggests that people are happy to use the Metro for their regular commute and the growth actually accelerated in the past year,” said KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

“Kochi Metro is also working to increase the last mile connectivity for its passengers. Discussions with educational institutions along the Metro corridor, Infopark and corporates to provide last mile connectivity are in final stages,” he added.

KMRL had recently inked an agreement with Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) for plying electric buses as part of its feeder service to Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial). Electric buses with a seating capacity of 32 will ply between Aluva Metro station and Cial.

KMRL is also encouraging group booking if there are more than seven passengers in the group, the statement said. The agency has also introduced minor cards to encourage schoolchildren above the age of 10 years to use the facility for daily commuting. Metro has also seen an increase in the total number of people who are using Kochi1 Card. There are 73,000 active Kochi 1 Card users and they form a healthy 29% of total ridership.

Garbage was not cleared for 4-7 days,” said B S Vohra, president, Federation of East Delhi RWAs. “Despite paying property tax, we were forced to live in unhygienic conditions simply because there is no consensus between two different political parties heading the state government and the municipalities.”Obviously there are a lot of disgruntled voters and many issues that affect them in daily life. Vohra sounded a warning, “I think people should consider these factors before casting their votes.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73922470,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-103922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oppn-plays-on-voters-woes-outgoing-mla-cites-central-hurdles/articleshow/73923402.cms

Chennai: It’s the time of the year where parents of three-year-olds are busy hunting for the best primary school . This year, they are also looking for the right house, finding which is becoming a struggle.

“School authorities have firmly told us children living near the campus will be preferred,” said T Sathya, a software professional who resides in KK Nagar. She has applied to a popular school in Adyar, but the need to find a home closer to the school is giving her sleepless nights. “It has been four months now. Either the rent is too high or the amenities are inadequate. I have promised the school to move nearby soon. Let’s see.”

As the admission season draws to a close, parents are getting increasingly anxious, withy most schools insisting that children live within a 3 km radius. “It’s mainly for safety and children get tired travelling long distance,” said S Raja, principal of Hindu Primary school.

The expectation of new-age parents is also high. “They do not want their children to carry any book, they want no homework at all,” said L Hemalatha, a teacher at Indus International Primary School, Neelankarai.

Most parents want their children to study in schools that are centrally air-conditioned. “We were also asked to install air-conditioners in school buses, so children don’t sweat or get tired,” said C Bharati Lakshmi, principal of Vael's Vidyashram.

They look for fewer children in classrooms, so their child gets individual attention. Parents want playgrounds, a variety of extracurricular activities and also foreign faculty. “It is good to have diverse cultures in the teaching faculty because they provide innovative and creative methods. And children gain more exposure,” said Suresh Karat, who moved from Ambattur to Thiruvanmiyur because he found a school that had all the facilities he looking for. He now travels 22 km to his workplace. “We got the admission by sheer luck, and distance was the only issue, so we moved. I want my son to have the most comfortable and luxurious learning experience.”

“We hear this a lot. Parents today want luxury, convenience, no homewor or hard work for their children, because most are travelling. They want the schools to take all the responsibilities of raising their children,” said Bharati Lakshmi, from an educational institution.

“The education scene today is changing. There are many schools providing easy, convenient education, making our children all rounders. They match our expectations. We see no reason to settle for anything less,” said Yamini Muthu, another parent.

Thiruvananthapuram: The state’s largest ‘ compensatory planting scheme’ is getting completed on the premises of the Sainik School in Kazhakkoottam. The social forestry department will hand over the forest to the school in May, said chief conservator of forests P K Kesavan here on Monday.

The saplings that were planted as a compensation for 4,500 trees, which were axed for the widening of Kazhakoottam-Mukkola national highway stretch in 2016, have grown up, turning the area into a forest.

Kesavan and other senior forest officials visited the site on Friday. Forest officials said that it was the largest compensatory planting project in the state. The forest has rare varieties of fruit trees, medicinal plants, etc. Around 38 varieties of trees and plants are growing up in this area.

The trees include Lakshmitaru, Kambakam, mango tree, neem, tamarind, Malabar tamarind, red sandalwood, cassia fistula, mahogany etc.

As per the agreement for compensatory planting, NHAI had given around Rs 1 crore to the forest department. Ten saplings were planted as compensation for every tree felled. Forest officials said that initiative has also helped in replacing acacia trees in the area.

The forest department had divided the area into three segments and made large pits to plant saplings. Saplings suited for the local weather were selected. “Once we hand it over to the Sainik School, responsibility of the maintenance will be with them,” said Kesavan.

Another compensatory planting scheme in connection with Vizhinjam port works is getting ready in 35 acres in the same campus. As many as 15,540 trees were axed for the works of Vizhinjam port. Already 1,250 saplings were planted in 12 acres in 2018.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The focus of police towards new-age crimes have started yielding results. Crime rates in state, in 2019, witnessed a 3.8% dip compared to the previous year, according to data registered under the Information Technology Act.

While 2018 had witnessed 51% more cases compared to 2017 under the I-T Act, the figures of 2019 were much lesser. The number of cases registered under the I-T Act in 2017 was 290. It had increased to 439 in 2018, but dropped to 422 in 2019. “The state police had observed 2019 as the year of cyber security and also had strongly implemented its policy of zero tolerance towards child pornography and crimes against children. Several awareness campaigns and preventive measures were undertaken in this regard. All these seemed to have had its impact,” ADGP (administration) Manoj Abraham, who is also the nodal officer of Cyberdome said.

The drop in the cases were more visible in cities. Number of cases in Thiruvananthapuram city dropped by 14, Kochi city by nine and Kozhikode city by six. Districts also followed a similar trend. Number of cases in Idukki dropped by 10 and Kannur by six. However, some places like Thrissur city and Palakkad showed a reverse trend where cases increased by 16 and 13, respectively.

Cybercrime cases in the state fall under three major categories — banking frauds, child pornography and cyber harassment (against women). With these three areas in focus, police, last year had launched several initiatives like ‘stop bank frauds’, ‘kids glove’ (creating awareness among teachers, parents and children about cybercrimes) an ‘P Hunt’ (crackdown on child pornography). Cybercells were strengthened and a team to act against child sexual exploitation was constituted. More than 70 officers were deputed to investigate cases related to child sex abuse on online platforms. As many as 210 searches were conducted against paedophilia and child pornography and several devices including laptops, hard disks, pen drives and similar devices with such abusive materials were confiscated. Police had also registered 38 cases and arrested 42 people in this regard last year.

Eco clubs are aimed at creating awareness on various social and environmental issues, including bio-diversity,... Read More

CHENNAI: State school education department has sanctioned Rs 38 crore for constituting ‘Eco and Youth’ clubs in 37,000 government schools. This includes 327 schools in Chennai. These clubs are aimed at creating awareness on various social and environmental issues, including bio-diversity, climate and local ecology, nutrition, health and hygiene.

In elementary and middle schools, the club will have five members and higher standards will have 15-member clubs.

Principals or vice-principals will head the clubs and interested teachers will be chosen by the school headmaster to coordinate activities on a rotational basis. These teachers, in turn, will select students to be members of the clubs.

The clubs have been authorised to use idle school resources like auditorium, libraries and art rooms for activities after regular working hours and on holidays. All the clubs will have three wings — literary, awareness, arts & culture. Those in the literary wing will conduct activities such as essay writing, elocution and poetry competitions on environmental issues for students in their respective schools. The second wing has been given the responsibility of conducting awareness campaigns on special days such as ‘Earth Day’ and ‘ World Environment Day ’, cleaning and maintaining parks, playgrounds in their vicinity. The art and culture wing will organise tree plantation drives, help set up drip irrigation systems, reverse osmosis (RO) and rain water harvesting projects in the school premises.

Money spent towards this will be monitored by Parents Teacher Associations or the School Management Committee and later uploaded to the government portal for scrutiny.

Experts, parents and retired government school teachers and staff can be roped in to guide students, said the order released in connection with this on January 30.

Representative image

PUNE: An autorickshaw driver took an elderly woman passenger in another direction from her destination before snatching her cellphone and Rs 25,000 from her purse near Ajanta Avenue society, off Paud road, on Monday afternoon. The driver ran over the woman’s leg while escaping but she fortunately did not suffer a fracture.

Senior inspector Pratibha Joshi of the Kothrud police station told TOI that they have obtained the registration number of the autorickshaw through CCTV footage from establishments in the vicinity.

Joshi said the 65-year-old woman, who did not wished to be named, had hired the autorickshaw from her residence on DP road in Kothrud at 2.30pm to go to the State Bank of India branch at Anandnagar to collect her pension. She asked the driver to wait for her outside the bank as she wanted to return by the same vehicle.

On the way back, the driver deliberately took her in another direction and stopped the autorickshaw near Ajanta Avenue society around 3pm. “He forced the woman to get out of the vehicle. Even as she did so, the driver pushed her hard and she fell on the road. The driver grabbed her cellphone and pulled out the cash from her purse,” Joshi said.

The woman sustained injuries on her shoulder and head after falling. “Even as the woman was on the ground, the driver started his vehicle and ran over her leg. The woman screamed in pain and local residents rushed to the spot. However, the driver managed to escape. The woman suffered bruises on her shin after a metal part of the autorickshaw scraped against it,” Joshi said.

The woman was admitted to a private hospital located on Paud road. She was given a discharge late in the evening. She later lodged a complaint with the Kothrud police. Police have registered a case under sections 392 (robbery) and 323 (causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.

TOI on Monday evening tried to contact the woman but her family said she was again taken to hospital for another check-up and would not be available for comment.

Prakash Javadekar

NEW DELHI: Just days after the Election Commission issued a show cause notice to BJP MP Parvesh Verma for calling Arvind Kejriwal a “terrorist”, Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday said the the CM had called himself an “anarchist” and that there is “not much difference between an anarchist and a terrorist”.

“Kejriwal masoom chehra karke poochhte hain ki kya main aatankwadi hoon ... aap aatankwadi ho, iske bahut sabut hain. Aapne khud kaha tha ki main arajakwadi hoon. Aatankwadi or arajakwadi mein bahut zyada antar nahi hain” (With an air of injured innocence, Kejriwal has been asking whether he is a terrorist. You are indeed a terrorist , and there is plenty of proof for that. You yourself said you are an anarchist. There is not much difference between an anarchist and a terrorist),” Javadekar told a press conference where he was flanked by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and Union minister Anurag Thakur.

Javadekar also raised the issue of Kejriwal “staying a night at the Moga residence of Khalistan Commando Force chief Gurinder Singh during the Punjab Assembly polls”. “You knew it was a militant’s house. Still, you stayed there. How much more evidence do you need?” he said.

The minister said AAP was supporting Shaheen Bagh, where slogans of “Assam ko azadi”, “Jinnah wali azadi” were being raised. “Supporting such slogans is also terrorism,” he said. He also referred to Delhi government avoiding taking a call on whether Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and others should be prosecuted for allegedly raising anti-India slogans. He said Kejriwal stood with JNU, where “anti-India slogans were raised, and did not grant sanction to prosecute (those who raised the slogans)”.

“On January 26, you threatened that you would stop their prosecution. How much more proof do you need? The people of Delhi now know that you are the chief of liars, you are an anarchist and sympathise with terrorists,” he said, adding, “You are supporting Shaheen Bagh, JNU, the slogans being raised there and all such anarchists...then you are definitely a terrorist. This is your identity, no matter how innocent face you make.” After Verma called him a “terrorist”, Kejriwal had said it was for the people of Delhi to decide whether they consider him their son, brother, or a terrorist.

“How have I become a terrorist? I’ve arranged for medicines...did so much for the needy. I’ve never thought of myself or my family... am ready to give my life for the nation,” he had said.

Representative image

MUMBAI: The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government expanded its pet project of a 24x7 lifestyle by allowing multiplexes and cinema halls to remain open round the clock .

A notification was issued on January 31, allowing cinema halls to be added to that section of the amended Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Service Condition) Act, 2017, that lets shops, including restaurants (that do not serve alcohol), salons, hyper malls and businesses such as banks, medical establishments and tax consultancies, to remain open 24 hours in the state. Till the notification, theatres could not run beyond 1am.

Manoj Desai, executive director of G-7 Multiplex and Maratha Mandir , plans to adopt a wait-and-watch attitude.

“Of course, we welcome the notification permitting us to function all night long. But we will observe other malls, multiplexes, single screens and take a decision once we feel the nightlife journey is safe for everybody,” he said.

The spokesman of a south Mumbai cinema hall said their last show starts around 11.15pm and winds up by 1.00-1.30am. “Officially, we have welcomed the government’s announcement permitting us to function day and night because it offers the viewer more flexibility and choice,” he said. However, business districts are deserted at night, and there are often few taxis. It is largely patrons with cars who prefer the late shows.

Besides the safety issues, there are also questions of viability. Since the 24x7 policy began on the Republic Day weekend, the response to late night shopping or eating out has been, at best, lukewarm. A cinema hall in Worli tried out the extended timings last week, but discontinued the extra shows for lack of patronage. “We are located inside a mall. We will have to wait and see whether the extended business hours succeed. The opinion of the residents of the neighbourhood also plays a part,” said the spokesman.

The 24x7 initiative, a brainchild of Sena leader and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, was launched from January 24 and is currently being implemented in non-residential areas and in gated premise like malls, mill compounds. Shops can remain open in three shifts. However, one-day leave has to be given to employees every week. Cinemas are now in the category that can stay open day and night, but liquor-serving establishments, clubs and pubs have to still shut shop by 1:30am.

The Simplex portion of the civil work is stuck at the 75% stage

MUMBAI: Nearly nine months before the deadline for the Andheri-Dahisar Metro 7 , the MMRDA has terminated the contract awarded to infrastructure major Simplex for the construction of the Andheri-Goregaon portion , citing extensive work execution delays.

Fears that the delay on the stretch would jeopardise the October deadline for the Metro 7 project began to be expressed about six months ago, when the MMRDA sent the first of several notices to Simplex Infrastructures Ltd to speed up work.

The Rs 6,208 crore Metro 7 project will connect the 16.5 km between Andheri (east) and Dahisar (east) with an elevated line running largely along the Western Express Highway.

Simplex was finalised to execute civil works on the 5.5 km stretch between Andheri and Goregaon in April 2016 for Rs 348 crore. Officials said the work here had remained virtually stuck at the 75% stage for some months now when it should have been finished by now. “The MMRDA has terminated the contract and fresh tenders have been invited to appoint a new contractor to complete the balance work of Simplex Infrastructures Ltd,” an MMRDA official said.

The MMRDA has also encashed the bank guarantee of Rs 35 crore given by Simplex.

Bhadrachalam: Diversified multinational conglomerate ITC Ltd has drawn up plans to invest Rs 2,500 crore in its PSPD (paperboards & specialty papers division) business as part of plans to hike capacity to 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2025.

A chunk of this investment — Rs 2,000 crore — will be pumped into its integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility at Bhadrachalam, Telangana. ITC Bhadrachalam, which is spread over 500 acres and is touted as the largest site for pulp and paper production in India, procures 15 lakh tpa of pulp wood from nearly 8,000 farmers in the two Telugu states and has created over 1,800 direct and 3,000 indirect jobs.

“At present our overall PSPD capacity is 7.5 lakh tonne per annum, out of which 6.5 lakh tpa alone is at Bhadrachalam. As part of our plan to reach 1 mtpa over the next 5 years, Bhadrachalam’s capacity will be increased to over 8 lakh tpa,” Vadiraj Kulkarni, chief operating officer, PSPD, ITC Ltd, told TOI.

Pointing out that ITC has already invested Rs 1,250 crore in its PSPD business over the past three years, Kulkarni said Rs 1,500 crore will be pumped into Bhadrachalam by the end of 2021-22.

“The Rs 1,250 crore investment went into setting up a 1 lakh tpa bleached chemi-thermo mechanical pulp (BCTMP) mill, which contributes to import substitution and captures larger value in India, and a new paperboards machine line with production capacity of 1.5 lakh tpa at Bhadrachalam.

The ongoing Rs 1,500 crore investment is being utilised for setting up a high-pressure recovery boiler, expanding the pulp mill capacity to 4 lakh tpa from 3.5 lakh tpa and augmenting the production capacity of board machines from 1 lakh tpa to 1.5 lakh tpa at Bhadrachalam,” Kulkarni explained.

He said another Rs 1,000 crore will be invested over the next five years for expanding the pulp mill capacity at Bhadrachalam to 4.75 lakh tpa at Rs 500 crore. Another Rs 500 crore will be pumped into Kovai (Coimbatore) facility to add a 1.5 lakh tpa paper board machine to enhance capacity at the plant to 2.5 lakh tpa. “We will be taking the necessary approvals for this Rs 1,000 crore investment plan in due course,” the ITC-PSPD COO said.

He said the investments in the PSPD business are aimed at driving growth and competitiveness of the business through an indigenous sustainable paper value chain anchored on an afforestation programme that has greened over 7.5 lakh acres across the country.

Tests were done at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research in Guindy.On Sunday, after they arrived at the city airport and one of them was found suffering from fever and cold during screening, they were admitted to the isolation ward in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. All the eight, who came here on business, are from China’s Guangdong province that is nearly 800km from Wuhan, the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak. Throat and nasal swabs along with blood samples were drawn for the tests. “We don’t have an infected patient in the state. The health condition of the patients is stable,” Vijayabaskar told reporters. “We will be discharging them soon and have encouraged them to return home as soon as possible. They are looking at flight options.”The patients were placed in tower 2’s isolation ward where 10 doctors, 18 staff nurses and around 20 paramedics have been posted . Care givers have been given personal protection equipment including special masks and gloves. “The only challenge we had in handling them was the language,” said hospital dean Dr R Jayanthi. None of them spoke English. “We serve as a quarantine hospital for the airport. Passengers from Kenya and Nigeria have been quarantined here when they entered our country without taking shots for yellow fever. But they knew English,” she said.For the last two days, a translator hired by the the hospital coordinated with the patients and helped doctors explain the treatment plan and Union ministry’s health protocol.

KANPUR: A class IX student allegedly committed suicide in the classroom at a CBSE affiliated college in Nawabganj area of Kanpur on Sunday night.

The student, Ashutosh Kumar, son of a primary school teacher Kamta Prasad, was a native of Gonda. He lived in a hostel on the college campus.

On Monday morning, his body was found hanging in a classroom on the second floor of the college. “He used to share the room with a student Pawan.

156,['4/02/2020'],December 2019 warmest in five Maharashtra cities since 1901,"The warming trend this winter indirectly suggested copious moisture incursion into Maharashtra (File photo)

PUNE: An India Meteorological Department (IMD) winter analysis has revealed that December last year had the warmest night temperatures since 1901 in at least five cities in Maharashtra — Pune, Ratnagiri , Malegaon , Kolhapur and Dahanu.The December 2019 nights were the fourth warmest for Mumbai in the IMD’s recorded history (1901) and second warmest for Aurangabad and Solapur. The data revealed that the average night temperature in Maharashtra was the highest after 1967.At least 11 cities in the state broke the minimum temperature records for experiencing one of the warmest Decembers since 1901. All these cities have recorded the warmest December nights during recent decades, especially after 1960.Arvind Kumar Srivastava, head of the Climate Research Division (Climate Research and Services) IMD-Pune, told TOI that not only Maharashtra, but the entire south peninsular India experienced the second warmest average minimum temperature in December 2019 in recorded history.He said, “The average minimum temperature for Maharashtra in December 2019 was 17.5ºC, which was the warmest December average the state has seen in the past 52 years or after 1967 when the average December night temperature was 17.95ºC. Maharashtra, meanwhile, recorded the third highest December average minimum since 1901 this winter.”Srivastava said to have such warm night temperatures during winter was rare but not incredible, considering the larger climate change and global warming scenario. “Climatologically, we have noticed a trend that when north India is cool during the season, south India tends to record relatively warmer minimum temperatures,” he said.The warming trend this winter indirectly suggested copious moisture incursion into Maharashtra, as well as south peninsular India. “But long-term humidity data will have to be studied to see if there has been an unprecedented increase in humidity levels in the last few months,” Srivastava said.“This winter, the anti-cyclones from the Arabian Sea were constantly blocking the flow of cold and dry northerly winds originating from the snow-clad regions of the Himalayas. While these winds could enter north India, their entry to south peninsular India, including Maharashtra, was blocked,” he added.The wind regime was also such that the moist westerlies from the Arabian Sea or warm and humid easterlies were influencing the minimum temperatures in Maharashtra during most of winter. “As far as the high night temperatures witnessed this winter in many cities of Maharashtra and south India are concerned, there was an influence of local factors like soil topography and vegetation that also played a role in pushing up minimum temperatures in those stations,” Srivastava said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73924581,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97220,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/december-2019-warmest-in-five-maha-cities-since-1901/articleshow/73915189.cms

Nagpur: “Curiosity is the foundation of any kind of invention or discovery. It helps in one’s quest for knowledge,” said Dr CD Mayee, a former vice-chancellor of Marathwada Agricultural University, while addressing students at the inaugural function of JIGYASA – Student-Scientist Connect Residential Programme on Monday.

At the outset, Prakash Kumbhare, senior principal scientist (CSIR Neeri), gave a brief introduction of Mayee. Regarding‘Jigyasa’, Kumbhare said, “NEERI has organized this five-day programme for school-going children to make them aware about researches and scientists. As students only retain what they learn in textbooks, this programme will connect them directly to

scientists and various research programmes and that’s why we have called it called it the Student–Scientist Connect programme.”

Some activities are themes and experiments on water quality research, water audit, lab visits, on-site experiments and interactions with Neeri scientists.

In his inaugural address, Mayee informed students about the importance of innovation, invention and research. He said the ‘Green Revolution’ has great significance.

While explaining the importance of accidental inventions, Mayee spoke about the discovery of penicillin in particular. He also educated students about Dadaji Khobragade, a humble farmer who invented HMT rice. Despite his invention, Khobragde remained poor, but people around him became rich because of the high quality of his rice. “All these inventions and discoveries were a result of curiosity. Apart from textbook knowledge, students must develop curiosity and should ask more and more questions. This programme will encourage students and help them to get good exposure,” said Mayee.

Dr JS Pandey, chief scientist, climatic change and skilling division (CSIR Neeri) felicitated Mayee with a memento. Dr Pradeep Salve, principal scientist, proposed a vote of thanks while Samruddhi anchored the programme.

160,['4/02/2020'],Exporters want appointment of nodal officer for faster GST refunds,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Ludhiana: Irked over the slow speed of processing of GST refunds, city exporters are demanding appointing of a nodal officer in the central GST and customs departments for faster processing of the same. According to businessmen, a huge amount of GST refunds of theirs get stuck every month on their export consignments due to which they have to face various problems.

Giving more information, Harish Dua, president of Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Organisation, said, “The problem of delay in GST refunds of exporters is taking a very serious turn now. For the last one year the refunds are being processed very slowly and it sometimes takes months to settle the entire refund pertaining to a particular period. The worst part is that this is happening even after completion of all formalities by us and proper filing of our returns.”

“From this year we are hearing that the Union ministers and officials are making false claims that the refunds are being processed at a very fast pace and all genuine claims are being settled on time by the central GST department but the story is the other way round. Sometimes, the GST department officials claim that our documents are not complete, sometimes they claim that they have not received necessary clearance from the customs department. This is a never-ending harassment and at the end of the day it’s the businessmen who suffer badly and incur huge losses due to their hard-earned money getting blocked. This problem of delay in processing of GST refunds cannot be solved until there is an appointment of a nodal officer for exporters who can coordinate with both GST and customs department for processing of GST refunds.”

According to Harish Kairpal, cashier of Knitwear Club, Ludhiana, “GST refunds of exporters from lakhs to several crores are getting stuck with the taxation departments and people do not have money to carry on with their business. When GST was to be launched the central government had made several tall claims that this taxation system is going to improve doing of business but the reality is the other way round and exporters are turning out to be biggest victims. Huge amounts of our GST remains pending with the departments for months, which is taking a toll on the exporters. The central government should take a serious view of this problem and get it resolved at the earliest by appointing a nodal officer for GST refund issues of exporters.”

According to Subash Bajaj, an engineering component exporter from the city, “The GST refunds problem is the biggest problem of the exporters’ fraternity and until this issue is tackled seriously, the exports from India will keep falling as businessmen are getting fed up with the system and many of them are considering quitting this business as one’s capital gets stuck with these departments. Therefore, appointment of a nodal officer, who could coordinate between both GST and customs department for refunds of exporters, should be considered by the central government.”

PUNE: Around 80% of the total of over one lakh schools in the state have self-evaluated themselves under the “Shala Siddhi” programme for academic and infrastructure development.

Gondia emerged as the top-most district to cover maximum (98%) schools that have completed their progress report. “The objectives of the evaluation system are to critically analyze the present practices to identify its strengths and areas that need immediate action for improvement,” state director of primary education Dattatray Jagtap said.

In Pune, 70.29% schools have completed the evaluation.

The “Shala Siddhi” programme was introduced by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration of the Union ministry of human resource and development in 2015. The exercise is conducted annually.

The schools have to evaluate their infrastructure with respect to school premises, playground with sports, equipment and materials, classrooms and other rooms, electricity and gadgets, library, laboratory, computer, ramp, mid-day meal, kitchen and utensils, drinking water, hand wash facilities and toilets. The evaluation has six more parameters for assessment.

Jagtap said, “The schools need to give a plan for improvement by identifying the areas. A school can collectively select some areas that it wishes to work on and leave out some, depending on its present limitations. It may then prioritize the chosen areas in three degrees — low, medium and high — and decide to work on them in a phased manner over time. Decisions related to prioritization would depend on the immediate needs of the school, demands from policies, local context, school specific issues, among others.”

The programme was implemented in the state form the 2016-17 academic year. The state government has targeted to make 100% schools compliant with “Shala Siddhi”.

JAIPUR: The state’s rural development and panchayati raj department on Monday directed the district officers not to ignore the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), which has already got a state party status, during the lottery process (to reserve seats), meetings and other panchayat election-related activities. It also asked the officials to keep the party in the loop and invite it in future.

The department took cognisance of the matter after Khinvsar ( Nagaur ) MLA Narayan Beniwal ’s letter to the state election commission (SEC) citing neglect by the election officials during election-related activities. Beniwal blamed the state government for absolute “mismanagement” during panchayat elections in the state and called for suspension of a few officials.

According to the department’s directions, the district election officers have been directed to invite RLP for all the panchayat election-related activities and meetings, along with other political parties, by mailing them on their email id rlpindiaorg@gmail.com.

“I had to write this letter to the SEC when RLP was not invited during the lottery to reserve the seats of zila pramukhs and zila pradhans in Jaipur. They invited all other political parties except ours,” Beniwal told TOI.

“The state government is not at all serious about the panchayat elections. Due to this, they have to conduct lotteries in various places twice. In many places, the candidates were made to file nominations, but the outcome of it has not been declared yet and is kept under sealed cover. Who should be held responsible for this mismanagement? I believe 3-4 officials should be suspended. People have lost trust in the entire election process,” he added.

168,['4/02/2020'],Rajasthan government to rent out its data centre,"This story is from February 4, 2020

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan government is reaching out to other states and corporates to rent out its extra space for ‘data storage’ at the Bhamashah State Data Centre ( BSDC ). The centre already stores data of all the departments but utilises only 30% of its capacity. Madhya Pradesh has shown interest in taking the storage facility on rent for its departments, while Jharkhand is considering the proposal. Officials said that Adani group too has shown interest in the proposal.

“The department has written a letter to the chief secretaries of all the state governments inviting them to consider using secure storage facility. We are receiving response from several states while talks with MP are at an advanced stage. Several corporates including the Adanis have been approached for taking the services of the BSDC,” said Pramod Agarwal , in charge the centre. The BSDC is country’s first and only tier-4 government-owned data centre meant to fulfil the data storage demand for 30 years of the state.

The facility at present provides data storage service to all the state departments, schemes for free. Officials realised that state-of-the-art facility can generate revenue to make the centre self-sustainable. It is also in talks with government agencies like corporations, industries and individual startups. The department is targeting a revenue of Rs 4 crore by renting out the space in the first year which is sufficient to make it ‘self-run’. “The pricing for the services is highly competitive as the land and building cost which belongs to the government is not included in the offerings,” said Agarwal.

The eight storey data centre facility was launched two months before the model code of conduct in 2018. Its existing capacity is 10 petabytes which further can be expanded to meet the growing needs. It is spread in 25,000 square feet area and offers seven-layered data security check.

Ludhiana: Even though the city municipal corportion mayor, Balkar Singh Sandhu, had announced a list of 100 vending zone sites for providing relief to roadside vendors, but the latter are complaining that at a few locations the police is not letting them to do their business. They met the commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal on Monday and handed over a memorandum to him.

The commissioner of police, however, has asked for the list of tentative vending zones announced by the civic body. The vendors also claimed that some of the locations mentioned in the list of vending zones were being used as parking lots and unless the civic body does not stop parking of vehicles there, they will not be able to do anything.

The president of the Rehri-Farhi Union, Punjab, Bal Krishan Pappi, said, “We have got the list of vending zones from the municipal corporation but at these locations cops are not allowing the vendors to run their business, so we met the commissioner of police in his office.” He further said they had requested him to direct the cops to allow the vendors to do their business at these sites. He also claimed that there were many locations like the underway road, Benzamin Road, the road adjoining civil hospital, etc, were being used for the parking of vehicles. He said they would meet the mayor and MC commissioner K P Brar on Tuesday about this as well. He said they would ask the authorities to stop parking of vehicles at these locations.

It was after the police and MC had conducted a joint anti-encroachment drive on 12 roads in the city that the vendors were made to vacate these locations. Following this, the vendors staged a protest and forced the civic body to announce vending zones.

Patients are screened as per the standard screening protocol and advised 28-day home quarantine with or without blood test. Ten people have been admitted in various government hospitals across the state. Of the 1,150 in home quarantine, 319 are from Chennai, 72 from Coimbatore, 38 from Madurai and 50 from Trichy. “Blood tests and nasal/ throat swabs are taken for patients who come from Wuhan or patients showing symptoms such as cold, fever or breathing difficulty,” said health minister C Vijayabaskar. While a dozen of the 18 samples sent to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine tested negative, results of four samples being tested by the National Institute of Virology in Pune are awaited, he said.

While one patient with travel history to China was admitted to Villupuram Medical College with symptoms of the virus, a 35-year-old man, native of Needamangalam in Tiruvarur, who returned from China was admitted to Tiruvarur Medical College Hospital. The man who worked as a cook came home on January 31. “He came to the primary health centre near his house with fever, cold and cough. Doctors there referred him here,” said the medical college principal Muthukumaran. His condition is stable and test results are awaited, he said.

We are asking schools to ensure personal and hand hygiene. All public places should be disinfected,” said director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. The state has also asked all schools to provide students with soap and running water. The state is also in touch with the Centre about the quarantined 53 students who returned from China, he said.

Earlier, deputy CM O Panneerselvam said hospitals and border areas were being closely monitored to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the state. Farmers of the border districts have been advised not to shake hands or talk without covering their mouth and nose, specially while sneezing or coughing.

Deputy director of health services, Trichy, Dr A Subramani said health inspectors were visiting quarantined passengers to check for symptoms of the disease. “We have asked the inspectors to bring patients showing symptoms to the hospital as per protocol. They should be given a mask and transported in an ambulance. They will be kept in an isolation ward of the medical college hospital,” Subramani said.

Hyderabad: City-based environment management services provider Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited (REEL) on Monday announced its foray into the Dubai market with the launch of FARZ, a fully automated material recovery facility (MRF) that leverages Artificial Intelligence, in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode with Dubai-based Imdaad group.

Spanning an area of 45,322sq m, the MRF can process 1,200 tonnes per day of municipal as well as commercial and industrial (C&I) waste, which is nearly 13% of the total waste generated daily in Dubai, with a recovery rate of 25-30% of waste, the company said in a release.

The company also pointed out that in addition to recycling waste, FARZ will help reduce emissions caused by trucks that collect and carry waste to landfill. The MRF, touted as one of the largest fully-automated ones in the region, incorporates magnetic, optical, and ballistic separators and smart recovery technologies to segregate and reclaim valuables.

Goutham Reddy, MD, Ramky, said the MRF rollout is part of REEL’s vision of delivering sustainable solutions at scale around the world. “FARZ has the most efficient recovery rate of any materials recovery facility with two separate lines, one to deal with household waste and the other focusing on commercial and industrial waste. The innovation and launch of the Farz facility is core to our transformation into a fully integrated global circular economy company,” he said. TNN

175,['4/02/2020'],"Ludhiana: Three years on, only 25,000 houses get UID plates","This story is from February 4, 2020

A UID plate affixed outside a house in Model Town

LUDHIANA: Almost three years are gone since the drive to install unique identity (UID) number plates had started in the city and only 6.25% of properties have been covered so far. Contrary to this, the civic body has made UID numbers compulsory in 33 blocks of the city. Now, to overcome the slow pace of installation of these plates the officials have started writing the UID numbers outside households with paint and in some areas they have done it twice as the first time the paint faded. There is no clarity as to when the procedure to install the number plates at other properties will complete.

According to Geographic Information System (GIS) survey conducted by the MC officials, there are more than 4 lakh properties in 37 blocks. The survey was conducted with the help of Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) and it was started in 2014. First of all, the civic officials had to struggle hard in getting the complete data of the survey from the centre because they had not cleared the dues.

The installation of the number plates was proposed in 2014 but actual installation of UID number plates started from block 26 in Model Town area on June 23, 2017, and till now plates have been installed outside 25,000 houses only. Areas like Model Town, Model Gram, Shastri Nagar, Pakhowal Road, Ghumar Mandi, Gurdev Nagar, Rishi Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Maya Nagar, Maharaj Nagar, Sarabha Nagar, BRS Nagar, etc. have been covered as of now.

A businessman and resident of Naughara Mohalla, Tribhuvan Thapar, rued that he was not aware that UID numbers were compulsory in his block now and came to know about this when he went for depositing the property tax. He said nobody told about UID numbers when he argued, then one employee said every house had a UID number outside the house and he may not have checked it. He said, “I had to first get a UID number for the property and only then I could file my return. This is sheer wastage of time.”

Another resident from Shivpuri Ajay Walia said, “Sometime back, I had heard about the number plates but in our area nobody ever came to even inquire whether residents wanted to install these or not.” He said now people have to first go to the MC office for getting UID numbers because when civic employees wrote these numbers outside houses they did not bother to tell the owner of the house that now this number was compulsory for every work in the MC.

One of the representatives from the private company involved in the work of fixing number plates shared that when they went from door to door for collection of Rs 110 (fee for the UID plates), people did not give any response and they did not get support from the civic officials as well. He revealed that the MC officials did not support this project as they had neither advertised the same and its importance among people, nor they imposed it strictly, so people did not respond.

The superintendent of MC, Vivek Verma, said the pace of the project no doubt had remained slow but the company had been asked to increase the speed because in many blocks now the UID number was compulsory, so people would require these plates. The MC commissioner, K P Brar, admitted to the delay at the end of the company and claimed that very soon they would take some decision about this firm.

176,['4/02/2020'],Economists question Budget transparency,"This story is from February 4, 2020

PUNE: Five economic experts from different institutes on Monday flayed the Union budget for “being least transparent” and not acknowledging the economic problem that the country faced.

“The government is not able to collect the taxes it has been vwing to collect for the past three years. Yes, the overall tax collections have always been low. But at least the government was earlier able to collect the taxes it had proposed to,” National Institute of Public Finance and Policy director Rathin Roy said at the Budget discussion organized by Pune International Centre (PIC).

He added said the government has “dangerously deviated” from the fiscal consolidation path without explaining why it did so and the path it would take to come back. Roy was a part of the expert panel that had constituted the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) roadmap.

Shubhashis Gangopadhyay, research director, India Development Foundation (IDF), said that earlier people were talking about why the fiscal deficit needed to be in check and now they were saying that “we should deviate”. He said, “Five years since the announcement on doubling of farm wages, the government is still working out how this needs to be done.”

Pradeep Apte, professor, Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, said the government has been speaking about the electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) for farmers, “yet the progress remains dismally low”. He said, “In all successive budgets, there is only a single line on e-NAM…the ease of doing business concept has always missed out on the agriculture sector.”

K L Dhingra, director of National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM), said the ease of business rankings has improved, prompting fellow panelists to ask: “Why hasn’t (private) investment come along with it?”

Dhingra said the government also did a lot of things outside the Budget and some of these, like the bankruptcy code, has helped banks contain bad loans.

The host of the event and economist Ajit Ranade said each successive Budget over the past four years has been presented at the backdrop of 1% drop in GDP over the previous years and stagnant capital formation. “While credit has collapsed to much of the industry, the banks still park Rs 3 lakh crore of excess money with the RBI every day,” he added.

Economist Vijay Kelkar said there was no acknowledgement in the budget that we are in a “major growth recession”. He said, “This is the first year, when I did not watch the Budget.”

CHENNAI: The CB-CID on Monday arrested a policeman and three others in connection with the scam surrounding the 2017 TNPSC Group II-A exam. So far, nine people have been arrested for the 2017 scam.

A probe began after the special team of CB-CID officers probing the fraud found that as many as 42 people who appeared for the examination from the Rameswaram centre had scored high marks and joined various government departments. Earlier, in relation to the scam in the 2019 Group IV examination, the CB-CID arrested 16 people.

Investigators have found that S Jayakumar, a Chennai resident, played a key role in both the scams, and is now on the run. “We hope to nab him soon,” said an officer. His mobile phone has remained switched off. The main agent, Jayakumar collected anywhere between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh from candidates seeking ‘high’ scores.

Of those arrested on Monday, Tirunelveli-based policeman M Muthukumar, 35, paid Rs 8 lakh to Jayakumar to help his wife clear the exam in 2017. Muthukumar’s wife Mahalakshmi bagged the 24th rank with a ‘score’ of 276 and is now an office assistant in a government department functioning out of the Ezhilagam complex in Chennai.

Another accused, P Vadivu, 44, is an assistant in the Kancheepuram registrar’s office. She had managed a rank of 29 with a score of 271.5 marks after paying Rs 12.5 lakh. The third accused, R Gnanasambandam, is an assistant in registration department’s headquarters in Chennai’s Foreshore Estate area. He secured the 54th rank after he paid Rs 15 lakh to clear the examination. The fourth accused, M Anandan, is an assistant in the registration office in the Red Hills area. He had paid Rs 13 lakh to the agent and ‘bagged’ 19th rank in the 2017 examination, a press release from the CB-CID said.

Ludhiana: Amid strong resentment expressed by the owners of a property, municipal corporation officials razed an illegal portion of a building in Dugri here on Monday. The officials blamed the property owner for using abusive language against them and added that they would also file a police complaint against the person. A resident of area had complained against the illegal construction work after which the civic body officials took action.

A resident of the area, Sukhwinder Singh, in his complaint submitted that the land was common land and now the civic body was its owner. But Gurinder Singh by using his political influence constructed a building on this piece of land. He said now he was continuing with the construction of the third floor. He said he had complained about this encroachment in 2005 as well but the civic body officials did not take action at that time.

Meanwhile, the MC officials claimed that they had stopped the construction work earlier also but the owner started the work again on Sunday and as soon as they came to know about the ongoing work, they dismantled the same. They alleged that Gurinder tried to interrupt the drive and also used abusive language against the MC team.

However, Gurinder denied using abusive language against anybody and claimed that the complainant, Sukhwinder, was holding some old grudges against him and by giving such complaints he was trying to settle old scores with him.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: People with residential water connections in Pimpri Chinchwad may soon have to pay twice the rate of water tax if their consumption ranges from 41-100 litres per capita per day (LPCD) and nearly 10 times the prevailing rate if usage is between 101 and 135 LPCD.A proposal in this regard has been prepared by the civic water supply department, which will come up for discussion before the standing committee on Wednesday.The proposal aims to control the overconsumption of more than 100 LPCD. “The aim behind the proposed water tax hike is to provide equitable water supply to all areas of the city. The department spends Rs 100 crore per year on water supply but only earns Rs 50 crore in revenue,” Makrand Nikam, chief of the civic water supply department, said.Besides, the water supply department is seeking approval for automatically increasing the water tax for residential consumption by 5% every year.

182,['4/02/2020'],Mamata Banerjee: BJP turning the country into killing fields,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Trinamool Chhatra Parishad’s dharna mancha on Rani Rashmoni Avenue on Monday

KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday questioned how BJP leaders holding constitutional posts were instigating people to open fire.

Speaking to reporters, she said, “I have seen the Uttar Pradesh chief minister asking to open fire. I am respectful to him, as I am also a chief minister. But how can a CM say that if you do not hear, then will open fire? Even an Union minister is saying the same words. How can they say so?”

Banerjee said whenever there are polls, BJP plays the card of hatred and divisive politics as it does not believe in development or humanity. “They are uttering words of hatred and playing communal politics during polls. They should not insult the people of Delhi,” the CM said, replying to queries related to the firing on anti-CAA protesters at Jamia University.

“The Supreme Court has also said that there can be peaceful agitations. Even in Park Circus there are agitations. If they have the guts, they should play the political card instead of indulging in vandalism. They aim to divide the country. We are also Hindus and Swamiji had stated that Hinduism is universal. We honour Bhagat Singh, who hails from Punjab, and we also honour the people of Tamil Nadu, who prefer to speak in their own language. We respect all regional languages,” she added.

“Whoever is trying to raise a question is being termed a terrorist, while they are the opportunists. They try to showcase that they are the biggest nationalists of the country. But they cannot deliver goods to the people,” Banerjee said. She added that “they are often taking to vandalism, hooliganism and goondaism, which was not the ideology of Gandhi or Tagore”.

“We our proud of our nation and they are making it killing fields. Government machinery is being used to spread hatred. We dislike it. We feel ashamed the way the country is being governed. They are turning the country into killing fields and encouraging divisive politics by using state machinery. They have no political programme and they aim at riots and goondagari. So, we will not learn politics from them. Bengal has its own culture and history and we have a long history of freedom movement.”

Banerjee said she heard the PM criticising the Delhi chief minister. “You should think of the people and trust them.” The CM added that the budget was a big zero for the people, with no roadmap for development. “The entire speech is of no value.”

HYDERABAD: A 23-year-old man was nabbed by cyber crime police on Monday for cheating people and insurance policy holders on the pretext of providing 10% rebate on their existing premiums. The accused was identified as Vineet Singh, a resident of UP’s Baliya district.

On January 3, a person received a call from Singh, who claimed to be an agent of a private life insurance company, and was told that if she paid her premiums through nationalised banks she would get a 10% discount. Believing the accused, she deposited the money in the bank account given by Singh. But a few days later, she received a message from the insurance company that her premium was pending. When she called the customer care, she realised that she had been cheated and approached the police.

PUNE: The civic body will from now allow tax discounts for rainwater harvesting to properties only after checking if groundwater was recharged.A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said the administration would inspect the groundwater levels near the properties getting the tax discount.He said while many properties were enjoying the discounts though the rainwater harvesting systems were lying defunct, the facility has been installed at some units “just as a formality” to enjoy the benefit.PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad “We will get an exact idea about the status of the rainwater harvesting systems in the city through the inspections. If the discounts given to the ineligible properties are scrapped, it will increase the PMC’s revenue.”He said the PMC would tie up with the Groundwater Survey and Development Agency and other authorities for the inspection. The survey would include physical inspection of the systems fitted in the properties and whether the rainwater was being properly discharged into soak pits or not. The technical study of groundwater level would also be done.Gaikwad said there would be surprise checks that would cover all types of properties, including private houses, commercial buildings and housing societies.“The findings will be out in a couple of months. The new rates for properties without a proper rainwater harvesting systems will be implemented from the next financial year,” he said.The Pune District Cooperative Housing Societies Federation has welcomed the step and demanded awareness be created simultaneously. “Rainwater harvesting is important. But many societies are not doing it scientifically. Some builders have set up these systems just to get building permissions,” the federation’s chairman Suhas Patwardhan said.He said the residents should be educated about the need of rainwater harvesting. The smaller and old societies should also install rainwater harvesting systems.A PMC official said the civic body was contemplating financial help to old properties to fit such systems. The PMC’s standing committee had given a green signal to the proposal in 2019. It had stated that the societies built before 2002 would be eligible for financial aid.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73925263,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-567405,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-lens-on-rainwater-harvesting-systems-in-properties/articleshow/73915246.cms
185,['4/02/2020'],Maharashtra: 20 pleas against attachment of D S Kulkarni properties,"This story is from February 4, 2020

D S Kulkarni

PUNE: Special judge Jayant Raje on Monday received 20 applications from different parties, including the Enforcement Directorate, opposing the proposed attachment of 463 movable and immovable properties worth over Rs1,500 crore of jailed developer D S Kulkarni alias DSK and his relatives in connection with the alleged economic fraud by the DSK group .

Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan told TOI, “All the applicants have opposed the attachment of the properties. The court has directed the prosecution and the competent authority — the sub divisional officer of Vadgaon Maval — to file written submissions on February 15.”

The court will pass a common order after examining and hearing the objections and claims. Confirmation of attachment will pave the way for raising money via auction of all these properties and clearing dues payable to banks and depositors, among others.

S S Narkar, assistant director of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Mumbai, filed an application to drop the proposed attachment of the properties seized by the ED on February 14, 2019. It read that the adjudicating authority in its order on August 5, 2019, had confirmed attachment of the properties by holding that it was involved in money laundering.

Lawyer Prakash Rajopadhye filed an application on behalf of suspect Shirish Kulkarni to stay the auction because the eight cars seized by the Pune police did not belong to his client (Shirish). His application said the cars were registered in the name of DSK Developers Private Limited and DSK Motors Limited, presently undergoing liquidation and resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

Prosecutor Chavan said the suspect (Shirish) had no independent right to stall the auction of the properties. “The DSK companies have not filed the application,” he said.

186,['4/02/2020'],Group IV scam: New system to check malpractice in TRB exams,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Chennai: Following malpractices in Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission’s ( TNPSC ) Group IV exams in select centres, the Teachers Recruitment Board ( TRB ) has decided to allot exam centres randomly to candidates in future exams.

As per the existing system, candidates can list cities where they prefer to appear for the exams. A majority of the candidates were allotted centres in one of the preferred locations.

“Now, candidates will be intimated about districts just 10 days before the exam and they will know their exam centres just three days before the exam,” TRB said in a release on Monday.

“The move will prevent malpractices like the one that occurred in Group IV exams. Though the board has moved to computer based online test for recruitment, we want to maintain confidentiality of the exam process. Hence, the board is also planning to shuffle officials on examination duty,” an official from TRB said.

The new system will come into force for block education officers’ recruitment test scheduled to be held on February 14, 15 and 16.

Expressing concern about the feasibilty of the new system, P Rajalingam, state secretary, TET Qualified Graduate and Secondary Grade Teachers’ Association, said, “It will be difficult to identify exam centres if we get random allotment just three days before the exam. If candidates are allotted exam centres in districts faraway from their native places, they may not be able to appear for the exam.”

For example, a candidate from Tirunelveli district can write exams in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar districts. But, if allotted a centre in Erode or Coimbatore, travelling there will take longer and most candidates cannot afford an extra day’s accommodation in the new town, he added.

“The move will help prevent malpractices. But, women candidates and differently abled candidates will face issues if they are allotted exam centres in other districts,” said J Robert, general secretary of Secondary Grade Seniority Teachers Association.

Some candidates also demanded the board to release full details of selected candidates, including their marks, caste and exam centres, after the exam to bring transparency.

In TNPSC’s Group IV exam, brokers had asked the candidates involved in the scam to pick Rameswaram and Keelakarai in Ramanathapuram district as exam centres. They were then given special pens with evaporating ink and later, correct answers were shaded in the answer scripts in collusion with a TNPSC official. Of the top 100 rank holders, 39 were from these two centres, shedding light on the scam. Police have so far arrested 16 people in connection with the scam.

187,['4/02/2020'],Traders protest Boulevard street construction,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Bhopal: Affected by smart city development, some of the city traders raised black flags and shouted slogans here on Monday. They allege that the master plan was not followed during construction of smart city road — a claimed denied by Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited in a press release on Monday.

Traders and displaced vendors protested over the construction of Boulevard Street, a Bhopal smart city project. Due to road widening, street vendors were displaced during anti-encroachment operation carried out by BSCDCL last month. Affected traders and vendors are now threatening to carry out a stir until the project is stopped.

BSCDCL press release, however, clarified that road widening is taking place for development of only Boulevard street; the drive has been undertaken by the corporation. This road widening is limited to only Jawahar Chowk. BSCDCL release mentioned that rumours are being spread that widening of about 10-metres of the road from Jawahar Chowk to Roshanpura would also take place. BSCDCL said it is not a project undertaken by the corporation. The road widening is proposed for development of Bhopal metro development and is not part of BSCDCL.

Sources said road construction was affected for some time during the vendors’ protest on Monday. According to smart city officials, 147 vendors have been relocated after the displacement. The recent protests come in the backdrop of halted work at road connecting Polytechnic to Bhadbhada. The twin projects are estimated at over Rs 80 crore. Polytechnic smart road is delayed by over two years. Boulevard street, of which about 300 metre remains incomplete, is also delayed by over a year.

SECUNDERABAD: With coronavirus spreading its tentacles in India, Osmania University (OU) has asked students from China, many returning from vacation after the Chinese New Year or seeking admission for the 2020-21 academic year, to undergo mandatory screening tests either at Gandhi Hospital or Fever Hospital.Currently, there are 26 Chinese students pursuing courses, including B.Com, MBA and law, in Osmania University and its affiliated colleges. Of them, a few students went home in January. Following the outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the university issued an advisory.“Any student with symptoms of coronavirus is advised to visit Gandhi or Fever Hospital as they have special isolation units and screening kits. Any Chinese student visiting India/Osmania University for admission is advised to undergo the screening test mentioned above so as to avoid communication of this disease,” the Osmania University said in an advisory issued to all foreign students. The university has also restricted the Chinese students from visiting their country in the immediate future.However, a few Chinese students, pursuing courses at Nizam College, are worried over their return to the country. A BCom student of Nizam College, who returned to New Delhi on February 2, has been asked to stay put in the capital for the next two weeks. “As per schedule, I returned to India on February 2.

AGRA: A group of transgenders on Monday came out in support of the traders of Sanjay Place who have been staging a protest for the past 21 days against Agra Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) administration for levying parking fee in the market.

Raising slogans and singing songs as a mark of protest against the civic body administration, a team of five transgenders declared that they would deal with the mayor, Naveen Jain , “in their own way” if the demands of the traders were not fulfilled.

Transgender Kajal Rathore said, “We are committed to supporting traders in every possible way. The AMC administration will not be allowed to exploit them. We will not let the parking mafia operate in Sanjay Place.”

On January 14, traders in Sanjay Place launched a protest against AMC administration for charging a parking fee at 38 places in the market. They claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a fee for parking at the time of purchasing the property.

Secretary of Sanjay Place Market Association Heeren Agarwal , said, “The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging the parking fee. We have already paid for the parking space. To muzzle the voice of traders, a fake FIR has been registered. We will continue our fight against the parking mafia backed by the mayor.”

The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) is sub judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final order in the matter.

Association’s treasurer Vinay Mittal alleged that despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, the AMC administration had issued parking contracts for three years to “people associated with BJP”. “AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till the AMC rolls back its decision,” he said.

PUNE: Tension gripped Tukainagar in Vadgaon Budruk on Monday afternoon, after the owner of a car wash and repair centre was fired upon. Later in the day, the Sinhagad Road police detained four of the six involved in the incident.

The suspects also damaged windshields of three cars parked at the spot, police said. Pandurang Khandu More (42) of Narhe, who escaped with no injuries, lodged a complaint with the police.

Police said all four detained were members of a local gang run by one Bunty Pawar, who has a criminal record of robbery, extortion and other body offences. Police said the suspects believed that More was a police informant.

According to the complaint, More arrived at his service centre at 2.20pm and was standing in front of it, when the six suspects came there on motorcycles. Five were armed with sharp weapons, while one brandished a firearm.

The person with the gun abused More and shot at him. More managed to duck in time. The bullet pierced the service centre’s tin enclosure. The other five men then charged at him, police said.

The complainant managed to give them the slip. “Enraged, the suspects damaged cars parked nearby,” police said. They have been booked under the charge of attempt to murder and relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act.

Photo for representative purpose only

JAIPUR: The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities in Rajasthan will organise a ‘ Nyay Sabha ’ on February 5 during which they will ask the government to ban liquor among other demands.

The other demands include reservation for SC/ST in private sector, timely release of compensation for those who are victims of atrocities, setting up of Indian Judicial Services and making provision for SCs and STs in the service.

The conference will be organised under the banner ‘SC/ST Samajik Sangathano Ki Nyay Sabha’.

“Consumption of liquor should be prohibited in Rajasthan for social uplift of SCs and STs as people belonging to these communities are the worst victims of it,” said B L Bhati, national general secretary of Rashtriya Meghwal Samaj Sangh .

“The victims of atrocities are supposed to receive 25% of the total compensation within seven days of registering an FIR, but they seldom get that. This is also one of the main issues. Despite bringing the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, it is not being implemented properly,” he added.

Bhati further said, “The state government recruits a lot of employees on contractual basis, but there is no provision for giving jobs to SCs and STs. There are about 2 lakh contractual workers in Rajasthan, but there is no reservation for SCs and STs in it.”

“Moreover, the reservation for the SCs and STs is proportional to their current population. They are still being given reservation as per 1971 census. They revised this provision for the MLAs and MPs, but they should do it for the service holders as well. The lands of SC and STs captured by the upper castes should be freed by the government. Scholarships to the SC/ST students should be provided timely,” he added.

State hangar

Bhopal: A day after Gandhi Nagar police arrested a 22-year-old youth for trespassing at Raja Bhoj Airport and vandalising a chopper, cops on Monday produced him before the court from where he was sent on police remand for five days. The accused entered the airport through state hangar gate, posing as an under training CISF commando. The on-duty security guard of special armed forces took him to be a cop and allowed entry.

Acting on a complaint filed by chief security officer of Raja Bhoj Airport, Vinod Soni, Gandhi Nagar police registered a case against the accused Yogesh Tripathi, a resident of 1100-Quarters, Arera Colony. Yogesh is pursuing BCA final year at a private college in Kolar.

Police sources said that the accused behaved like an unstable man in police custody and shouted, ‘Jai Hind’, Jai Shri Ram, Jai Mata Di with a salute to each and every police officer, who came to interrogate him. He told the cops that he had done a course in NCC. Senior officers of district police, crime branch and intelligence are interrogating him.

When the cops asked him questions, he gave bizarre answers. He said his name is blue sky, he is a bird and so on. A police officer, requesting anonymity, said that when Yogesh's father Vishwamohan Tripathi gave him green peas to eat, he ate them without pealing them. The father told police that Yogesh is quite religious. He has two sisters. His eldest sister resides in South Africa while the younger one is pursuing MCA at a Pune college. Yogesh's friends also reached Gandhi Nagar police station to meet him, but he refused to identify them. In the evening when Yogesh was tired, he sat quietly as if he was meditating, informed the sources.

Interestingly, the accused has been associated with a theatre group also and wants to take part in TV reality shows. When he entered the state hangar, his appearance was like that of a soldier. He had given himself a military haircut and was wearing camouflage trousers; it was his appearance that helped him gain entry at the airport .

Armed police teams conducted flag marches across several localities like Bandra, Sakinaka, Jogeshwari and Gore... Read More

MUMBAI: Even as Mumbai police on Monday carried out flag marches in parts of the city to show they were in control of the law and order situation , the Maharashtra government tried to persuade the organisers of the anti-CAA stir at Mumbai Central’s Mordell Road to withdraw their eight-day-long agitation.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh of NCP requested a delegation of ‘Mumbai Bagh’ representatives that they should take back their protest as it did not have any permission. He also gave them a written assurance that not a single citizen of the state would lose citizenship. “I have requested them to take back their protest as they have been sitting there for eight days without any permission. Also, I have said this multiple times that CAA and NRC will not be implemented in the state and not a single citizen of Maharashtra will have to lose citizenship,” he said.

The government has also assured the protesters it will not file any cases against them if they move out. The Nagpada police in the past week had issued notices under the preventive Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code to seven persons, all locals, warning them that if any untoward incidents took place, they would be booked.

A delegation of former and present MLAs and women representatives of the protestors met the minister on Monday after certain issues cropped up at the protest site from Saturday. Police had on Saturday tried to get the group to withdraw, without any success.

Former MLA Waris Pathan said they had asked Deshmukh to take back the notices issued to eight persons. “We will meet the core committee of the protestors and take a unanimous decision about the next step,” Pathan said. He said a decision on the manner in which the protest has to be taken back or if it can be shifted to another location would be taken in a meeting scheduled at night at the protest site outside Arabia hotel in Mumbai Central.

The women who form the core committee of the protest were closeted in a meeting on Monday night to determine their next course of action. However, the men backing the agitation said they had no plans of winding up the stir or of moving it elsewhere, and demonstrators at the site staged their sit-in well into the night.

Samajwadi Party MLA from Bhiwandi Rais Shaikh, who was also part of the delegation, said they did not want anyone to take advantage of the protest and the situation at the site, so an appropriate decision would be taken.

For their part, Mumbai police began preparing themselves for the worst by conducting flag marches in various parts of the city, which will be repeated on Tuesday. Police also revised and updated their Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for communal riots. Former IPS officers said they do not remember such an occurrence since the Mumbai riots of 1992-93. Routine flag marches are carried out before elections or prominent events. But seldom do police anticipate communal riots to break out at such times.

Monday’s flag marches came hot on the heels of violence in JNU and firing outside Jamia Milia Islamia University in Delhi and at Shaheen Bagh. The protests going on at Govandi, Madanpura and Mumbai police have prompted Mumbai police to take the preventive step, sources said.

Police remained tightlipped when asked if there was any high alert or anticipation of any untoward incident in the backdrop of anti-CAA-NRC protests at Nagpada and Deonar. “Anything can happen. We are preparing for the worst,” said an officer. “The march was carried out at the level of local police stations across the city for peace. The idea is to show visible police presence and prevent any untoward incident, particularly in sensitive pockets,” Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP Pranay Ashok said. Meanwhile, Nagpada police have deployed two CCTV vans at both ends of the ‘Mumbai Bagh’ protest to capture images from all directions. The cameras are linked to the server at the police control room.

A flag march resembles patrolling by armymen in full gear in an area where curfew has been imposed. The objective is to show presence of forces in the area in order to prevent a law and order situation.

Former Mumbai police commissioner D Sivanandhan said, “I had heard about police flag marches only during December 1992-January 1993 after the Babri Masjid demolition.”

Former Navi Mumbai commissioner KL Prasad said, “I have never heard any such flag march during the last decade in Mumbai. Even after 26/11, no flag march was carried out. The march is carried out for reassurance and to restore confidence among people who are scared of untoward incidents. Secondly, the idea is to spread fear in the minds of miscreants.”

IPS officer-turned lawyer YP Singh said, “The march could be in anticipation of any volatile situation.”

In the western suburbs, police from Bandra, D N Nagar, Meghwadi, Nirmal Nagar, Oshiwara, Sahar and Sakinaka carried out marches in vulnerable pockets on Monday. “We got instructions from the police commissioner’s office to conduct the march. It was carried out for an hour from 11.15am to 12.15pm,” an officer said.

In Mumbai North, flag marches were conducted at 5 to 6 locations including Aarey Colony, Goregaon East, Malwani etc. “The revised and updated SOP mentions what should be the line of action if a communal riot breaks out,” said Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner, north region.

Chennai: In an order that protects homebuyers ’ rights over the land of an incomplete housing project, the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority ( TNRERA ) has restrained the registration department from facilitating any deed over the property . The issue pertains to an apartment complex at Pudupakkam on Vandalur — Kelambakkam High Road on the outskirts of the city, for which two landlords gave Power of Attorney to a developer but withdrew it later over delay in completing construction.

The complaint filed by Padmalaya Apartments Buyers’ Association said ABC (India) International, a partnership firm, was the owner of the land parcel developed by Real Value Promoters Pvt. Ltd. According to the complainants, the landlords executed a deed of General Power of Attorney in favour of developer in 2011. The construction work did not reach 40% despite the homebuyers paying substantial money towards the project nor was the proportionate undivided share in the land conveyed to the buyers, the petitioners alleged.

Meanwhile, the partnership firm in 2019 issued a notice to the promoter intimating about the cancellation of Power of Attorney on various grounds including undue delay in construction. Terming the cancellation of Power of Attorney illegal, the homebuyers said they were also stakeholders of the property. “In view of the cancellation, there is ample chance of disposal of the property. If they are allowed to proceed further in this regard, it would cause grave, irreparable prejudice and hardship to homebuyers,” the complainants said.

In the order delivered by TNRERA on Thursday, the realty regulator restrained the partnership firm from selling, mortgaging, leasing or parting with the physical possession of the property. “Further, considering the urgency and plight of the homebuyers, the authority directs the concerned sub-registrar office not to register the property until further orders,” it added.

HYDERABAD: Beginning the new academic year, recruiting faculty without verifying the genuineness of their certificate, might cost a college management dearly. As per the draft Affiliation Procedure and Regulations released by the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad ( JNTU H), for 2020-21, colleges can even lose their course recognition or affiliation for recruiting ‘fake faculty’.The varsity has made managements solely responsible for appointing faculty with fraudulent or unrecognised degree certificates and said that this can be reason enough for initiating punitive action against any college. “Punitive action can include rejection/suspension/withdrawal of grant of affiliation,” read the draft affiliation rules.Reacting to this norm, college managements said JNTU must put in place a mechanism to verify certificates, instead of putting the onus on colleges. “When candidates mention that they completed their PhD from some obscure college in Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh, we are very careful as these colleges have a reputation for issuing fake certificates. But in the recent past, we even come across candidates who have furnished fake certificates from institutes like IITs or other reputed colleges. There is no way we can verify the genuineness of these certificates,” said K Ramadas, convener, Telangana Private Colleges Managements Association adding that JNTU should take the responsibility of verifying such gaps.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73931371,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-198799,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/recruiting-faculty-with-fake-certs-to-cost-jntu-dearly/articleshow/73915266.cms

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha passed the order on the plea moved by R Varaaki.

According to the petitioner, though the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) has been passed by both the houses of the Parliament and approved by the President, agitations are ongoing across the country, causing law and order situation.

“It is unfortunate that the student community, which is supposed to set an example of development of the country, has fallen prey to certain organisations backing the protests,” the petitioner said.

202,['4/02/2020'],"They defeated cancer, but could not defeat myths","This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: When this 35-year-old teacher (name withheld) was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago, she was devastated like any other person. But she took heart when her husband, a professor in a renowned college, supported her in fighting the disease. He used to take great care of her during the six-months of chemotherapy and radiation cycles.

She endured the painful treatment helped by rediscovery of her husband’s love. She emerged victorious and was the happiest woman with a caring husband and thinking of a new life ahead. But, what welcomed her when she reached home was a bunch of divorce papers.

“My husband requested me with folded hands to sign them. He said he did his duty as a husband in the last six months. In return, he was asking me to free him from this relationship. He said it was not possible for him anymore to see his wife in me,” she said.

Many women like her who have won their battle against cancer have lost their families, marriages and are suffering from psychological problems due to stigma prevailing even among the educated.

Cancer is second most common non-communicable disease (NCD) after cardiovascular diseases. Health community concentrates on early detection and treatment of cancer. But experts hardly speak about its after-effects.

Cancer counsellor at Nagpur’s RST Hospital Manjiri Joshi said after-effects were often neglected. “A 27-year-old cancer survivor is fighting a divorce case in court. Her husband and in-laws don’t want her to be a part of their family. As she is not agreeing to divorce, her husband once even tried to kill her in court premises,” she said. As cancer cannot be the ground for divorce, in-laws have levelled many derogatory allegations against such women in courts which is even more painful for them, Joshi added.

On the eve of World Cancer Day, three women cancer survivors undergoing psychological rehabilitation treatment spoke about their trauma to TOI. An art graduate in her mid-30s said she was thrown out of the house on the night her breast cancer reports came positive. Joshi said many of these women went into depression due to such behaviour of family members.

“These are some extreme cases. In many families though, relatives either start giving special treatment or neglecting cancer survivors which makes them lonely and isolated. The need is to educate family-members as well,” she said.

This phenomenon is not restricted to India. according to figures from Macmillan Cancer Support, one in seven relationships break down after a cancer diagnosis.

203,['4/02/2020'],Path cleared for Shapoorji Pallonji firm to work on south Mumbai’s priciest SRA project,"This story is from February 4, 2020

The vast slum sprawl at Cuffe Parade

MUMBAI: Three years after the SC paved the way for authorities to approve one of the most valuable slum redevelopment projects at Cuffe Parade in south Mumbai , the apex grievance redressal committee under the Slums Act on Monday upheld the initial permissions granted to real estate giant Shapoorji Pallonji ’s wholly owned subsidiary, Precaution Properties Pvt Ltd, in 2017.

The project on a 28-acre sprawl south of the World Trade Centre—subject to further approvals for plans and commencement certificate from SRA—will mark the launch of Mumbai’s most valuable slum rehabilitation in recent times. There are over 6,000 hutments and 45,000 slumdwellers estimated to reside in the densely packed slum.

Under the project, the developer has to pay 25% of the ready reckoner value as land premium to the state. It is estimated to work out to in excess of Rs 1,100 crore, said the developer’s lawyer Cherag Balsara.

The letter of intent (LOI) of November 2017 issued to the developer put the eligible hutments for rehabilitation at 2,670 in the slums of Ganesh Murti Nagar, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Nagar and Colaba Rajjak to the south of the World Trade Centre on Sadhu D L Vasvani Marg at Cuffe Parade.

In 2018, developer Dyna Estate Pvt Ltd through its director Naveed Siddiqui and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Nagar Cooperative Housing Society spread over 7,000 metres (under two acres) had filed an application before the apex grievance redressal committee to challenge the acceptance of a proposal by Precaution Properties in 2013 to implement the SRA project and the letter of intent in November 2017 to the Shapoorji Group company as being “illegal.’’

The committee was originally appointed under the orders of the Bombay HC to address grievances of slumdwellers and builders against planning authorities such as Slum rehabilitation authority (SRA), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), civic body and MMRDA. It was later brought under the Slum Act.

The company claims to have 84% support of the eligible slumdwellers. The land belongs to the state government, says the LOI.

The Shapoorji Pallonji group said its proposal was pending since 2012. The lawyers for Dyna and the Slum society, Mayur Khandeparkar and Arun Panicker, argued that the LOI was “illegal’’ and granted without the requisite 70% consent of slumdwellers and cited several other grounds including reduction in number of slum dwellers and lack of survey by the authority. Balsara who appeared for Precaution, refuted the allegations and questioned the other developer’s locus to be heard when he said the matter had already traversed all the way to the Supreme Court earlier.

The committee had in February 2018 observed that there was no case made out for any interim relief to Dyna Estate but noted there was an urgency and hence it “requested the CEO of SRA to scrutinize and submit a factual report on the Slum scheme within a month.’’

Two years later, the committee headed by Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of the state housing department, dismissed the applications finding “no substance’’ in them. It also dismissed another application filed by Prashant Ghadge, president of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Nagar CHS and Shree Ganesh Murti Nagar. The committee also had as its members Deepak Kapoor, chief executive officer SRA; Milind Mhaiskar, ex vice-president of Mhada; A Jarhad, additional municipal commissioner; and Sanjay Khandare, additional commissioner, MMRDA (who was absent).

The project has had a chequered history with another developer having taken the dispute with Precaution Properties to the apex court in 2013 where an order was passed in 2017. The committee was of the view that the “bona fides of Precaution Properties is clear from the records with which it prosecuted the matters before the Supreme Court…’’ and the committee said it did not concur with a report of the SRA, CEO submitted in December 2018, before it.

Panicker, when contacted, said, “We will study the order and consider challenging it.’’

Civil work at the Sanganer Airport is on and authorities plan to provide international-standard facilities

JAIPUR: With the increasing congestion and passenger load at terminal 2 of the Jaipur airport , the Airports Authority of India ( AAI ) is planning to utilise the Sanganer airport for handling international flights.

By July, the Pink City is likely to have separate airports — terminal 2 and Sanganer airport, to handle the domestic and international flights. Civil work at the Sanganer airport is on and authorities claim to cater to international-standard facilities. Also, the airport authorities have written to the Jaipur Development Authority ( JDA ) for the extension of the road in front of Sanganer airport to have smooth traffic for international passengers landing in the city.

Authorities close to the development at the Jaipur airport on TOI said the civil work at the Sanganer airport is in progress and the airport is going to get a facelift.

“We are aiming at completing the work by April so that we may further apply for various clearances and commissioning from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). We are handling 72 flights per day and by December we had handled at least 4.75 lakh passengers. Thus, we had aimed for the bifurcation of domestic and international flight operations,” said Jaideep Singh Balhara on Monday.

Sanganer airport, which had an area of 5,000 square metres will have an area of 11,750 square metres and 10 check-in counters, eight immigration counters, divyang-friendly, two boarding gates and other passenger amenities. “The use of two airports for separate flights will also enable us to handle more flights as we may have more than 100 flights operating from the two airports in total after the opening of the Sanganer airport,” said a senior officer of civil engineering wing of the Jaipur airport.

The AAI officials are also in touch with the Jaipur Development Authority to plan the expansion of the road in front of the Sanganer airport. “The width of the road needs to be increased and we are in touch with JDA and other departments so that international tourists coming to the city get smooth traffic,” said an officer.

JAIPUR: Soon, each and every case of cancer will be registered in the state as the health department is planning to sign an MoU with Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ), Bangalore, which will provide a software to the health department to register each case of cancer along with other details such as part of body, stage of cancer at the time of diagnoses.

Cancer has emerged as one of the non-communicable diseases, which has attracted attention of the health authorities. The state-of-the-art government’s cancer hospital is all set to get inaugurated.

At a time when studies suggest that 70% of cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, the state government does not have the actual figures of cancer cases and actual burden of disease in the state.

In the state, there are only six hospitals including government and private, which have their own hospital-based registry of cancer. However, the health department is planning to prepare a population-based registry to find out the actual burden of different kinds of cancers in the state, said a health department official.

The health department has no details of the actual number of patients suffering from different kinds of cancers such as cervical, gall bladder, oral, head and neck, lung, stomach, colorectal, and oesophagus whereas in females, breast cancer, cervix cancer and ovarian cancer in the state. With the new cancer registry, the health department will be able to find out the actual number of patients of each kind of cancer in the state.

The official said that cancer has been declared a notifiable disease but as they want a paperless registry (online registry), they are taking the help of ICMR, Bangalore.

All those patients, tested positive for cancer through histopathological examination will get registered. The health department is planning to get the details of all the cancer patients online from hospitals who are diagnosed with cancer through histopathological examination to find the actual burden of the disease, which would help in preparing policies for benefitting cancer patients in future.

Talking about the prevalence of cancer in the country, Dr Divesh Goyal , senior consultant, medical oncology , of a private hospital, said, “Eighty per cent people in the country consult with a doctor when recovery is difficult, also 71% death caused at the age of 32-69 years. Due to late detection of cancer 70% of the people die in the first year, whereas 15% die because of lifestyle factors, obesity and tobacco use, and other 15% cancers in minors.”

Aurangabad: The draw held to fix category of wards on Monday did not bring good news for many office-bearers in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) including the mayor, deputy mayor, standing committee chair and former deputy mayor. These bigwigs have already started looking for other wards for themselves.

Over the past five years, the office-bearers have tried to ensure maximum development in their respective election wards — to solidify their re-elected chances. However, their aspirations received a jolt with the ward reservations.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele’s current ward of Itkheda has now been reserved for women (general). This means Ghodele cannot contest from Itkheda. It is being speculated that Ghodele may field a woman family member from the ward.

Rajendra Janjal, who was elected deputy mayor in December, has lost his existing Shivaji Nagar ward to SC reservation. When asked about his future strategy, Janjal said, “I am also an office-bearer of Yuva Sena, the Shiv Sena’s youth wing. So, even if I do not contest, I can work for the party’s seats,” he said.

The Jawahar Colony ward, from where standing committee chairperson Jaishree Kulkarni is a corporator, has now been reserved for the backward class of citizens (BCC). Vijay Autade, who had quit the post of deputy mayor in December, had also suffered due to the reservations allotted to wards. His current ward of Mayur Park got SC-women reservation. AMC House leader Vikas Jain cannot contest from Vedant Nagar as it has been kept for women (general.

Bijnor: Close to 20,000 birds were counted during the two-day bird festival organized at Haiderpur Wetland. Besides, 267 species were also identified. Apart from the birds, swamp deer and otters were also spotted in wetland areas. Bird watchers from Delhi, NCR and nearby districts participated in identifying various avian species and in the bird census.

Last year, as many as 238 bird species were sighted in Bijnor and neighbouring wetland areas. Of the total bird species, 96 were migratory birds and 139 were resident birds. This time, said officials, more than 20,000 birds were counted comprising 267 species, 29 more than last year.

Giving details, VK Jain, forest conservator, Saharanpur, claimed, “We have sighted 29 more species than last year. What is also encouraging is that we have spotted otters and swamp deer in the wetland. The rare Orphean warbler, White tailed eagle, Brahminy kite and Penduline tits were spotted in the wetland for the first time.”

UP Singh, secretary of water resources UP Singh, Ravi Singh, CEO, WWF of India, Sanjay Kumar, divisional commissioner of Saharanpur, Suraj Kumar, Muzaffarnagar DFO, M Semmaran, Bijnor DFO, and other officials took part in the two-day event.

Haiderpur is a floodplain wetland formed by Madhya Ganga Barrage in Muzaffarnagar, adjoining Bijnor Ganga Barrage. It is a part of Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. It is fed by rivers Ganga and Solani.

Of late, the UP government has also taken steps to transform a part of this area into a biodiversity park by installing watchtowers and paving trails. According to officials, at present, Haiderpur covers more than 3,000 acres and comprises 15 km of nature trails, 12 viewing points and one watchtower.

Last year in February, the first bird census was conducted here. A total of 19,784 birds were counted in the wetlands and backwaters of the Ganga. The three-hour census had involved seven teams that counted the avian species in Haiderpur and its surrounding wetlands, which is part of the 2,074 sq km Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary.

Aurangabad: The draw of lots to fix the reservation of candidates, who can contest from each of the 115 wards of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in the upcoming civic elections, was held on Monday under the guidance of the state election commission.

The drawing of lots was held publicly at the auditorium of the Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) by the AMC in presence of municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey and EC observers Avinash Sanas, Atul Jadhav and Pradeep Parab.

The total population of the city is 12.38 lakh. Of them, 2.38 lakh people account for the scheduled caste (SC) category and 16,000 for the scheduled tribe (ST) category. Based on the population, of the 115 AMC wards, 22 have been reserved for SC candidates, 2 for ST, 31 backward class of citizens (BCC or OBC). The remaining 60 seats are open. There are a total of 58 seats reserved for women — 11 for SC women, 1 for an ST woman, 16 for OBC women and 30 in the general women’s category.

Municipal commissioner Pandey said the draw of lots was held impartially and in accordance with the rules.

The EC had already fixed which of the wards will be reserved for the SC and ST candidates. Based on the women’s reservations in the last three AMC general elections — in 2005, 2010 and 2015 — six of the 22 SC wards and 1 of 2 ST wards were reserved for women under these categories. The remaining 5 SC women wards were decided by drawing of lots.

As many as 23 wards were directly reserved for BCC/OBC candidates, as they were not reserved for them in the past three polls.

The draws were held to decide the remaining 8 OBC wards. 16 of the BCC women wards were decided based on their reservations in the previous elections.

The remaining wards went to the general category candidates. The general women category was decided based on reservations of the previous three elections and on the draw.

AMC officials A B Deshmukh and Sanjeev Sonar moderated the draws.

File photo of protest at Saudagar Park in Tandalja

Vadodara: A day after a pandal was removed and electricity connection snapped at the protest site in Tandalja, an individual wrote an application to city police informing about gathering of women at a private plot to protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The office of police commissioner received the application on Monday morning informing that women from Saudagar Park and neighbouring residential societies of Tandalja will be gathering at a private common plot. Police said that the application has not been moved by any group or an organization but an individual and it is currently under process.

However, sources among the protesters told TOI that the application has not been done to seek permission for gathering but only to inform cops. “Since it is private premises and we will not be using loudspeakers, we do not need any permission from the police. The application is a way of informing them that the women are going to gather in a private premise so we should not be harassed this time,” said a person involved in mobilizing the women.

“We have received the application of the gathering at the private plot and it is being evaluated,” said inspector D K Vaghela of JP Road police station.

On Sunday, police had said that the organizers who had held protests on Saturday will be facing action as they had not sought permission for the sit-in. The pandal was removed on Sunday morning by the supplier as he was asked for the facility only for a day and that too for a private program and the electricity was also disconnected.

The women, however, continued with their sit-in when the cops began looking for the organizers, no one claimed responsibility for the dharna.

The youth was kept in the special ward for swine flu patients at the civil hospital in Chhatarpur

BHOPAL: A suspected patient of corona virus was quarantined in Chattarpur for three days from February 1 to 3 after which he was advised to go home and remain in isolation. A medical student in China, the boy is suffering from cold and other related symptoms. He was kept in the special ward for swine flu patients at the civil hospital of Chattarpur which was later converted isolation ward for suspected cases of coronavirus.

A resident of Naugaon , Abhishek Rajput had returned from China on January 14. “After I returned on January 14, I caught cold. As I had returned from China, I thought it better to get myself medically examined in Naugaon. The doctors in my city sent me to the Chattarpur civil hospital,” he told the local press.

Almost after 24 hours of isolation, Rajput went missing from the ward on Sunday triggering panic in the hospital. However, few hours later he returned to the isolation ward.

A student of final year MBBS in China, Rajput said ,”First of all, this is not an isolation ward, but swine flue ward and is so dirty that humans can’t stay here. I am absolutely normal but I have been forced to live here because of the government norms.”

The civil surgeon of Chattarpur Dr RK Tripthi said, “He seems to be fully fit, but as precautionary measure he was kept in the isolation ward. Nasal and throat swabs and blood samples were sent to a the medical college in Sagar, which would send the samples to NIV, Pune. We kept him in isolation because we have to follow the protocol”. However, he denied that the ward is dirty. Since it is located in the old building, the whitewash on the wall may look bad but the room is clean.”

On Monday evening, Rajput was allowed to leave the hospital with an advise to remain in isolation at his home.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday accused the BJP leadership of provoking firing incidents in the capital to polarise the electorate to win the assembly elections, asserting that anti-CAA-NRC protests were about constitutional values while BJP’s actions were about arrogance of power.

Gaurav Gogoi, Congress’s lead speaker in the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address, demanded that Union minister Anurag Thakur, who was briefly barred by the EC from campaigning in the Delhi polls for his rally cry “desh ke gaddaron ko...”, be booked under relevant laws and banned from contesting elections.

He said young boys had suddenly surfaced in Delhi, firing at protesters and students. “Who is pulling the trigger? Is it the boy who held the gun? I don’t think so. The persons who pulled the trigger are the ministers provoking that boy,” he added.

Gogoi alleged that provocative ministers and Delhi Police , which had failed to curb violence in the election campaign, were under directions from the BJP leadership. He said police could not prevent the firing incidents but had earlier entered university campuses and beat up students and professors. He said the culprits behind the violence in JNU had not yet been arrested.

“You may threaten us or shoot us, but people will not be afraid,” he said, referring to BJP.

DMK’s T R Baalu alleged that CAA was brought because the government wanted to discriminate among people. BSP’s Ritesh Pandey called CAA-NRC “divisive” and accused BJP of realising the dream of Jinnah.

While BJD steered clear of the CAA-NRC debate, its MP Pinaki Misra demanded that OBCs should also be enumerated in the upcoming Census.

Trinamool Congress's Mohua Moitra dubbed CAA-NPR-NRC the “biggest betrayal” of Indians. P V Midhun Reddy of YSRCP said his party was opposed to the NRC-NPR, and the government should not create insecurity among minorities. P K Kunhalikutty of IUML accused BJP of playing the “communal” card in Delhi.

Hardik Kher

VADODARA: A jail sepoy at Vadodara Central Jail was arrested on Monday for smuggling a SIM card inside the jail premises for Rs 500.

The accused Hardik Kher had taken the money from wife of an undertrial prisoner to pass on the SIM card to him. Police said that Kher’s name was revealed during interrogation of the undertrial Yogendra Mahida’s wife Priyanka Mahida.

According to police, Kher had approached Priyanka when she had come to jail to meet her husband. He had told her that he can smuggle a SIM card inside the jail for her husband and will charge a nominal amount of Rs 500. Cops could reach till Priyanka while they were going through call detail records of the SIM card which was found with a mobile phone in November last year.

“The undertrial had borrowed phone from another accused inside the jail and he only needed a SIM card to talk to his wife and other family members from the jail so an understanding was reached with the jail sepoy to bring in the SIM card,” said a police official. He added that Kher is being interrogated if he had smuggled any more sim cards or any other prohibited items inside the jail in the past.

Kher worked in the Group IX of state reserve police force at Lalbaug for 18 months before being selected for jail sepoy’s post a year ago.

217,['4/02/2020'],AMC unlikely to collect user fee for waste before polls,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Aurangabad: With the elections just around the corner, the civic administration is likely to defer the drive of collecting a user fee from citizens for waste collection.

Incidentally, the municipal corporations are authorised to collect a user fee from residents and commercial establishments for doorstep waste collection. In August 3, 2018, the general body of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) passed a resolution to impose user fee on those availing the benefit of the civic body’s waste collection service.

The resolution mandates households to pay Re 1 a day i.e Rs 365 a year to the civic body for waste collection. Small commercial units are to be charged Rs 730 a year and hotels and bigger commercial units Rs 10 to 100 every year depending on the quantum of waste produced.

A decision was taken to implement the collection of user fee after the private agency engaged for waste collection began its services. The agency started its work in February 2019. Subsequently, the AMC had decided to appoint an agency for collecting user fee.

During his budget presentation for the fiscal 2019-2020 in June 2019, former municipal commissioner Nipun Vinayak had enunciated that collecting a user fee from waste producers was one of the key measures to improve the financial situation of the civic body.

Incidentally, user fee for waste collection is one of the parameters on which cities are scored in the nationwide cleanliness survey Swachh Survekshan. The civic administration aspires to finish in top 100 cities in the cleanliness survey this year.

The decision had evoked mixed reactions from residents. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena protested against the civic body for putting ‘financial burden on residents’. According to residents, apart from Swachh Bharat cess of 0.5%, they were also paying for cleanliness charges along with property tax. However, in the wake of the forthcoming general elections of the AMC, the imposition of user fee seems unlikely before April.

Since taking charge of his office in December, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey has repeatedly stressed on taking steps to improve the financial condition of the civic body. When asked, assistant commissioner and tax officer Karan Chavan said that he was not aware of the user fee collection and that he would seek the details of the resolution passed by the general body.

Mohan Bhagwat in Bhopal on Monday

BHOPAL: Aiming to make its presence felt on social media to attract more youths who could play a crucial role in generating social awareness, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat began his three-day interaction here in the state capital on Monday.

During three-day convention, Bhagwat is likely to make youths aware and review the impact of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, abrogation of Article 370 and Ram Temple construction in Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh , considered as nurseries of saffron ideology.

“Sarsanghchalakji, held interactions with the pracharaks (publicity in-charge) from MP and Chhattisgarh on the first day and discussed on issues related to youths, their active participation on social media and role as Sangh Parivar volunteers. Bhagwatji will focus on various other issues during deliberations with the ‘vibhag pracharaks’ and members of BJP and other frontal organisations on the second and last day of his stay,” said Omprakash Sisodia, regional publicity in-charge of RSS’s Madhya Bharat region.

Sources in BJP disclosed that during interaction with workers and BJP leaders, the RSS chief is most likely to discuss public response to the decisions taken by the Narendra Modi government and the ongoing protests against the CAA.

The Sangh’s three-day programme is being seen as an effort to quell dissent among people against the new citizenship law and ramp up support for the decisions taken by the Union government. The pracharaks will be handed over district-wise plans to reach out to youths, sources added.

The Sangh Parivar is also concerned about growing influence of Congress through its ‘soft-Hindutva’ agenda in the Madhya Bharat region. “There is an impression in the public about the ‘soft-Hindutva’ propagated by the Kamal Nath government in MP. The decisions on constructing cow shelters, funding Sita Mata temple in Sri Lanka, organising Ramleelas in villages, construction of Ram Van Gaman Path through a trust and the development of the Narmada Yatra route have created a deep impact among the public about Congress’s religious sentiments. They need to be discussed,” disclosed a senior RSS cadre.

The Sangh Parivar is also upset over declining BJP base in MP and other neighbouring states. Discussions on BJP leadership and growing resentment among grassroots workers would be held on the second and third day of the convention.

Bhagwat is also likely to review the work and roadmap of RSS affiliates, including the students’ wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). A similar meeting of RSS pracharaks of Madhya Bharat region was held here five years ago, sources said.

The superstar mentioned that he was born here and spent his childhood in Indore and went to school in Gwalior.Interacting with the media, Salman said that when he was first told that IIFA will be held in Indore, he thought the organisers were saying ‘indoor’ as it had not crossed his mind that the event can also be organised in MP.“When the organisers clarified that they were talking about Indore, it was a pleasant surprise for me. I was very happy,” Salman said.Speaking about hosting IIFA in the state, Salman said, “Since CM Kamal Nath is giving rebates on shooting films in MP, more and more producers and actors have started coming here. When a film crew comes to any city, we are just here with our 300 people and equipment. The resources and food are all provided by the state, which boosts economic activity. We also hire local artistes for roles and it has a huge impact on a city. The cities here have a lot of beautiful locations and when a city is featured in a film, the tourism of that place automatically increases.”Appreciating CM Nath’s energy and enthusiasm, the superstar said, “I cannot call him my elder brother and will have to call him my younger brother because he is a young CM for his young state. MP will not get a younger CM than him because he stands up to every occasion.”Actress Jacqueline Fernandez , who visited Bhopal for the first time said that she was looking forward to visiting the Tribal Museum and trying the local cuisines.“I did not expect the city to be so beautiful and clean. During my flight I was told that it is the ‘City of Lakes’ and when I landed, I was really surprised to see that Bhopal is so green.

Meerut: A total of 47 members of Popular Front of India (PFI) have been arrested in Meerut zone as police in region leads the crackdown in terms of arrests made in past 4-5 days. According to senior police officials, 75 members of the organisation have been identified as suspects and action has been taken against 47 in Meerut zone. Throughout Uttar Pradesh, police arrested 108 PFI members in the last four days for their alleged involvement in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a senior official said in Lucknow on Monday. The arrests are in addition to the 25 made earlier, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told reporters.

“The way these protests turned and spread in sensitive regions of west UP districts, it was clearly premeditated and backed by the organisation. PFI’s name had emerged in the initial probe when inciting posters were found. The magnitude of these protests has also led us to links of funding by vested interests to promote unrest. We are looking at all angles in our probe and keeping a close watch on all suspects possibly involved in fuelling the protests,” Prashant Kumar, additional director general (Meerut zone) said.

In Meerut zone, which comprises nine districts, 21 PFI members have been arrested from Meerut, nine from Ghaziabad, 10 from Shamli, six from Muzaffarnagar and one from Hapur. Apart from the Meerut zone, 14 were arrested in Lucknow, 20 in Varanasi, 16 in Bahraich, three in Sitapur, four in Bijnor, five in Kanpur and one each in Gonda and Jaunpur.

In Bijnor, the four arrested were identified as Nassiruddin, Aarif, Dilshad and Idrees. According to the police, booklets and pamphlets with inflammatory content were recovered from them. Several booklets of cash receipts of donations sought were also recovered along with the incendiary literature.

“To avoid police surveillance, the accused used to communicate through WhatsApp chats and calls and used to seek donations through cash receipts. They wanted to turn the localities here into Shaheen Bagh,” an official press release from the police department in Bijnor said.

In December 2019, UP Police had sought a ban on PFI, suspecting the organisation’s complicity in the statewide violent protests against the CAA on December 20. “We have written to the Union home ministry, recommending that the PFI should be banned,” then UP DGP OP Singh had said.

The department had claimed that they had ample proof of PFI activists’ involvement in the recent violence. “We have evidence of PFI’s involvement in violence and mobilization of protesters. Not only have the outfit’s members been arrested from Lucknow, Meerut and Shamli, their role has also been ascertained through electronic footprint and data extraction technique,” Singh had said.

The PFI was formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF). Security agencies have alleged its leaders have been groomed in the SIMI ideology.

226,['4/02/2020'],Forest dept plans no fruit bat-coronavirus link campaign,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Meerut: Days after a youth allegedly killed a fruit bat perched on a tree near his house in Shivlok Colony here, believing that it is responsible for spreading the dreaded coronavirus, the forest division has taken up the task of launching a campaign to make people, especially schoolchildren, aware that there is no link between this nocturnal mammal. The viral infection that has taken a toll of 360 people in China, the country of the deadly virus originated.

The reason for killing is being attributed to social media reports that the coronavirus permeated humans through the bat soup which is widely consumed in China.

The fruit bat, also known as Indian Flying Fox, is one of the largest species of bats found in South Asia. It mainly lives on ripe fruits and is not a carnivorus. The fruit bat is a part of the megabat family. All megabat species are listed as “threatened” by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Some species are listed as “critically endangered”, “endangered”, and “vulnerable”.

Following the killing of the bat, Meerut divisional forest officer Aditi Sharma said, “Although the killing of the bat is an isolated incident, we have to prevent the escalation, particularly in the backdrop of conflicting media reports. It is still to be proved that a bat is responsible for the spread of coronavirus. There is no authenticity in social media reports. So, we will educate masses, especially schoolchildren, not to fall in the trap.”

The coronavirus scare is escalating in the country after three people tested positive in Kerala. The virus has spread to two dozen countries and WHO has also declared the crisis a global health emergency. Soon after the outbreak of the deadly viral disease, reports began emerging connecting it to bat soup, which is quite common in China so much so that a video of a woman consuming the soup also went viral.

Meerut: Nearly a year after new vehicles started coming with high security registration plates, now vehicles made before April 2019, too, will be able to get these plates from their dealers. These number plates have high security features such that they cannot be tampered with or removed as they have a special lock system in place.

The registration plates are made of aluminium and will have unique features with a nine-digit code. This code will help trace any history of challans on this vehicle number.

“Now, vehicles made before April 2019 can get high security number plates too. High security number plates for vehicles made after April 2019 was a mandatory step taken across the country last year. However, earlier there was no mechanism in place to get these number plates for vehicles made before April 2019. But now, vehicle owners can approach their dealers to get these number plates,” said Meerut regional transport officer Vijay Kumar.

Earlier, all the vehicle dealers were instructed to make sure that the new vehicles being purchased should have high security registration plates. These plates are to be provided by the manufacturer of the vehicle to the dealer via the vendor. But now, these number plates can be taken for older vehicles, too, from the dealers concerned.

The registration plate is made of aluminium and will have unique features with a nine-digit code. This code will help trace any history of challans on this vehicle number. It will also have built-in GPS system.

“This step will prevent tampering with number plates as people used to make designs to create a fancy number plate – which cannot be done now. It has a lock of sorts, which if tried to be broken, will also remove the chassis number. It will have a hot stamp chromium based hologram logo and will be printed on a superior grade reflective sheet. While for new vehicles, the price of the plates is included in the cost of the vehicle, but its cost will be taken separately for four-wheelers and two-wheelers which is Rs 334 and Rs 111 respectively,” added Kumar.

Meerut: The anti-corruption body arrested a Nagar Palika staffer red-handed while accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh in Hapur’s Pilakhua area on Tuesday. A trap was set after a contractor alleged the accused, Vinod Kumar, was demanding Rs 1 lakh to approve pending bills for 13 projects. A FIR under suitable sections was registered at Hapur Kotwali police station.

The complainant, Madeep Sharma, resident of Modinagar in Ghaziabad, used to work on behalf of his sister Deepa Sharma, who is a registered contractor at Pilakhua’s Nagar Palika. Madeep approached Meerut’s anti-corruption unit with his allegation, following which, a trap was set.

Bijnor: A 22-year-old woman, who went missing on Sunday night, was found dead at Malan River in Bijnor’s Mandawar area on Monday morning.

The missing woman, whose father met with an accident recently and is said to be in a critical condition, was scheduled to get married on Tuesday. The woman’s mother had also passed away a few years ago. While, prima facie, police are claiming it to be a case of suicide, they are also not ruling out any foul play. Police have sent the body to district hospital for postmortem, and have started a probe.

The woman went missing around 11pm on Sunday. Family members and neighbours initially tried to trace her, but failed in their effort. Villagers also launched a search operation on Monday morning.

However, a passer-by spotted her body stuck at one of the pillars of the bridge over Malan River near Rawali village. Malan is a tributary which passes through the deceased’s village. Police, upon receiving information, rushed to the spot. A large number of villagers then gathered and identified the woman.

According to a villager, the woman’s father had sustained injuries two days ago in a road accident when he was on his way to a market to purchase wedding materials for his daughter. He is undergoing treatment now. The woman, who was about to get married to a man of a village under Jalilpur block, was terribly upset after her father’s accident.

He was the panchayat president of Sankarapalayam panchayat.

A total of eight cases including a murder case were pending against him at the Velli Tirupur police station, a police officer said.

“While Radhakrishnan was talking with a few people on Andhiyur-Burgur Road, a Scarpio stopped near him and four people got out it. They started hacking him using sickles. After ensuring that the victim had died, the gang fled from the spot,” Erode SP Sakthi Ganesh said.

Visakhapatnam: Officials of the prohibition and excise department are investigating links between ganja cultivators from Idukki district in Kerala and tribals in Vizag Agency upon receiving credible information that smugglers from the Agency have recruited cultivators from Idukki.

Speaking to TOI, deputy excise commissioner T Srinivasa Rao said some persons from the Idukki valley, supported by local tribal farmers, had set up ganja plantations in the hinterlands of the Agency and along the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) and were making profits. “We are collecting information from various sources to establish links between persons from Kerala and Agency area tribals involved in cultivating ganja in remote areas,” Srinivasa Rao said.

Police sources said ganja cultivators from Kerala have also taken land on lease from tribal farmers. Along with ganja, cultivators are also extracting hashish oil, the demand for which has been growing among users.

“We have nabbed over 50 inter-state ganja smugglers, including some persons from Kerala, in Vizag city in the past few years. Our investigation ends with the arrest of the smugglers but there is a need to investigate further into the trade to identify the big sharks,” said ACP (task force) A Trinad Rao. “Some ganja smugglers are also trying to introduce hashish oil, which will bring them huge profits,” Rao added.

Police and excise officials said there is a high demand for cannabis cultivated in Vizag with prices for one kilogram ranging between Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 in Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and other metros. The cannabis grown in the Agency tracts is of superior quality and second only to Idukki Gold, the strain that originates in Idukki. Once a hub of ganja cultivation, cultivators from Idukki district are now setting up plantations in the Agency and along the AOB after enforcement agencies in Kerala came down on cultivators.

For inter-state smugglers from Kerala and even Tamil Nadu and a few Agency farmers though, ganja cultivation has emerged as a major source of income.

“It is difficult to root out ganja cultivation in tribal pockets in Vizag Agency as the inter-state smugglers are investing in plantations and hiring out experts and getting good returns,” said B Lokanadham, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

Indore: The Jal Mahotsav at Hanuwantiya backwaters has been extended till February 16 amid conducive weather and fresh enquiries ahead of the approaching Valentine’s Day.

The month-long Jal Mahotsav was scheduled to conclude on February 3 but the state tourism department and event organisers announced to extend the event for over 10 days.

Hiteshwar Singh, a partner at the event organising company hosting Jal Mahotsav said, “Looking at the weather condition and enquires for coming weekends, the date was extended. We are hoping for some encouraging footfall in these dates though water activities will continue throughout the year.”

MP tourism department in November 2019 had leased out the land at Hanuwantiya backwaters to an event management company for five years. As per the contract, the tourism department gave them land and fixed infrastructure to host the Jal Mahotsav for another four years.

Officials and organising team were anticipating the footfall to remain around 3.5 lakh tourists this year during the month but the event fetched lukewarm response amid lack of promotional activities.

An official from the state tourism department wishing anonymity said, “The footfall was not as we anticipated, mainly because people were not aware of the event and attractions at this place. We plan to do extensive promotion for next year’s event so that we get a better response from people.”

Lack of proper road connectivity and infrastructure gaps also led to poor tourist response and bookings at the tent city that has 104 tents in different categories spread across five acres, said sources.

The organisers plan to host Jal Mahotsav every year at the backwaters while water sports and adventure activities will run throughout the year.

Singh said, “From now onwards, we plan to host Jal Mahotsav every year and next Mahotsav will start in mid-December. The tent city will be there for two to three months of which one month will be celebrated as Jal Mahotsav.”

NGOs unhappy with tender components

More ABC centres

BENGALURU: With the stray dog population increasing rapidly, BBMP is set to write to Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) seeking relaxation in animal birth control (ABC) programme norms as it’s unable to get agencies on board to neuter canines under the prevailing regime.As per the latest stray dog census figures released last December, around 1.4 lakh canines have to neutered. This figure is 46% of the estimated stray dog population in the city.AWBI rules mandate the programme be conducted only by non-governmental organisations or animal welfare bodies.However, the civic agency’s expression of interest (EOI) notifications have been getting poor response from not-for-profits.For example, in Bommanahalli and east zones, the Palike floated a tender thrice in the past few months but no one has come forward to catch, sterilise and immunise stray dogs. A senior BBMP official said: “We will urge AWBI to allow us to make use of veterinarians’ services to conduct the ABC programme,” he added.Animal welfare NGOs, on the other hand, say they’re not happy with components of the tender floated by BBMP. “It has fixed Rs 1,200 for neutering a dog and Rs 150 per dog for administering anti-rabies vaccination. While the cost factor is manageable, there aren’t many shelters in the city to conduct the operations. On the other hand, shelters owned by NGOs can conduct only a limited number of operations per day. Nobody wants to take the risk,” said Pranamya K, an animal activist.BBMP officials say they have plans to increase the number of ABC centres where neutering operations are done and dogs are kept under observation before being released on their home turfs. “Currently, we have only one ABC centre per zone. Given that the latest census figures put the dog population at 3 lakh, we need at least three-four centres per zone or one per assembly constituency. We are working to set up more units,” said an official.Goa-based Worldwide Veterinary Service Centre (WVSC) conducted the census in December. The last such exercise was conducted seven years ago.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73921193,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-617464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/palike-to-seek-relaxation-of-abc-norms/articleshow/73915065.cms

Lucknow: The ground in Vrindavan Yojna on Sultanpur Road turned into a ‘battle zone’ on Monday, when scores of combat tanks and armed personnel in their war gears enacted an operation to capture the enemy post.

As armed men moved forward amid ‘explosions’, artillery and battle tanks resorted to ‘heavy shelling’ to push the enemy back. From the gigantic Russian battle tank like T-90 (Bhishma) to indigenous Arjun battle tank and Bofors guns, all worked as per the plan laid out for the operation.

Initially, passerbys who stopped to see the action did not realise what was happening. However, they soon realised that it was a rehearsal for a show to be staged during the Defence Expo. The dust raising explosions and smoke was artificially generated to make enactment appear like a real battleground.

While the infantry took the charge on the ground, fighter jets including Sukhoi and Jaguar flown by Indian Air Force’s Surya Kiran team left people spellbound with their beautiful formations and by painting tri-colour in the sky with smoke.

Later at Gomti riverfront, naval commandos demonstrated ‘Marcos Action’, an offensive to neutralise terrorists.

Marine Commando Force or Marcos is a special operation force of the Indian Navy meant for hostage rescue and counter-terrorism operations, among other things.

The action began with light combat helicopters taking a position in the air and ropes dropping down from a great height with the naval commandos sliding down with lightning speed on the sailboat and shooting terrorists before climbing back again. The action-packed show was followed by a rehearsal of a patriotic music performance by the naval band. Models of army bunkers are also being constructed at the venue to enable people to understand the harsh conditions army personnel face in borders.

Her husband Surendra Singh, posted in 31 PAC Batallion at Rudrapur, was killed in an encounter with dacoits on February 8, 1982, in Bikhona village of Agra.

Till 2011, Devi was given just Rs 458 which was her husband’s pay in 1982. And after 2011, when the service tenure of her husband got completed, she got a family pension amount which was fixed in 1982. “The pay was revised several times since 1982 but I never got the correct amount,” said Nanda Devi, who lives in Lelu village of Pithoragarh. In 2018, she approached DS Bhandari, an RTI activist, and asked for his help. “The pay was revised in 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016, but Nanda Devi did not get the benefit.

Accused in Bhopal police custody

BHOPAL: A day after a youth breached the Raja Bhoj airport security and vandalized a chopper at the state hangar and blocked a plane, heads have started rolling. Five SAF personnel who were deployed at state hangar have been suspended for negligence. Beides, Gandhi Nagar SHO SI Tarun Bhati has been removed and attached to DIG office. DIG Irshad Wali said security arrangement at the state hangar is being assessed.

Meanwhile at a review meeting of the different agencies with the district administration it has been decided to internally segregate the state hangar from the airport. The state hangar and airport are in the same compound, without a fence separating the two. Government aircraft and chartered planes use the hangar. Surprisingly, CCTVs were found missing at the state hangar. A high-level meeting of airport authorities, CISF and state police was held to assess the airport’s security arrangements.

“For security enhancement a proposal will be submitted in the near future. All necessary arrangement including CCTV, enhancement of manpower and other pertaining things will be done within a week,” said Wali. Meanwhile, crime branch took the statement of accused Yogesh’s father Vishwa Mohan Tripathi. Police also spoke to his neighbours to know about the metal status of the accused.

In a major security breach at Raja Bhoj airport, a 22-year-old college student — who allegedly wanted to play commando — sneaked into the state hangar on Sunday evening, vandalized a parked helicopter and blocked a SpiceJet flight that was moving for takeoff. DIG (CISF), Neelam, also reached the Bhopal airport.

Deputy commandant, CISF Virender Singh, confirmed to TOI that the state hangar will be segregated from Raja Bhoj airport. “We have spoken with the state police. It has been decided to segregate the state hangar from the main airport.” Asked as to how it will be segregated, Singh said, “It will be done by putting up a wall, mounted by wire. We will send the proposal to the higher authorities soon.”

He added that at present, there is no frisking arrangement at the state hangar. “It is also decided to put body scanner, CCTVs and other security arrangement at the state hangar,” said Singh.

About the manpower deployment, Singh said CISF deployment will be increased. “At present, there are 179 personnel deployed at the airport. There is need of another 115 for which a demand has been made,” said Singh.

Justifying the need for more CISF jawans, Singh said, “After the state hangar is separated, more CISF personnel will be required to secure the airport. The new air cargo terminal is also coming up near the state hangar. In such a situation, there is a need for more manpower.”

Airport director, Anil Vikram, said a high-level meeting was organised where airport security authorities discussed several issues. “I can’t tell you much due to security reasons. However, only thing I can tell you is that there was a high-level meeting,” said director Vikram.

After the incident, CISF personnel arrested the suspect, Yogesh Tripathi, who sports a crew cut and goatee and wore camouflage trousers. Yogesh told security personnel that he breached airport security because he “wanted to get into commando training”. His family is bewildered by this claim and says he had never shown any inclination for military service. The accused entered the state hangar through the gate before committing the crime.

Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman kept mum on the number of jobs created as there was not much to talk about.

Sitaraman while presenting the budget had not quoted any figure on job creation saying Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would dispute the figure.

Gehlot in a tweet said, “The FM should not be scared of #RahulGandhi ji’s questions. Instead she should reveal figures of new jobs to be created, which youth are waiting to hear. But she has no answers as generating employment is not in govt’s priority. No jobs, no figures, therefore no answers from the FM.”

Rahul Gandhi had launched an campaign against the ruling party for letting down the youth on the job front kicking off a ‘Yuva Aakrosh’ rally from Jaipur on January 28. Similar rallies are planned in other cities as the opposition Congress plans to cash in on the disenchantment of the youth with the Modi government.

CM condemns Hedge

The chief minister also took on BJP southern siren Anant kumar Hegde MP calling Gandhi's freedom struggle a ‘drama’.

The chief minister in a tweet said, “The BJP MP’s statement is condemnable. BJP leaders can afford to call freedom movement a drama only because they nvr fought for India’s independence & nvr made any sacrifices. Such statements reveal their true mindset that they use Gandhiji’s name just for show & hv no regard for him.”

Hegde, a former Union minister, reportedly claimed at an event in Bangalore that the entire freedom movement was staged with the consent and support of the British, and the independence movement led by Gandhi was a ""drama"".

BJP had sought an apology from the MP for his unsavory comment on the Father of the Nation and the freedom movement.

Visakhapatnam: The headquarters of the Crime Investigation Department ( CID ) are likely to shift soon to the outskirts of the Port City.

Senior officials at the department have given the go-ahead for the shift from AP police headquarters in Mangalagiri to Chaitanya Engineering College in Kommadi in Vizag city. A DIG-rank officer CM Trivikram Varma visited the city on a three-day tour to narrow down on a suitable space to house CID headquarters.

At present, the headquarters occupy two of four floors at police headquarters in Mangalagiri, comprising a space of 40,000 square feet. The administrative building of the engineering college has a space of 60,000 square feet.

“All officers and ministerial staff will be accommodated in this administrative building once the government releases the GO. We will accommodate two cyber laboratories in the same, which are now located outside the office in Mangalagiri,” said a senior IPS officer at the CID on condition of anonymity. The Disha office would also be accommodated in the same structure, the officer added.

The CID, which has seven regional offices in the state, is headed by additional director general PV Sunil Kumar and has two DIGs, 10 SP-rank officers, three additional SPs and other staff including over 25 DSPs, around 80 inspectors, more than 100 sub-inspectors and another 200 staff.

Dehradun: Former CM Harish Rawat on Monday extended support to residents who are opposing CAA , NRC. On the occasion, he launched a scathing attack on the ruling party saying that the move was aimed to create a divide among people and divert their attentions from simmering issues like inflation, unemployment and other failures.

Rawat said, “The freedom fighters and our seniors had made it clear that no one will be discriminated in the country on lines of caste, creed or religion. This was not a decision of the Congress but all those personalities who led the freedom struggle. Now in this BJP government a new theory has cropped up, where people are being discriminated on basis of their religion.”

Congress state chief Pritam Singh is scheduled to visit the Parade ground on Tuesday to express his support.

AHMEDABAD: Between 2007 and 2016, there was a 60% increase in the number of cancer cases recorded in the ‘Ahmedabad Urban Agglomeration Area,’ states Population-Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) data, an annual increase of about 4.8%. The data since 2017 has not been made public. The registry is maintained by the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research, ICMR, Bengaluru.The data found that the prevalance rate of cancer has gone down, from 98.6 per lakh among males and 81.2 in females in 2007, the figures were 94.3 and 77 for 2016, respectively.Dr Shashank Pandya, director of Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI), said the overall increase can be attributed to two factors. “Over the past decade, population of the city has increased and that will surely reflect on the numbers. There is also an increase in awareness, we see more patients today at stages I and II, which was not the case a few years ago,” he said.GCRI at Civil Hospital, the biggest cancer hospital in Gujarat, attends to about 83 new cases a day, or 2,500 cases a month, that may or may not need hospitalization. Officials said that health insurance — both government and private — has improved cancer reporting in recent years.Experts point to the state’s notorious tobacco consumption habit as the major cause and which can be easily prevented. Dr Somesh Chandra, a city-based oncosurgeon, said the youngest person with tobacco-related cancer he has seen was 18 years old. “Having gutka/masala is found to be causing cancer much faster than other forms of tobacco consumption. It is severely affecting adolescents and young adults (YAY) in Gujarat,” he said, adding that such cancers are more aggressive.Dr Parimal Jivrajani, preventive oncologist, said regular screening of tobacco chewers and smokers by experts and general practitioners or even by themselves can detect cancer at early stages. “Hidden cases in almost all categories of cancer cannot be ruled out,” he said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73921685,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125991,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cancer-cases-in-city-up-60-in-10-years/articleshow/73915641.cms

Nashik: The Satpur police arrested three grandsons for allegedly murdering their 65-year-old grandfather, who was found dumped in a water channel along Wasali road on Friday night.

The three suspects were arrested on Sunday and remanded to police custody till February 7.

Senior police inspector of the Satpur police station Rakesh Hande said that the trio was arrested on the suspicion of murdering their grandfather Ramdas Gopala Khoskar, a resident of Naikwade village near Girnare.

The murdered victim used to work as a labourer was addicted to alcohol and used to abuse his grandsons over petty issues which resulted in they killing him. Hande said that the details of the murder are yet to be known as they are investigating the case.

During the investigation, it was found that Khoskar was struck on the head with a blunt object. He had left his house on Wednesday and did not return home since then. His family members lodged a missing complaint.

The police were suspicious of why the family members of the victim did not lodge a missing complaint even after Khoskar failed to come home after two days. Further, there was also no attempt by any family members to trace the elderly person which forced the cops to focus on the three grandsons, who were subsequently arrested.

Hande said that things would be clear during the custodial interrogation of the suspects. Khoskar is also a distant relative of Igatpuri MLA Hiraman Khoskar.

Jagroop Singh

JAIPUR: The department of personnel has asked former Jaipur collector Jagroop Singh to pay Rs 7.4 lakh, which it claims was paid to him due to wrong grade increment when he was promoted to super time scale in 2010 while he was an RAS officer. Yadav was later promoted to the IAS cadre from state service.

The department said either he should authorise the DoP to deduct the amount from his gratuity or deposit the amount so that his pension papers could be processed.

Singh told TOI that the department claimed that he was paid two grade increments on promotion from 2010 to 2012 which was a mistake and has now come to its notice while preparing the pension. According to the calculation by the DoP, the total amount comes out to around Rs 7.4 lakh.

Singh said the DoP had fixed his pay in 2012, 2015 and 2018 but it did not come to their notice. “Now they are claiming that I have to pay the amount or it will be deducted from my gratuity. I do not have this much of money in my bank account. I have authorized them to do whatever is they want,” he added.

He said, “I had paid income tax at 34% to the amount they claim to have paid in excess. The mistake was not committed on my part but by the DoP. At least they should return the the tax that I paid because of my excess salary,” said Singh.

Cops examine the crime site

Lucknow: Investigations into the murder of Hindutva leader Ranjeet Bachchan , who was shot dead near Globe park in the heart of the state capital on Sunday morning, made a headway on Monday when police recovered the two cellphones reportedly robbed from Bachchan and his cousin Aditya Srivastava by the assailant before he opened fire at them from point-blank range.

The phones were recovered about three kilometres from the crime spot. Bachchan died on the spot after being shot in the face, while Aditya, who suffered a gunshot wound in his left arm, had told police that the assailant first robbed them of cellphones and then opened fire. The recovery of phones ruled out any mobile snatching angle to the murder, said sources privy to the probe.

Additional deputy commissioner, central zone, Chiranjeevi Nath Singh told TOI, “The mobile phones belonging to the slain Hindutva leader and his cousin were recovered near Bhaisakund under Hazratganj police station area. Both the phones have been given to experts for retrieving data and chats while the footage of CCTVs installed on the route from the crime spot are being scanned.”

Police also questioned some relatives and contacts of the slain leader who revealed that he used to take money from people in the name of constructing an old age home in Patarka Tola area in Gulharia Bazaar police station area of Gorakhpur and assisting them in getting job. The probe team is in touch with Gorakhpur police and seeking details about Bachchan’s close acquaintances.

Police said Bachchan, who was associated with Samajwadi Party and had formed his own party — Vishwa Hindu Mahasabha — in 2017, was also into theatre and had been a graded artist of Doordarshan.

The investigators also found that one Shubham who used to accompany Ranjeet on morning walk daily did not go with him on Sunday.

Meanwhile, a source privy to the probe said police and STF have closed in on the accused. Police have checked over 100 CCTV footages and scanned over 200 phone numbers. Meanwhile, joint commissioner of police Nilabja Choudhary has been named head of the investigation team probing the murder case.

Nashik: The bumper-to-bumper traffic at Dwaka junction became a thing of the past on Monday as slew of measures taken by the city police seemed to do wonder.

As many as 40 police personnel were deployed at the junction from the morning till 10pm to take care of every problem that hindered smooth flow of traffic.

“Smooth flow of traffic at Dwarka junction could be obtained after barring all heavy vehicles and private buses at the entry points near KK Wagh College, Dwarka Circle, Indiranagar underpass, Splendour Hall and Garvare T Point,” a police officer said.

Similarly, heavy vehicles and private buses to and from Pune, Sangamner and Sinnar were banned from using the Dwarka junction and were diverted via Fame Signal-Ramdas Swami route-Jejurkar Mala-Mirchi Hotel signal-Aurangabad Road-Amrutdham Chowk route to move towards the Dhule side or elsewhere.

Heavy vehicles to and from Mumbai side were diverted on the Fame Signal-Sri Sri Ravishankar Road-Wadala Pathardi Road-Pathardi village circle-Pathardi Phata route. Apart from this, the police had also moved all autorickshaw and taxi stands around 100 metre away from the junction.

Meanwhile, many commuters expressed satisfaction over the traffic diversion. Pravin Ahire, a farmer from Nashik Road, said, “Police have done an excellent job to do away with the perennial problem of traffic congestion at Dwarka circle. For the past many years traffic issues of Dwarka could not be solved. However, this time around police have managed to succeed.”

Amit Pawar, a resident of Adgaon, said, “Every day while coming from Adgaon I used to spend at least 15 minutes in the traffic jam at Dwarka. On Monday, however, I crossed the junction in less than a minute.”

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil said, “We monitored things minutely over three days observing the problem. From the observation I found out that heavy goods vehicles which had no work at the junction were using it when there are alternative roads. Many private passenger buses also halted near the junction adding to the problem.”

He added, “Encroachments on the road were also cleared to open up the free lefts of the junction. This all created a breathing space at the junction, resulting into a smoother flow of traffic. 90% of the traffic problem at Dwarka has been mitigated.”

261,['4/02/2020'],"Reducing revenue deficit a task, as AP’s tax share dips","This story is from February 4, 2020

Vijayawada: With the 15th Financial Commission using 2011 population figures instead of the 1971 census for tax devolution, Andhra Pradesh’s tax share has come down from 4.3% to 4.1%.

This would be a dampener for the state government ’s efforts to reduce its revenue deficit.

The latest commission has been at the centre of a controversy after many southern states opposed the terms of reference which would have disincentivised the successful population control measures taken by them over the last few decades and put them at a disadvantage in comparison to some of the populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh.

The bigger controversy about the 15th Finance Commission that the southern states complain about is that the large and populous states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have been faring poorly in India’s direct tax revenue. Bihar being the third largest populous state contributes barely 0.65%.

However, when it comes to population control and decent tax contribution, the southern states have been fairing well compared to the northern states. A region-wise division of direct tax contribution shows that the five southern states — Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala — contributed 23% to India’s direct tax revenue.

According to Central Board of Direct Taxes data, Andhra Pradesh contributed Rs 220,823.54 crore in taxes from 2013-14 to 2018-19.

Andhra Pradesh alone accounts for 4.4% which is the lowest amongst the southern states. Nevertheless, considering the lack of a revenue generating capital, the state requires a larger share of the tax share compared to its neighbouring counterparts.

Compared to other neighbouring states, Andhra Pradesh’s focus hasn’t been on getting a better deal from the financial commission. It is about getting the Special Category Status (SCS) which the same commission had refused them that would give them tax incentives and bigger revenue share. The revenue deficit of the state government for the first two quarters (April to September) of the current financial year (2019-20) stood at Rs 7,649.79 crore while the fiscal deficit stood at Rs 15,842 crore.

A team is expected to go to Kakdwip later this month to bring back the boat after carrying out the repairs. All eight fishermen are from Thippalavalasa village Vizianagaram district, but have been living in the city with their families for many years now. On October 3 last year, their boat Amrutha strayed into Bangladesh waters while they had gone fishing. They were detained by the neighbouring country’s coast guard and had been languishing in a jail there since then. “They faced a tough time in jail. Proper drinking water was not available and we had to purchase water for them. They also faced problems with food as the food habits in Bangladesh are different to what we eat here,” added Janakiram.

NEW DELHI: As preparations pick up for US President Donald Trump’s visit later this month, it is learnt that he is likely to land in Ahmedabad on February 23 where, apart from visiting Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram, he may address a town hall-like event.

The event is likely to include Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well, and might be even bigger than the ‘Howdy Modi’ function in Houston last year. The US advance team to finalize preparations are expected to arrive this week.

Trump is likely to come to Delhi that evening, beginning his official visit on February 24. It is unclear whether he will come with wife Melania or daughter Ivanka, who has already visited India, representing her father at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad in 2017.

After his official engagements, which include talks with Modi and a banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan among others, Trump may make a short trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal.

The visit will be Trump’s first to India as president, and has acquired significance since he will be coming just after a bruising impeachment trial and in an election year. The US goes to polls in November, but the gruelling primary season is scheduled to start by the month-end. The US and India are expected to conclude a limited trade deal during Trump’s visit that has been in negotiations for the past few months.

Vadodara: Residents of Vadodara city will for the first time get an opportunity to express their opinion regarding various services provided to them by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The civic body has initiated the process of gathering citizens’ opinions for the Ease of Living Index (ELI), 2019 and the Municipal Performance Index (MPI), 2019.

The surveys will be digital in nature where details for both the indexes will be gathered in the same survey form. The URL of the survey as well as a QR code that can be scanned on smartphones to take the survey will be circulated widely by the civic body. VMC will use the social media, advertisements and outdoor displays for creating awareness about the survey which has deadline of February 29.

Deputy municipal commissioner S K Patel said that the two indexes were a part of the Smart City initiative. In all, 114 cities and town are participating in the survey. These include all those that were picked up to be developed as smart cities and some that opted for it voluntarily.

ELI is based on three pillars that include quality of life, economic ability and sustainability. It will examine 50 indicators in 14 categories like education, health, housing and shelter, mobility, safety and security, recreation, level of economic development, economic opportunities, environment, green spaces and buildings, energy consumption and others.

MPI will look into indicators in 20 sectors that include registration and permits, infrastructure, revenue management, expenditure management, fiscal responsibility, fiscal decentralisation, digital governance, digital access, digital literacy, transparency and accountability, human resource, participation, effectiveness and others. These sectors fall under the verticals of services, finance, planning, technology and governance.

Patel said that after the data for the surveys is analysed the union ministry for urban development and housing will give rankings to cities. “It will also give us details regarding aspects where we may be lacking so that we can improve on them,” he added.

VMC is eyeing to have at least 10,000 responses for the survey. Patel said that five lakh responses were being eyed from the 114 cities where the survey will be conducted.

The seized gold

AHMEDABAD: Travelling abroad frequently? The Ahmedabad customs department has its eyes on you! In a bid to curb gold smuggling, Ahmedabad customs has begun profiling of passengers through a new system, wherein the officials will analyze travel patterns of individual passengers to identify potential smugglers. The new system, known as Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS), has been put in place.

Sharing more details, Kumar Santosh, principal commissioner, customs, said, “Since September 2019, we have begun profiling passengers using APIS. This system is operated by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and customs. As part of this, a list of passengers is obtained from the airline and fed into the system. Based on the passports, the system helps us identify passengers who go abroad frequently and returning within five to seven days.”

“Most smugglers take the foreign trip for a fixed duration to bring gold illegally into the country, having evaded duty and taxes. If it is a businessman or tourist, the duration of the trip will vary and it will not be frequent. Based on this information, we map suspicious passengers and interrogate them,” he further added.

Following primary investigation, the customs officials will be able to segregate the suspects.

“Based on spot intelligence, the suspects are identified. This system has been highly successful as it helps detect suspects more efficiently. We have been able to catch several smugglers,” he added.

According to senior customs officials most passengers caught with smuggled gold come from Dubai and Sharjah in the UAE in addition to Muscat in Oman, Kuwait and Bangkok .

At Ahmedabad airport alone, some 97 cases of gold smuggling were reported from April 2019 to January 2020, as part of which some 70 kg gold was seized. According to estimates by Ahmedabad customs, the seized gold was valued at Rs 24.8 crore.

KOTA: Superintendent of police, Bundi, Mamta Gupta, taking cognisance on the complaint against Child Welfare Committee (CWC) member and ASI for allegedly terrorising 7-year-old boy during counselling in the school on Saturday, ordered inquiry on Monday by an RPS-level officer. The report will then be submitted.

A few video clips, where one of the members of CWC, Bundi, Shobha Kasat along with investigating police officer Kurshed Khan is counselling the boy of a private school in Bundi have gone viral. The boy’s parents on Friday last week had alleged that one of his class teachers had beaten him with a stick and thrown him into a water tank as punishment. The video has triggered controversy and raised questions on the way of counselling the minor boy by the CWC member.

After the video surfaced, the boy’s father, Chandradeep Singh alias Sonu Singh, submitted a report against Kasat and Khan alleging them of severely torturing and terrorising his son in the name of counselling. He has demanded that a case be lodged against them under appropriate sections of IPC.

“We have asked Hindoli circle officer to look into the matter,” said Mamta Gupta. However, she defended the investigating officer Khurshed Khan and said that the video shows him to be present, he is not saying anything.

ADM (administration) Rajesh Joshi also reportedly ordered inquiry into the complaint against CWC member and the ASI for allegedly terrorising the boy during counselling.

Vadodara: The standing committee of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) cleared the draft budget proposed by the municipal commissioner after striking down most proposals of increasing various charges and fees.

The committee passed a budget of Rs 3769.17crore for the year 2020-21 against the draft budget of Rs 3,770.54crore.

The VMC administration had refrained from raising taxes and other major options it had for increasing revenue in the draft budget. While the administration had claimed that the decision as taken as the finances of the civic body were manageable without any hikes, it is widely believed that this was done as civic polls were scheduled later this year and because the civic body had a poor track record in delivery of services in the current financial year.

The standing committee too stayed away from doing so as it was also eyeing to do away with hikes in various fees and charges proposed by the commissioner. The committee, however did not reduce any of these.

Committee chairman Satish Patel said the fees and charges were turned down as they would not affect the budget in a major way. The committee imposed hikes in the licence fee for water as well as drainage plumbers, architects, surveyors, site engineers, developers and others. Charges for drainage connections to cottage industries have been doubled as compared to last fiscal, but the committee did not agree to the hike proposed by the commissioner that was three times as compared to 2019-20.

Kakinada: Residents of five villages close to Uppidi village in East Godavari were evacuated on Monday, a day after a gas leak from a rig well, owned by PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited, there was reported. The leak was not arrested till Monday evening.

An ONGC crisis management team has been pressed into action to arrest the leak. Police have been deployed to ensure no inflammable material is used in the area. Power supply in the area has been cut off and the use of mobile phones suspended. Persons and vehicles are prohibited from enterting an area within a three-kilometer radius of the leakage spot.

Speaking to TOI, officiating asset manager, Rajahmundry Asset, and group general manager, ONGC, Adesh Kumar said an ONGC crisis management team is trying to arrest the gas leak, which is gushing out from the depth of 2,200 meters, but it is difficult to access the leaking valve through the thick vapours. “Right now high capacity water pumps are being used to arrest the gas leakage. But mud will be pumped into the well as part of Plan-B if efforts to curb the leak fails,” he said, adding that besides the ONGC crisis management team, two experts are being brought from Ahmadabad for support. He explained that the well used to be drilled by ONGC in the past, but it was abandoned owing to the low pressure in the well. It was closed in 2007. He said the PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited obtained the well in an auction and had started operations when the gas leak began. He expressed hope that the gas leakage will be arrested by Tuesday

East Godavari SP, Adnan Nayeem Asmi said that 300 police personnel have been deployed at the site and a DSP level officer has been appointed to monitor the situation round the clock.

Meanwhile, Amalapuram MP Chinta Anuradha said that the well was closed in 2007 by the ONGC and alleged that the incident took place when PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited tried to reopen the well. She observed that the gas leak took place due to human error and expressed doubt that the private operator might have failed to deal with the dead well in a proper manner. She revealed that one person from the private company was injured who was carrying out activity at the well when the gas gushed out on Sunday.

Nashik: The Nashik Road railway station has been chosen by the Railway Board for modernization and upgrade as per city’s cultural and heritage importance.

A letter issued by Bhusawal’s divisional railway manager (commercial) RK Sharma on January 29 states that the Nashik Road is one of the nine stations chosen by the board for the makeover. “The local railway officials have been asked to submit the manner in which the stations can be developed,” the letter said.

According to a railway official, Nashik Road station is among the nine stations attached with pilgrimage tags across the country. Others include Dwarka, Gaya, Puri, Kashi, Prayag, and Rishikesh.

The authorities have asked the officials to carry out joint surveys as per the theme and submit their plans at the earliest. The aim is to get the frontage of the railway station and the entrance designed keeping in mind the pilgrimage and the tourist importance of the city.

“At this point in time we have got some ideas, but are still getting more inputs from the citizens in general as well,” the official said. He added that they were open to suggestions from citizens, historians and artists in particular to design the frontage of the railway station and the premises.

A Railway Board letter, dated December 2, 2019, stated that modernization and upgradation was to be taken at the select stations.

“Lack of funds had put the beautification process on the back-burner. But the new move by the board has inspired hopes for the same. In couple of weeks the proposal will be worked out and sent to the divisional railway manager’s office for refinement,” the official said.

Kiran Bedi

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi welcomed the centre’s move to establish a national police university. She said the move will meet the research needs of vital security concerns and serve as a single platform for academicians in policing.

Bedi said an institution like this was always in the pipeline and was much needed but was not given much focus earlier. Recalling her tenure as DGP of the Bureau of Police Research and Development she said announcements never were seen to match available resources. ""They were mere announcements. These lacked the financial muscle. Indian policing concerns all along needed a common platform to bring together authors, researchers, creative thinkers, scholars, interns and fellowships and more. Most of all it needs today a common repository of actionable research studies, scattered at several places and any number of disciplines of law enforcement and management,"" she said.

Bedi also expressed optimism that the institution will be in a better position to advise policymakers, feed the law enforcing managers, regionally and nationally, time to time and provide academic and practical knowledge to prepare the law enforcement officials for the evolving challenges.

She said the institution can work with police universities overseas to enlighten the officials on international law enforcement practices and learn the good practices. ""Setting up of the university was long in need of adequate resources to be born and grow. We thank the Government of the day. It's interesting to see the current Government gifting the police service a Police Memorial inaugurated by the Hon'ble PM (last year?) (which was languishing for years) to now a Police University by Hon'ble Union Finance Minister, (a project of Union Home Ministry ),"" she said.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has asked the state crime investigation department (CID) to inquire into the case of a man missing since 2016 and submit its report within three months.

Murlidhar Bandu Nyahalde (75), father of the missing man, had moved court seeking directions to hand over the case to the CID.

On September 15, 2016, his son, Gokul, had gone to Krushna Garden Hotel where he had an altercation with the staff and since then, he has been missing.

Nyahalde, a farmer from Jaitana in Sakri taluka of Dhule district, said he suspects that the hotel staff had done something to Gokul. He had also approached the state government for transferring the investigation to the CID as the Nijampur police in Dhule district had been unable to find any clue about his son’s whereabouts.

AM Gholap, who represented the petitioner, pointed out to the court that that some statements were recorded during a detailed inquiry with the staff of the hotel. He said that the petitioner has suspicion that no inquiry has been made with the staff members who were working at the relevant time in the hotel as some of the members had left the hotel after the incident and the police have taken no interest to trace them.

While allowing the petition, the bench comprising justices TV Nalawade and MG Sewlikar observed: “As the father of the missing person is not satisfied with the present investigating agency and there are aforesaid circumstances, this court holds that investigation needs to be transferred to other investigating agency like CID.’’

The court ordered: “Investigation of both the aforesaid matters is transferred to C.I.D. the head office of which is situated in Pune. The officer in-charge of that office is to see that some senior officer is appointed to make investigation and inquiry into aforesaid matters.”

While disposing of the criminal writ petition, the bench observed that “this court hopes that new investigating agency makes proper investigation like collecting information of servants who were working in the hotel at the relevant time. This Court expects from the new investigating agency to file report within three months from today (January 28, 2020)”.

Lucknow: In a statewide crackdown, UP Police arrested 108 members of the Popular Front of India (PFI) in a four-day operation for their alleged role in violent protests against amended citizenship law in the state since December 19. Most of the arrests were made from Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Sitapur, Shamli and Bahraich.

Aurangabad: As the AMC election campaigns gain pace, rumours of possible political alliances have intensified. With reservation allocated to 115 wards, both the BJP and the Sena on Monday expressed readiness to contest the elections independently.

The Sena-BJP relationship weakened within the AMC after the former cut ties to form a government with Congress and NCP. The relationship ended in December when Vijay Autade quit as deputy mayor over a proposal to felicitate Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

The AMC election — set to be held in April — is likely to see intense battles between the Sena and the BJP.

When asked how the Sena plans to face the polls alone, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the party is now used to winning. “Even when it was part of the alliance, Sena had to fight on its own capacity,” he said. However, he did not confirm whether Sena will go to polls in alliance with the NCP or the Congress.

The BJP also stayed mum on rumours of a possible alliance. Party’s group leader in AMC and former deputy mayor Pramod Rathod said ward reservation has ensured justice for all.

MIM corporator and former group leader Naser Siddiqui said his party will field candidates for 60 seats and will likely win 40.

AHMEDABAD: The scare for coronavirus infections has pushed up the demand for N95 masks , especially among non-resident Indians (NRIs) and travellers who are going abroad. Estimates by chemists suggest that the stock of masks has eroded with high demand from travellers and currently, only pollution masks are available in the market.“The demand for N95 masks has shown a sharp rise in the city, especially from NRIs, foreigners and those travelling abroad. N95 masks are more in demand because they provide protection against the viruses.

CHENNAI: A 51-year-old engineer from Portugal was killed when a wall collapsed on him while he was working on a chimney at a private glass factory in Sriperumbudur on Monday. Police said Carlos Simmons was wearing all the mandated safety gear, but he was buried alive under debris when a wall attached to the chimney collapsed.

Simmons was senior engineer in a team of 28 people that had come from Portugal last week to service the factory’s chimneys, which had been imported from that country. The team was staying in the glass company’s accommodation for the annual maintenance work.

Police said the chimney six workers, including Simmons, were servicing on Monday afternoon was surrounded by a 20-foot-high concrete wall, a portion of which suddenly gave way. Five of the workers managed to escape to safety. That’s when they realised Simmons was missing.

Police said the Portuguese workers themselves found Simmons under the debris and managed to pull him out. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital where he was declared brought dead.

“The structure of the wall was weak,” said an investigating officer. “We are probing further into the case. He was stuck underneath a huge pile of debris and was unable to breathe,” the officer said quoting eyewitnesses.

The Sriperumbudur police sent the body for post-mortem to the Chengalpet government hospital. Police have registered a case of accidental death and are investigating.

SLUG: 36 NMC-Owend properties

Nashik: Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has taken strong note of the alleged illegal constructions carried out in 36 civic-owned properties.

Game, on Monday, directed an inspection of these properties to ascertain whether any civic official was responsible for these illegal constructions or the parties to whom these properties were leased to had carried out the illegal constructions without the knowledge of the civic administration.

As per Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) of the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ), 15% constructions on open or amenity spaces are permissible — 10% is permissible on ground and 5% on first floor.

Recently, a survey was carried out by the town planning department and Public Works Department (PWD) of the municipal corporation. During the survey, officials of both the department found violation of the norms while carrying out construction on open and amenity spaces.

Following this, Game told TOI that he has directed the PWD department to inspect the properties and find out who is responsible for the illegal construction .

“Responsibilities about the illegal constructions are to be fixed first. Action will be taken against municipal officials if they are found involved for illegal constructions. Notices will be sent to the parties to whom the properties have been leased out if they are found involved in illegal constructions,” Game said.

Meanwhile, the civic administration has decided to table the proposal of increasing the lease rates for its properties from 2.5% to 8% at the coming general body meeting.

The decision has been taken after the urban development department of the state government has directed all civic bodies to increase the lease rates on civic-owned properties. The state government has also sent a letter to the NMC asking it to levy new lease rates.

There are over 2,500 properties of the NMC, including 1,900 commercial outlets and remaining 900 study halls, community halls, libraries, laughter clubs, gymnasiums that have been leased out to different parties.

Nepali Thali meal set with mutton curry from top angle

HYDERABAD: An average industrial worker in Telangana spends almost all of his daily income for his family to consume two non-vegetarian thalis in a day. As per the Thalinomics survey conducted by Centre, the average household income for a family of five in the state is close to Rs 480 per day while the cost of one non-vegetarian thali is said to be around Rs 40.

Telangana is said to have one of the highest household incomes but with a non-vegetarian thali priced at Rs 40, it almost spends all of it to consume two thalis a day. In case of a vegetarian thali, the average household in Telangana spends between 50-75% of its daily income.

While the survey shows that the percentage of income spent on a non-vegetarian thali is similar states such as Kashmir, Bihar, Assam and Tripura, the daily incomes in these states is also lower. For example, in Assam, the price of a non-vegetarian thali is around Rs 40 but the daily household wage is just above Rs 280. Meaning: a family has to spend over its daily household income to afford two non-vegetarian thalis for a family of five.

When it comes to the affordability of a vegetarian thali, the survey shows that a household in Telangana spends between 50 to 75% of daily income on a vegetarian thali. Jharkhand fares well in this regard with a household spend of up to 25% for two vegetarian thalis a day.

The survey revealed that affordability of vegetarian thalis improved by 29% from 2006-07 to 2019-20 while affordability for non-vegetarian thalis improved by 18% across India. The survey has considered the price data from consumer price index of workers for around 80 centres in 25 states and Union territories from 2006 to 2019. The fiscal year 2015-16 was considered as the year when there was a shift in the dynamics of thali prices .

Telangana BJP president K Laxman

HYDERABAD: Telangana BJP president K Laxman on Monday said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should reveal to the people the funds allocated to the state when he was a cabinet minister in UPA-2 government. Addressing media, Laxman said that even when the UPA-2 was in power, Gujarat – then under chief ministership of Narendra Modi – had developed faster than the state.

“The state government has a two-pronged approach. In Delhi, they try to lobby with Centre but criticise it in Hyderabad and blame it for their own failure,” Laxman said. He also slammed minister KT Rama Rao’s statement on allocation towards Telangana.

“Being an educated person, KTR should understand that the central government allocates funds ministry and department-wise on the basis of projects taken up for the welfare not to fill up your pockets,” Laxman said. He said that despite people giving the mandate to TRS in the state, the Modi government has implemented several welfare schemes in Telangana.

“Several central government schemes are not implemented in the state as the TRS government failed to allocate its share which has deprived people of the benefits of schemes initiated by the Centre,” Laxman said. Throwing KTR a challenge, the state BJP president said that his party is ready for a debate on funds allocated by Centre to Telangana.

BATHINDA: A swarm of locusts, measuring 3km in width and 1km in length, entered Punjab through Fazilka district on Sunday night, prompting the state government to carry out a nighlong, multi-department, 13-hour-long operation to control the pest.The insect had been ravaging fields in neighbouring Rajasthan and Pakistan. Though a few flying insects were being spotted across the region for many days, this was the first time that they entered Punjab in such a huge number. The swarm flew into Bakenwala and Roopnagar villages of Fazilka, which are situated near Rajasthan and Pakistan borders, following which worried farmers approached the state agriculture department.The dead insects on groundTop officials of the agriculture department on Monday claimed that the swarm could not cause any loss to crops and the threat had been neutralised. The agriculture department conducted the operation by involving officials from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Border Security Force (BSF), fire department, police, civil administration, horticulture and farmers. “About 400-500 tonnes of insecticides were used to eliminate locusts,” Punjab agriculture department director Sawtantar Kumar Airi said, adding that locusts came from the Pakistan side.Punjab additional chief secretary (agriculture) Viswajit Khanna said it was ensured that the whole swarm of locusts was eliminated. “Boomer sprayers, tractor-mounted high-velocity sprayers and a fire department vehicle were used to control the locusts. The operation was concluded with completely wiping out the locust swarm,” he said.Farmer Joginder Singh of Roopnagar said they first spotted a large number of locusts on trees at night. “Though several locusts have been killed, we are worried more swarms may enter our villages and damage crops,” he said.Punjab agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said the entire state machinery was put into motion after they came to know of the swarm of locusts entering Roopnagar. “When we got the information, we held a meeting with officials in Chandigarh about 9 pm and sounded a high alert. We deputed all officers concerned on emergency duty. The director and joint director of agriculture were immediately sent to Abohar. Fazilka deputy commissioner was alerted. He held a meeting of all district-level stakeholders at 11pm. The joint operation coordinated at state level started at 10pm on Sunday and continued till 9am on Monday,” he said.Even as officials said they were ready for any situations farmers continued to be worried.

290,['4/02/2020'],Nimhans training ITBP education counsellors in stress management,"TimesView This is a welcome development. People who serve the country, especially in high and cruel terrain, are subject to a variety of pressures and need all the help they can get. Periods of working with hostiles alternating with those of inaction, and separation from family take a heavy toll on them. While training counsellors is the first step, it needs to be backed up by larger deployment of mental health personnel, at least at the base-camp level. The problem needs to be approached from the other end too as families of serving personnel also suffer from stress.

BENGALURU: After having trained Tamil Nadu police in stress management, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences ( Nimhans ) has now begun training ‘education and stress counsellors’ of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) on how to manage loneliness, boredom, environmental pressure at high altitudes, smartscreen related issues and suicidal tendencies among their personnel.ITBP counsellors are expected to hold workshops in managing stress and other related issues for their personnel.The nation’s premier mental health institute signed an MoU with Union home minister Amit Shah on ‘Stress Management and Counselling for ITBP Personnel’ on December 30, 2019. Though talks were going on since 2017, workshops began only last month.“Mobile phone penetration has made work tougher for ITBP personnel. They get worried over phone calls from home. Also, regular exercises cannot be done at their places of deployment given the oxygen saturation levels. A special yoga module has been designed for them after hazard vulnerability risk analysis,” said Dr K Sekar, registrar, Nimhans.Each batch is being trained for two weeks. A batch has 30 ITBP stress counsellors, who work largely at base camps. The plan is for them to trek with their personnel and engage them in stress management at high altitudes.“There are 5-6 major issues that bother ITBP personnel. They work at high altitudes and are prone to loneliness and alcoholism. They battle family issues. With mobile phone penetration, they get to know about what’s happening back home but can’t help. Boredom sets in as they can only stare at the mountains and the sky,” said Dr C Jayakumar, assistant professor, co-principal investigator of the project.Two batches have already undergone training and it began for the third batch on February 3. In all, 450 ITBP personnel will be trained. The average age of the participants is 40-45.An ITBP education and stress counsellor currently undergoing training in Nimhans said the major issue bothering their personnel is separation from family. “Things have changed now as compared to the pre-mobile era. Though phones are not allowed at work, everyone accesses them once back in their accommodations,” said the counsellor.The first two batches had two women each and the third batch has three. The 90,000-strong ITBP has about 4,000 women.“Women in ITBP have their own challenges, including psychosomatic issues, stigma pertaining to working far away from home, marital issues and biological issues arising out of the tough terrain,” Nimhans authorities said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nimhans-training-itbp-education-counsellors-in-stress-management/articleshow/73914713.cms
291,['4/02/2020'],HC to govt: Rehabilitatethose evicted in Bellandur,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Bengaluru: The high court on Monday indicated it will pass necessary orders if the state doesn’t take a decision to rehabilitate or compensate those who were evicted in Bellandur last month. Shanties/sheds on a private property were razed on the presumption that the occupants were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

“It all began with a letter from a police officer, and the government will have to rehabilitate those who were deprived of their shelter,” a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka observed while posting the matter to February 10.

During the hearing, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP ) claimed it had no role in the demolition and police informed the court that the inspector concerned who wrote a letter to the private property owner had been transferred and they didn’t take part in the exercise.

“Illegal Bangladeshi migrants are residing in the temporary sheds put up on your plot. Related videos have gone viral on social media. Please clear the illegal sheds once you receive the notice,” then Marathahalli inspector had written.

‘Vacated premises on their own’

During the hearing, counsel for owners of the land in question told the court they didn’t conduct demolition and in fact, the occupants vacated the premises with their belongings on their own following a polite request to them. However, the bench refused to accept this, asking who would believe such a claim.

Advocate general Prabhuling K Navadagi told the court the central government had issued an advisory to all states regarding illegal immigrants. However, the bench, which perused the October 3, 2019 advisory issued by the Centre, noted police were only told to identify illegal Bangladeshis and asked whether any identification exercise was conducted in the case at hand.

The bench added it will not approve of police action in evicting people, a power vested with a civil court. It also termed the police inspector’s action of writing to a property owner a dangerous trend and wondered how police acted in such a way.

The court is hearing a PIL filed by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, Karnataka. The petitioner organisation has claimed occupants of the sheds/shanties demolished are not from Bangladesh but from poor families of North Karnataka, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Bihar, and they are being victimised because of their vulnerable social-economic status. It says the evicted people are migrant labourers and possess valid IDs to show they are Indian citizens.

Unbelievable claim

A squatter vacating the premises on his own based on a polite request? Who will believe this in a city like Bengaluru? Unless backed by police power, this can’t happen. If that is the case, BBMP and the state can avail the services of these landlords to get all illegal encroachments cleared. There will be no work for courts as well

Ludhiana: Ten days after they gunned down hotelier and financier Harjinder Singh Jindi, the Ludhiana Police, in a joint operation with their Uttarakhand counterparts, arrested Sukhwinder Singh Moni and his aide Sumit Choti from Haridwar on Monday.

The city police would bring them here on Tuesday, said commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal.

On January 23, Moni and Choti, who is from Saharanpur, had shot Jindi at a doctor’s clinic in the busy Jawahar Nagar market. CCTVs installed in the clinic and the market had captured the duo. Both Moni and Jindi were residents of Jawahar Nagar.

The car — a Maruti Suzuki Wagon R — used in the crime was robbed from Haridwar.

“To execute the murder, the duo first robbed a car from Haridwar on January 19. They then affixed a fake registration number plate on it to avoid getting traced,” Agarwal added.

Roorkee Police had arrested Moni in an April 2019 case of robbery of Rs 25 lakh from SBI’s cash van. “Moni along with his gang members had robbed the cash van. He was arrested in the case and jailed, but he jumped bail and went into hiding. Since then Haridwar Police had been on his lookout,” said a cop.

About the motive behind Jindi’s murder, Agarwal said, “The two accused would be interrogated on Tuesday. That will make the picture clear.”

Haridwar SSP Senthil Krishna Raj said, “During interrogation, the accused said they met in Roorkee Jail. On coming out on bail in October 2019, the two hatched a conspiracy to kill the Ludhiana man, as Moni believed that he was implicated in a theft because of him. To execute the crime, they stole a motorcycle from the venue of a wedding function on January 1. Later, they went on that motorcycle to rob a car. That car was used in the Ludhiana murder.”

The Haridwar police had released sketches of Moni and Choti in the carjacking case. “But the accused managed to reach Ludhiana after affixing a fake registration numberplate on the car. Haridwar police have arrested the accused with the stolen car, fake number plate affixed on it, two pistols, seven live cartridges and RC of the stolen bike,” he added.

Ludhiana: As per the latest data of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Ludhiana is ranked second in the country in the Emigration Act, 1983, violation cases.

According to the NCRB data released recently for mega cities for 2018, as many as 52 cases were registered in the Ludhiana commissionerate, earning it the second spot. Delhi is at number one with 143 cases. Chennai, Kochi and Lucknow stood at number three, four and five with 11, five and four cases, respectively.

Among the commissionerates and districts of Punjab, Ludhiana rural police district is at number two position with six cases registered in 2018 and Hoshiarpur at number three with one case. Cases under the Emigration Act in Ludhiana comprise 88.14% of the total cases in the state.

The data for the past many years suggests that the cases in 2018 were the highest in the recent years, with 31 filed in 2017 and 43 in 2016. In 2016, Ludhiana was at number one position in the country, with Kochi and Ernakulum sharing second spot with 21 cases each.

Police officials said five districts in Punjab, including Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr, Kapurthala and Ludhiana, are known for large number of such cases.

“Many in these districts want to go abroad and some of them are not educated enough for the work they apply for. So, they fall in the trap of travels agents. We try to get their money refunded,” said Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Aggarwal.

Assuring strict action, he said, “In the past four months, we have booked 100 such agents and in a single day on January 1, we lodged 30 cases against agents who didn’t have a licence. Those willing to go abroad should look for authorised agents and apply on the basis of their qualifications or look for better avenues in their own country.”

Social activists say there is a need to monitor the working of emigration companies. “People arrange money after selling their land and other valuables, but fall prey to illegal agents. Police must watch the working of such companies and act as soon as a fraud is reported,” said social activist Keemti Rawal.

Kakinada: Residents of five villages close to Uppidi village in East Godavari were evacuated on Monday, a day after a gas leak from a rig well , owned by PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited, there was reported. The leak was not arrested till Monday evening.

An ONGC crisis management team has been pressed into action to arrest the leak. Police have been deployed to ensure no inflammable material is used in the area. Power supply in the area has been cut off and the use of mobile phones suspended. Persons and vehicles are prohibited from enterting an area within a three-kilometer radius of the leakage spot.

Speaking to TOI, officiating asset manager, Rajahmundry Asset, and group general manager, ONGC, Adesh Kumar said an ONGC crisis management team is trying to arrest the gas leak, which is gushing out from the depth of 2,200 meters, but it is difficult to access the leaking valve through the thick vapours. “Right now high capacity water pumps are being used to arrest the gas leakage. But mud will be pumped into the well as part of Plan-B if efforts to curb the leak fails,” he said, adding that besides the ONGC crisis management team, two experts are being brought from Ahmadabad for support. He explained that the well used to be drilled by ONGC in the past, but it was abandoned owing to the low pressure in the well. It was closed in 2007. He said the PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited obtained the well in an auction and had started operations when the gas leak began. He expressed hope that the gas leakage will be arrested by Tuesday

East Godavari SP, Adnan Nayeem Asmi said that 300 police personnel have been deployed at the site and a DSP level officer has been appointed to monitor the situation round the clock. He mentioned that awareness is being created among public not to use flammable objects in the region.

Meanwhile, Amalapuram MP Chinta Anuradha said that the well was closed in 2007 by the ONGC and alleged that the incident took place when PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited tried to reopen the well. She observed that the gas leak took place due to human error and expressed doubt that the private operator might have failed to deal with the dead well in a proper manner. She revealed that one person from the private company was injured who was carrying out activity at the well when the gas gushed out on Sunday.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday questioned state cooperatives commissioner M Veerabrahmaiah as to why he failed to respect the order of the court on the election conducted to the executive committee of the Hyderabad district NGOs cooperative housing society.

The commissioner along with two of his subordinates appeared before a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy in a contempt case filed by G Prabhakar, a member of the society who questioned the alleged failure of the officials in following the order of the court.

The bench questioned the commissioner and ordered him to show proof that he had understood the court’s order and its implementation.

“Did you issue notice to the aggrieved persons before notifying election to the society? Where is the proof of such notices? You were directed by the high court to first hear the aggrieved persons. You issued election notification on December 5 but you did not refer the order of the court. It is not clear whether you went ahead without hearing the aggrieved persons,” the high court bench said.

Though the state counsel tried to defend the commissioner by trying to explain the circumstances pertaining to the case, the bench said that this is a contempt case and hence they wanted to hear only the “relevant answers” so as to ascertain if the commissioner had followed the direction given by the court.

The commissioner then sought time to explain his case through an additional affidavit..

LUCKNOW: The 21-year-old missing BSc student whose unrecognizable, badly-burnt body was found on Saturday evening from Harchandpur in Rae Bareli, three kilometres away from her college and identified on Sunday, had been kidnapped for forced marriage and set ablaze for resisting, alleged her father in his complaint to police on Monday.

The family members and relatives staged a protest by keeping her corpse on main road in Bachhrawan. The girl, a resident of Bachhrawan, had gone to college on Saturday, but her body was recovered from thickets in Harchandpur area of Lucknow-Allahabad highway.

The girl’s father has accused one Atul Gupta (25), saying he had proposed to his daughter few days ago while she was returning from college. “Despite my daughter’s clear refusal, Atul misbehaved with her on many occasions, after which we took up the matter with his family, but 15 days ago he threatened her with dire consequences if she didn’t marry him,” he alleged.

Acting on the complaint, Rae Bareli police lodged an FIR against Atul Gupta on charges of murder, concealing evidence, criminal intimidation, and causing hurt. SP, Rae Bareli, Swapnil Mamgain told TOI, “Atul, a distant relative of the girl, has been nabbed but is denying charges. He runs a cloth store in Shivratanganj, Amethi. We have detained four other persons also and are questioning them.”

“The post-mortem report of victim rules out rape and mentions burns as the cause of death. We will recreate the crime scene to ascertain the sequence of events since kidnapping a 21-year-old and setting her afire cannot be done by one man,” Mamgain said.

A source privy to probe, however, said the victim had told a friend to carry her bag home and tell her parents that she had been kidnapped, but they did not report it to police and complained a day later.

Locust attacks took place in Jaisalmer and Barmer on Sunday

Jaisalmer: After Pakistan declared national emergency over locust attacks, state revenue minister Harish Choudhary has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare the same in 12 locust-affected districts in Rajasthan.

In a letter to the PM, he stated that 12 districts in Rajasthan are affected by locusts and swarms of these insects are still coming from Pakistan. He demanded a solid action plan to avoid such crises in future and to buy latest equipment to deal with such attacks. On the other hand, fresh locust attacks took place at many villages in Jaisalmer and Barmer on Sunday.

Choudhary said he has urged PM Modi to declare the locust attack a national emergency looking at the losses. Around 20 countries in the world have been affected by locusts. Somalia and Pakistan have already declared it a national emergency. Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat were the most affected states. In Rajasthan, locust attacks started from March 2019 and is continuing. Twelve districts, including Barmer, Jaisalmer, Jalore, Bikaner, Sriganganagar , Hanumangarh, and Pali, have witnessed damage of crop in a big way. Two farmers have died in Barmer due to the losses they suffered by locust attack.

Crops in an estimated 3.52 lakh hectares have been damaged and at present locusts are damaging rabi crops. The department is unable to get prior information of the arrival of locusts. Affected farmers must be compensated, he wrote in the letter.

On Sunday, fresh locust attacks took place in Jaisalmer and Barmer. In Jaisalmer’s Ramdeora, locusts attacked crops causing heavy losses to farmers. In Chauhatan of Barmer district , locusts damaged bajra, moong, gwar and other crops.

It is said that the wind blowing from north to south is a reason that locusts are coming from Punjab state in Pakistan into India.

299,['4/02/2020'],High court issues contempt notice to Punjab chief secretary,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Karan Avtar Singh

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh on a plea claiming that despite HC order, the state was not hearing the victim’s family before premature release of accused convicted in any case.

A bench headed by Justice Surinder Singh issued the notice after hearing a contempt petition filed by advocate H C Arora. Petitioner has stated that on October 31, 2019, HC had disposed of a PIL filed by the petitioner, by directing the Punjab government to take a decision on petitioner’s representation dated June 25, 2019, at earliest.

In his representation, the petitioner had demanded that before releasing a life convict (murderer) by granting him pardon, or releasing him prematurely under the prevalent policy, the competent authority must give a hearing to the victim’s family, and the state must pay adequate compensation beforehand to the dependent family members of the victim (of murder) in all such cases.

The petitioner has alleged that on one hand, the Punjab government had not decided the representation of the petitioner, and on the other hand, the cases for granting pardon by the governor, were being expedited by the state authorities. Petitioner has referred to the cases of former SP Preetpal Singh, former ASI Harbhajan Singh , former SI Ajit Singh; and former inspector Amrik Singh. Lifer Manjit Singh Dhaner had also been released by granting him pardon during the intervening period.

“The respondent is deliberately sitting over the petitioner’s representation, and has thus, committed contempt of the directions issued by the HC. The chief secretary is therefore, liable to be convicted for commission of contempt,” the petitioner has contended.

Aurangabad: The cyber cell of the city police has issued a warning asking citizens not to respond to an email claiming to be from a charity and approved by the “Ministry of Health Australia”. The alleged phishing attempt surfaced recently.

Authorities asked citizens to avoid sharing any bank details or personal information with senders of the email.

The purported charity email was sent to recipients by one Mrs Donna Harrison from Australia who claimed to be ""a childless widow of a business tycoon"". The mailer claims she is suffering from cancer and wants to donate $21.8 million dollars she inherited to the poor, orphanages and widows. In its concluding paragraph, the email asks recipients to write back to dhi94299@gmail.com for details.

The cyber cell said similar communications were found to have been used by fraudsters to steal personal information of people. “Users should avoid clicking on links, downloading attachments or replying with personal information to phishing emails. Users can also report such emails to the service provider as phishing attempts,” Kailash Deshmane, in-charge of the cyber cell at the Aurangabad police commissionerate, said.

Authorities added that emails, online advertisements and entire websites are now being used for phishing purposes. “Phishing mails try to give an impression that they are from credible individuals or firms communicating on behalf of banks. These attempts of cyber-attacks seek usernames and passwords, bank details, PIN, numbers of debit/credit card among other details,” an official said.

As per the official portal of the state government, India is now the third biggest source of malicious activity online and every sixth social media scam today impacts an Indian.

302,['4/02/2020'],Oppn motion on guv recall defeated,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The assembly on Monday defeated by vote the motion moved by UDF seeking to favourably reconsider the notice of opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala to recall governor Arif Muhammed Khan for taking a stand against state assembly’s resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The assembly rejected the UDF motion by 74 against 36 votes of the total 111 votes, while one member — P C George — remained neutral. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that even though the government does not endorse any of the stand of the governor in the subject, it does not think that a motion to recall should be moved because the governor aired his opinion. The chief minister said that the governor is trying to act as Centre’s spokesperson here and the government neither agrees to his views nor his opinion against the assembly resolution in the matter. But, the chief minister quoted UDF leaders like K Karunakaran, Oommen Chandy, K M Mani and M M Hassan in the assembly on various occasions in the past, to say that just because the governor aired his views, it need not be discussed by the assembly.

Citing Chennithala’s request before the governor not to sign the ordinance for increasing the number of seats in local self-government institutions, the chief minister slammed the opposition for using the governor against the government.

Justifying his decision to come up with a notice to recall the governor, Chennithala said that the governor is part of the legislature and is bound to remain with the unanimous resolution of the assembly against CAA.

Chennithala said that if the governor had a different view, he should have conveyed it to the speaker and not hold a news conference and speak against it.

The opposition leader said that there have been instances when the assembly had discussed against actions of the governor in 1969 and 1989. IUML legislative party leader M K Muneer said that the governor had insulted the government and not the opposition. He said that when the opposition is standing in support of the government, the government is favouring the governor against the opposition.

UDF MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan said that the governor has crossed the limits by intervening in the day-to-day administration of the government and the government should introspect if it should oppose the notice to recall the governor, just because the opposition moved it.

MLAs P T Thomas, M Ummer and Anoop Jacob spoke from the opposition demanding that the notice should be reconsidered by the business advisory committee (BAC). After the demand was voted out, the report of the BAC was accepted by the assembly.

Picture used for representational purpose only

LUCKNOW: To eliminate the possibility of question paper leak from sensitive districts, Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) has made it mandatory for the flying squad to inspect the seal of question paper packets an hour before the start of board examination.

A minimum of eight squads will be constituted in each district to conduct multiple checks in each session. Five separate teams would be formed at the divisional level. The teams would comprise district inspector of schools, Government Intermediate College principals, retired teachers and police personnel.

“The squads will have to ensure that secrecy is not breached by leaking the papers before the start of the exam. They will check the question paper packets randomly in each centre,” said UPSEB director Vinay Kumar Pandey.

Besides, members of the flying squad will also apprise the centre superintendents of their authority as “working magistrates” within the boundary of the examination centre. This authority gives them power to take action against any suspicious person or activity. The board has found that a majority of superintendents, in the past, have failed to exercise the power at the crucial stage due to lack of knowledge about it.

With copying mafia graduating from the conventional method of copying and leaking papers to hi-tech methods, the teams have been asked to focus on electronic devices too, said Pandey.

“Apart from copying through papers, new methods involve use of electronic gadgets and devices by students,” he added. The board has already imposed a blanket ban on taking smartphones inside examination centres. The ban also applies to invigilators, centre superintendents as well as inspecting teams.

This year, inspecting teams also have the added responsibility of checking CCTV cameras, routers and audio devices to ensure real-time monitoring of exams from a monitoring cell in all districts.

MOHALI: The special court of National Investigating Agency (NIA) here on Monday declared alleged Babbar Khalsa International terrorist Kulwinderjit Singh alias Khanpuria as a proclaimed offender. He is wanted in multiple cases of terror acts in Punjab.

During the resumed hearing in the terror module case, the NIA judge made the declaration on hearing prosecution arguments. A chargesheet in this regard was filed in a special NIA court in Mohali on November 22, 2019, against four lleged Babbar Khalsa International terrorists for planning and conspiring to carry out terror acts in Punjab, officials said.

Apart from Khanpuria, the accused included Ravinderpal Singh of Moga , Jagdev Singh alias Sonu of Fatehgarh Sahib, and Harcharan Singh of Delhi.

The NIA said Kulwinderjit was suspected to have fled to Malaysia in January 2019 and had been operating the network from there. “Kulwinderjit is absconding. As per available information, he is in Malaysia. NIA has got a look-out circular issued against him,” a senior NIA officer told TOI.

Punjab Police had arrested Ravinderpal and Jagdev in May 2019. The NIA, during its probe, found that Khanpuria was the chief conspirator and had conspired a planned terror strike. The accused wanted to carry out serial blasts in public spaces, the officials added.

NIA said Khanpuria and his associates were planning to target a few places in Punjab, adding that the accused had even done a reconnaissance of the people and places they wanted to attack by way of explosions.

Haridwar: The Himalayan state has lost 1,258 leopards ever since the state was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, suggests data of the forest department accessed exclusively by TOI.

Rampant urbanisation in and around forest areas and unchecked solid waste which attracts felines are major causes of man-leopard conflict and deaths of big cats in the state.

Uttarakhand lost 94 leopards in 2019, followed by 105 in 2018 and 102 in 2017. In 2016 and 2015, the hill state lost 88 and 54 leopards respectively.

The top three reasons of big cat deaths have been attributed to natural causes (603) followed by unknown reasons (183) and mutual fights (143). The state also lost 55 leopards to road and rail accidents while 37 animals were poached and 22 were trapped in snare.

Senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII) S Sathyakumar said, “Leopard is one of the most versatile species as it can adapt to any habitat. Uttarakhand needs to focus on ensuring that villagers are not dumping solid waste in and around forest. Livestock should also not be left unsupervised.”

Experts agreed that the number of man-animal conflicts is increasing due to poor civic habits of residents. Sathyakumar said, “Incidents of leopard and human interaction have increased over the years in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh due to poor solid waste management systems. The problem needs to be addressed on priority. Abandoned agricultural land has also turned into a secondary forest for leopards.”

The forest department data also suggests that in 2019, maximum 11 leopards each were killed in Pauri, Haridwar and Pithoragarh forest divisions.

A study by WII had last year suggested that abandoned houses in the villages are turning into safe havens for leopards in Pauri Garhwal district. In Haridwar forest division, a killer 30-km stretch of NH-74 that cuts through Shyampur, Rasiyabad and Chidiyapur forest ranges of Hardiwar Forest Division, also claimed maximum four leopards last year.

In Pithoragarh, a combination of reasons has been cited as reasons such as territorial fights and aging behind the deaths, said Vinay Bhargav, DFO of Pithoragarh forest division.

Reacting on the high number of leopard deaths in three forest divisions, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department Rajiv Bhartari, said that the department is looking into reasons behind the deaths are trying to figure out solutions.

Ludhiana: A month after two Royal Bengal tigresses joined the Ludhiana Zoo family, preparations are afoot to welcome another member. A tigress, the third one this year, will join the zoo this week.

With this, the tiger safari, which is a part of the zoo, will have three female and one male big cat.

“Chhattisgar’s Bilaspur Zoo has agreed to give a tigress to the Ludhiana Zoo. Efforts are being made to bring a healthy male tiger, too, for breeding. Besides, there are plans to bring gharials, deer and two new species of birds. We will first make enclosures for gharials and deer and then bring them here,” said a zoo official.

“We have received an approval from Central Zoo Authority of India to bring here more animals. We have also received permission for zoo expansion. Two Himalayan black bears, a male and a female, will be shifted to the Ludhiana Zoo soon,” said a senior wildlife official.

Divisional forest officer Khushwinder Singh said, “Chirag and Ichra, the two tigresses that were brought here in January, are lodged separately and released in the safari in turns daily as they are not friendly with each other. Since they belong to different families, they lack compatibility. If left together, they may end up killing each other.”

Wildlife officials said Chirag and Ichra were shifted by the wildlife department from Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park in Chhatbir, near Zirakpur, to Ludhiana Zoo on January 10. The two had to be quarantined for sometime, so that they could acclimatise to their new habitat before getting released in the safari.

“Initially, Chirag showed aggressive behaviour and attacked a bus ferrying wildlife department officials and guards. But now, she is adapting well. Her aggressiveness too has abated,” said a zoo employee.

The officials are hopeful that increase in the number of big cats would bring more footfalls to the zoo.

“Veterinarians will be working on improving compatibility among the big cats. We are yet to introduce the three of them to each other. Hitherto, they are being lodged separately,” said forest guard Narinder Singh.

Wildlife officials said Mani, 17, the lone male tiger in the safari, was kept in a separate gallery and not released in the safari as a precautionary measure. “He is too old and may hurt himself on coming out. Therefore, it has been decided to keep him in a separate gallery,” a wildlife official added.

Chirag was born in 2008 to Paras and Chorni (both now dead) in Ludhiana tiger safari. She was later shifted to Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park. Ichra was born in Bannerghatta National Park, near Bangalore, in 2006.

Of the five big cats Ludhaina Zoo had, three tigresses, Mohini, Elaichi and Shanti, had died in 2013.

Similarly, BJP put forward the names of both its MLCs for the two committees — PNV Madhav for three-capital committee and Somu Veerraju for CRDA repeal committee. And Progressive Democratic Front (PDF) wants KS Lakshman Rao to be part of the three-capital cities committee and I Venkateswara Rao of the CRDA committee.

Interestingly, YSRC is yet to respond to the chairman’s call. It has objected to the very constitution of the select committees. YSRC chief whip Ummareddi Venkaeswaralu asked the legislative council secretary not to initiate any process with regard to the constitution of the select committees as, he said, the chairman’s decision violates set norms. Similarly, the leader of the House in the council, Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose said they would not be part of the select committees.

As per the rule, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath should head the three-capital cities committee and municipal administration minister Botsa Satyanarayana should head the CRDA repeal bill. In addition to the ministers, YSRC would get one more slot in the committees. Sources said the chairman of the legislative council has authority to name the chairman of the committee in case the ministers choose to abstain from the committees.

Roorkee: Haridwar Police at the behest of the SIT registered cases of cheating, forgery and other crimes against the management of 17 private educational institutes on Monday at different police stations of the district, for their involvement in the multi-crore SC/ST scholarship scam .

Six of these institutes are in Haridwar alone, whereas the rest are in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. These institutes allegedly siphoned off Rs 10 crore from the social welfare department by faking admissions of SC/ST students from 2011 to 2017.

The SIT, which is investigating the fraud committed by private institutes of Dehradun and Haridwar, has arrested over 20 persons so far and registered over 56 cases against errant institutes.

“The owners of these private institutes will be arrested very soon,” said Manjunath TC, head of the SIT Dehradun and Haridwar.

The six Haridwar institutes were booked under sections 420 (cheating), 409(criminal breach of trust by public servant), 467(forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using forged document as genuine one) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Nashik: Farmers exporting grapes from the district to Europe are fetching good price for their produce as selling price has increased by Rs 25 per kg.

During the same period last year, farmers were getting Rs 70 for per kg of grapes in Europe, but this year the price has increased to around Rs 100 per kg. With grape production in the district affected due to unseasonal rain, the supply has also taken a hit that led to the price rise.

“We are getting good rates for grapes that are being exported to European countries. The rise is around 25-30%,” Manik Patil, senior member of Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh (MRDBS), said.

“There is rise in demand for India grapes in Europe, but supply of export quality grapes is not adequate. The unseasonal rainfall that had lashed the district vineyards in September and October last year have led to decline in grape production. There will be drop in export of grapes, but exact figure can be estimated after February-end,” he added.

Meanwhile, the district has so far recorded 26% drop in registration of vineyards meant for export during the grape season 2019-20 (Dec-April). As per government norms, it is mandatory for the grape farmers to register to export their produce.

According to state agricultural department, around 28,500 farmers have registered their vineyards on a total of 18,000 hectare. Last year, a total of 38,400 grape farmers had registered their vineyards on 24,575 hectare across the district.

“The district, till Sunday, has exported 720 containers with 9,528 tonne of grapes to European countries. During the same period last year, the district had exported 994 containers with 13,247 tonne of grapes,” a state agriculture department official said.

Of the 9,528 tonne of grapes, 6,300 tonne have been exported to The Netherlands, while 1,500 tonne have been sent to Germany.

Inner walls in some of the coaches have come off

CHENNAI: The new Linke-Hofmann-Busch (LHB) coaches being introduced for most of the trains may have improved travel comfort but interiors of some of the coaches which are nine months old have already started to come off.

Inner walls and cladding around windows made of fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) have started to come off since they are fixed with small screws that gets damaged fast. The plastic coating on the doors of toilets is peeling off, while taps and doors of waste bins are broken. These give coaches a shoddy and unclean look, making travel unpleasant.

Last week, food waste was overflowing from stainless steel bins on the Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram Express that started from MGR Central. The scene was no different on the return trip on Saturday. A tap which was broken was found welded with a crude piece of metal to make it usable.

While railways tend to blame irresponsible use and vandalism by passengers for such mess, a railway official said the quality of interior furnishing was not of consistent quality. “The coaches are safer as they do not topple during accidents and are also silent when compared to the conventional coaches of Integral Coach Factory design. But the walls are made of FRP which is not durable for Indian conditions. Since manufacturing is outsourced to multiple agencies, each firm produces materials of varying quality,” he said. “The toilet is a mess because the design is adopted from abroad. It is a dry toilet and not meant for water intensive usage,” he said.

A staff of a firm hired for onboard housekeeping said it was a struggle to meet passenger complaints. “There are often complaints about windows getting jammed,” he said.

“Some of the coaches have expensive toilet fixtures. But the maintenance funds sanctioned are very less and it is not possible to replace taps with the same quality fixtures. So patchwork is done,” the official said.

Indian Railways is in the process of replacing all conventional coaches with LHB design coaches and ICF has stepped up production. It is making around 2,000 coaches a year.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu police are probing a post on the Telegram app in the name of ‘Al Hind Brigade’ threatening to strike against the Tamil Nadu and Delhi police for the recent crackdown on Islamic State modules.

The post has an image of a letter written in Tamil surrounded by guns and grenades. The letter reads: “To the ....(expletive deleted) of Delhi special cell and Q branch, we are watching you and shall respond soon. Keep waiting.”

The post appeared a couple of weeks after the Delhi police arrested suspected TN IS module head Khaja Moideen and two others early in January. A day earlier, the Tamil Nadu police Q branch had apprehended three men suspected to belong to an IS module in Bengaluru. Investigators believe special sub inspector Wilson was gunned down in Kanyakumari district on the night of January 8 by two men angered by the arrest of Khaja Moideen.

A senior TN police officer said various teams are at work trying to identify the people behind the Telegram post. “It was written in Tamil and it naturally indicates the possibility of a Tamil speaking group behind the threat. The group may not be from Tamil Nadu, but can be from anywhere around the globe. But one thing is definite, the group believes in the IS ideology,” said an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Police sources said the ongoing crackdown against IS modules in south India seems to have irked many groups and their anger is being manifested through some posts.

Not many have heard of the ‘Al Hind Brigade’, except when it claimed responsibility for killing Kamalesh Tiwari, a Hindutva activist in Uttar Pradesh three months ago. Investigators suspect the outfit facilitated travel of many IS sympathisers cross the globe to Syria to join the fight to create an Caliphate since 2014-15.

314,['4/02/2020'],"Centre must revisit budget to revive economy, says PC","This story is from February 4, 2020

Chennai: Former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday urged the Centre to revisit the budget that was presented on Saturday if it is keen to revive the ailing Indian economy. Otherwise, the nation has to gear up to face trouble and the year 2020-21 too will turn out to be another wasted year, he said.

Terming the budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman as a movie that “bombed” after the first show, Chidambaram said despite delivering a marathon speech, people have been left in the dark.

“Unless and otherwise they revisit the budget, as they did last year, we are faced with a situation of very, very moderate growth and there cannot be a revival of economy. But they continue to live in denial,” Chidambaram said, participating in a budget analysis programme organized by the Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI).

“We are in a situation, where there is an ill patient and a rather incompetent doctor. It is not difficult to predict the repercussions and we will go through a very difficult time in 2020-21. They have to recognize and take radical measures, but there are no signs of behavioural change,” Chidambaram said.

Listing out “demand constraint” and an “investment-starved” economy as two major issues, he said the budget should have addressed them. “While people are not buying, no fresh investment is happening too. Hence, the question should have been – how to stimulate demand and promote investment,” he said.

“The budget should have put money into the hands of crores of people. Instead of increasing MGNREGA allocation to Rs 1 lakh crore, it cut that to Rs 61,500 crore, from earlier Rs 71,000 crore. It could have increased funds to farmers under PM-KISAN scheme. This way, more money would be in the hands of poor and farmers, who will go out and spend, thereby increasing demand,” Chidambaram said.

If there are financial constraints, government should divert funds allocated to long gestation projects like cleaning rivers and building new UDAN airports. Clean rivers and new airports are needed. But, the immediate concern should be to revive consumption demand, he said. He blamed lack of private investment on breakdown of trust, as agencies, vested with extraordinary powers, are harassing everyone to identify the black sheep.

“Exports is another segment that the government should focus. If there are products that others are willing to buy, we can even subsidize it. Of course, WTO will intervene, but that can be tackled,” he said.

315,['4/02/2020'],SAD Punjab leaders yet to bolster BJP in Delhi,"This story is from February 4, 2020

After deciding not to contest Delhi assembly polls, SAD had announced to support BJP

BATHINDA: Having reluctantly lent support to BJP for Delhi assembly elections, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders from Punjab are refraining from campaigning for their ally.

Only three days are left for campaigning, but no party leader from Punjab, including party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, has campaigned in support of BJP candidates so far. Leaders of SAD’s Delhi unit, including president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, are campaigning for candidates of the alliance partner.

SAD, which had announced to not contest the February 8 elections over Muslims’ exclusion from CAA and fewer seats being left for it by the BJP, took a U-turn on January 29, that it would support the right-wing party as their tie-up was emotional.

The absence of leaders from Delhi campaigning is said to be a fallout of a tension growing between the two parties. SAD leaders said they would take part in campaigning, but expenses incurred on campaigning could be counted in the name of the candidate instead of the party. “To save this expense, SAD leaders have not been invited for campaigning,” said one of the SAD members.

With BJP not paying any heed to SAD’s demand for leaving some seats, the nearly 24-year-old alliance had come under threat. With its demand not being met by BJP, Akalis decided not to contest the Delhi polls and took many days to extend support to alliance partners. Senior party leader and Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder and SAD Delhi unit head Sirsa had given different versions about not contesting the polls. Bhunder claimed that there was problem on allotment of tickets, Sirsa claimed that as SAD had a different stand on the CAA, they had decided against fighting the elections.

When contacted, Delhi SAD chief Sirsa said they were campaigning aggressively for BJP candidates. “As it is the election for Delhi, leaders from here are into campaigning. Party leaders from Punjab too will jump for campaigning.”

An aide of SAD president Sukhbir denied reports of any trouble between both alliance partners. He said, “The SAD Delhi unit leaders are actively campaigning for the BJP candidates at various constituencies. Whenever the BJP will call Sukhbir, he will go for campaigning.”

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) on Monday urged the citizens to participate in ease of living survey launched by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.

The survey is being held in 114 cities across India, which fall under the ‘smart cities mission’, and rank them according to different parameters. The objective of the survey is to help cities assess their liveability vis-a-vis global and national benchmarks. It also encourages cities to move towards an outcome-based approach to urban planning and management.

As part of the ‘Ease of Living’ Index Assessment, a citizen perception survey is being conducted on behalf of the ministry. “This is a very important component of the assessment exercise as it will help indirectly capturing perception of citizens concerning the quality of life in their cities” said Prakash Thavil, CEO, NMSCDCL.

The survey is being administered both online and offline and has commenced from February 1. The residents have to give their feedback online on — Eol2019.org/citizenfeedback. They can also use the QR code to scan and register their vote. The residents can give their feedback by February 29.

“Nashik has participated in ease of living survey, which examines the liveability of the city for the citizens. 1% of the total population of the city must have to give their feedback,” Thavil said.

The citizens have to give feedback based on 24 subjects, including governance, education, health, cleanliness, water supply, safety, and security, economic opportunities, employment, availability of affordable housing, power supply, transportation, recreation, environment, public services, and life style.

Meanwhile, the municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game on Monday instructed the officials to continue their cleanliness drive even though the Swachh Survekshan 2020 is over.

The teams of centers had visited the city for Swachh Survekshan in the second half of December last year. They visited various parts of the city to ensure that the garbage is not being dumped in the open. They had also taken feedback from the residents about cleanliness in the city.

Afsana Khan

BATHINDA: Punjabi singer Afsana Khan has landed in trouble by singing songs allegedly singing obscene songs at the government senior secondary school in Badal village of Muktsar district. This happened just a day after a case was registered against Punjabi singers Sidhu Moosewala and Mankirt Aulakh for allegedly promoting violence through a song uploaded on social media.

Punjabi language votary Panditrao Dharenvar has filed a complaint with Muktsar police seeking action against Khan, who lives at Zirakpur in Mohali district, but hails from Badal. On Saturday, she had visited the village school where she made students sing with her briefly. A video clip of her singing at the school had gone viral on TikTok.

Dharenvar told TOI said, “In its order on July 22, 2019, the Punjab and Haryana high court had observed that glorification of violence has given rise to culture of gangsters. The court also took notice of the fact that glorification of liquor, drugs and violence in the songs in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh has increased in the recent times. These songs affect the children of impressionable age. The DGPs of Punjab and Haryana were directed to ensure that no songs were played glorifying liquor, wine, drugs and violence in any song even in live shows.”

Muktsar district education officer (secondary) Malkit Singh said a show cause notice had been issued to the school principal to clarify why the singer was allowed to sing such songs. “Any action will be taken after getting reply from the principal,” he said.

Muktsar SSP Raj Bachan Singh Sandhu said, “We have got the complaint through e-mail from Dharenvar and are looking into the matter. Action will be taken after thoroughly investigating the issue,”

Earlier, Moosewala had questioned the Punjab government and censor board. He said that if the government blamed songs for drugs and weapons then it should ban liquor shops and stop giving arms licences.

JAIPUR: After oil, now another discovery is set to change the lives of people in Barmer. A vast reservoir holding approximately 480 billion cubic meters of water stretching across Barmer and Jalore districts, has been discovered.

Seismic surveys, petrophysical data, and detailed hydro-geological investigations conducted during the hydrocarbon exploration by Cairn Oil & Gas led to the discovery of these huge aquifers in the Barmer Basin. These aquifers are a part of Thumbli water reserves and can fulfil drinking water requirements of the region for many decades to come.

The projected annual domestic and drinking water demand for India is just 55 billion cubic meters (BCM) by 2025 and 90 BCM 2050.

The latest water discovery is spread over the blocks of Baitu, Shiv, Barmer, Gudamalani, and Sanchore Kurd (Jalore) with a depth that ranges from 350 meters to 1,500 meters.

However, the only challenge to this project lies in the salinity of the water in the reservoir. The quantity of salt in the water from the Thumbli reserve ranges from 5000 mg per litre to 20,000 mg per litre while the permissible limit of salt in drinking water is 1,000 mg or less.

The silver lining to this cloud is that many desalination plants are operating successfully in India and other countries. The government in partnership with private companies and with the latest technologies can overcome this obstacle to ensure that this parched land is once again transformed into a land of plenty.

This is the second time in seven months that Shri Harikrishan Welfare Society has been asked to stop

BATHINDA: After nearly seven months, the Bikaner district administration has again restrained a society from a Bathinda village from cooking and serving langar for patients and their relatives on the premises of Acharya Tulsi Dass regional cancer hospital and research centre.

The hospital authorities and Bikaner deputy commissioner on Sunday stopped Shri Harikrishan Welfare Society of Koreana village from preparing and serving langar and asked its functionaries to get permission for the same from the state government.

In July 2019, the hospital administration had stopped the society from serving langar after which the society members along with former Talwandi Sabo MLA Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had met Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal , who had asked them to continue the langar.

Now, the society members have decided to meet the Rajasthan chief minister to seek permission to continue with their welfare activity.

Aiming to provide healing touch to patients and their relatives, the society had been preparing and serving langar for the past six years at Bikaner. The society used to collect ration from 15 villages in Talwandi Sabo sub-division in Bathinda. Sources said some persons having eateries had put pressure on the administration to stop the langar so that local people could make a profit by feeding persons visiting the cancer hospital.

Acting principal of Acharya Tulsi Dass institute Dr H S Kumar said, “The society was running langar without permission from the state government. The society has been asked to get proper permission in writing to restart the langar and till then it has been asked to stop the operations.”

Dhadrianwale had planned to conduct a three-day ‘dewan’ in Gadiani village starting Monday. However, at around 1pm, individuals owing allegiance to some Sikh organisations started gathering in Kanakwal Bhanguan village gurudwara. They said they would oppose the preacher and not allow him to hold event as “his preachings were not aligned with the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and he was spreading misinformation in the name of religion”.

Hearing about the gathering, police reached the durdwara and detained the individuals inside till 4pm. They were let off only after the event at Gidiana got over. However, the protestors claimed that they would attempt to stall the dewan on Tuesday.

Sangrur SSP Sandeep Garg said the situation was being monitored and no one would be allowed to disturb the law and order situation. He said the Sikh preacher had sought all required permissions to hold the congregation and police teams had been asked to thwart any attempts to disrupt the event.

Amaravati: In a boost to the state government’s plans to link rivers Godavari , Krishna , Penna and Kaveri, the Centre has readied the draft Detailed Project Report.

Following chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy’s request, the Centre has got the study completed by National Water Development Agency (NWDA). The river linking of Godavari, Krishna and Penna would help tap nearly 247 tmc of water going waste into sea and divert for feeding of drought-hit Prakasam, Nellore and four Rayalaseema districts.

Union Jal Shakti Abhiyan minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawath said the report has been sent to the states for their comments. In response to a question posed by Rajya Sabha member V Vijaysai Reddy during the ongoing Budget session in the Parliament on Monday, the minister said that the chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy had requested the Centre last August to consider linking the four rivers and requested financial support for the big project.

While Godavari will be linked either at Itchamapalli or Janampet, the second link would come at Nagarjuna Nagar and Krishna would be linked with Penna at Somasila. In the final lap, Penna would be linked with Kaveri near grand anicut.

According to DPR, linking of Godavari, Krishna and Penna would help provide irrigation water to about 3.5 to 5 lakh hectors of agriculture fields in Guntur, Prakasam,Nellore and Chittoor districts. It also said that the linking would help stabilization of ayucut under Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal (NSRC).

The minister said the Centre would initiate action on the final DPR after getting responses from respective states. He said that the Centre would take statutory clearances before launching the project.

In response to another question raised by Vijayasai Reddy, shipping minister Mansukh Lal Mandaviya said that the Centre granted 32 road and 21 rail projects to AP under Sagar Mala project.

KOLKATA: Three novel coronavirus suspects have been put under observation in the isolation ward of Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BG). All three had flown into Kolkata from Kunming on January 23 on the same flight that carried the medical student from Kerala who tested positive for the virus.

“Currently, we have admitted three persons in our isolation ward and they are under observation. Their swab samples were taken on Monday and sent to NICED Kolkata for confirmatory tests,” said ID&BG medical superintendent and vice-principal Ashish Manna. While one of the passengers is from Kolkata, the other two are from Jhargram and North 24 Parganas.

Sources in the health department said none of the three showed any prominent symptom of the virus but since they travelled on the same plane as the medical student, who tested positive for the virus—she is the first coronavirus patient in the country—they had been admitted to the state’s referral hospital for infectious diseases as a precautionary measure.

Health department officials, who have started tracking down passengers from Bengal who had travelled by the same flight from Kunming, have so far zeroed in on four flyers. While three have been admitted to ID Hospital, the fourth person is in home isolation.

“The health department is constantly in touch with the fourth person who is in home isolation. We expect to get results of the three samples from NICED by Tuesday,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director, health services.

Two other male patients, both from Kolkata, also turned up at ID&BG Hospital on their own on Tuesday. One of them, who landed here from South Korea via Beijing on January 10, said he had cold and cough and so, wanted to get the test done. But when the hospital authorities said he had to be admitted to the isolation ward if his samples were to be taken, he returned home. The second person had returned from China on January 29. Sources said the man was asymptomatic but he initially had gone to a private hospital off EM Bypass out of anxiety. From there, he was referred to ID Hospital. Doctors examined him at the emergency and sent him home with the advice of home isolation.

All medical and non-medical staff members at the hospital’s emergency wing and isolation ward have been directed to wear masks while on duty.

“The masks are meant as a precautionary measure. These should be no reason for panic. At the same time, we have to take all preventive steps to stay on the safe side,” said Anima Halder, principal at ID&BG Hospital.

AURANGABAD: Schools in Maharashtra have been asked to carry out awareness activity to inform students about the ill-effects of tobacco consumption to mark the World Cancer Day , on Tuesday.

As part of the initiative, educational institutions will carry out a symbolic ‘Holi’ of different tobacco products.

The state government has issued directives to the office of Education Commissioner and directorate of both primary and secondary education.

Salaam Mumbai Foundation, a Mumbai-based NGO working on the mission of creating a tobacco-free Maharashtra, has joined hands with the government for the special initiative.

Prashant Redis, leader of the state-level association of principals, has appealed to the school authorities to support and encourage students to take part in the activities.

“Young minds are ideal to inculcate necessary information about the ill-effects of tobacco consumption. The teenage population is one of the most vulnerable groups which can fall prey to the consumption of different types of tobacco,” he said. The World Cancer Day is organized by the Union for International Cancer Control.

Amarinder Singh during a road show with Shivani Chopra in Delhi on Monday

CHANDIGARH: On the first day of his campaigning in Delhi, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday slammed his Delhi counterpart and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal on his “tall claims of providing cheap power to Delhiites”, calling him a “shifty character”, who had mastered the art of “deceit and lies to mislead the people”.

Capt Amarinder also accused BJP of converting the entire country into Shaheen Bagh and using it to polarise elections in Delhi and, in the process, “destroying India’s foundations”.

Taking on Kejriwal, the CM said the AAP leader had done nothing exceptional by providing cheap power and setting up mohalla clinics, as all chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states were doing the same. “Some people will surely be happy with these freebies but what has he really done for the development and progress of Delhi? What has he done for creating jobs for your children?” he said, while questioning Kejriwal on how many jobs had AAP given to youth in Delhi.

Amarinder, who was addressing a public meeting in Hari Nagar in favour of Congress candidate Surinder Setia , said there had been virtually no progress in Delhi in the last five years. “In Punjab we have given jobs to 11 lakh youths,” he said adding that what Delhi needed was economic and industrial development. He, however, regretted that both AAP and BJP had sacrificed the interests of Delhiites in their turf war.

Castigating BJP, Capt Amarinder said, “They are attempting to polarise the elections here with Shaheen Bagh but they will not succeed, as people have seen through their game.” He said the entire country had in fact become Shaheen Bagh with protests against CAA and NRC happening across the nation.

“There is unrest in universities. Students are on the streets across the country, and are being shot at,” he alleged, adding that this was not the India for which so many had sacrificed themselves. “In contrast to the divisive politics of BJP, which had weakened the nation, the Congress had always worked towards strengthening India,” he claimed.

Amarinder said in Assam, names of 19 lakh people had been included in the NRC. “Will they put them all in detention camps that they have built,” he asked adding that where would all those people, who are being brand as non-citizens, go?

In an informal chat with mediapersons, Amarinder said, “Kejriwal is giving subsidy on power to only a section of residential consumers and spending Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,700 crores on it, while my government spends Rs 9,000 to Rs 10,000 crores on electricity subsidy to all sections of society. He is subsidising power only to a section of residential customers and making commercial and industrial consumers in Delhi pay through their nose by cross subsidising them.”

While the CM refused to predict how many seats the Congress would win in Delhi, he said the party was in a strong position. He said the claims of an AAP wave in Delhi were a myth, as it was in Punjab in 2017.

NEW DELHI: The second round of firing at Jamia on Sunday night has put the protesters at Shaheen Bagh , too, on alert . Compared to Sunday, more protesters stood at the entry of each lane and checked everyone entering and said, “Aap ki suraksha ke liye kar rahe hai, cooperate kijiye (We are doing this for your own safety, please cooperate).” There were also instructions to check the two-wheelers parked close to the protest site.

On entering the area, like the walls in Jamia, the walls of the protest site at Shaheen Bagh are also being adorned with graffiti. With the protest being led by women, the graffiti on one of the walls shows two women in hijab holding the Constitution. Not just art, the protest site against CAA/NRC will also witness participation and solidarity of artists like Prateek Kuhad, Subha Mudgal and several others till February 7.

The Fearless Collective is decorating the walls at the site with graffiti. The artist Shilo has been adorning the walls for a week now. A local of the area, looking at the graffiti, said, “We should take permission from other building owners too and get it painted.”

While from the stage, songs of “Inquilab Zindabad” and “Halla bol” rang, Ishrat Jahan, a regular at the protest, asked, “Has police presence increased here too or it is just in Jamia? But police itself facilitates the entry of such people, so we cannot trust them.”

Meanwhile, PTI reported that a plea was filed in the Supreme Court on Monday seeking a direction to authorities to remove the protesters from Shaheen Bagh.

Tirupati: Officials from the state endowments department, in the presence of revenue department staff, broke open locked rooms and inspected several documents at Sri Swamy Hathiramji mutt in Tirupati on Monday.

Last week, the state government sacked Arjun Das, the mahant (chief priest) of Sri Hathiramji math on grounds of irregularities and appointed Srikalahasti temple EO C Chandrasekhar Reddy as the mutt’s in-charge.

Speaking to reporters, Chandrasekhar Reddy said “I assumed charge of Hathiramji mutt on January 29, as per the directions of commissioner of Dharmika Parishad. We found that some rooms in the mutt were locked and informed the same to the commissioner. Further, with the directions of the commissioner we broke open the locks in the presence of the revenue inspector, tahsildar and other officials. We will list out the records and properties of the mutt and send the list and relevant documents to the commissioner.”

Meanwhile, BJP functionaries, led by state spokesperson Samanchi Srinivas, staged protests at Hathiramji mutt premises in Tirupati on Monday. Speaking to reporters, Samanchi Srinivas demanded the government hand over the administration of the math to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams executive officer.

“Hathiramji mutt was the administrator of the Lord Venkateswara temple for 90 before the TTD was formed. It was during this period that the mutt received several donations. Protection of the properties are the prime responsibility of the state government. There should be a list of lands and other property, including jewellery in the possession of the mutt,” Samanchi Srinivas demanded.

CHANDIGARH: Congress functionary and former MLA from Nabha, Ramesh Singla, joined Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the presence of Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann in Delhi on Monday.

Taking a dig at Congress government in Punjab, Singla said it had disappointed every section of society by reneging on the promises made ahead of the state assembly elections.

He also drew a comparison with the AAP government in Delhi, claiming that the latter had done better.

Formally inducting him in the party, AAP Punjab chief Mann said Singla played his political innings in various capacities spanning over decades and did not succumb to any political pulls and pressures of the Congress leadership and stood by people of his area during the militancy period.

With Singla’s exit, it was proven that leaders with clean image were being ignored while sycophants were being promoted to meet their petty political ends in Congress. Leader of opposition in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said Singla’s political experience would be utilised to strengthen the party to the fullest.

KOLKATA: Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel deployed at Kolkata airport have been issued protective masks to guard against the spread of coronavirus from passengers.Sources in the force told TOI the decision to provide masks to all personnel at airports was taken after the coronavirus scare . Initially, the decision was to provide masks to all personnel deployed at international wings, where the chance of dealing with a coronavirus carrier was high, particularly flyers arriving from China. Later, it was decided that masks would be provided to everyone on duty at airports.According to a senior CISF official, the order came last week. “We were told to wear masks as a precaution. We had initially approached the airport director for masks but as we were told that they would need some time to get them, we got them on our own. As told, all CISF personnel, especially those at the international wing, have been wearing masks since last Saturday,” said the official.Another official said CISF dealt with passengers at close quarters, first at the time of entry, then at security check-in, leaving them at high risk of catching the infection. “That is true not only among those on duty in the international section but also those at the domestic wing as international passengers can also fly on the domestic network after arriving here,” he said. Personnel at the terminal entry gates and frisking points at security check have been particularly asked to don the masks all the time as they are the most vulnerable due to their proximity to passengers. “We would like to introduce a regimen in which the personnel wear the masks throughout their duty, even after the coronavirus scare is over as, given the huge number of people they deal with daily. The habit is yet to set in. So some of them, like those screening cabin bags and away from direct passenger contact, are still reluctant to wear masks,” said another official.In November 2019, when the air quality in the Delhi-NCR region had plummeted drastically, CISF had issued N-95 anti-pollution masks to its personnel at IGI Airport, Delhi Metro, government buildings, Special Service Group (SSG) and other units, directing them to wear them till the AQI improved. The masks distributed for protection against coronavirus are also N-95, where respirators are thicker, making it difficult for some to wear them for prolonged periods. Those wearing the mask need to fit the respirator around the nose, cheeks and chin to ensure that they don’t breathe around the edges of the respirator. “If the mask is not worn properly, it is difficult to breathe and so, the reluctance to use it at a stretch. It will take getting used to,” a jawan said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73927224,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-397953,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisf-distributes-masks-to-personnel-at-airport-to-guard-against-virus/articleshow/73915745.cms

Visakhapatnam: The Port City has ranked fourth in the feedback component of Swachh Survekshan 2020, with over 4 lakh people, which amounts to nearly 23% of the city’s population, submitting their responses both online and offline. The citizen feedback component carries a 25% weightage in the survey. The final rankings of SS-2020 is likely to be released in the later half of March.

Apart from Visakhapatnam, the other four cities which made it to the top-5 list in citizen feedback are from Uttar Pradesh. Ghaziabad leads the pack with more than 13 lakh responses (76% of city’s population). Agra secured the second highest responses in the country (11.5 lakh or 60% of city’s population), followed by Lucknow (12.33 lakh feedbacks or 44% of city’s population), Visakhapatnam (4.02 lakh responses) and Varanasi (2.2 lakh responses or 18% of city’s population).

When it comes to citizen engagement on social media, Visakhapatnam stands second. The other leading cities in social media engagements are Lucknow, Hyderabad, Tirupati, Ghaziabad and Roorkee.

GVMC additional commissioner III V Sanyasi Rao said the 2020 survey received an unprecedented response from the citizens. “The response can be gauged from the feedback submission of nearly one-fourth population of the city. We are expecting a better rank this time,” Rao told TOI.

Both Vijayawada and Tirupati got about 1.22 lakh responses each in the citizen feedback component. Other than Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Tirupati, no other city from Andhra Pradesh has garnered 1 lakh responses.

Vizag leading the SS feedback is not a new phenomenon as the city outscored all other Indian cities in the 2018 Swachh Survekshan by receiving nearly 1.61 lakh responses. South Delhi municipal corporation, which was then in second place, garnered about 1.2 lakh responses.

Even though the feedback component carries only a 25% weightage, it reflects the interest among and participation of residents in the city’s cleanliness and sanitation activities.

Haryana government will also write to the federations to depute more women coaches with women teams

KURUKSHETRA: In a decision that will be primarily applicable to state-run sports academies, the Haryana sports ministry has said it would ensure only women coaches and managers for all women’s teams representing the state.

Haryana sports and youth affairs minister Sandeep Singh on Monday said, “The women players will feel more secure if they have women coaches and managers and their families too will be less anxious during their travel.”

“If for some reason, a male coach or manager accompanies a women’s team, he will be given strict instructions not to stay with the team at night and he will have to make arrangements for his stay at some distance from the women’s team,” the minister said.

Asked about the sports federations or associations which are under no obligation to depute same gender coaches, Sandeep said, “We will recommend, suggest and write to the federations to depute more women coaches with women teams and male coaches with male teams of Haryana. Normally, when a Haryana team goes to a tournament, our coaches accompany them as the federations do not have their coaches.”

“It will be beneficial for everybody if the federations and state sports department work in tandem to bring better results. If we recommend something and the federations don’t accept the same, this will only hamper the outcome,” the minister added.

Asked if federations do not accept directions or recommendations, Sandeep said, “In that case, we will take action against the respective sports federation or association.”

“Letters will also be sent to state sports federations of school, junior, senior levels for deputing same-gender coaches for players, so that we can boost the confidence of female players at all levels in Haryana,” the minister said.

Asked if there are enough women coaches for different levels, the minister said, “In Haryana, we have the best women sports coaches and their number is also good. In case, we struggle to provide women coaches, we will ensure stay arrangements for male coaches away the women players. In those cases, we will try to send women managers with the teams.”

The cabinet comprises 12 ministers, including chief minister Pramod Sawant, and was last reshuffled in July 2019, after ten Congress MLAs joined the BJP . Sawant had dropped three ministers from GFP and one independent MLA to pave the way for four of the newly inducted MLAs.

He also said that senior party functionaries will assess the performance of the minister and then take a decision.

‘After ZP election, the cabinet would be reshuffled. If this correction is done, it would be better,” he said.

The Sawant-led BJP government is scheduled to complete its first year next month. Sawant had taken over the reins of the state two days after the death of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar on March 17, 2019.

“Our BJP leaders in Goa and Delhi knows about this issue. To increase the performance of this government, this (reshuffle) should be done,” Lobo said.

Stating that he too could be dropped if the chief minister felt he was not performing, Lobo said that the need of the hour was to have in place ministers who can generate revenue for their departments.

Lobo said he had made a similar demand during the tenure of then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar. Parsekar had refused to effect a cabinet reshuffle except for changing the portfolio of a minister of its then ally, MGP. In the assembly election that followed in February 2017, BJP was pushed to second position with just 13 seats in the house of 40.

“When we were 13, we had to give away some of our portfolios to GFP. Two of them did not even know how to get the work done,” Lobo said.

Specially designed bowls that were used to conceal the drug by Jerusalem-based Shaul Borov

MANALI: An Israeli national, who came out with a new idea to smuggle charas (hashish) out of Kullu , was arrested with 2.5kg of the contraband.

Intending to sell charas in Varanasi at higher prices, Shaul Borov, 42, of Jerusalem, Israel, spent a month to conceal 2.5kg charas in 10 small and large size bowls, police said.

While the inner layer of bowls was metallic (copper), the outer shell was of other material and had designs. The accused managed to fill the gap with such a large quantity of charas. He rented a room at Vashisht village near Manali to execute the job, police added.

Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh said the accused was here on a tourist visa and lived in a rented room at Vashisht village. “He was trying to ferry the consignment to Varanasi. He spent a month in concealing the contraband in his room. He had filled charas in empty gap and sealed it properly. A police team had stopped a private Volvo bus plying on Manali-Delhi route for checking and recovered the contraband on Sunday night,” he said.

In the past two months, police have arrested eight foreigners allegedly involved in supplying chitta to Kullu and other regions of the country or for charas smuggling. “Five Nigerians, two Ivorian and a Russian have been arrested in the past two months under the NDPS Act,” the SP said.

Police sources said the smugglers have become a headache as they have adopting new techniques to conceal charas. On an average, Kullu police foil a bid to smuggle charas or chitta in every two days, but some still manage to go out of Himachal .

The prices of charas, especially Malana cream, are many times higher in other states.

Not just roads, the smugglers at times trek for days to smuggle charas. Concealing charas in shoes, body, books, apple cartons, backpacks, tyres of vehicle, seats, and under dashboard had been a conventional method, sources said. Smugglers also use Nepalese persons as carriers on a commission basis.

Sources said while the smugglers are coming with more innovative ideas, the police force is also getting smarter in order to check smuggling of drugs.

340,['4/02/2020'],"Police conduct flag marches, Maharashtra says won’t file case if stir called off","This story is from February 4, 2020

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has urged anti-CAA protesters at ""Mumbai Bagh"" to withdraw their eight-day-long agitation and assured them that it will not file any case against them if they move out. Nagpada police, in the past week, had issued notices under the preventive Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code to seven locals, warning them that if any untoward incidents took place, they would be booked.

A delegation of former and present MLAs and women representatives of the protesters met the minister on Monday after certain issues cropped up at the protest site from Saturday. Police had on Saturday tried to get the group to withdraw, without success.

Former MLA Waris Pathan said they had asked Deshmukh to take back the notices issued. “We will meet the core committee of the protestors and take a unanimous decision about the next step,” Pathan said. He said a decision if the protest has to be taken back or if it can be shifted to another location would be taken in a meeting scheduled at night at the protest site outside Arabia hotel in Mumbai Central .

The women who form the core committee of the protest were closeted in a meeting on Monday night to determine their next course of action. However, the men backing the agitation said they had no plans of winding up the stir or of moving it elsewhere, and demonstrators at the site staged their sit-in well into the night.

Samajwadi Party MLA from Bhiwandi Rais Shaikh, who was also part of the delegation, said they did not want anyone to take advantage of the protest and the situation at the site, so an appropriate decision would be taken.

On their part, police began preparing themselves for the worst by conducting flag marches in various parts of the city, which will be repeated on Tuesday. Police also revised and updated their standard operating procedure for communal riots. Former IPS officers said they do not remember such an occurrence since the Mumbai riots of 1992-93. Routine flag marches are carried out before elections or prominent events. But seldom do police anticipate communal riots to break out at such times.

Monday’s flag marches came hot on the heels of violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University and firing near Jamia Millia Islamia University and at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. The protests going on at Govandi and Madanpura have prompted Mumbai police to take the preventive step, sources said.

Police remained tightlipped when asked if there was any high alert or anticipation of any untoward incident in the backdrop of the anti-CAA/NRC protests at Nagpada and Deonar. “Anything can happen. We are preparing for the worst,” said an officer. “The march was carried out at the level of local police stations across the city for peace. The idea is to show visible police presence and prevent any untoward incident, particularly in sensitive pockets,” Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP Pranay Ashok, said. Meanwhile, Nagpada police have deployed two CCTV vans at both ends of the “Mumbai Bagh” protest to capture images from all directions. The cameras are linked to the server at the police control room.

A flag march resembles patrolling by Armymen in full gear in an area where curfew has been imposed. The objective is to show presence of forces in the area in order to prevent a law-and-order situation.

Former Mumbai police commissioner D Sivanandhan said, “I had heard about police flag marches only during December 1992-January 1993 after the Babri Masjid demolition.”

Former Navi Mumbai commissioner K L Prasad said, “I have never heard of any such flag march during the last decade in Mumbai. Even after 26/11, no flag march was carried out. The march is carried out for reassurance and to restore confidence among people who are scared of untoward incidents. Secondly, the idea is to spread fear in the minds of miscreants.”

IPS officer-turned lawyer Y P Singh said, “The march could be in anticipation of any volatile situation.”

In the western suburbs, police from Bandra, D N Nagar, Meghwadi, Nirmal Nagar, Oshiwara, Sahar and Sakinaka carried out marches in vulnerable pockets on Monday. “We got instructions from the police commissioner’s office to conduct the march. It was carried out for an hour from 11.15am to 12.15pm,” an officer said.

In Mumbai North, flag marches were conducted at 5-6 locations including Aarey Colony, Goregaon East, Malwani etc. “The revised and updated SOP mentions what should be the line of action if a communal riot breaks out,” said Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner, north region.

JAIPUR: A gang consisting of meritorious students, student leader and sports medal winner has been busted by Sikar police, which was allegedly involved in printing fake currency and possessing it. Acting on a tip off, the police searched pockets of seven students and recovered notes of Rs 200 denomination from their possession, which were allegedly fake. The arrested accused are in the age group of 18 to 26 years.

“The seized notes have the same serial number –OLF933094,” superintendent of police (Sikar) Gagandeep Singla told TOI. The fake currency was almost replica of the original notes. One of the arrested accused, Ramawatar Jat, was elected as president of students’ union of science college in Sikar in 2017-18. He also won karate championship in a state-level tournament, the police claimed. The other arrested accused were identified as Vijendra, Abhishek, Ajay, Ankit Kumar , Rakesh Kumar and Rafiq.

According to the police the accused told them that they had learnt the art of printing fake currency from an internet search engine. “They used fake currency to fulfill their daily requirements. They also printed excess fake currency and used it in the nearby areas of Sikar district,” said the police.

When the police inquired about their education, they were shocked to hear that they all were good in academics.

The police seized one printing press that was used for printing fake currency notes at Kalyan Circle, Sikar. The police arrested two accused at the printing press identified as Surendra and Subhkaran.

342,['4/02/2020'],Himachal government busy in Delhi polls: Congress,"This story is from February 4, 2020

SHIMLA: With chief minister Jai Ram Thakur along with his cabinet colleagues busy in the campaigning for BJP candidates in Delhi assembly polls, the opposition Congress has accused the BJP government of leaving the state’s functioning at the mercy of god.

Congress MLA Vikramaditya Singh, son of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, said for the past one week, the entire cabinet and senior officials had been missing from the state secretariat, which is very unfortunate.

“While on one hand, the entire government is busy in Delhi election campaign, on the other officials of state government are also missing from the state secretariat which is quite surprising. The entire functioning of government has been left at the mercy of god for the past one week,” he said.

Vikramaditya, who is Congress MLA from Shimla (rural) constituency, said the current situation prevailing at the secretariat shows that BJP government has no concerns for the people of state. He said people are facing problems due to frequent snowfall, the official machinery has completely failed to provide relief to people.

“Upper Shimla area is still cut off from the main roads. Power supply too has been disrupted. At a time when people are staring at shortage of daily used commodities, the state cabinet is busy in Delhi polls,” he said.

He said the way entire cabinet is busy with election campaigning in Delhi, it shows as if they themselves are going to form a government in Delhi.

He said under the BJP regime at the Centre, people of country are feeling unsafe. He said CAA and NRC have triggered such a situation in the country that people are wielding guns and opening fires at protesters, after being instigated by politicians and ministers.

He said Himachal Pradesh had failed to get any benefit despite having BJP government in the state and Centre. “The hill state was completely ignored in the Union Budget even as Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur represents the state,” he said, adding that all four BJP MPs from the state had also failed to utilise MPLAD funds, showing that they had nothing to do with the development of state.

343,['4/02/2020'],City’s Shaheen Bagh begins under guard and cop watch,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: The city’s first full-fledged Shaheen Bagh-style all women protest against the controversial CAA-NRC-NPR began with the participation of about 4,000 women after organizers agreed to limit the days to five with the timings being 10am to 6pm at Farooq Nagar ground at Teka Naka on Monday.

The organizers have decided to renew the permission through a new applicant after every three days to keep the indefinite protest going.

Women continued to sit under the two big domes set up at the venue till around 8pm. Organizers said the activities wound up by 6pm while the women held a meeting for over two hours. A similar protest was held from Jan 19 to 23 at the Eidgah ground in Jaffar Nagar but it faced issues pertaining to police permission.

Muslims women had planned an indefinite protest on the almost one-acre land owned by ‘The Weavers’ Cooperative Housing Society’ in the locality dominated by the same community.

The police were initially reluctant to allow any kind of protest at the venue apprehending law and order issues. The organizers, comprising sitting and former corporators from the area, were instructed to shift activities regarding the protest to Samvidhan Square.

On Monday, the organizers, led by Hafiz Abdul Basit, assured the cops about the safety of women and also deployed over 1,100 volunteer guards to keep a watch on the crowd and if need be, to control it.

To prevent any untoward incident or incidents, separate groups of cops and volunteers stood guard at regular intervals along the boundaries of the ground which was sealed with the shamiana. The stick-wielding volunteers — posted everywhere at the venue — guided women to the dome and ensured their entry path remained clear.

Around 200-300 men, who also came to support the cause, were given a separate enclosure outside the dome to sit.

Speeches, patriotic poems, songs and satire were presented by women who were for the first time in full control of the stage as well. Men weren’t allowed on the stage. It was strictly an all-woman affair — for the women, of the women and by the women.

Homemaker Tarranum Firdos joined the protest to condemn the Delhi police’s excesses on students and inaction against the Jamia shooter. “We will continue to sit here till the government holds a dialogue with our Shaheen Bagh sisters,” she said.

Firdos finished all her household chores, including preparing dinner, before coming to the venue around 2pm. “Some of us have come with kids, while some came with their beddings and belongings to stay overnight, assuming we would get 24-hour permission,” she said.

Teka resident Zakia Ansari has participated in all the protests held in the city so far. “I’m unwell today, but that won’t stop me from continuing my fight against the CAA and the NRC,” she said.

Ansari said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister Amit Shah should not have taken such a decision which has forced

mothers and sisters to hit the streets. “We don’t like to sit without food or water but given the precarious situation, we are left with just one choice — to protest,” she said.

Razia Parveen, a resident of Mominpura, said the country’s earlier leaders never took such a step which has created such a divide.

Student Zeba Khan said she has all the documents but was fighting for others. “What about the others who are living here but may not have documents,” she asked.

Lecturer Farkunda Jabeen said the law is basically a ploy to divert attention from core issues.

CHANDIGARH/BATHINDA: With its Haryana counterparts arresting gangster Raju Basodi in Thailand last week, Punjab Police has started paper work for getting the accused on production warrant for interrogation into the murder of another gangster, Manpreet Singh Manna , at a shopping mall in Malout on December 2 last year.

Basodi had taken responsibility for Manna’s murder in a Facebook post. Muktsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Raj Bachan Singh Sandhu said they were in touch with Haryana Police and were planning to take Basodi’s custody on production warrant in Manna’s murder case.

Basodi is wanted for a number of murders in Rajasthan , Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh and Punjab. His name also figured in the murder of gangster Sonu Shah in Chandigarh on September 28, 2019.

A source said police had come to know of Basodi’s whereabouts through the interrogation of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.

Basodi’s close associate Sandeep Jathedi was freed by his friends who opened fire on a police party in Faridabad on January 31.

A Haryana Police officer said, “This is certainly a major catch for us. Our officers were continuously in touch with Interpol after red corner notice were issued against him.”

Raju hails from Basodi village of Sonipat. He first shot into news after he killed two persons and pumped 19 bullets into a person in police custody. He had come out on bail in 2017.

After that he was working with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi who is lodged in a jail in Jodhpur of Rajasthan.

His most recent involvement was in the murder of Sonu Shah, who was shot dead in his office in Burail of Chandigarh, in the broad daylight.

NEW DELHI/GREATER NOIDA: Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has arrested a wrestler for allegedly selling a country-made pistol for Rs 10,000 to the 17-year-old youth who had shot at a student outside Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday. The accused, Ajeet , was arrested from his house in Shahjahanpur near Aligarh .

“We will interrogate Ajeet to know the source of the weapon. It will also be probed whether he is involved in arms dealing,” said DCP (Crime) Rajesh Deo . Ajeet has a BA degree and was enrolled in a BEd course at a university in Uttar Pradesh.

Police are yet to take any action against the juvenile’s relative. An officer said that the relative had no knowledge if the shooter actually bought the weapon or he was going to fire it at Jamia.

The shooter, who is to take his Class XII exams next month, told police that he was dropped off at Jamia Nagar and mistook the protests there as the Shaheen Bagh sit-in. He claimed that he got scared seeing the students and others approach him and fired in panic.

Sources said the shooter’s links with Deepak Sharma, who calls himself the leader of a fringe outfit called Rashtriya Swabhiman Dal, were being investigated as the youth had uploaded a photo showing him and Sharma together on Facebook. Sharma is known to police as National Security Act was invoked against him following clashes between Indian and Afghan students at Sharda University in 2018.

Asked whether he knew the shooter, Sharma claimed he barely knew him. “The picture is of a protest where the juvenile had participated,” he added. He said he didn’t support the youth’s act of shooting at a protester.

The controversy over the shooter’s age continued on Monday when a second image of an electoral slip was uploaded on Twitter.

Bareilly: A 35-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself at Oel area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday night, hours after she quarreled with her abusive alcoholic husband. The woman was found hanging on Monday morning, when she did not open the door of her room even as her children could be heard crying.

This is the third incident when a married woman was either killed by her husband or committed suicide in Lakhimpur Kheri in the past one week.

When police arrived, the door was broken and Susheela Devi was found hanging. Her saree was used for the purpose. Police have sent the body for an autopsy to ascertain exact cause of death.

Neighbours said on Sunday evening, her husband Miththu had come home drunk as usual and the two had quarreled. Later, Susheela locked herself in her room with her children, aged three and two years old.

According to police, Susheela was married to Miththu nearly 10 years ago. Differences cropped up between them because of Miththu’s drinking habit.

Earlier, Susheela had gone to her maternal home and stayed there for nearly six months. Then, Miththu had promised to control his drinking habit. Over the next few years, the couple had two children. However, Miththu again started drinking heavily and would return home drunk every day.

Chandrakant Singh, SHO of Kheri police station, said, “After receiving information, sub-inspector Rajbali rushed to the spot and found a woman hanging in a room. Prima facie it looks like suicide but we have sent the body for an autopsy to ascertain reason of death. The woman’s husband is a drunkard and has been called for questioning. We are yet to receive any complaint from the parents of the deceased.”

On January 27, a man allegedly hacked to death his 35-year-old wife in Lakhimpur city as he suspected that she was having an affair with his younger brother. He also killed his brother.

On February 2, a 28-year-old woman was allegedly strangled to death by her husband, who later hanged himself in Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri district. He suspected that his wife was cheating on him.

<p> The portion of Dhapa that has been turned into a green zone after dumping of waste was stopped there<br></... Read More

KOLKATA: Unable to find an alternative ground to dump waste as large as Dhapa , the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to continue with the existing facility but after scientifically reclaiming it in phases.

Adopting multi-pronged strategies to combat the ill-effects of hazardous waste at Dhapa, the civic solid waste management department has started reclaiming portions of the dumpyard, so that those areas could be reused after creating sanitary landfill, said Debabrata Majumdar, member, mayor-in-council, overseeing the department.

During a visit to Dhapa, TOI found multiple machines scooping out chunks from high piles of waste and taking them to a compost plant, where the waste is recycled into fertilizer . “We have started reclaiming a part of the Dhapa ground since January 16. These scooped-up chunks are transported to a factory, where the waste is screened and segregated. After segregating plastic and the likes from biodegradable waste, the latter is sent to a separate unit to produce organic manure from it,” said a KMC solid waste management official.

As the KMC is determined to reduce health hazards from the Dhapa dumping ground, a search for an alternative land is also on. “Going by the present rate of reclamation, it will take much long to reclaim the entire 23 hectares of Dhapa. We need an alternative land that could be set up with a sanitary landfill facility to take the load off Dhapa,” a KMC official said. The civic body has stopped dumping waste on 12 hectares of land in the crore Dhapa area. The portion has been beautified and a green zone created there.

A civic official pointed out that the capacity of the compost plant would be enhanced soon. “In the first phase, we are recycling 300 tonnes of garbage a day. The capacity of the compost plant will be increased to 900 tonnes a day in three months,” he said.

The official said 100 tonnes of manure were produced from 300 tonnes of wastes every day. This apart, the compost plant, set up on a PPP model, receives 500 tonnes of biodegradable waste collected from Kolkata households every day.

A section of KMC officials, however, felt the success of the project of reclaiming the Dhapa ground would depend on fruitful implementation of waste segregation at the ward level. “We have recently started waste segregation at households in 20 KMC wards. The number will go up by another 100 by the end of the year. Only then will we be able to prevent the pollution being generated from the hazardous waste dumped at Dhapa,” said a KMC solid waste management official.

351,['4/02/2020'],CJ defends justice Haq’s transfer to Aurangabad: Lawyers,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: Even as a growing number of legal fraternity members are coming out in support of Justice Zaka Haq, and protesting his sudden transfer to Aurangabad, Chief Justice of Bombay high court Pradeep Nandrajog defended the decision, said some city-based lawyers.

Justice Haq, however, is yet to take charge of his new assignment at Aurangabad bench, where he was supposed to take charge from Monday, and is currently on leave till further notice. Justice NB Suryawanshi, whose headquarter was transferred from Mumbai to Nagpur, has joined the bench here.

The lawyers had told TOI that the judge may resign if his transfer is not cancelled, terming the entire episode as an ‘insult’ and ‘humiliation’ to the city’s bar, which has produced many legal luminaries.

Meanwhile, heaping praise on the city-based judge, the CJ told a delegation of Nagpur High Court Bar Association (HCBA) that he wanted a dynamic lawyer at the Aurangabad bench to effectively look after Public Interest Litigations (PILs), besides regular civil and criminal cases.

According to the lawyers, justice Nandrajog patiently gave a hearing to HCBA delegation led by senior counsel Shreehari Aney and including president Gauri Venkatraman and secretary Prafulla Khubalkar. The delegation handed over a representation signed by over 300 lawyers, who strongly protested sudden transfer of Justice Haq to Aurangabad bench, and even orally warned they would boycott court proceedings.

“The CJ welcomed lawyers’ delegation and explained the decision to transfer the judge to Aurangabad. He told them that he wanted a judge held in high esteem by lawyers. He was also impressed with the working style of justice Haq, who’s known for quick disposal of cases. He was of the opinion that justice Haq’s stay there would significantly help reduce the pendency of cases,” the lawyers told TOI on condition of anonymity.

According to them, the CJ, who is to retire later this month, also clarified that he hadn’t acted on anyone’s complaints against the judge, nor acted over his action of sending a notice to the registrar for alleged negligence on the part of HC registry officials, as speculations had been swirling.

“He told the HCBA delegation that as a CJ, he needs to make some adjustments to maintain the balance and justice Haq’s transfer was a routine affair without any prejudice. The CJ also shared his own experiences with senior lawyer Aney. Their entire conversation lasted for over an hour, which is rare, as the CJ is busy due to administrative work besides judicial duties,” the lawyers said.

They, however, pointed out that no discussions took place on justice Haq losing out his seniority at the Aurangabad bench. “The HCBA members should have stressed on maintaining the judge’s seniority, as he’s currently at fourth position in Nagpur bench and will eventually retire at second position in May next year. At Aurangabad, he will be at fifth position, and would retire at same position, which is an injustice to him,” they said, adding that there was otherwise nothing wrong in transferring the judge, which is the sole prerogative of a CJ, as the administrative head.

352,['4/02/2020'],Work on smart road with RWH kicks off in Srirangam,"This story is from February 4, 2020

For residents of flood-prone Veereswaram Melatheru of Srirangam , even a moderate rain is a source of dread. But with Trichy Corporation now launching civil work on a smart road equipped with stormwater drains in the locality, the fear could soon be a thing of the past.

Estimated to cost `80 lakh, the smart road project is expected to change the face of the locality, bringing in rainwater harvesting (RWH) system, covered cable ducts and stormwater drains-cum pedestrian platforms on either side of the road.

The move came on the success of smart road project established at Veerswaram Keelatheru on a pilot basis last year. The scheme was effective in preventing inundation in recent northeast monsoon, encouraging the corporation to sanction second smart road.

As a requirement, the civic body said that all the houses and shops located on the road must have underground drainage connection and piped water supply. The eligibility criteria were set to avoid the need for digging up the road again to install pipes.

As per the smart road proposal, the 275-metre-long Melatheru road in Veereswaram will get one-foot wide stormwater drain on both sides. The drain will be covered with reinforced cement concrete (RCC) slabs so that vehicles and pedestrians can walk on them.

""The provision for stormwater drains will be provided next to the compounds of houses. Parallel to the drains will be covered cable ducts on either end of the road leaving a space for telephone cables to pass through without disturbing the road space,"" a corporation official said.

By covering the stormwater drains with RCC slabs and making use of the space, the overall width of the road will increase from 5 metres to 6. ""Completion of piped water connections to households has delayed the commencement of civil work for the smart road. Concrete road laying will also start shortly,"" the official said.To drain the rainwater on the low-lying road, the corporation has dug three 20-foot deep borewells near PDS outlet and Anjaneyar temple in Veereswaram to collect the rainwater and rejuvenate the groundwater table. Officials said Veereswaram Melatheru will get a smart concrete road within a couple of months which will serve as a model for emulating smart roads in other parts of the city.

353,['4/02/2020'],Amravati-Mum regular flights from next year,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: Vidarbha is going to get its second fully operational airport at Amravati soon. With this, the city will get air connectivity with Mumbai next year if everything goes according to the Rs110 crore expansion plan.

The present airstrip at Belora, 15km from Amravati, was constructed by public works department in 1992.

Gaurav Upshyam, Amravati airport manager of Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC), said work on expanding the runway is going on.

“At present, the length of the runway is 1,300 metre. We are lengthening it to 1,850 metre, suited for small aircraft like ATR 72. After the expansion, aircraft with 72 or 90-seat capacity will be able to operate from Amravati. The length of the runway for Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 aircraft is over 3,000 metre,” he told TOI. Upshyam further said that tender for construction of the terminal building had been floated and it would be ready after an year.

“On the technical side, a team of Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had visited Amravati. A team from Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is slated to inspect the airport. We will need green signal from these two authorities before starting the operations,” he added.

Alliance Air has already promised to start an air service to Mumbai. A team of SpiceJet too visited the airport. Upshyam said that talks would be held with other players too.

Presently, the airport is used by only chartered aircraft. The airport was originally spread over an area of 74.86 hectares. Later, another 336 acres was handed over to MADC in January 2015 for expansion.

The airstrip was taken over by Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) in August 1997 and later transferred to MADC. There were plans to hand it over to Airports Authority of India (AAI), but the state government changed its mind.

Nagpur Flying Club had applied to DGCA for permission to shift its flying operations to Amravati airport, but the club closed down and hence the shifting did not take place.

Amravati airport had been included under UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) and regional connectivity schemes of the central government in 2019. The demand for an operational airport in the city is an old one.

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has decided to set up old age homes having a capacity of 150 persons in every district of the state by 2024.

The government had earlier set a deadline of 2028 to establish these homes, but decided to complete the project by 2024 after the Punjab and Haryana high court expressed dissatisfaction over the same.

“The state government has revisited the scheme for establishment of old age homes with a capacity of 150 persons in each district of Haryana. Keeping in mind the welfare of senior citizens, it has been decided to reduce the timeline from 2028 to 2024 to set up these old age homes in each district and start work as early as possible,” the social justice and empowerment department has informed the high court.

After hearing Haryana’s stand on the issue, the HC has disposed of the public interest litigation (PIL) filed on the issue.

The Punjab government has already informed the HC that the state would complete construction of 21 old age homes, one in each district, by 2022. As far as UT Chandigarh is concerned, it has already got two old age homes.

Earlier, when the Haryana government had informed the HC about setting up of old age homes in every district by 2028, the high court had termed the state’s deadline as “highly unreasonable and unrealistic.”

356,['4/02/2020'],"Quizzing suspects over 69 days, cops crack murder case","This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: Persistent follow-ups and sustained interrogation of suspects over 69 days finally helped cops solve the mysterious disappearance of 35-year-old Monesh Thakre. On Monday, the suspects led cops to a nullah in the forest adjoining Jamtha village, where they had dumped the remaining bones of the victim after murdering him and burning his body. The cops were able to recover four burnt bones, including the lower jaw, from the spot.

Akshay Yeole (25) and Nilesh Agre (19) have confessed to stabbing Thakre to death at an abandoned property at Bhawani Nagar on November 28, 2019, over gang rivalry. Yeole, facing one more murder charge and one attempt to murder among four earlier offences, had lured Thakre to the desolate place from a liquor bar at Pardi. Agre too had gone with them on the bike.

Yeole and Agre’s friend Soham Biloriya (30) too has been named an accused, but is on the run. They had taken Thakre’s body on scooter to a 22 acre abandoned plot behind their houses at Bhawani Nagar, Pardi, and left it there after the murder.

In the wee hours of November 29, Yeole, Agre and Biloriya returned there with petrol taken out into bottles from their scooters and bikes. Thakre’s body was burnt over the next couple of hours. The three then washed themselves, and burnt their own clothes too to destroy evidence.

The following day, Yeole and Agre roped in Amol Hirapure to arrange a car. The three wrapped the last remains of Thakre in a sari and threw the bones into a nullah near Jamtha on Nagpur-Jabalpur Road. Later, they burnt the sari too.

Police said most bones had been washed away, but four bones stuck in the mud were recovered by the police after the accused three admitted to the crime and led them there.

It’s learnt Thakre had tried to lure Yeole away from the liquor bar by claiming he had found a place with hidden silver coins. However, Yeole turned the tables on Thakre, by taking him on his bike and asking Agre to join them.

Yeole had feared that Thakre and his friend Vinod Wagh, who was in a rival group, may eliminate him. Wagh had earlier thrashed Agre over Rs2,500-Rs3,000 he had lent him, when Yeole was in jail. Planning to avenge the humiliation, Yeole had asked Agre to wait for him to step out of jail on bail.

On November 28, Thakre was enjoying liquor with two friends, and was later joined by Yeole and Agre. After the two friends left, Thakre continued consuming liquor with Yeole and Agre. They were seen at the bar at Pardi by many, and also captured in CCTV cameras.

The cops had seen the footage, and had questioned Yeole and Agre, separately and together, numerous times over the last two months. But the two had not revealed anything. Apart from Pardi police, where Thakre’ family had filed a missing complaint, crime branch too had been repeatedly questioning Yeole.

Recently, Agre had taken ill, and spilled the beans about the murder while being questioned rigorously in his weakened state.

Additional CP Nilesh Bharne said DNA test of the bones would be conducted to confirm the identity of the victim, and prove the murder and destruction of evidence by the accused.

The team which cracked the case comprised ASI Shreeniwas Mishra, constables Pankaj Lande, Vijay Yadav, Umesh Khobragade, Sunil Choudhary, Sachin Andhale and others under PI Vinod Patil and API Amol Kachore.

357,['4/02/2020'],HC slaps Rs 5.80L cost on 29 for ‘frivolous’ petition,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court slapped a cost of Rs5.80 lakh on 29 persons calling their petition a frivolous one. While dismissing their plea, the HC asked them to deposit the amount within four weeks and asked Amravati collector to recover it in case of default.

“In spite of such conduct on judgment debtors (petitioners) part, if this court is to lend its helping hand to them, a litigant would lose faith in country’s legal system and would start resorting to ‘Courts of Men’ and not ‘Courts of Law’,” a division bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Milind Jadhav observed.

“If HC helps petitioners, it would be doing great disservice to law and justice administration system. In that case, what was said about more than 100 years ago by the Privy Council, would continue to hold the field. It famously says that in India it is very easy to obtain a court’s decree, but it’s very difficult to execute it. The ordeal of a litigant in India really begins after he obtains a decree from the civil court and it happens when the decree holder is compelled to initiate execution proceeding,” the judges said adding they find this petition as “frivolous and vexatious” which deserves to be dismissed with exemplary costs.

Chandrashekhar Rathi, managing trustee of Fattehlal Saligram Trust in Dhamangaon, had filed a civil suit before the civil court at Telhara in Akola for getting possession of agriculture land from petitioners Devidas Gavai and 28 others. The judgement went in Rathi’s favour on July 3, 2010, which directed Gavai and others to return land’s possession. Thereafter, he filed an application for executing court’s orders while seeking directives to police authorities to provide protection to facilitate sowing operations on disputed land, as it was in petitioners’ possession, which they challenged in HC.

The judges pointed when a court passes a decree against judgment debtor to vacate land and hand over possession to the applicant, the former is obliged under the law to obey it. “S/he should voluntarily hand over the possession within stipulated period without requiring a decree holder to file execution proceedings. Ordinarily, a judgment debtor should not create a situation wherein an applicant would be required or compelled to once again knock at court’s doors for enforcing a decree, else it will only be reduced to a paper having no meaning.”

The judges added petitioners enjoyed the possession of disputed land for about a decade and even today, they are desirous of perpetuating their illegal possession. “A judgment debtor must respect the law by showing wilful and voluntary compliance. If they refuse and seek refuge in some technicality of law, they don’t deserve any help from HC exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,” they said.

What HC said:

* Petitioners’ enjoyed possession of disputed land for about a decade

* Even today, they were desirous of perpetuating their illegal possession

* Litigants lose faith in legal system if courts help such frivolous petitions

* If court helps such petitioners, it’s great disservice to justice administration system

* Situation shouldn’t be created where litigants are compelled to knock court’s doors again

While the roads in Veereswaram locality of Srirangam are set to turn heads for their smart appearance, the pothole-riddled, interior roads in the residential areas are crying for attention.

Residents complained they constantly give their vehicles for repair after driving on the uneven roads in Vasantha Nagar near Kollidam flood bank road, leaving a hole in their pocket.

Situated near the eastern entrance to Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy Temple, Vasantha Nagar has around 150 houses and has a road to reach Kollidam flood bank road. However, the approach road connecting Vasantha Nagar has been in disrepair for at least 5 years, the residents said.

With the top surface of the bituminous road coming off frequently, two-wheeler riders frequently skid off the approach road. ""It is difficult to travel during peak hours on the road with our children riding pillion. We frequently spend a significant sum to repair our two-wheeler as the tyres go flat often,""

K Revathy, a resident of Vasantha Nagar said.

As the approach road is the only way for the residents of Vasantha Nagar to reach the core area of Srirangam island, the residents have asked the local body to rebuild the road.

Residents said that two-wheeler riders often crash into the pedestrians commuting on either end of the Vasantha Nagar approach road. When contacted, a corporation official said that roads of Vasantha Nagar, Indira Nagar and Rajagopal Nagar all falling under ward number 3 will be refurbished within the month.

""Through Tamil Nadu Urban Road Infrastructure Fund (TURIF), the residential roads in ward number 3 will be rebuilt with paver machines,"" an official from Srirangam zone of corporation said.

Trichy: The All India Private Colleges Employees Union (AIPCEU) has questioned credibility of Tamil Nadu Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) for not acting against candidates who were found guilty of malpractices in the recruitment of lecturers to government polytechnic colleges in 2017.

While TRB had notified afresh for 1,058 lecturers recently as the recruitment notification was cancelled after malpractices surfaced, no action has been taken so far against 196 erring candidates.

This is unlike TNPSC which has banned 99 erring candidates for life after finding them guilty of malpractices in the TNPSC Group 4-2A examination.

AIPCEU founder K M Karthik said that all the 196 erring candidates who were responsible for cancellation of the TRB recruitment will be applying for the post again along with those who had passed the exam in 2017. “But for not fault on their part, the passed candidates have to appear again and clear the test to secure job.”

“While the High Court had asked not to collect exam fee from the students applying again, TRB is collecting the fee against in contempt of the court order,” he said.

He also questioned the move from TRB to seek experience certificate and conduct certificate at the time of applying for the post. “While such details should be asked during the certificate verification, such move would lead to malpractices,” he said.

Nagpur: A 73-year-old Congress neta in Akola shot dead his youngest son after the latter tried to attack him over a property dispute at their residence in Irvande Plot on Monday. The deceased, identified as Manish Bharti, had several serious offences, including assault and robbery, registered against him.

Assistant police inspector of Civil Lines police station, Vishal Nande, said, “We rounded-up the father, Harilal alias Baba Bharti, but he complained of chest pain and high blood pressure so we had to shift him to hospital. We will arrest him after his health becomes normal.”

Just two days ago, an order was issued against Manish externing him from Akola district limits for three months. Police had not arrested him before he could be relieved outside the district limits.

Political sources in Akola Congress said that Baba is a well-known party neta while his eldest son Rajesh is a member of the party. Rajesh is also a former Youth Congress president.

According to police, Baba owns huge property in Akola and also runs a bar and an education society. Manish and Baba often got into quarrels as the former used to harass his father for money.

On Monday, Baba and his wife were in the house when Manish came there. Baba suspected Manish might attack him, so kept his licenced gun in his pocket.

It is learnt, Manish started demanding money and asked Baba to transfer a plot in his name, over which the father-son duo got into a quarrel. Manish allegedly pulled out a knife from his pocket and started running towards Baba who then fired a shot from his revolver. Manish sustained bullet injuries in the chest and fell on the ground.

After some time, Baba called police control room to report the incident. Civil Lines police along with the local crime branch team took Baba into custody. Cops sent the body to government hospital where the post-mortem was conducted.

It is learnt that police have seized the revolver and an empty cartridge from the spot. Baba has been booked for murder under sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Arms Act.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While the state election commission (SEC) faced flak from political parties for using 2015 electoral roll for 2020 local body elections , SEC has conducted elections in 810 wards since 2015, based on the ward level voters list prepared in 2015. No complaints were received by SEC for making use of 2015 voters list to conduct bypolls in the state in the past four years.

There is a difference of 9.93 lakh voters between the final electorate published in 2019 for Lok Sabha elections and the draft voters list published by SEC on January 20. SEC officials said that around 50-60 voters will be added in each ward by the time the final list is published on February 28.

“We could successfully conduct byelections in over 800 wards making use of the first ever ward level voters list, prepared in 2015. We did not receive any complaints in the past four years for relying on 2015 voters list. Addition of new voters will not be a challenge this time as well,” said a SEC official. Political parties had demanded making use of voters list published in 2019 for the 2020 local body elections.

SEC had undertaken a massive exercise in 2015 mainly making use of HVOs (house verification officers) to prepare a ward level based voters list in the state for the first time. It had involved an elaborate process beginning with field verification, compilation of list based on field visit, completion of data entry by electoral officers, arranging ward based lists at booth level and publication of draft voters list.

The process resulted in aligning assembly booth level lists to each ward. SEC has been keen on sticking to the 2015 ward level based voters list mainly due to two factors: the cost involved in conducting house level verification and the fact that making use of assembly level booth list will only furnish partial data for three to four wards. According to officials, 24,970 assembly booths will have to be redistributed among nearly 20,000 local body wards if the 2015 voters list is not used. SEC is now in the process of updating voters list in 19,498 wards across gram panchayats, municipalities and corporations.

The draft voters list in panchayats and municipalities was published on January 20. The complaints regarding draft voters list may be submitted to electoral registration officer till February 14. The final voters list will be published on February 28.

Those who have attained 18 years on or before January 1,2020 can add their names to the voters list. Applications for corrections, addition, change of polling station and ward can be submitted online. Applications for deletion of names from electoral roll (Form 5) will have to be applied by post. Online applications can be submitted on www.lsgelection.kerala.gov.in.

Voters list will be available for scrutiny in all local bodies and village offices and taluk offices. Secretaries in gram panchayats, municipalities and additional secretaries in corporation are the electoral officers.

NEW DELHI: Deaths in a raging fire in a city hotel last year was due to lack of awareness about safety arrangements and not due to failure of fire safety systems, the fire department on Monday told Delhi high court .

In a reply filed before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar , the department has argued that during the fire-fighting operations on February 12, 2019, when the tragedy occurred, it was found that “the incident took place due to the lack of awareness among occupants and hotel staff, not due to inadequacy of fire protection arrangements.”

The blaze killed 17 persons and resulted in the court initiating suo motu hearing into the tragedy after it received a letter from two persons claiming that the hotel, located in Karol Bagh , had failed to comply with the Supreme Court directions to have more than one exit and entry point.

The department, however, told the court that the hotel has two exit staircases and a fire safety system was also provided on the building premises.

In their letter that led the court to act, the petitioners had alleged that the hotel is located on a narrow road as against the requirement in the Master Plan that such establishments be set up near roads with a minimum width of 80 feet. They also questioned how a licence to operate was granted to the hotel by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Delhi Police despite these limitations.

The fire department, in its affidavit, stated that it conducts inspections of buildings referred to it by the local authorities and that unauthorised constructions and encroachments do not come under its purview.

Last year, the court had sought response of Delhi government, police and the fire department on the basis of the letter asking it to look into the fire.

The court has now listed the matter for further hearing on April 14.

KOLKATA: A young film-maker from Baruipur, who visited the International Kolkata Book Fair on Sunday evening, has sought compensation from Bidhannagar police, alleging that his car was damaged while being towed by cops from a no-parking zone in Salt Lake on Sunday. In the complaint, Sanchayan Chakraborty stated that he had parked the car behind Bidyut Bhavan at DJ Block in Salt Lake around 4.15pm and moved towards the book fair.Around 7.45pm, when Chakraborty and his friend, Palash Haq, came back, they found the car was missing. “We had not found any ‘no parking’ board in the area where we left the car. We first thought that the car had been stolen and ran to the nearby police outpost at Karunamoyee, where we came to know that it was towed by cops. We found the car on the roadside in CJ Block, but its front portion was severely damaged,” said Haq who posted their ordeal on the Facebook page of Bidhannagar Police on Monday.“We ran to the Bidhannagar East police station and sought an explanation from cops about the damage of the car. Initially, they refused to take our complaint and sent officers to check the car. They blamed us for parking the vehicle at a no-parking zone. Later, they accepted our complaint as a general diary,” said Haq.Showing photographs of the damaged vehicle, TOI sought an estimate from an expert dealing with Honda cars. He said the repair would cost from Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000.“The front bumper, hood, grille, moulding, radiator, condenser and bumper beam need to be replaced and this would cost approximately Rs 80,000,” said the expert. Cops said they have started a probe into the case on the basis of the complaint.“As per the Motor Vehicles Act, if any car is parked in a no-parking zone, obstructing traffic movement, police are authorized to tow it away. Sometimes cars get damaged while being towed. The same thing may have happened to this car. However, it was the fault of the car owner who had kept it in a no-parking zone,” said a senior police officer. He added that no illegal parking challan was issued against the complainant on Sunday. “We noted down his offence but have not issued any challan yet.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73921705,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-590973,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/towing-vehicle-damages-book-fair-visitors-car/articleshow/73915810.cms

374,['4/02/2020'],"When world looks at India now, it sees hatred and violence: Rahul","This story is from February 4, 2020

New Delhi: Hitting out at both BJP and AAP at his first public meeting ahead of the assembly elections , former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday alleged that both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal came to power by telling lies and would do anything to stay in power.

“Modi had promised two crore jobs and improvement of the economy. Kejriwal told lies about Congress and came to power. Those who come to power by telling lies can’t bring development,” Gandhi said at a public meeting in Sangam Vihar. “They only think about their own power and nothing else. They will say whatever you want to stay in power,” he added.

Rahul said the entire world wants to invest in India, but the Prime Minister doesn’t want that. “Modi says that he doesn’t need to provide employment. He says I want to divide Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christians. I want to destroy the unity this country has,” he alleged.

“When the world looks at India now, it sees hatred, violence, rapes, goondaism and killings. In the past five years, one Indian has started talking to another with hatred. This is not our history. This is a country of love,” Rahul said in his first public meeting at Sunlight Colony in support of Congress candidate from Jangpura, Tarwinder Singh Marwah.

Accusing the Centre of “selling” state enterprises like Indian Oil, Air India, Hindustan Petroleum and railways and Red Fort, Rahul claimed, “He (Modi) may even sell the Taj Mahal.”

“Be it BJP or AAP, they have only one target — to spread hatred in society. This is something that Congress can never do even if it tries. They talk about patriotism. Go to any person in this country, you will find patriotism in their blood, no matter which religion they belong to,” he said.

Alleging that both BJP and AAP were making one Indian fight with another to stay in power, Rahul asked, “Can a person who makes patriots fight among each other be a patriot himself?”

“Congress doesn’t divide people or spread hatred. Modi and BJP might be benefitting, but the people are not. If you want progress, development, economic growth and employment, you have to remove violence and hatred from your heart,” he said.

Rahul said, “They talk about Hindu dharma, they talk about Islam, they talk of Sikhism. They have no knowledge of religions. In Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Sikhism, where is it written to attack people and suppress them? What kind of Hindu dharma is this of Modi and RSS? Hinduism talks about taking everyone along.”

Stating that demonetisation and GST, which he termed as “Gabbar Singh Tax”, had broken the backs of traders, Rahul said, “The finance minister is not ready to tell how many youngsters got employment. The Budget speech by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament was hollow. In my next speech, I will list how many projects Adani and Ambani have been given by Modi.”

At Sangam Vihar, Rahul was joined by his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Hitting out at the PM for his Shaheen Bagh jibe “sanyog nahi prayog”, Priyanka said that 3.5 crore people had lost their jobs and unemployment rate was highest in 35 years. “The Congress government had pulled 14 crore people out of poverty. In the past five years, they (BJP) have pushed people back to poverty,” she claimed.

Trichy: Four botany students and an assistant professor from St Joseph’s College here have developed an eco-friendly sanitary napkin with plant-based fibre as the principal element. The college is awaiting patent for their napkin which can be produced for just Rs 2.

Terming it a path breaking innovation which will help marginalised sections of the society, T Francis Xavier, assistant professor of botany department, who guided the students, said that the napkin has double the absorption capacity than ordinary napkins.

“We found that the fibre has phenol and hydroxyl group of chemicals which ensures high absorption. Another advantage of phenolic compounds was its anti-bacterial property making it ideal as napkin. We have used two more plant fibre as anti-bacterial agents,” he said.

“Direct expose of this fibre to skin may cause rashes. To prevent this, plant fibre is treated in sodium hydroxide and covered with a thin layer of cotton to give it the final shape of a napkin,” said Bhubaneswari, a student member of the team.

While the team did not divulge the name of the plant as they are in the process of getting a patent for their eco-friendly napkin, Francis said that the team stumbled upon the plant during their visit to the tribal hamlets of Kolli hills last year for ethno-botany study.

They found tribal women in the village using a dry land weed from aloe vera family during menstruation after covering it with a cloth.

Francis said that their product could be an alternative to conventional napkins as it does not have dioxin - a bleaching agent used in many conventional napkins is cancer inducing. “Besides, petroleum products used to convert the liquid to gel form also leads to rashes. The napkin produced by us could prove ideal especially for being very economical,” said Francis.

St Joseph’s College Principal M Arockiasamy Xavier congratulated the team for their efforts. Apart from the napkin, students have also come up with napkin making machine at a cost of Rs 15,000 to produce napkins in a safe manner, Francis said.

Sulakshana Singha Roy has not attended office since January 10

KOLKATA: A young woman employed with a top designer’s firm at Topsia has been missing from her PG accommodation for the last 20 days.

The woman, Sulakshana Singha Roy (22), a government art college graduate hailing from Alipurduar, had returned from a Darjeeling trip, but had not joined office after that. On Sunday, her family lodged a complaint with Chitpore police station, alleging that she might have been “trafficked” and her colleagues might have something to do with that. Her sister, who stays in the same PG accommodation on a different floor, lodged an FIR with the police, claiming that some unknown office employee abducted Sulakshana and trafficked her for sexual exploitation.

Earlier, on January 11, a missing complaint was lodged with the police. Following the FIR on Sunday, police amended the case under IPC sections 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) and 370 (trafficking).

Police sources said the woman could not pursue higher studies owing to financial constraints.

She took up the job but was not happy with the remuneration. She had visited her home at Kuarpara in Alipurduar last month. She had come back to Kolkata but it seemed that she had skipped the office on January 10 and 11. She had reportedly left the PG accommodation on January 11 and called up her mother, saying that she could not speak to her because the battery of her mobile was dying out. Her last presence in the city was traced close to her office on Topsia Road, said police.

Cops have spoken to the woman’s colleagues and checked the CCTV footage of the Park Circus area, but they got no lead in the case so far. A colleague of Roy said that they had no idea about where the woman might have gone and that there was no allegation against her. “All that we can say is no colleague could have harmed her,” he added.

As soon as we get the information, the passenger will be masked and brought to the isolation ward where the patient will be treated as per protocol,” said Subramani.“The common advice from the health department is to maintain personal hygiene like hand washing. If someone feels they are having fever, he or she should stay back at home. In case of breathing difficulty, the person should be admitted to the isolation ward,” he said adding that he/she will be given oxygen and administered IV fluids and tested for lung infection.DDHS also said that fatalities could be completely avoided if the person is treated early.As far as Trichy district is concerned, the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) is equipped with a 12-bedded isolation ward for treating patients with coronavirus.

TRICHY: Trichy railway division has commenced work on constructing two escalators on each end of the footbridge at the railway station at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore. The project is expected to be completed within three months, officials said.

The escalators will be installed at the main entrance near the parcel office and the second entry at Kallukuzhi on the opposite side of the station.

“Trichy railway station already has seven platforms and construction of the eighth one is nearing completion,” officials said. “However, the movement of the escalators will only be upward. Passengers cannot use them for stepping down from the footbridge”, officials added.

Till 2016, passengers who arrived on platforms two to seven had to use the subway which became congested during peak hours as it is narrow. The footbridge was opened in 2016.

“The escalator will mainly benefit senior citizens, children and patients who find it difficult to climb all the steps of the footbridge,” said K Raju, 59, a commuter from Lalgudi.

An escalator is already installed in the subway to connect platforms 2 and 3. It was established under Rajya Sabha MP Trichy N Siva’s Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) funds. Officials said that there are plans to provide more escalators to connect all the platforms with the footbridge.

380,['4/02/2020'],Maharashtra: College teacher set on fire by married man stalking her,"Accused Vikesh Nagrale

NAGPUR: A 24-year-old college teacher in Hinganghat town, about 75km from here in Wardha district, was set ablaze in public view by a man stalking her for past few days. Ankita Pisudde, 24, a contributory lecturer with local Matoshree Ashatai Kumawar Mahila Mahavidyalaya, sustained 35%-40% burns and is being treated in Nagpur.Police have taken into custody a fellow villager Vikesh Nagrale, a married man with a child, for carrying out the attack early on Monday morning near the college where Ankita taught.Sources in the Orange City Hospital and Research Institute, where Ankita was brought, stated she was in critical condition with Grade-III deep dermal burns covering scalp, face, right upper limb, left hand, upper back and full neck with injuries affecting her respiratory system. Doctors stated a surgery was performed on Ankita but another 72 hours would be needed to make a proper prognosis.Ankita, a postgraduate in Botany and pursuing BEd, was walking towards her college along with two students after getting off from the bus she took every day from her village Daroda. They were half-a-kilometre from the college when the attack happened.Nagrale came on his bike and hurled petrol from a container on Ankita’s head. He then threw a lighted torch, made by wrapping a cloth around a stick, towards her following which upper part of her body got engulfed in flames. Nagrale, who had kept his bike idling, sped away from the place.Later in the day, he was intercepted at MIDC Buti Bori by Nagpur rural police as cops traced his mobile phone location. Nagrale was communicating with a friend and Hinganghat police took help of the friend to nab him.Nagrale had earlier tried to end his own life over some issue with Ankita. Police said Ankita and Nagrale were friends earlier but she had snapped ties after he got married to another woman around a year ago. The accused also had child. He worked as an electrician with a railway contractor. Police received information from Daroda village, where Nagrale and Ankita stayed, that he was stalking her for the last few days.Home minister Anil Deshmukh told TOI strict action would be initiated against the accused who has been slapped with stringent provisions of law. “We will conduct trial of the case in a fast track court. The government would provide all possible help to victim and her family,” he said.“Any one engaging in such a heinous crime would be strictly dealt with,” he said. Deshmukh added he would shortly visit Andhra Pradesh along with senior officers to study the stringent anti-woman atrocity laws the state had enacted.Minister Sunil Kedar, guardian minister of Wardha, visited the hospital and had a discussion with the medical team urging them to focus on reviving her. “I am trying to either shift the victim to Mumbai or ensure a Mumbai-based expert attends to her. My first priority is to save her life,” he said. Kedar also stated he would delve deeper into the incident and find out what had led to the attack.Around three months ago, Nagrale had approached Ankita in the bus while she was heading to Hinganghat to speak to her. She had objected to it and also relayed to his father Arun about his advances. Arun had berated Nagrale and threatened to approach police if he repeated his act. At that time, no police complaint was lodged.Pandurang Tumaskar, chairman of the management body of the college where Ankita taught, said a passer-by tried to shield her but he failed to foil the attack. “A family in the vicinity rushed out with buckets of water with which they doused the flame and a man with car rushed her to a hospital in the vicinity from where she was referred to Nagpur and taken there escorted by police,” he said. He said Ankita was a regular and sincere lecturer in the college which she had joined in June last year.Ankita’s father Arun said he had never heard anything from his daughter after the incident in the bus. “We are completely taken aback by the attack. I want strict action against Nagrale,” he said. “The family was informed by a student of my daughter’s college whose father is my friend,” he said.State women commission has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter and directed the Wardha SP Basavraj Teli to take strict action against the perpetrator and prepare a watertight case against him.Hinganghat police station’s in-charge Satyaveer Bandiwar stated Nagrale was slapped with attempt to murder under section 307 and also 326A for injuring by burning under Indian Penal Code (IPC).WHAT IS SECTION 326AWhoever causes permanent or partial damage or deformity to, or burns or maims or disfigures or disables, any part or parts of the body of a person or causes grievous hurt by throwing acid on or by administering acid to that person, or by using any other means with the intention of causing or with the knowledge that he is likely to cause such injury or hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with fine: Provided that such fine shall be just and reasonable to meet the medical expenses of the treatment of the victim: Provided further that any fine imposed under this section shall be paid to the victim.In Video: Woman teacher set ablaze by man in Maharashtra’s Wardha",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73922960,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-442737,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/college-teacher-set-afire-by-married-man-for-snapping-ties/articleshow/73914364.cms
381,['4/02/2020'],MLAs peeved over Yogeshwara’s possible cabinet entry,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Bengaluru: The possibility of defeated MLA CP Yogeshwar being inducted into chief minister BS Yediyurappa ’s cabinet is causing ripples within the ruling BJP, with many legislators, especially from Kalyana-Karnataka region, raising a banner of revolt.

Several MLAs led by Surapur legislator Narasimha Nayak, also known as Raju Gouda , held a meeting at the Legislators Home on Monday and voiced their opposition.

""When there are more than two dozen MLAs aspiring for a cabinet berth, making a former MLA a minister is beyond logic,"" Gouda said. ""We will convey our feelings to Yediyurappa and state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel."" Murugesh Nirani, Paranna Munavalli, Rajkumar Patil, Dattatreya Patil Revoor, Basavaraj Mattimud are among others who attended the meeting. MP Renukacharya, political secretary to the CM and Honnali MLA, was also present at the meeting. ""Some more MLAs will join us when we meet again tomorrow,"" Gouda said.

The MLAs highlighted the issue of caste and regional imbalance in the council of ministers to further their cause. With four from Bengaluru and three from Belagavi district set to take oath on February 6, the share of MLAs from these districts in the cabinet will rise to seven and five respectively. Currently, 16 districts have no representation.

Sources say Yediyurappa and BJP’s national leadership decided to reward Yogeshwar with a cabinet berth for his ""active"" role in getting 17 Congress-JD(S) MLAs to resign and join the BJP, enabling the party to grab power. The party also believes he has the potential to become the Vokkaliga face of the BJP in the Old Mysuru region, where the party’s organisation is weak.

If Yogeshwar is inducted, he will be the second former MLA to make it to Yediyurappa cabinet after deputy CM Laxman Savadi, who lost the 2018 assembly polls. Several party MLAs were unhappy with Savadi’s elevation and are now upping the ante against the party leadership.

""Let Yogeshwar be made Rajya Sabha or council member. We have no problem. But making him minister is not acceptable. If they want to make defeated MLAs ministers, then why not AH Vishwanath and MTB Nagaraj, whose sacrifices brought BJP to power?"" said Gouda.

Reports say Yediyurappa has promised Vishwanath and Nagaraj, the disqualified MLAs who lost the bypolls, that they would be made ministers in June. Both met Yediyurappa and secured this assurance. The two were demanding that they be inducted into the cabinet on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Vijayapura MLA Basavanagouda Patil Yatnal urged the CM to evaluate the performance of existing ministers and drop those found non-performing. ""Many ministers don’t even come to the Vidhana Soudha. What is the use of having such ministers?"" he asked.

Yediyurappa also continued to face pressure to induct Athani MLA Mahesh Kumatalli into the cabinet. The Jarkiholi brothers, Ramesh and Balachandra met Yediyurappa separately on Monday with a request to make Kumatalli, their confidant, a minister.

Porvorim: The department of information and technology is in the process of drafting the land allotment policy for the Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) park at Tuem, said IT minister Jennifer Monserrate on Monday. Monserrate said the land allotment policy will make provisions for planned development of the Tuem IT park.

“The IT department is in the process of finalising the constitution of the special purpose vehicle for implementation of electronics manufacturing clusters,” Monserrate said, replying to a question in the state legislative assembly.

The Info Tech Corporation of Goa Ltd (ITG) has been identified as the implementing agency for setting up of the Tuem facility. ITG has already completed the survey for the plots and has also fenced off the land at a cost of Rs 22.8 lakh and Rs 12.8 lakh respectively.

Monserrate said that an escrow account has been opened with State Bank of India where the state government has deposited Rs 14.7 crore, which is 20% of the amount sanctioned by the Centre. The union ministry of electronics, and information technology has also deposited Rs 12.4 crore in the escrow account. “The Central government has already given its final approval for setting up the greenfield ESDM at Tuem and would be providing a grant in aid of Rs 73.8 crore against an approved cost of Rs 161.3 crore.

The department paid Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants Rs 36.7 lakh for carrying out transaction advisory services.

Goa State Pollution Control Board has granted the Tuem ESDM park consent to operate while Town and Country Planning department has granted the project technical clearance.

383,['4/02/2020'],Congress will take solid steps to tackle joblessness: Manmohan,"This story is from February 4, 2020

New Delhi: In an where most campaigns have seen sharp personal attacks and blame game , former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday said that he would rather talk about the issues plaguing the youths .

“Today, I won’t condemn any party. I want to point out the issues plaguing the youths of Delhi... It is a matter of shame that despite being educated, our youths have to run around for jobs. We will take solid steps to deal with unemployment if we come to power in Delhi,” Singh said, while addressing an election meeting at Tilak Nagar.

The senior Congress functionary pointed out that the unemployment rate in Delhi in the last four months was 15%, while it was 7% in the rest of the country. “Congress is committed to the people and our thrust will be on employment,” he said.

He pointed out that there had been a fall in the number of factory workers in the capital in 2017-18 compared with that in 2013-14 when the Sheila Dikshit government was in office. “It was 75,273 in 2013-14 and fell to 68,630 in 2017-18,” Singh added.

He urged people to vote for the Congress candidates from Rajouri Garden and Tilak Nagar, Amandeep Singh Sudan and Raminder Singh Bamrah, respectively, who were also present at the meeting.

Praising Dikshit for transforming the capital with her vision, Singh said, “Sheila Dikshit is not with us today… For 15 years, she offered great service to Delhi and its people. She changed the design of the city with roads, flyovers and the metro. Delhi Metro started during her tenure. In the first ride from Connaught Place to Delhi University, she accompanied me and had said that she wanted to set up an extensive network connecting most areas of the city.”

Referring to various people-friendly promises in the Congress manifesto, the former Prime Minister said, “Problems related to environment are increasing in Delhi. We will ensure that development is done with special care to environment.”

Pointing out that Congress had a separate manifesto for environment and planned a Delhi Electric Vehicles initiative, he said, “Like Sheilaji who had transformed the bus fleet of the city from diesel to CNG, we will do everything possible to clean up Delhi’ air and water.”

384,['4/02/2020'],National Board for Wildlife approves road connecting Corbett &amp; Rajaji reserves,"Haridwar: After years of back and forth, work on the controversial Laldhang-Chillarkhal road may soon get started as the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has given a go-ahead to the project.The road, proposed to cut down travel time between Garhwal and Kumaon, will cut through the reserve forest area of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) which has a healthy wildlife population. The 11.5-km-long road also includes a 4.5 km stretch from Chamaria Bend to Siggadi Sot — which is the sole wildlife corridor between Corbett Tiger Reserve ( CTR ) and RTR, which are the two premier sanctuaries of Uttarakhand.In June last year, the project had been put on hold by the Supreme Court which had directed the state government to first get clearance from National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and NBWL before commencing with the motor road project.Subsequently, the NTCA asked Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to submit its observations on the project. Scientists at the Tiger Cell of WII recommended a “status quo” on the stretch between Chamaria Bend and Siggadi Sot. WII recommendations, a copy of which is with TOI, read, “Status quo should be maintained on the stretch between Chamaria Bend and Sigaddi Sot. Black topping should be avoided in this route considering wildlife movement in the area. However, the forest department may maintain this portion regularly by using ‘murram’ so as to allow passage of vehicles.”Notwithstanding WII suggestions, NTCA approved the project stating that a 100-metre-long underpass can be constructed after every one kilometre road on the stretch. After NTCA’s approval, NBWL also gave a green light to the project and extended the limit for the length of underpass from 100 metres to 150 metres after every kilometre. So, the total length of the underpasses on the Laldhang-Chillarkhal road would now be a mere 705 metres which wildlife experts say will be too less for smooth movement of animals. Notably, a forest department committee headed by current WII director Dhananjai Mohan in 2014, had suggested that the construction of a 7.5 km-long flyover should take place in a phase-wise manner so that movement of animals is not obstructed.Reacting to the approvals given by NTCA and NBWL, Bhanu Bansal of the Centre for Wildlife and Environmental Litigation, which had raised the matter in NGT as well as the Supreme Court, told TOI, “It is shocking that NBWL cleared the project without taking into consideration various government reports which clearly bar black topping of the proposed road. It is one of the rare wildlife corridors that joins two tiger reserves. Elephants and big cats frequently use the area and this move would be detrimental for them.”Anup Kumar Nayak, member secretary of NTCA, when queried, said,“We totally believe in co-existence of wildlife and human beings. The approval has been given in the buffer zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve and not in the reserve areas. Also, the permission is accompanied by several relevant clauses which are meant to safeguard wildlife.”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/national-board-for-wildlife-approves-road-connecting-corbett-rajaji-reserves/articleshow/73912769.cms

KOLKATA: Vehicles crawled in north Kolkata but the chaos that paralyzed traffic on Saturday, immediately after the Tallah Bridge closure, did not return to haunt motorists on Monday. Police passed the acid test on Monday but on a long-term basis, they need to resolve a number of issues for smooth traffic movement.On Monday, the north-bound traffic along Lockgate flyover was relatively smooth as many vehicles were diverted along Central Avenue. Cars had very little or no issues in accessing Lockgate flyover and zipped past the chaos below during peak office hours. They took around 10-15 minutes to cross the area which normally takes five to seven minutes.Cars got lined up on a regular basis during morning peaks hours along the Belgachhia Road-R G Kar Road corridor, which ran both way. Kolkata traffic police officers, who were present all along the stretch, had a harrowing time in dispersing snarls. But since the queue of cars stuck in the jam was long, it was not possible to disperse all of them in a single signal cycle.Heavy congestion was also reported from Raja Manindra Road and Indra Biswas Road, which fed traffic to the Belgachia Road–R G Kar Road corridor from Paikpara and Tallah Park crossing, respectively. Even though Northern Avenue was made one-way, erratic traffic movement from the opposite direction made it difficult for cops to declog the area.Because of the tremendous traffic pressure, Kolkata Police on Monday switched to the automatic mode of signal to the manual mode. This was why a single signal cycle often ran into more than 15 minutes, causing further stress on fraying nerve of waiting commuters. The Kolkata station-bound traffic was diverted along Canal Circular Road from APC Roy Road. Police said this moved helped in decongesting the area to some extent.There were many choke points along this corridor that slowed down traffic and turned dispersal painstakingly long. The first choke point was in front of the RG Kar Hospital first gate, where a complex mix of the vehicular and pedestrian traffic left the area grid-locked. Similar was the situation at the entrance to Kolkata station complex from R G Kar Road. Traffic came to a standstill on either side when vehicles were allowed to ply one side by blocking the other side. Bad tram track conditions on the Shyambazar-bound flank slowed down car movement. Smooth, concretized tram tracks along the north-bound flank allowed vehicle dispersal faster along the stretch.The presence of a large number of police personnel, particularly traffic sergeants on motorcycles, who did not allow any vehicle to halt unnecessarily at any point, saved the day.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat forest department plans to replicate Nagaland’s success in conserving Amur falcons at Gujarat’s only Ramsar Site, Nalsarovar. Unesco’s Ramsar convention, named after the Iranian city where the convention was signed in 1971, seeks to protect wetlands of international importance. The falcons were once hunted in Nagaland but are now being diligently conserved with local participation.

In Nalsarovar, poaching of birds is rampant. Wildlife Institute of India ’s R Suresh Kumar — who is part of the Amur Falcon project in Nagaland — said: “After we realized that the falcons were being hunted in large numbers, we began satellite-tagging them.” The birds were also given a local name, that of a village in the vicinity, to instil a sense of ownership among the people.

Kumar said that when the birds returned, villagers were able to track their movements. The locals began conserving the falcons and poaching has almost ended. A senior officer from the Gujarat forest department said that the same model will be used in Nalsarovar. Flamingos and other migratory birds will be tagged, and the birds will be named after villages or the most respected persons in the villages. The department is hopeful that this will help in conservation efforts.

A senior officer said that tagging will also help the department to learn about bird migrations. He said that in the case of Amur falcons, they travelled from Nagaland to Africa and back every year.

The migratory path passes over Gujarat; the birds even make a brief halt in the state. These birds pass over Gujarat in the April-May period. Their distribution in Gujarat is widespread, with sightings reported in coastal, forest, and desert areas. Most sightings occur in the Little Rann of Kutch .

“These birds pass through Saurashtra and Kutch as the semi-arid conditions in Kutch are similar to those in Somalia,” Kumar said. “Those conditions are ideal for Amur falcons.”

390,['4/02/2020'],Police to devise special plans for exam season,"This story is from February 4, 2020

KOLKATA: The first real test of traffic plans after the Tallah Bridge shutdown — factoring in the movement of office crowd — has convinced the police brass that there is no need to change the Lockgate flyover traffic flow for the time being. However, cops will return to the drawing board to chalk out plans for examinees since the area has 20 Madhyamik and 11 Higher Secondary examination centres.

Taking into consideration the situation on ground, a few changes were implemented at Chiria More, Bagbazar and Paikpara by Monday evening. The most important decision that has been taken is to switch off the automated signals and operate them manually. Of immediate importance for two-wheeler users, the cops have clarified on Monday that no bikers will be allowed to use Lockgate flyover at night.

On Monday, the police brass — led by special CP Jawed Shamim — was out on the streets since the morning. Spot checks were done at the entire area, particularly at Lockgate flyover, the Belgachhia flyover and Cossipore Road, through the day. More than 150 officers on the ground sent regular reports to the temporary command centre at Chiria More and the main control room at Lalbazar.

From Tuesday, claimed sources, if Raja Manindra Road gets more volume of traffic than it can handle, cops will try to divert a few vehicles to Indra Biswas Road. Similarly, an attempt will be made to temporarily divert some cars to Cossipore Road to ease pressure.

“We do not think that tidal movement is necessary at this moment. Most motorists are aware of the shutdown and willingly took the diversion at Chiria More. We have begun tweaking the traffic signal timings based on real-time data. We want to ascertain yet again — after extensive meetings with different civic agencies — that we cannot permit two-way traffic movements on Lockgate flyover at any point of time. Even with a speed limit, there are sharp turns that two vehicles — if one is bus — will find difficult to negotiate,” said Santosh Pandey , joint CP (traffic).

Police said the stoppage of truck movement in the area has helped decongest north-bound traffic. “Except for the RG Kar Road stretch, we have come up with alternative strategies. The pedestrian crossover near RG Kar gates still has not thrown up an effective solution,” said an officer.

Sergeants TOI spoke to said they wanted auto routes to be introduced from Paikpara to Lake Town and Belgachhia Metro station. The cops said they will forward the suggestion to Kolkata Police headquarters.

Representative image

KOLKATA: Students commuting to different schools in north Kolkata had a tough time on Monday. While many of them reached schools late, other had a nightmarish journey back home. Many schools are now thinking of relaxing the entry restriction.

According to sources, schools may replicate their policy of relaxing the entry time that they had implemented in the wake of Majerhat bridge collapse in 2018. Rina Sharma, principal of Khalsa Modern School in Dunlop, said: “We are ready to allow grace time for entry of students travelling from Tallah and further north. Students will be given special assistance if anyone misses out on lessons. The annual examinations are approaching.”

Calcutta Public School, Baguiati, is yet to decide on relaxing the entry time for students travelling to and from the affected area. “In the changed scenario, travelling to and from school has become a major issue. We will take a call after checking out with students,” said a spokesperson of the school. Techno India Group Public School, Saltlake, principal Rupa Banerjee said the school had already decided to relax entry time for examinees. “We really cannot do anything about tweaking start and dispersal timing of the school,” she added.

Parents of some students have planned to meet the education minister to make an appeal so that students of the troubled area are exempt from certain regulations that bar entry of students after a point of time. “We are also thinking of appealing to schools not to penalize students if their attendance falls short of the mandatory limit,” said Aurobindo Ghosh, secretary of the Parents Association of North Kolkata.

Arijit Sarkar, a Syambazar AV School student, was late by 40 minutes after taking a detour of one hour from Chiria Mor. “I am now dreading to go to school by bus,” he said.

On Monday, a school bus was found stuck on R G Kar Road for over 40 minutes. “We are worried that they will be late. Parents will rebuke us if their wards are marked absent,” said Anukul Das, a schoolbus cleaner ferrying students to East Kolkata school.

Panaji/Saligao: Goa’s revenue department has reclassified 56 villages as urban areas under section 2(38) of Goa Land Revenue Code 1968 (LRC), the government said in a notification.

However, the department said the notification would not affect building or infrastructure guidelines and was only meant for assessment of land revenue.

“Under the LRC, notification of any village as urban area only affects the process of assessment of land revenue and this classification does not change any building or infrastructure guidelines as far as the revenue department is concerned,” said the government in a note.

The department said that the 56 villages are already classified as census towns as per Census 2011. “The notification simply adopted revenue villages, which are the census towns, as urban areas without any additional criteria,” the government said.

As per Census guidelines, a census town is defined as an area having a population of more than 5,000, with at least 70% males engaged in non-agriculture activities.

The Congress block, Aldona, has meanwhile demanded immediate scrapping of the notification. Congress block’s Aldona president Amarnath Panjikar said the move would destroy Goa’s identity.

SECUNDERABAD: For the first time, residents in Secunderabad Cantonment will earn a penalty for wasting potable water. The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) is acting a tough against consumers who waste water.

It has been imposing penalty under Section 197 of Cantonments Act, 2006. If the consumer fails to pay the penalty, and the water connection will be disconnected.

SCB water wing officials noticed that most consumers waste water — which supplying by Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) — to bathe pet animals, wash vehicles and gardening. Besides wastage of water, the SCB is also losing revenue.

“We have inspected certain areas during the water supply timings and observed water wastage and served notices to nearly 10 consumers while imposing penalty,” SCB assistant engineer, water works, N Surya Shashank told TOI.

The notices with penalty are being served on the spot, and consumers are given two days to pay the fine. According to the Act, violators can be fined up to Rs 2,500 apart from cost of wasted water.

The official said consumers who were served notices have already paid the penalties to avoid disconnection.

Madurai: Madras high court has directed the state government to take a decision with regard to installation of statue of late DMK leader M Karunanidhi in Madurai within eight weeks.

G Thalapathi, DMK district secretary, in his petition stated that Karunanidhi had served as a chief minister for five terms between 1969 and 2001 and he has the credit of holding the longest tenure of chief minister of Tamil Nadu for 6,863 days.

Since Karunanidhi died at the age of 94 on August 7, 2018, his party functionaries decided to erect a statue for him at Madurai. He said that he had sent a representation to the authorities concerned seeking permission to erect a statue in Madurai on September 3, 2018 and has also sent a reminder letter dated December 6, however, no steps were taken by the officials in this regard.

He noted that while his representation to erect a statue for the late DMK leader is pending for nearly 15 months, the authorities concerned have permitted to erect a statue of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa at K K Nagar in the city.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking permission to erect Karunanidhi’s statue in Madurai by considering his representation. When the petition was heard on Monday, justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana impleaded the revenue department secretary in the petition and directed the state government to take a decision in this regard within eight weeks.

397,['4/02/2020'],"2 months on, leopard cub found abandoned is healthy at 3.2kg","This story is from February 4, 2020

Mumbai: Two months after a weak leopard cub was found abandoned in Thane, it has not only survived the odds but even blossomed into a healthy and “playful kid”.

TOI got an update of the spotted male wild cat days after another abandoned leopard cub, a female, was also found in the sugarcane fields at a village in Nashik.

When morning walkers at Yeoor forest in Thane had first spotted the male cub in December, yowling furiously for its mother, the chances of its survival were slim. At the time, the cub weighed barely 380gm, said Dr Shailesh Pethe, wildlife veterinarian at Sanjay Gandhi National Park where both the abandoned cubs are now being tended to. “He’s put on; he now weighs 3.25kg,” he said.

The cub was christened Bittu by Thane corporator Purvesh Sarnaik, and his father Pratap Sarnaik, a legislator, adopted him in December. Initially, Bittu was being fed imported formula milk but is now on a staple diet of raw chicken. “He is fed about 500-600gm of chicken a day, split over four or five intermittent meals besides vitamin supplements,” said Dr Pethe who was helped by superintendent Vijay Barabde, the rescue team and Dr Manish Pingle.

Bittu’s abode is a guest house at the national park. He has a room all to himself where he romps about on all fours under the vigilant eye of his caretakers. Also, he’s taken for walks in the fenced frontyard—an hour in the morning, another in the evening, “This is done to keep his joints in good movement,” said Pethe.

Bittu is now a playful kid, say forest officials. He loves to play with a clutch of toys —a ball, a rattle and chewies —brought specially for him. “These toys are meant for kids and are often found at pet shops,” said Dr Pethe.

When fatigue bogs him down, Bittu curls up into his shawl-lined bed.

Anwar Ahmed, chief conservator of forests of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, said that the cub is hale and hearty. “He couldn’t have been better,” said Ahmed, giving credit to park veterinarian Dr Pethe and the entire team that has been baby-sitting Bittu.

Dubbing the cub’s survival as a “good thing,” Ahmed said, “Generally, cubs abandoned by the mother are prone to infections. While no one can take care of him like the mother would, for this cub we ensured that all possible sources of infection were kept at bay.”

The human touch has left an imprint on the wild cat, said Dr Pethe. “He knows our touch, he recognizes our voices... There’s no way he can now be released into the wild. Soon, he should be sent to a rescue centre at the national park itself.”

For now, though, he is having a rollicking time with his human companions.

“He digs his milk teeth into us... All of us in the team have got love bites from Bittu,” said Dr Pethe. “Since the other abandoned cub arrived last week, Bittu seems to be a bit wary of her.” Perhaps sibling rivalry applies to wildlife too.

Ahmedabad: The 11-megawatt waste-to-energy plant being built by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) at Pirana will be operational by the end of this year and will turn 1,000 tonnes of waste to energy every day.

AMC commissioner Vijay Nehra tweeted that AMC has begun removing the Pirana dump site in the city. He said the plant will use 1,000 tonnes per day and will produce 11MW of electricity. Nehra called on citizens to ensure no more such dumps are created.

The AMC has entered power purchase agreements with two companies that will convert domestic garbage into energy. The AMC stated that Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) has approved a rate of Rs 7.03 per unit for one company and Rs 7.07 per unit for the other. At least three companies had sent petitions to GERC for approval of the Rs 7 per unit tariff.

The AMC had also set up the first sewage sludge hygienization plant in the country, which became operational last year. The plant, set up at Pirana, can convert 100 tonnes of dry sludge into fertilizer every day.

400,['4/02/2020'],HC seeks reply over imposition of Section 144,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday almost echoed the concerns raised by the petitioners, at the continued imposition of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in the city, and observed that was is like sending a message to people that it is not safe to live here.

Last month, five petitioners, including a member of faculty from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA), challenged this continual imposition of the section, which restricts the gathering of more than four persons in public, claiming that it had made Ahmedabad “an indefinite war camp which is under permanent danger”.

Taking cognizance of the details supplied by the petitioners, Justice S H Vora said that there was not a single day since 2016 that the police commissioner’s notification invoking Section 144 was not in force in the city. The court commented that it appeared unreasonable so far as the use of Section 144 was concerned, sources said.

The high court also highlighted other contentions raised by the petitioners and put before the state government a question that to maintain law and order, it is understood that the provision is invoked in specific areas for certain periods, but it cannot be imposed permanently across the city since 2016.

The high court ordered the state government to reply to its queries by Wednesday and posted a further hearing on the issue for February 13.

The petitioners complained that the continued imposition of Section 144 of CrPC takes away the people’s right to get together to express themselves. The HC was moved last month after police detained students from outside the IIM-A campus on December 16, when they were protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The HC had earlier suggested that the authorities publish in newspapers the reasons along with the notification imposing Section 144 of the CrPC and Section 37 of the Bombay Police Act, restricting the gathering of more than four persons in public.

The petitioners contended that the repeated imposition of these provisions is against Article 19(1) of the Constitution.

Pradeepsinh Jadeja

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday stayed the metropolitan court from proceeding further on a complaint against the junior state home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja alleging him of poll code violation in 2007.

The election officer then had filed a private complaint against Jadeja, who was a BJP candidate in Asarwa in the 2007 assembly elections, for a pamphlet circulated with a photograph of then chief minister with slogan ‘Aapnu Gujarat, Aagvu Gujarat’. The pamphlet also contained a prayer – Vishwambhari Stuti - with a picture of goddess Ambe. It did not contain name of the printer, which is a must under Section 127 (A) of the Representation of People Act.

As Jadeja moved the HC for quashing of the complaint, Justice S H Vora observed that the election officer, Prakash Makwana, has not filed any reply till date. The HC observed that the statement of two witnesses, on whom the metropolitan court relied to order a trial against Jadeja, do not disclose name of printer or publisher of the pamphlet or information about printer of such pamphlet.

The HC further said that Jadeja was nominated as a candidate later. “On perusal of the contents of the pamphlet itself, on the face of it, it does not fall within four corners of provisions of Section 127(A) of the Representation of the People Act or any ingredients of said section surfacing from the statement of two witnesses. Therefore, present application deserves consideration,” the court observed while admitting Jadeja’s quashing petition and ordering a stay on trial court’s process.

Madurai: More than 400 auto rickshaw drivers gathered at Madurai district collector office on Monday demanding Rs 25 lakh compensation and a government job for the family member of an auto rickshaw driver, who died by suicide after touching a high tension wire recently.

The auto rickshaw driver, identified as Arichandran, 45, from Solai Alagupuram, took the extreme step after a police team took action against him for carrying more number of passengers than the permitted number of three people, said the drivers. The drivers from various associations started gathering at the collectorate since morning on Monday. A large number of police personnel and officers were deployed to prevent them from entering the collector office premises. They sat in front of the office and raised slogans against police personnel for harassing them.

The police carried out a drive against diesel auto rickshaw, which is being used as share auto rickshaw, on January 28 as a large scale violation was noticed. More than 20 auto rickshaws were impounded, while fine amount was collected from more than 200 auto rickshaw drivers.

In her complaint with the Avaniyapuram police station, Arichandran’s wife Chandrajothi, 43, stated that her husband, who came home dejected under the influence of alcohol picked up a quarrel with her. He was also under distress due to the pressure of repaying a loan amount. He left the house at around 7 pm and went to the backside of a school at Villapuram, where he climbed on to an electric pole and touched a live wire. With 90% injuries, he was admitted to a government Rajaji hospital, where he died on Sunday, without responding to the treatment.

Auto rickshaw drivers claimed that harassment by the police personnel has taken the life of Arichandran. R P Chandra Bose, coordinator auto rickshaw drivers associations, in a petition to the district collector T G Vinay, stated that a compensation of Rs 25 lakh should be given to the kin of Arichandran. He also demanded a government job for his wife. He also demanded that the city police should come forward to streamline share auto rickshaws by allowing them to carry six passengers, since they cannot earn their livelihood carrying three people just like a regular auto rickshaw.

Certain areas in Cantonment are getting alternate day water supply while some areas get supply three and four days a week.“Though we are managing water supply with present quantity, but with summer in view, we have asked the water board to increase at least nine LGPD to avoid inconvenience to the consumers,” a source in the SCB water wing told TOI.Apart from the regular potable water, the Cantonment Board is also supplying water through nine tankers and will increase them by five tankers based on demand, the source said.Regarding booking of tankers, we are sending tankers within 24 hours from the date of booking. In fact, tanker demand may double when summer reaches peak. We will take all measures to ensure to proper number of tankers are sent to needy consumers, said sources.A senior water wing official said, “There are 850 power bores, and all wells have been recharged with ground water in Cantonment area following bountiful rains. We are anticipating that water crisis may be overcome this summer.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73921403,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146117,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-readies-plan-to-tackle-water-crisis-during-summer/articleshow/73916023.cms

SALEM: The Salem flower market merchants have dumped marigold flowers in bins after its prices dropped significantly due to more than abundant yield. One kilogram of marigold usually costs Rs 150 and Rs 200 depending on the variety. “Now, it is being sold for mere Rs 20,” S Nagaraj, one of the flower cultivators told TOI.

Marigold, one of the important flowers for pujas, is largely cultivated in Ayothiyapattinam , Valasaiyur, Vazhapadi , Attur, Edappadi , Mettur, Omalur, Tharamangalam areas in Salem district.

Marigolds are brought to VOC market, the main flower market in the city. The merchants dispatch them to other retail shops across the district from here.

The marigold cultivators suddenly faced huge loss due to abundance in production.

“Many of the flower farmers across the district switched to marigold business after it had fetched good demand since Pongal,” Nagaraj said, adding that, due to huge demand for marigold flowers to make garlands, the rates skyrocketed once ‘Thai’ month started from Pongal festival.

Marigold is the most favored flower for garland makers as they start buying them in the huge quantities for marriages and other events.The prices have dropped significantly. “Big sized marigolds are being sold for Rs 20 while small sized ones are for Rs 10,” C Kathiresan, a merchant from VOC market said.

The farmers, who did not get proper price for their produce, disposed them in the bins of nearby areas.

New Delhi: The Centre on Tuesday told Delhi high court that the probe into the incident of violence at Jamia Millia Islamia during the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act is at a crucial stage .

Seeking more time before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the investigation was still underway.

Taking note of the submission, the bench granted the Centre time till April 29 to file a reply even as senior advocates appearing for a section of students of Jamia sought immediate interim orders, underlining that 93 students and teachers filed complaints about the alleged attacks on them by police but no FIR has been filed against the cops till date.

Lawyers for the petitioners alleged that the government has not complied with the court order to file a response within four weeks of the last date of hearing on December 19 and should be asked to file on affidavit reasons for delay.

The bench, however, declined to pass any interim order and granted time till April 29 to the government to file a reply.

It had on December 19 asked the Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police to respond to several PILs seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia protests against the CAA.

The court is hearing six petitions, moved by lawyers, students of JMI, residents of Okhla — where the university is located — and a Imam of a local mosque where among other prayers they have also sought medical treatment and compensation for the students.

Besides, the petitions demand registration of FIRs against the erring police officers.

The petitions had said the force used by police was “disproportionate”, even if it was required, and “brutal” and expressed concern over the “unregulated and unwarranted arrest and detention of students”.

Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar

AHMEDABAD: Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar missed her train on Monday evening due to prolonged court proceedings after she specifically requested the court to allow her to go early.

Patkar had to catch a train to Delhi at 5.40pm, but she could come out of the metropolitan court campus only at 7pm. The procedure was so prolonged that her advocate complained to the court that the activist was being harassed as if she is an accused in the case. Patkar’s cross-examination is under way since April 2012 in connection with her complaint about an assault on her at Gandhi Ashram at a peace meeting during the 2002 riots.

Her advocate Govind Parmar tendered an application to the court on Monday that the court may complete hearing early so that the activist could catch her train. When advocate Parmar tendered an application, a defence lawyer, Ajay Choksi, wrote an objection to Patkar’s request . The objection ran into 20 pages and the lawyer took a couple of hours to pen down his objections to Patkar’s request for early hearing . The procedure ended at 6.15pm and Patkar left the court campus at 7pm, said her lawyer.

Other officials who spent a lot time on official trips abroad are chief secretary Dharmesh Sharma, who was abroad for 35 days, and housing secretary Sanjay Gihar, who spent 17 days at three destinations in US.

Sharma’s trips — two to Portugal, one to the US and one to London — cost the state Rs 16 lakh. The cost of Gihar’s trip has not been stated in the assembly reply as “the matter was under submission”. The exact official reason for these two trips has not been stated in the reply either. Similarly, former WRD minister Vinod Paliencar went on a 12-day visit to three destinations in USA.

The cabinet circular stated that “Sewage of 9,758.53 MLD is generated from 391 urban local bodies in the state. Sewage treatment capacity of these urban local bodies is 7,747.24 MLD which comes to 79%. It is a satisfactory situation. Still, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued instructions to ensure treatment of entire sewage. Therefore, approval has been given to STPs with capacity of 2,011.20 MLD at the cost of Rs2,820 crore.”

Funds will be provided from Swachh Bharat Mission and AMRUT phase-II.

The state’s urban development department will soon issue a notification in which funds to be allocated will have city-wise details.

HYDERABAD: The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) will be initiating a massive plastic waste management project in the two Telugu states. The project is part of an all-India initiative, covering 50 cities.

UNDP team has been constituted in Hyderabad to look into the project, which is being taken up in partnership with Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages (HCCB), for both the states. This team will coordinate with key officials to ensure project implementation.

“The goal is to break the ‘house to landfill’ model of plastic waste and focus on reduce, reuse and recycle,” said Prabhjot Sodhi, head – Circular Economy, UNDP. In the city, Rs Rs 5 crore will be spent only on plastic waste management, and in the state the figure will be Rs 10 crore.

Among the first steps to be taken is the establishment and scaling up of UNDP & HCCB-run swachhta kendras in the city. Set up at waste transfer stations, these will help in segregation and reduction of waste that otherwise heads to landfills.

In the first phase, one swachhta kendra was established in August last year under GHMC limits in Kaithalapur transfer station (Kukatpally). Two other swachhta kendras are going to be set up and operated in Lower Tank bund and Nagole in the next six months.

UNDP has several plans to fight plastic littering. It will be launching a ‘plastic to bag’ exchange campaign. This campaign will entail the setting up of ‘eco exchange stalls’ in and around active locations in the city where the public and shopkeepers will be encouraged to bring waste plastic and exchange them for cloth bags that are environmentally friendly. Plastic collected at stalls will be recycled.

Madurai: With hardly two months left for the financial year to end, the cash-strapped Madurai Corporation has been able to collect only around 45% of tax dues from the residents. The civic body has now urged them to come forward pay the dues well ahead of the deadline.

Stating that lack of response from the denizens was the reason for the tepid collection of taxes, officials said that tax is the lifeline for the corporation to provide various basic amenities and to pay its employees.

Corporation collects various taxes like property tax, vacant land tax, water tax, garbage tax, underground drainage tax and professional tax. In addition, corporation also gets non-tax income though rentals from shops. Property tax fetches major share of revenue.

Sources said that revenue through various taxes and non-tax income such as rental through shops is around Rs 207 crore for 2019-20. However, only Rs 94 crore has been collected so far, which is just around 45%. Out of Rs 207 crore, property tax accounts for around Rs 110 crore. However, only Rs 97 crore is collectable amount with the remaining Rs 13 crore under various litigations.

An official said that people need to pay only the old tax as the revised tax rolled out by the corporation has been reversed after the intervention of the state government. The corporation’s revenue though property tax would have doubled if the rollback did not take place. It would have fetched at least around Rs 100 crore more, which would have been a boon to fund-starved corporation, he said.

About Rs 40 crore paid towards the revised property tax is with the corporation and it would be adjusted in the respective people’s account. Corporation commissioner S Visakan said that employees have been asked to speed up the tax collection process. The amount of tax collected so far has not been encouraging. People should come forward to pay taxes without waiting for deadline to ensure all basic amenities are provided smoothly, he said.

Visakan also said that tax collection centres will function on all weekends and on government holidays in February and March to facilitate smooth collection of taxes.

New Delhi: Waving placards and shouting slogans of “goli maaro...” , some 60 supporters of the Citizenship Amendment Act on Tuesday marched towards Jamia where the anti-CAA protesters were agitating, sparking fears of another standoff. However, police acted swiftly and stopped them much before they arrived at the university’s stadium. A similar protest also took place at Shaheen Bagh around noon. Amid frequent interruptions, the anti-CAA protesters took a pledge to exercise their franchise during the Delhi assembly elections on February 8.

Around 3.45 pm, the CAA supporters waved the national flag and marched towards the varsity. Most of them claimed to be the residents of the area. As they were about to reach the university stadium, Delhi Police barricaded the area. While the CAA supporters shouted “goli maaro…”, students gathered on the other side raised the slogan of “Halla Bol”.

“We also have the right to protest. They have blocked the roads for so many days, and now we have to show our strength,” said Ravi Kumar, a CAA supporter.

However, a student said that police should have stopped them at Sukhdev Vihar metro station itself.

Meanwhile, the varsity administration has put up a “wall of democracy,” where students and others can pledge to vote.

At Shaheen Bagh also, protesters on Tuesday took a pledge to use their voting rights on February 8. “Are we going to vote?” asked one of the speakers from the stage, and all the women protesters shouted in unison—“Haan jayenge”.

Saima, a resident of Shaheen Bagh, said, “Voting is our right and those who have stood by us will get our support.”

Ninety-year-old Asma Khatoon seconded her. “I will also go and cast my vote. It is my right,” said one of the oldest protesters at Shaheen Bagh.

Over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent comments, Khatoon said: “He says that we want to break the country. But he is the one who is dividing it.”

Ahmedabad: The high-profile river rejuvenation committee (RCC) had been formed after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had pressed the panic button and warned Gujarat about the deteriorating condition of its rivers. The committee will meet on Tuesday and discuss the condition of the Sabarmati downstream of Narol bridge and the actions taken in the case of 20 other rivers.

The December 2019 RCC meeting did not yield an encouraging outcome for the Sabarmati. Many industry associations in Ahmedabad that were asked to urgently upgrade their central effluent treatment plants (CETPs) for treating chemical waste had missed their targets. Many had sought extensions for more than a year. However, the parameters for the Sabarmati within the city limits have been encouraging.

“We have been measuring the chemical and biological oxygen demand, faecal coliforms, and other parameters within the municipal limits and they are within acceptable limits,” said a senior AMC official. “We have managed to divert all illegal sewerage diversions off the river.” The official, however, added that downstream of Narol bridge, industrial waste let into the river was choking the Sabarmati.

CETPs such as the Green Environment Co-operative had sought an extension of a year as civil works had not been completed on time. CETPs such as Odhav Green Enviro projects have been reprimanded for not even attending the December RCC meeting and for not providing updates on upgrades. “Strict action will be taken against CETPs that fail to respond or provide updates on their facilities,” a senior GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board) official and committee member said. Issues such as the status of spray dryer and aeration systems in various CETPs were discussed in the meeting. GPCB member-secretary T M Tambhani and environmental engineer G H Trivedi said in the meeting that performance bank guarantee of Rs 15 crore from various stakeholders had been deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board.

SECUNDERABAD: Commuters in Hyderabad railway division have long been complaining about poor rail connectivity in the eastern parts of the twin cities, as many have to travel to Secunderabad or Nampally to take trains.

“It is high time that Malkajgiri and Bolarum are turned into terminal stations as there are a huge number of people travelling from these areas daily to Kacheguda, Secunderabad, and Nampally to catch trains,” Vishwanath G, a resident of Sanjeev Nagar told TOI.

Passenger associations are asking authorities to develop the stations into a terminus saying that South Central Railway ( SCR )’s rail connectivity is focused in the city’s west zone.

They say connectivity to towns under division such as Nizamabad and Bodhan can also be improved.

“Until the MMTS phase two is functional, where we will have connectivity to Medchal, Bolarum, Manoharabad, and even Hi-Tech City, we need more express halts as there are no proper connecting trains to Secunderabad and Kacheguda,” said a member of Malkajgiri Suburban Train and Bus Travellers Association.

“Rail connectivity is cluttered at Secunderabad, Nampally, Hyderabad and Kacheguda stations from where many east and southbound trains move. Some important trains like Rayalaseema Express and Devagiri Express should have halts here,” he said.

Elaborating on this, SCR officials said that close to 20 express trains pass through the station, and only 10 halt here. “A number of trains travelling to Maharashtra and other parts of Telangana and AP halt here. Over the time, we have observed a rise in demand and need for more trains such as Rayalaseema Express, Sampark Kranti, and Devagiri to be halted at Malkajgiri,” said an SCR official. Passenger amenities at Malkajgiri railway station have been improved with new platforms, reservation counter, and signage, said SCR officials.

PANAJI: Passenger jets taking off or landing at the Goa International Airport face a good probability of running into birds and other animals at Dabolim. According to data shared by the Indian Navy with the state government, 224 incidents have been reported at the naval-controlled airbase since April 2014.

Aircraft have hit kites, pigeons, lapwings, crows, peacocks, owls and even dogs.

While 99% of the incidents involved commercial airliners Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd’s light combat aircraft (LCA) Tejas also suffered a scare. The data, however, fails to mention the incident that occurred on November 16, 2019, where a MiG 29 KUB fighter jet crashed after reportedly encountering a flock of birds.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), close to 90% of the bird collisions occur during take-off or landing. At the Goa airport , most incidents occurred during take-off, but rarely resulted in significant damage to the aircraft, data shared by chief minister Pramod Sawant shows. The data also revealed that out of the 224 instances when the aircraft hit an animal or bird, only seven resulted in damage to the aircraft engines.

Commenting that the Indian Navy and Airports Authority of India are responsible for tackling the risk, Sawant said, “Indian Navy has informed that the measures have been put in place for mitigation of bird or animal hazard.”

Among the factors that put the Goa airport at risk is its proximity to residential areas where dumping of garbage in the open is rampant. Sawant also acknowledged the threat posed by construction activities around the airport. The Indian Navy has identified five buildings which have been constructed without obtaining their permission, he said.

“Rules and notifications of the government of India are uniformly applicable to all airports in the country,” Sawant said in his reply to the state legislative assembly.

Notwithstanding several failures on earlier occasions, Patel plans to take a cue from Aam Aadmi Party, that rode on the back of the Anna Hazare movement to become a force reckon with — at least in Delhi and Punjab. He has decided to make one more attempt with centenarian freedom fighter HS Doreswamy at the forefront.

""An alternative political platform is the need of the hour as BJP and Congress have failed to fulfil aspirations of people, especially the younger generation. What we need is a political party that propagates caste-less and cash-less politics,"" said Doreswamy, who plans to launch an indefinite sit-in (Satygaraha) against the Union government’s ill-conceived economic policies on February 6 in Bengaluru.

Patel, son of former CM JH Patel, said like-minded leaders across parties will leverage Doreswamy’s movement in order to forge a partnership before planning further course of action. ""Anna Hazare’s movement was historic as it spawned a new wave of politics in India. Likewise, Doreswamy’s Satyagraha can take politics in Karnataka in a new direction. We can push for a new kind of polarisation in the state,"" said Patel.

The initiative coincides with disgruntlement in BJP ahead of the cabinet expansion exercise and chaos in the state Congress over appointing a president of the state unit. Incumbent Dinesh Gundurao had resigned in December, but there is a squabble over a suitable replacement.

Patel is hoping against hope senior BJP MLAs, especially wealthy ones like Murgesh Nirani and Umesh V Katti, will join him in building a formidable alternate political force.

""There are some functionaries, including those from the old Janata Parivar, who are unhappy with their parties. If they all to come together on a common platform, it will be possible to revive the Janata Parivar,"" said former minister and senior JD(S) MLC Basavaraj Horatti.

While several preliminary meetings were held at Patel’s residence, the team is planning to meet again on February 16 and 23 to discuss the way forward.

However, many leaders say it is another futile attempt as there is little or no scope for an alternative party in Karnataka, especially with the BJP becoming a force to reckon with.

However, the JD(S) is leaving no stone unturned in its bid to revive the party, which has been dubbed a sinking ship following a string of electoral setbacks. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy is said to have quietly embarked on a mission to rebuild his party before the next assembly polls in 2023.

“The idea of reviving Janata Parivar will not transpire in the present political situation,” Kumaraswamy said. “It is better these leaders join hands to strengthen the JD(S), which already has a strong base,” he said.

Reacting to this, senior Congress functionary BL Shankar, originally from the Janata Parivar, said the revival of JD(S) is possible only when the party is freed from the clutches of the HD Deve Gowda family. “What Kumaraswamy should first do is to ensure JD(S) is free of its family orientation. Then he must ensure a pan-caste and pan-region party by involving different leaders,” said Shankar.

420,['4/02/2020'],Niti proposal will not be implemented: Shailaja,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Health minister K K Shailaja said the Niti Aayog proposal to privatize district hospitals will not be implemented in the state. Many of the Central policies are against the interests of the state and the government will be forced to protest against such policies, she added.

“The government is not ready to privatize the district hospitals in the state. The Centre has not informed that it is a compulsory directive from the Niti Aayog. Anyway, we are not ready for it,” said the minister.

Shailaja said many of the central policies are not supportive of the state and hence, the state is not getting funds for the many of the new schemes announced by the Centre. “Most of the new schemes are tailor made for the north Indian states. A state like Kerala which has made rapid strides in the health sector are not getting enough funds from the Centre due to this,” she added.

“At present, the health department is sourcing funds from KIIFB for the development of hospitals. The state is not getting enough support from the Centre for the development of health centres,” she said.

The minister said the state government does not support the view that all the district hospitals should be upgraded into the medical college hospitals as mooted in the Union Budget.

“We are of the view of more specialty treatment should be made available in the district hospitals for which there was no need for converting it into medical college hospitals,” said the health minister.

422,['4/02/2020'],Opposition claims 21.9sq km of private forests reclassified,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Porvorim: Opposition members demanded constitution of a house committee alleging that 21.9sq km of private forests have been reclassified. Raising the issue during question hour on the opening day of five-day budget session of Goa legislative assembly on Monday, former forest minister Vijai Sardesai termed it the “biggest scam” of modern Goa.

Sardesai alleged that a committee appointed by the forest department had reduced the area of the private forest already identified from 25.92 sq km to 4.91 sq km.

He was supported by opposition leader Digambar Kamat who said that while the written reply to his starred question on the subject stated that no private forest areas, identified by any committees, was reclassified, the reality was different.

Kamat said that the forest department had informed the chief town planner in August 2019 that the area in question (private forest) can’t be considered under 16B of the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act. The provision allows de-classification of orchard land. Suddenly, in September 2019, the forest department wrote to the CTP that the area is not a private forest, Kamat said. “There was no question of even granting provisional no-objection certificate since the report on private forests by V T Thomas and Francisco Araujo committee was finalised in October 2018,” he said, pressing for a house committee under the chairmanship of chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is also the forest minister.

Earlier, Sardesai questioned the purpose of appointing a review committee headed by joint secretary revenue to rework findings of the earlier review committee, which submitted its report in 2019. The report, he said, was submitted during his tenure as forest minister and it was rejected. Even the advocate general of Goa had given it adverse comments, he said.

Till date, he said the government has appointed seven committees to identify private forests. Some have given their reports, some are in the finalisation stage. “The government ought to tell people, which report it is following,” Sardesai said.

CM Pramod Sawant said there was no need for a house committee as the matter is pending before the National Green Tribunal. To this, the opposition members said the House is supreme

423,['4/02/2020'],Rogue biker in bid to flee leaves cop injured,"This story is from February 4, 2020

The bike that Akash Ghosh was riding

KOLKATA: A Jadavpur traffic guard sergeant, Raja Roy, suffered a fracture when a biker hit him while trying to flee during a routine check on Sunday. The incident was reported around 8.20pm from a cut on the median on Prince Gholam Mohammad Shah Road at the Lords crossing near South City. Roy had earlier been attacked twice while on duty.

Roy said he saw a young man on a sports bike coming down the north-bound flank (towards Prince Anwar Shah Road ). He was not wearing a helmet and not following lane rules. I was standing at the cut, which he tried to take to return to Golf Green. When I asked him to stop, he accelerated and hit me, and I fell on the road. The biker tried to speed away, but skidded and fell as well and locals caught him,” Roy said.

The Jadavpur police was informed and Roy was taken to MR Bangur Hospital where a fracture was detected in his left leg. He was later shifted to KPC Hospital where doctors advised him rest for several weeks.

An FIR was lodged by Roy in this regard. Cops said the errant bike rider, Akash Ghosh, did not have a driving licence. The bike he was riding was registered in the name of another person.

The lower constabulary that TOI contacted said mere arrests in individual cases of cop assault were not enough. An all-round tough police stand will automatically increase ‘respect’ for the uniform. As the cops are being targeted on roads, Kolkata police is increasingly becoming jittery.

While the initial cases, which were registered in 2013 were brushed off as “occupational hazards”, the rise in such incidents have forced Lalbazar to try and find ways to prevent them. The worst hit are the traffic cops.

424,['4/02/2020'],Best-case scenario: Phoolbagan Metro services by April,"This story is from February 4, 2020

The Phoolbagan station, which is almost ready for operations

KOLKATA: Now that East-West Metro’s operations on the elevated Salt Lake section are about to start, Metro Railway will be inviting the Commissioner of Railway Safety ( CRS ) to inspect the underground stretch till Phoolbagan later this month. Officials hope to extend services till Phoolbagan station by April. The 5km Sector V-Salt Lake corridor will be opened to the public on February 13. But not many people are expected to use the section and Metro Railway is likely to incur losses.

The CRS, under the ministry of civil aviation, gives the safety clearance to new Metro routes in the country. “We shall try and apply for the CRS’s inspection of the 1km stretch between Salt Lake Stadium and Phoolbagan this month. Hopefully, the Phoolbagan extension can be opened in April,” a senior Metro official told TOI on Monday.

The 16.5km East-West Metro — that will eventually link Salt Lake’s Sector V with Howrah Station — is being built by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) and will be operated by Metro Railway, that operates the north-south Metro.

Officials said the truncated operations can be somewhat viable if services are extended to Phoolbagan where the underground station has been built. The tunnel goes up to Sealdah. The stretch (till Salt Lake Stadium) that is ready to begin operations is elevated. From here, a ramp at Subhas Sarovar leads the tracks down to Phoolbagan station.

But the CRS inspection must be preceded by a clearance for the signalling system from French agency Certifier. On June 1 last year, East-West Metro’s first underground trial run took place as the train chugged 17m below the surface into Phoolbagan station. At that time, the deadline for the extension was October, 2019.

Officials said not many — especially from Sector V — would be able to avail the services because the Sector V station at College More is far from the IT hub. Even if some IT professionals try to walk for 10 minutes or more through the CSTC depot or the road next to Wipro to reach Sector V station, chances are most will prefer riding buses or autos instead.

But once the Phoolbagan extension is operational, commuters will be able to travel from Sealdah to Phoolbagan in autos and take the Metro till Sector V or elsewhere in Salt Lake. There are two auto routes catering to commuters in this section.

Officials said a passengers’ survey can be undertaken only after the Salt Lake services start. “But we are sure that it will merely be a joyride. To make the section viable, the Phoolbagan extension is must,” an official said, adding that, “The East-West Metro will receive a major boost when services are extended till Sealdah.” But the Sealdah extension will be possible only when the 2.45km tunnelling between Esplanade and Sealdah is complete.

This last leg of the tunnelling was stalled after a tunnel boring machine hit an aquifer on August 31 that caused large-scale subsidence, in which several Bowbazar fell like a pack of cards.

425,['4/02/2020'],SC to hear Maratha quota cases from March 17,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Nagpur: While refusing any interim relief to city-based petitioners, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed its registry to list the Maratha quota cases for final hearing from March 17.

A division bench comprising justices Nageshwar Rao and Deepak Gupta also told the petitioners and respondents that no adjournment application would be entertained at any cost, once the hearing begins. Further directing both parties to complete their pleadings before March 17, the judges indicated that they want to finish off the cases as early as possible.

The orders came while hearing Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) by parents led by Devendra Jain and one by the aggrieved students. Both pleas were filed under the banner of ‘Save Merit Save Nation’. Along with these two, many other cases from Mumbai and other parts of the state were clubbed together. A battery of lawyers led by senior counsels — Arvind Datar and Gopal Shankarnayaran — along with Hrishikesh Chitaley and Ashwin Deshpande represented the petitioners. Noted senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi held the brief for the Maharashtra government.

The petitioners have challenged the Maharashtra government’s decision to implement 12% quota for the Socially Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) in medical and dental courses. The decision was later upheld by the Bombay High Court. It contended that injustice was being meted out to general category students by reducing their quota of seats with the introduction of the Maratha quota.

According to them, students are not only demanding quashing of new quotas that exceeded 50% limit set by the SC, but are also demanding 4% seats for the open category students after HC reduced the 16% SEBC quota to 12%. They accused the government of filling up PG medical seats with 16% SEBC quota instead of 12% despite HC orders which led to loss of 4% seats.

426,['4/02/2020'],"Worrying trend: Defence forces saw 1,110 suicides in 2010-19","File photo

NEW DELHI: Over 1,110 soldiers, airmen and sailors took the extreme step of ending their lives over the last decade, once again underlining the need for much better suicide prevention interventions in the over 14-lakh strong Indian armed forces.The defence ministry says several measures have been taken over the years to reduce stress among military personnel , ranging from counseling, yoga and grievance redressal mechanisms to improvements in food, clothing, married accommodation and a much more liberalized leave policy.But clearly, much more needs to be done. Latest figures show there were over 895 suicides in the over 12-lakh Army in the 2010-2019 timeframe, followed by 185 and 32 in the much-smaller IAF and Navy , respectively.Mental stress among military personnel, especially among active-duty ones, is of course a global problem. The US military forces, for instance, are currently grappling with a record high suicide rate, with as many as 541 cases in 2018. The suicide rate among active-duty troops was 24.8 per 100,000 personnel, up from 21.9in 2017.While it is true that the suicide rate in the Indian Army works out to just about half of India’s rate of 16.5 suicides per 100,000 people, it is nevertheless worrying in the highly-disciplined environs of the force because suicides can be largely prevented through effective intervention policies.Soldiers don’t have to deal with abject poverty, unemployment, farming distress or other factors that makes India’s suicide rate the highest in the entire south-east Asian region, as per the World Health Organization .But protracted deployment along the volatile border with Pakistan as well as counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the North-East does take a toll on the mental health and physical endurance of soldiers.Soldiers posted in forward or “field areas” also undergo tremendous stress for not being able to take care of the problems facing their families back home, which could range from property disputes and harassment by anti-social elements to financial and marital problems. “Earlier, the news from the home-front came periodically. Now, they get updates 24x7 through mobile phones, which have certainly added to the rise in stress levels,” said a senior officer.“Moreover, police and civil district administrations around the country are largely unresponsive to grievances of soldiers and their families. A battalion commander could earlier talk to the civilian district authorities to resolve personal problems of his soldiers but that is no longer the case,” he added.Soldiers also have to contend with lack of basic amenities, relatively poor salaries, denial of leave and other such problems. A study by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR) some years ago had also noted that the “perceived humiliation and harassment, over and above their occupational and familial causes'', at the hands of their superiors often served as the final “trigger'' for soldiers to commit suicide, as was then reported by TOI.The defence ministry says “domestic and personal problems, marital discord, stress, health issues and financial problems” have been identified as “the major causes” behind suicides in the armed forces in several studies conducted by DIPR since 2006.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73919365,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2325684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/worrying-trend-defence-forces-saw-1110-suicides-in-2010-19/articleshow/73919364.cms

PORVORIM: Deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar on Monday said that although Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, who is known as the Architect of the Indian Constitution , had thought of the concept of ‘Dalitstan’ for dalits, India has remained united.

While participating in the discussion on a motion moved to congratulate PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for passing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Ajgaonkar said, “For the dalits, Babasaheb Ambedkar had said there would be Dalitstan, but we are all together in India.”

He said Ambedkar had travelled widely and was learned, and could hence frame the Constitution of India as a country encompassing people of all faiths. He also said that is because of the Constitution that Hindus, Christians, Muslims, dalits and others live peacefully in India. “Nobody can remove anyone from this country,” Ajgaonkar said.

He further said that when Pakistan was created, all Muslims went there and it was declared an Islamic state, but Hindustan did not become a Muslim or Hindu nation. “Some people say India will become a Hindu nation, but when you say Hindu, it includes everyone — Hindus, Muslims, Christians, dalits and others,” he said.

MUMBAI: Praveen Pardeshi who took charge as Mumbai's municipal commissioner from the now chief secretary Ajoy Mehta in May last year, will table his first civic budget for 2020-21 on Tuesday.

As the corporation’s revenue income has not shown a significant rise, sources say no large increase is expected in the budget size.

Last year, Mehta had presented a budget of Rs 30.692.6 crore—significantly higher than Rs 27,258 crore in 2018-19.

While no new taxes or rise is likely, the budget could look at newer ways to generate revenue, either by promoting tourist spots or charging for advertising. The BMC’s property tax collection till January 31 for the year stood at Rs 2,878 crore—Rs 630 crore less than last year, indicating slow collection due to dipping incomes.

Mumbai: BEST expects a grant of at least Rs 50 crore towards capital expenditure to purchase 165 new buses this financial year while it wants a financial assistance of Rs 100 crore every month from the BMC for “viability gap funding” to compensate for losses incurred in its bus operations .

Sources said BEST also expects aid of Rs 78 crore for the Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS) in Mumbai and significant funding for installation of new LED street lamps across the island city. While it is yet to be seen what is in store for the cash-strapped undertaking in the civic budget , BEST committee members argued the transport body should not “completely depend” on the BMC.

Panel members told TOI that it was possible for BEST to commercially exploit its own land and bus depots and earn huge revenue to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees.

“We need not depend on the BMC budget to bail us out. Now that we have gained a good ridership of 34 lakh daily commuters with the huge cut in bus fare (Rs 5 for 5 km and Rs 6 for AC rides), we can earn more revenue through advertisments on TV panels in buses and at bus stops, hoardings at depots and BEST owned land. We can construct commercial premises at depots and give them on lease to private operators,” said panel member Bhushan Patil from Congress. He recalled that BEST had already received Rs 2,000 crore aid from the civic body in recent months to clear past loans and run bus operations. “It is high time you can reduce losses on your own,” said BEST panel opposition leader Ravi Raja. “If we do proper asset management and commercially exploit BEST land, we can earn up to Rs 3,000 crore in four years.” BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said there was no new plan to redevelop any of the 27 bus depots. — Somit Sen

Panaji: After the Supreme Court gave the go-ahead, the state government and GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL) have begun working on a revised timeline for the greenfield international airport being built at Mopa , said chief minister Pramod Sawant .

Sawant, in a written reply to the legislative assembly, said that the cost of phase I of the airport was likely to increase beyond Rs 1,900 crore estimated earlier, due to the delay.

“The physical progress achieved in construction of Mopa airport was 14.28%. As per the earlier schedule, the first phase of the project was to be completed and commissioned on or before September 3, 2020. The revised schedule of construction is being worked out in view of the order of the courts,” said Sawant.

As per clause 30.2.1 of the Concession Agreement signed between the state government and GGIAL, the concessionaire shall pay 36.99% of gross revenue to the government from the sixth year onwards. GGIAL, a subsidiary of GMR Airports Limited, has “not yet” claimed any damages for the delay.

“In view of the Supreme Court order, correspondence and consultation with the concessionaire is being initiated to finalise the revised time frame to complete the construction work of the Mopa airport,” said Sawant.

The chief minister also said that land for the approach road to the airport has not been acquired.

433,['4/02/2020'],Vocational courses help halve dropout rate to 7%,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Panaji: The introduction of National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) and the pre-vocational scheme has brought down the dropout rate at the secondary school level by more than half to almost 7.3% in 2017-18 as against over 16% during the previous years, according to a reply tabled during the ongoing state assembly session.

During the current academic year 2019-20 itself, over 7,200 students from Class IX to XII will be benefitting from the NSQF scheme, chief minister Pramod Sawant, who also holds the education portfolio, said.

NSQF allows students to opt for a seventh subject that involves skills training in 14 streams like tourism and hospitality among others. From the six regular subjects and the seventh NSQF one, students have to clear any six. The scheme helps students who prefer a vocation-based approach to studies clear their examinations by letting them study a vocational subject and it gives them vertical mobility.

Students who clear Class X under the scheme can continue training in the subject of their choice at the higher secondary level as well and study up to the degree level in the vocational stream.

Under NSQF at the school level, students have to attend lectures by industry professionals and complete at least four industrial visits in a year in their chosen specialisation. They are evaluated by industry experts in the practical portion of the course, which includes viva and creating a work portfolio.

From 2017 onwards, assessments are being done by industry persons through National Skill Development Corporation, based on an MoU signed between the national body and the state.

Similarly, the pre-vocational scheme was introduced around 2010 in aided institutions in rural areas. Under the scheme, students can drop any one subject from among mathematics, science or social science to opt for a vocational subject from Class VIII onwards.

Eight fishermen from Kanyakumari district who went deep sea fishing in the Arabian Sea rescued and released a more than 12ft long whale shark, protected under Schedule 1 of The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, that was accidentally caught in their net. While there are incidents of whale sharks getting killed when boats accidentally hit them in Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin districts, fishermen termed the rescue a rarity.

P Dickson, owner and captain of mechanised boat ‘Deivasnegam’ said that 13 fishermen set off for fishing from Thengapattanam fishing harbour on January 11. Around 5pm on January 25 they were fishing 100 nautical miles (185km) northwest of Goa and had spread the net for a five nautical mile (9km) stretch.

The rescue and release was video recorded on mobile and shared among friends and with fisheries officials after the fishermen reached home on Sunday. tnn

VK Sasikala was imposed a fine of Rs 10 crore after she was convicted by the Karnataka high court in a disprop... Read More

BENGALURU: Stepping into the last year of the four-year simple imprisonment awarded to her in a disproportionate assets case, former AIADMK secretary VK Sasikala is yet to pay a fine of Rs 10 crore. Failure to do so may result in her spending one more year in jail.

Sasikala, her foster son VN Sudhakaran and J Ilavarasi have been lodged in Central Jail (Parappana Agrahara) since February 15, 2017, after the Supreme Court set aside their acquittal by Karnataka high court.

In September 2014, the special trial court of judge John Michael Cunha had sentenced former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran under Section 109 IPC read with Section 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act — abetment of criminal misconduct of a public servant — to simple imprisonment for four years.

Jayalalithaa was fined Rs 100 crore, while Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi were fined Rs 10 crore each. In case they failed to pay the penalty, they would have to serve another year in jail, the trial court said.

All the convicts approached high court for bail, but the requests were turned down. Later, Jayalalithaa and others approached the Supreme Court, which granted them bail on October 17, 2014. All the four had walked out of prison after spending around 21 days in detention. The high court acquitted the quartet on May 11, 2015.

According to prison officials, most convicts who are slapped heavy fines pay only at the end of their jail term. In Sasikala’s case, the amount will have to be paid only through cheque or demand draft. “The source of income should be announced and a no-objection certificate should be obtained from the income-tax department,” said senior jail officials.

However, prison officials dismissed as baseless rumours of Sasikala’s early release due to good conduct. “We don’t know who is spreading these rumours. Premature release is for convicts who have completed at least 14 years of imprisonment and are guilty of heinous crimes like murder, rape and dacoity. If Sasikala and others pay fine, they will walk out on January 25, 2021. Else, they will be released on February 15, 2022,” he said.

HYDERABAD: Activists and residents from central Hyderabad and IT corridor asked the newly-appointed officers to be active on Twitter like the former officers of that zone. The residents said that the previous officers used to reply to their complaints on Twitter and depute staff to resolve their grievances.

“The newly-appointed officers should be active on Twitter to understand the ground reality. In GHMC app, there are chances that the complaint might be closed even without being attended,” said Harish Daga, an activist.

Residents said that social media platforms are the easiest way to approach the officials. “Twitter is the easiest way to approach officials and we can also post pictures with the complaint. During one instance, I had posted about water-logging on a road near Nectar Gardens in Madhapur and immediately staffers were pressed into action to resolve the problem,” said Neeru Golconda, a techie.

“We visited the zonal offices in Serilingampally and Khairatabad. The officials there asked us to reach out to them online and told us to make use of technology for reporting all civic related issues. They also informed us about the recent developments by the civic body’s IT wing,” said PM Sai Prasad, a BJYM leader and RTI activist.

438,['4/02/2020'],Spread of nCoV rumours hurting us more: Prof from Chinese varsity,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Madurai: Pained at the damage caused by spread of false rumours as China battles the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV), a 39-year-old assistant professor at a Chinese University from Madurai urged the public not to believe and spread such rumours.

C Neelakandan, a native of a village near Madurai, is an assistant professor at the department of Information Technology and Communication Engineering, Shaoguan University Guangdong Province. “It is painful to see people spread false rumours about nCoV. Some people are not aware of what is really going on and merge incidents to exaggerate the damage caused by spread of the virus,” he told TOI.

Neelakandan has been working in China for the past 10 years and was at his university during the initial outbreak of nCoV in China. “I first heard of news that a severe pneumonia virus is spreading in China. I had to go via Wuhan to catch my flight in Beijing but there was no panic then. I actually travelled with people from Wuhan in a train but everything was fine then. Only later, when I came to know of nCoV, it was scary and I was thankful,” he said. Neelakandan reached India on January 10 for his vacation.

“The screening at the airports in India, evacuations and lockdown in China began only after January 20. I actually wanted to go back to China by January 15 but I got to know that the reopening of the university got delayed,” he said and added that his university has been checking up on his health status.

“I’ve been checking with my friends at my work place and even some who are in Wuhan. They are all fine but are trying to stay at home and isolate themselves. I’m really glad to hear from friends that most of the students and professors from Tamil Nadu who were in China have been evacuated. During such trying times, everyone is doing their best,” said Neelakandan. He hoped that by the start of spring, things improve and urged Indians to keep their spirits up and welcome Chinese residents with open arms.

Recently, he attended an international Tamil conference at Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU). “It was heart-warming to see a few Chinese students come for an educational tour to India and spend time at MKU and meeting locals too. Winter vacations are special for students in China, but it is a sad time this year. I hope Chinese residents are not banned from the country,” he said.

Kozhikode: Social Democratic Party of India ( SDPI ) has asked chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to withdraw the baseless comments on the party and tender an apology for misleading the assembly.

Addressing a news conference here, SDPI state general secretary P Abdul Hameed said that the remarks against the party should be removed from the assembly records.

The CM made the comments referring to an incident in Angamaly. Not a single person arrested in the case is an SDPI worker, he said. Hameed said CPM is worried that lakhs of people are participating in the anti-CAA agitations led by the SDPI while the protests staged by the CPM have low turnout. “That is why the CPM is raising the allegation that the SDPI is creating trouble on the pretext of anti-CAA agitations,” he said. “The CM is helplessly watching the growing RSS influence in the police,” Hameed said. Even while the government says that there will not be any case for participating in the anti-CAA protests, police have registered cases, he said. TNN

PATNA: RJD will hold a meeting of its district presidents at Patna on February 8 following the return of leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav from Delhi. The meeting will, however, be chaired by RJD’s state president Jagdanand Singh .

Incidentally, it will be the first state-level meeting of RJD district presidents after its organizational elections held in November-December last year.

“The meeting has been called to chalk out strategy for assembly elections in Bihar slated to be held later this year. Feedback will be taken from the district presidents and they will also be issued instructions for expediting the poll preparedness in their respective districts,” RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said.

Sources said a proposal for holding such a meeting was made by party’s national vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh as well. Raghuvansh had also written a letter to the party president Lalu Prasad on January 9 with a copy to Jagdanand, expressing concern over lethargic approach in the party towards formation of committees at the grassroots level and preparation for the assembly election.

Incidentally, the two Rajput veterans of the RJD were at loggerheads over the past few weeks after appointment of Jagdanand as state president of the party. Raghuvansh even went on to calling few new regulations introduced by Jagdanand as dictatorial. Later, Lalu had to intervene in the matter, following which Raghuvansh called on Jagdanand at RJD state headquarters last Friday. Incidentally, both addressed media persons separately and Raghuvansh met Lalu at Rims, Ranchi on Saturday.

Tej Pratap to meet Lalu

Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav reached Ranchi on Monday evening. Sources said he is slated to meet Lalu on Tuesday at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), where the latter is undergoing treatment, while serving jail term in fodder scam cases. “I am going to take blessings from my father,” Tej told reporters at Patna. Earlier, Tej’s mother and former Bihar CM Rabri met Lalu at Rims on last Monday after more than two years.

Ponda: With water no longer overflowing from the Opa barrage, the public works department (PWD) has asked officials of the water resources department (WRD) overlooking the Ganjem bandhara to get the pumps at the Ganjem and Selaulim Dam ready within a fortnight to rejuvenate the Khandepar river.

Following the commissioning of the new 27 MLD water treatment plant at Opa, over 160 MLD water is drawn from the Khandepar river and the authorities are preparing for an eventuality where the level of river could see a dip by February 15.

A total of five water treatment plants at Opa enable supply of potable water to Ponda and Tiswadi talukas.

Once the level of the Opa basin drops, it receives water from the Selaulim dam, Ganjem water scheme, a total 18 bandharas over the Khandepar and Kalem rivers and the mining pits in Codli village on the banks of the Opa river.

The Opa barrage has a capacity to hold up to 5m of water, but level it maintained at a maximum 4.4m to avoid flooding in surrounding areas. Surplus water is allowed to overflow from the barrage gates.

However, as of Monday, water stopped overflowing with the water level in the barrage touching 4.3m.

Ganjem Bundhara has two pumps of 330HP each that fetch 30 MLD water, while at Selaulim dam there are two pumps of 650 HP each that together draw 48 MLD water.

While the WRD fetches 35 MLD water from the Mhadei at Bolcornem Bundhara and pours it in the Ganjem river which flows into the Opa, the Selaulim treatment plant pours 48 MLD water in the Kalem river that flows down to the Opa water treatment plant, WRD canal officer Ankush Gaonkar said.

In addition to this, 70 MLD water is being poured into the river from the mining pits of Vedanta and an abandoned pit near Someshwar Temple at Codli in Dharbandora and Zarapkar mines at Satone in Dabal, said Gaonkar, who looks after rejuvenating the river during summer.

Representative image

PATNA: The Kaimur police on Monday arrested a CRPF jawan for faking his kidnapping to get ransom from his father.

The constable, Rajdev Kumar Gupta, was recovered from a train between Patna and Bhabhua in Kaimur on Monday, six days after his alleged kidnapping by unknown criminals from Buxar-Thakura road under the Noan police station area of the district on January 27.

The victim’s wife, Nandini Kumari, had apprehended the involvement of Gupta’s stepbrother, who was detained by police. The suspect, however, denied his involvement in the kidnapping of Gupta, who was posted in Andhra Pradesh.

Nandini had told the investigating officers that her husband was kidnapped for ransom as her father-in-law had received Rs 30 lakh after selling some ancestral land in the village recently. The kidnappers had allegedly demanded Rs 18 lakh as ransom for his release.

Kaimur SP Dilnawaz Ahmad said, “Our investigation revealed that the CRPF jawan had been in constant touch with his wife ever since the kidnapping was reported to police. He, however, kept moving from one place to another and talked to his wife from different phone numbers.”

On Monday, when the location of Gupta’s cellphone was traced near Mohania in Kaimur, police rushed to the place and recovered him.

“During investigation, it came to light that a sum of Rs 6 lakh was transferred to Gupta’s bank account from his father’s to pay the ransom money to the alleged kidnappers. In fact, Gupta had taken a Rs10 lakh loan and had enacted the drama of his false kidnapping to return the money,” the SP said.

The role of Gupta also came under the scanner after the Andhra police disclosed that the CRPF jawan had been missing from duty since December 3 last year. The officials of the central force apprehended that he might have been kidnapped by the Left extremists operating in the region and subsequently a missing complaint was lodged.

Gupta, who is a native of Buxar district , was produced before a court at Bhabhua, which later remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days.

Villagers fear digging into the nullah will destroy the water source

PONDA: Following opposition from locals, the water resources department (WRD) on Monday said that they were ready to lay the pipeline from the river bed instead of laying it 2m deep below the nullah bed.

Fearing that digging along the existing natural water nullah to lay a pipeline would destroy the underground natural water resources, a group of over 50 people from Dhatwada-Usgao and surrounding areas in Ponda taluka stopped the laying of the pipeline on Saturday.

Locals demanded that the WRD either change the route of the pipeline or lay pipes over the nullah bed.

The WRD has been laying a 1,000mm pipeline for the augmentation of water from Ganjem water scheme on the Mhadei river to Khandepar river, for rejuvenating the Khandepar river during summer. The Opa water works complex, which comprises the five water treatment plants that collectively supply potable water to over 90% of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas, is fully dependent on water from the Khandepar river.

Water levels of the river dip every summer and the WRD is then forced to source water from elsewhere, including 35MLD water from the Ganjem water scheme.

Until last summer, the WRD used to pour the Ganjem water into the Dhaushirem nullah, from where it would flow into the Khandepar river. As the entire quantity of water does not reach the Khandepar river due to losses by evaporation, ground seepage and drawing by farmers mid-way, the WRD has been laying a pipeline that would pour the Ganjem water directly into the river.

A WRD official said that the contractor would fill the trench and restore the nullah basin after laying the pipeline, but the locals were not convinced.

While there is a high court order pending on demolition of existing Secretariat buildings, the government is getting ready with its plans.Sources in TSSPDCL said the government has asked the power discom to vacate its offices in the building, adjacent to the present Secretariat complex. As of now operations division, electrical inspector and other offices have been functioning from the building which is about 100 years old.A few years ago, the government had proposed to use the building for security personnel guarding the Secretariat. But TSSPDCL authorities said that they do not have space to shift their offices. Now, the government reportedly instructed the power discom to vacate the building because as per Vaastu compliance the land is required for new Secretariat. The office in Mint Compound is spread in about 2.5 acres of land.It was once called as Nizam’s Mint Compound and later, in 1980, ministry of finance set up government’s Mint and Security printing press in the building. Earlier, there was a plan to seek government of India’s land in the same compound, but keeping in mind the Bison Polo experience the idea was dropped as Union government may not part with the land. “Officially we have not received any communication on handing over the Mint Compound buildings to the state government,” a director of TSSPDCL said.

PANAJI: The demand for face masks in view of the coronavirus outbreak in China has increased, but they are mostly bought by tourists rather than locals. The specialised N- 95 masks are not available.Dr Utkarsh Betodkar , state epidemiologist, said people don’t need to use specialised masks. They can do with a three-layered mask if necessary. It costs relatively less and is a one-time use mask that should be replaced after six hours of use, he said.Kedar Jirage, proprietor and chief pharmacist at Jeevan Rekha medical stores in Panaji, said they sell about 30 to 35 masks a day. “They are bought by mostly travelers,” he said. He said his pharmacy had received an order for supply of 100-150 masks, but they could not fulfill it. The person who placed the order, he said, wanted to send them to China.Raj Vaidya, chief pharmacist at Panaji’s Hindu Pharmacy, said they too have sold more masks since the new disease surfaced.Betodkar, however, warned people not to buy masks unnecessarily, particularly the specialised kind, to avoid the shortage of masks.“Correct disposal of masks is very important,” he said, further adding that specialised masks are for use by doctors and health workers who are exposed to the infection.

Porvorim: Chief minister Pramod Sawant told the state legislative assembly on Monday that his government does not intend to appoint any agency to provide midday meals to schools and that women’s self-help groups (SHG) will continue to do the job.

“If at all any memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed, it will be cancelled,” Sawant said while replying to the question tabled by opposition leader Digambar Kamat during the ‘question hour’.

Raising a supplementary query, former town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai said that the state government had signed an MoU with Akshaya Patra Foundation, a not for profit organisation that runs school lunch programme across the country.

Earlier, Kamat pointed out that payments to some SHGs was delayed. “The government should ensure that the payments to SHGs be released on time,” he said.

To this, Sawant said that payments to some SHGs was not made on time as there was a delay in signing an agreement. The delay, he said, was on the part of SHG.

He further said that payment was held back as one of the three signatories to the contract had not signed. “There could be double claims. The department can be questioned if payment is released without other signatories,” Sawant said.

Nonetheless, he said, it should be ensured that payments are to be made to all SHG within one month of submission of bills. The chief minister expressed the need to put a mechanism in place to allow timely payments to SHGs.

Hyderabad: As many as 31 students of a government-run primary school in Kadekal village in Mulugu district are facing a grave risk. With their school building in a dilapidated condition and set to collapse, the students are at their wits’ end.

A software engineer Suman, who recently got a job in the school, highlighted its condition on Twitter and pleaded with education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy to do something. He posted photographs of the school. In one photograph, he stood with the children pleading that they be saved from an impending tragedy.

The minister said she had asked the commissioner of school education to look into the matter. “I have instructed the officials to construct a new school building in place of the dilapidated classrooms,” Sabitha said.

Following the minister’s intervention, an official visited the school on Saturday. “We hope something will be done for the children so that they can study in a better environment,” Suman told TOI.

The decades-old school building has been neglected. It has three rooms. One room is always locked, while the condition of the other rooms is very bad, forcing the children to study under an asbestos sheet. Suman, who comes from a tribal background, worked in an IT firm in Hyderabad before becoming a teacher in the school in December last year.

Condition of cycling track laid out alongside Tansa pipeline has worsened

MUMBAI: Two years have passed and work worth crores has been sanctioned, and yet completion of the 39km cycling and jogging track along Tansa pipeline continues to be a pipe dream. Though the BMC had sanctioned more than Rs 488 crore in its previous budget for the project, work has been moving at a snail’s pace.

Photographs from Bhandup-Mulund areas, where the BMC started the project in 2018, show the condition of the tracks that have been laid so far has already worsened. The project was to be completed by financial year 2020-21, but it is set to miss the deadline. Civic officials involved in implementation of the project refused to speak on it.

Politicians alleged that delay in the work has escalated costs. In 2018, the BMC had decided to lay out a cycling track along the Tansa pipeline between Mulund and Sion , connecting the stations in between, at a cost of Rs 300 crore. Within two years, though, the project cost increased to nearly Rs 500 crore.

Ravi Raja, opposition leader in the BMC and Congress corporator, said, “A cycling track is a good concept. But the BMC had planned it in a hurry, without conducting a proper study. A cycling track should be close to roads but it is being constructed along a water pipeline. We don’t know how the project will be executed. The BMC has already allocated work worth Rs 275 crore but it is unable to expedite it due to encroachments. It keeps delaying the project and the cost keeps rising. It is a waste of public money.”

In 2017, the BMC began massive demolition drives to remove over 16,000 encroachments for the security of Tansa pipeline following a Bombay high court order.

To ensure encroachers do not return, the BMC drew up a project titled ‘Green Wheels Along Blue Lines’ to develop a 10-metre-wide cycling and jogging track on the cleared land between Mulund and Sion. The proposed cycling track will have 40 exits and it will be connected to 10 Central Railway stations, five Western Railway stations, four Harbour line stations, seven Metro stations, two monorail stations and a few arterial roads. The BMC plans to put up a foldable track near Mahim creek area.

454,['4/02/2020'],Sattari villagers fret as lone KFD test unit shut,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Valpoi: Goa has no facility to diagnose Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) despite the cashew fruiting and harvesting season being just a few months away. This has stoked fear among the people — specially those in the Sattari taluka — who frequent forested areas during the cashew season and run the risk of contracting KFD.

A virology unit set up in 2015 by Manipal University at the Valpoi community health centre (CHC) to diagnose the dreaded disease shut in September last year upon completing its three-year research, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said.

The facility, which was headed by virologist Dr G Arunkumar, was instrumental in the early detection of KFD, leading to speedy treatment and fewer deaths. The tests it conducted for KFD and other virus-related diseases were free of cost. Reports were made available within 24 hours, enabling doctors at the CHC to provide prompt treatment.

The absence of such a facility now has people worried. “Cashew season is nearing, and in absence of this virology unit, people will suffer. Who will be responsible if there are any dire consequences? The government should take note of this,” Copardem-Sattari resident Uday Sawant, said.

However, Betodkar said people need not worry. “In case of suspected cases, samples will be sent to Manipal hospital’s laboratory at Dona Paula. An arrangement has been made,” he said.

Thane-Dongurli panch member Nilesh Parwar said a virology centre at Valpoi CHC was a necessity as several people from the Sattari taluka go to the forest during cashew season.

Until last week, no cases of KFD were detected in Goa while in the past, cases were seen as early as in October and November, coinciding with start of the cashew season. Commonly known as monkey fever or ‘makad taap’ in Goa, KFD was first diagnosed in 1957 in the Kyasanur forest of Karnataka’s Shivamogga district.

It spreads through infected ticks and affects both monkeys and humans. The mortality rate among monkeys, however, is higher. The ticks drop off as soon as a monkey dies, making others vulnerable to the disease. A 50-metre area around a monkey carcass is considered to be infected area.

Coimbatore: The city corporation has appointed a technical expert to prepare detailed project report (DPR) to construct rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures at its buildings under the smart cities mission.

The civic body has obtained the in-principal approval to construct the structures at corporation offices, schools and hospitals as part of area-based development (ABD) component of the mission from the smart city board, corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar said.

But during the board meeting in January, where the corporation presented a few models, the board raised objections related to the smart components of the project, said a corporation official. “The board directed the corporation to justify the reasons for proposing it under the mission,” he said.

“Recently, we appointed a technical expert as consultant to prepare DPR by collecting underground water level data in the city to understand how constructing the structures would increase water level,” said the commissioner. “The consultant will also recommend a suitable model with smart components, which could be adopted while constructing the structures.”

Last year, the corporation had directed public to construct RWH structures to collect rainwater that falls on rooftops on or before August 15 and had warned of severe actions on those, who fail to do it before the deadline.

Sravan said that 40% of the buildings in the corporation limit have working RWH structures. “Notices were issued to the owners of 30% buildings, directing them to repair the structures. We have already taken the assessment and are taking measures to ensure that all buildings are equipped,” he added.

Representative image

PANAJI: As many as 367 government primary schools have shut in Goa since 1989 due to zero or very low enrolment, chief minister Pramod Sawant said in a reply tabled in the House on Monday. Sawant, who holds the education portfolio, further said that another 24 government primary schools are staring at possible closure as they have an enrolment of between zero and five students.

In a bid to prevent this, measures such as renovation of school buildings, provision of trained English teachers and the recent appointment of more Marathi primary school teachers have been taken, the chief minister said.

Low enrolment schools are also single-teacher schools. As per norms of the directorate of education, an additional teacher can be allotted to a government primary school only if it has more than 24 students. The recent Niti Aayog report stated that Goa, along with Arunachal Pradesh and Jharkhand, has the highest percentage of single-teacher schools at 26.6, 19.7 and 16.9 percentage points, respectively.

During the 2019-20 academic year, 108 government primary schools saw enrolment of 10 or fewer students, while in 2018, 15 government primary schools closed down due to low enrolment. Such closures for want of students have seen the number of government primary schools reduce from 921 a decade ago to 753 currently.

Interestingly, while numerous state-run institutions have shut down, privately-managed aided and unaided schools have increased from 325 in 2010-11 to 397 in 2018-19. The state has now stopped issuing permits to new private primary schools to help the government retain control of the primary education sector.

459,['4/02/2020'],"New wetlands definition sees Maharashtra lose 29,000 sites","This story is from February 4, 2020

HC has asked district collectors to file affidavits explaining why incorrect information was given

MUMBAI: In 2010, 44,714 wetland sites were identified in Maharashtra. A decade later, their numbers have shrunk to approximately 15,865. The state environment department gave this information in an affidavit filed before the Bombay high court this past week.

The drastic fall in the numbers is on account of change in definition of wetlands under the 2017 Wetland Rules , said D Stalin, conservationist with NGO Vanashakti . In other words, a majority of areas classified as wetlands earlier are no longer identified as thus under the new definition.

The severity of the problem can be gauged from the depletion of wetland sites in one district alone. In Satara district of western Maharashtra, of a total of 7,909 wetland sites, there are only 719 in existence, states the affidavit. The 7,909 sites were identified by the Space Application Centre, Ahmedabad. The ground reality is that there are merely 719 sites in existence, sid Joy Thakur, under secretary, environment department, in his affidavit.

“For four years, the government did nothing despite the high court ordering them to draw up a list in 2013. The loss of wetlands is worrisome, especially in a state that regularly suffers from drought,” alleged Stalin.

The affidavit before the Bombay high court has stated that in 2010 the Wetlands Atlas published by the Space Application Centre had identified 44,714 sites in the state. According to the 2017 rules, 23,055 sites are indicated as per the Wetland Rules of 2017. But an onsite inspection shows there may be approximately 15,865 sites.

The affidavit states 15,189 sites have been visited and verified and that there are no wetlands in Nagpur, Nandurbar and Parbhani.

Subsequently, though, the court was informed there are wetlands in these three districts. The court has now directed the respective district collectors to file an affidavit explaining why incorrect information was provided.

D Stalin, said the state deliberately dragged its feet on identification of wetlands in accordance with the 2010 rules.

Coimbatore: Moira, a short film on road safety , was screened to an invited audience at SPI Cinemas in Brookefields shopping mall in the city on Monday.

The 40-minute film shows the plight of a youngster, who drove rashly through crowded lanes to catch a movie. He soon meets with an accident and meets Yama, the lord of death, who tells him about drunk driving, overspeeding and even about noise pollution.

Moira is a Greek word meaning fate, said TR Vijayaanand, who wrote and directed it. “I wanted to create a space to discuss about death on a one-to-one basis. I wanted to speak not about the death of an individual, but also about the grieving loved ones. I hope the film will create awareness about road safety rules and a flicker of fear for life,” he said.

The film was shot in Coimbatore and London. The shooting began in 2018. It was a joint initiative of Young Indians and Round Table India 20.

Coimbatore is only second to Chennai when it comes to road accidents, said B Praveen Kumar, chair of Young Indians. “Many of the accidents are a result of ignorance and carelessness,” he said.

The organisers have tied up with Moviebuff to stream Moira on YouTube from Friday.

In a similar event, actor Sivakumar honoured the winners of the short film contest conducted by Uyir – A people's movement against road accidents, at Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Science in the city.

The theme of the contest was road safety. Managing trustee of Uyir S Rajasekaran said that 162 entries were received from across the country for the three categories – 30 seconds, one minute and two minutes. The jury selected 10 short films. The winner received Rs 20,000 along with a shield.

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , on Monday, said that there are attempts to create religious hatred in the society in the name of agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). While replying to the allegations of the opposition in the assembly that innocent people are being arrested for attending CAA agitations, the chief minister said that the SDPI activists were involved in violence in the name of agitations.

“The government has not taken any case against those who were peacefully agitating against CAA. But cases have been registered against those who purposefully created violence in the name of the agitations,” said the chief minister.

He reiterated that SDPI tried to create violence in a few parts of the state in the guise of anti-CAA agitations. The government will not allow anyone to destabilise the communal harmony in the state. Any attempt to create religious hatred will be seriously dealt with, he added.

Roji M John of the Congress raised the allegation that police booked people involved in agitations against CAA in his constituency. He said that over 200 people from the mahallu committee of Angamaly have been booked though they were protesting peacefully. “Cases have been registered against them for obstructing traffic,” said Roji.

To this, the chief minister said that mahallu committees have been organizing protests in several parts of the state and in almost all places the agitations have been peaceful. “However, in a few areas, certain fundamental elements had intruded into the agitation and purposefully created violence. It has been found that SDPI activists were behind this. The police will not allow such radical elements to create trouble,” the chief minister reiterated.

“No one will be allowed to create trouble in the state and attempts to create religious hatred are being seriously looked into,” said Vijayan. He also criticized the opposition for taking up SDPI’s cause. “Why are they upset when I speak about SDPI?” he repeatedly asked, gesturing towards at the opposition benches.

However, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala charged that the state government is adopting the same policy of the BJP government by taking action against those agitating against CAA. “The police in Uttar Pradesh are taking action against the agitators. Why should we have the same policy? Is the state government adopting the policy of Amit Shah?” asked Chennithala.

Coimbatore: Soon, all government schools in the state will have youth and eco clubs.

It said the clubs should be started in all the 24,250 elementary schools, 7,043 middle schools and 6,065 high and higher secondary schools. While each elementary school would receive Rs 5,000 for the club, middle school would get Rs 15,000 and high and higher secondary, Rs 25,000. A total fund of Rs 37.84 crore has been allocated for the purpose, said the communication

In elementary and middle schools, the clubs should be run by five-student teams, and in high and higher secondary schools, they should be run by 15-student teams. Interested teachers should take turns to coordinate the club functions.

The clubs will have three sections: The literary section, which would conduct essay, elocution and poetry writing competitions; the arts and culture section, which would conduct music, dance and drama events and also plant and preserve gardens in the school campus; and the awareness section, which would conduct awareness campaigns in and around the school.

A Samagra Shiksha official said while several schools already have the clubs installed, following the direction, all schools should ensure the clubs are functional. “The fund is meant to buy gardening equipment and set up gardens on the school campus.

BENGALURU: Saddled with Rs 15-lakh debt, a 33-year-old software engineer allegedly bludgeoned her mother to death with a digging bar and tried to kill her younger brother before fleeing from her house in Ramamurthynagar, KR Puram, on Sunday.

C Nirmala, 54, died instantly after her daughter C Amruta hacked her in the bedroom around 5am, police said. Amruta then allegedly entered her younger brother, C Harish’s room and stabbed him in the neck using a kitchen knife.

“I was sleeping when she barged in. When I asked her why she was doing this, Amruta said she owed Rs 15 lakh and debtors would defame the family. She said it was better to die than live like this,” Harish, 31, told police.

He tried to grab Amruta but in vain. She ran away and Harish called his aunt Sudha who lived nearby. “Sudha shifted Harish to hospital and saved his life,” a police officer said. Harish works as an engineer in a private company, while Amruta was employed with a firm in Mahadevapura. The siblings were not married and lost their father long ago.

Colva: Additional sessions judge Dvijpla Patkar on Monday ordered that Vikat Bhagat, an accused who is facing trial for allegedly raping and murdering a 28-year-old foreign national, be produced in the court for trial in handcuffs.

The court had earlier ordered that Bhagat should be produced during the trial through video conferencing. However, a couple of times the accused refused to attend the hearing via video conferencing.

After hearing the prosecution and the accused on the application for hand-cuffing, the judge ordered that Bhagat henceforth be brought for trial in handcuffs.

Bhagat is accused of befriending the foreign national, on October 13, 2017, taking her to an open isolated field in Canacona taluka and allegedly raping and assaulting her with glass bottle on her head and face, and then murdering her by compressing her neck. He has also been accused of robbing her cellphone and also destroying evidence.

In December, 2018, a police sub-inspector from the escort cell, PSI Uday Umarye, had filed an application seeking the court’s order to handcuff the accused.

The PSI had brought it to the notice of the court that the accused does not cooperate with the escort team while being taken to courts and hospitals and keeps arguing.

QUOTES

Over the years, prognosis of many cancers has improved significantly. Cancers of breast, prostate, thyroid, leukaemia, and lymphoma can be completely cured in more than 80% of cases. But in India, only 20% of patients can be cured as remaining 80% report to hospitals in advanced stage

Dr GK Rath | Head, National Cancer Institute

I request all of you to stand beside those who have lost their loved ones due to cancer. Let us pledge to raise awareness about this disease so we can together prevent, diagnose, treat and beat cancer

Dr Sushil Mandhaniya | Medical Oncologist

If detected at early stage, we can treat and cure breast cancer completely. Unfortunately, women neglect early symptoms. When detected with cancer, they feel as if it’s all over. In fact, we can conquer this disease with confidence, proper treatment and self-belief

Madhuri Tijare | Director of Samarth breast cancer support group

Cancer if treated early is curable. We can definitely channelize our efforts at all levels towards fighting this grotesque disease and in turn drastically reduce the mortality and morbidity. Let us join hands and work towards creating awareness

HYDERABAD: Every 10 minutes, a woman succumbs to breast cancer in India and over 60% of the cases are detected in advanced stages, say experts.

Data by the state health authorities reveal that incidences of cervical and breast cancer are the highest in Telangana, followed by head and neck cancers. In 2018, 45,713 cases of cancer were reported in the state and the numbers have been going up every year by 4,000-5,000.

Experts point out that pollution and absence of screening protocol are pushing up the number of cases.

“Over 60% of breast cancers are detected in the advanced stage due to lack of awareness and organised nationwide breast cancer screening programme. In India, 1,50,000 new cases of breast cancer are reported every year of which 70,000 succumb to the disease,” said Dr P Raghu Ram, director of Kims-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases and president of Association of Breast Surgeons of India.

“Consumption of tobacco is a major factor contributing to the rise in oral cancers and lack of vaccination leads to cervical cancers and sedentary lifestyle and obesity has caused more breast cancers,” said Dr Chinnababu Sunkavalli, robotic surgical oncologist at Apollo Cancer Institute .

As a result, they find it difficult to travel to the ration shop and offices to collect pension, the people, who sought the help of the collector on Monday, said.

The complainants said that roads from Samathurpuram to Kalaignar Nagar and Annanagar were taken up for relaying by the Chettipalayam town panchayat last December. “They dug up the road and started the work but abandoned it for reasons not known. Now, the road is full of dust and gravel,” said R K Rangasamy, a petitioner. “The road is in a worse condition.”

As many as 30 disabled people stay in the area, including people with visual impairment. “We have to travel 5km to Kalaignar Nagar to access a ration shop and travel all the way to the Chettipalayam panchayat office to collect our pension. Without buses, we are paying Rs 100 to hire autorickshaws, which we can’t afford and as a result, are struggling,” stated the petition.

“Being disabled, we can’t even walk on these roads, which are full of large gravel stones, for the fear of it knocking us down or making us trip and fall,” said Rangasamy.

The petitioners urged the collector to instruct the town panchayat complete the road work.

Bokaro: School education and literacy mission department minister Jagarnath Mahto on Monday made a surprise inspection of a government middle school in Devipur area of Deoghar district and found performance of the schoolteachers unsatisfactory.

Mahto, who took charge as minister on Friday, made a stopover to the school while returning from the Baba Baidyanathdham temple. Soon after taking charge of the ministry, he is on a school-touring spree to take stock of the ground realities.

While visiting the school in Deoghar, Mahto sat along with the students on the floor and asked them to take turns in writing what they have learnt so far. Teachers and education department officials present at the school were left red-faced when many of the students failed to write simple Hindi alphabets.

“Obviously, the teachers are not performing up to the mark,” the minister remarked.

Mahto had also made surprise inspections in two schools of Giridih district earlier. At a school in Bengabad area of Giridih, he asked the students to don the role of teachers while he sat on the floor with the others to test their knowledge. On Saraswati Puja, he visited an upgraded high school in Chitardih under Jamua block of the same district after a video clip of a teacher in an inebriated state surfaced. He summoned the education department officials and presented a rose to the teacher before everyone and asked him to mend his ways. He later transferred the teacher and said, “Such acts will not be tolerated. What will students learn from him?”

Talking to reporters, Mahto said he will continue his tours to assess the quality of teaching as well as other aspects of the education system to take corrective steps. He said, “Improving teaching standards at government schools is in my priority list.”

479,['4/02/2020'],What is the right vaccination for swine flu?,"Swine flu (also known as the H1N1) is a respiratory condition which is highly infectious and can spread very quickly from one person to another. While it was earlier only detected in people with regular exposure to pigs (hence the name), it now primarily spreads from person to person.Like many other strains of flu, swine flu is extremely contagious and can spread through air droplets produced by sneezing, coughing and even by touching infected areas where droplets have recently landed, including desks, utensils and tabletops. This is why the best means to prevent this deadly flu is to get vaccinated.Infact, people with a compromised immune system, pregnant women, elderlies and those suffering from chronic health conditions are more susceptible to falling prey to swine flu. Even though the symptoms of H1N1 closely mimic the usual influenza infections (including cold, cough, high fever, body ache, running nose, sore throat etc.), some people may require hospitalization.Although the symptoms of swine flu are usually mild, pregnant women, very young children, elderlies and those with a weak immune system are more likely to be seriously ill with swine flu. Hence, even though everyone should make it a point to get swine flu vaccinations, the priority groups which are more at risk of catching this infection should get vaccinated without fail.Vaccines have been developed to protect against the virus that causes swine flu. According to Dr Sushant Chhabra, HOD Emergency Medicine, Manipal Hospital, one should get the seasonal flu vaccine as it keeps getting updated every year to protect against new strains of viruses. The flu vaccination available in the market has four inactive strains and is known as the quadrivalent flu vaccine.0.25 millilitres0.5 millilitresThe swine flu vaccination is ideally taken once in a year and its immunity period is usually between 6 months to one year.Some of the most common side-effects of a swine flu vaccine include allergic reaction, fever and redness and pain at the site of injection.

480,['4/02/2020'],Only 20k got 100-day work under NREGA in Jharkhand,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Ranchi: Only 20,000 families — out of the 26.23 lakh active MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) card holders in the state — have got 100 days of work at a stretch in the current fiscal year, according to a study by civil society outfit NREGA Watch.

Stressing that the centrally-sponsored scheme for rural income generation is failing in Jharkhand, the study claimed that in the 2015-16 fiscal year, 1.74 lakh got 100 days of work. Since then, the study said there has been a steep decline every year at a time when Jharkhand is reeling under rural and farm distress, the study said.

Convenor of NREGA Watch (Jharkhand) Jamesh Herenj said there’s a lack of interest among the rural people in taking up MNREGA jobs owing to the non-timely payment of dues and the poor wages. “Since December 24 last year, payments worth Rs 83 crore are pending under MNREGA due to the non-allocation of funds and the liability only increases with time. In Jharkhand, a worker gets Rs 171 per day, which is lower than the amount a worker gets in non-MNREGA schemes, which is about Rs 257.29 per day,” Herenj added.

“One of the reasons behind the steep fall in job seekers is because of job diversification. Rural jobs comprise a whole range of works, right from digging wells to ponds, constructing roads, among others, as laid down by the gram sabhas. However, in Jharkhand, the former state government ignored the gram sabhas’ advice. For instance, in the last six months, the only work which took place in the state was TCB (trench cum bunds) creations. Before that, works like building toilets or rural houses were alloted at places where there was no demand,” he said.

Representative image

RANCHI: Acting on tip-offs from multiple sources, including the Narcotics Control Bureau, police used drones to verify the inputs and destroyed illegal cultivation of poppy crop in 320 acres of land spread across remote areas of the state within two months of the season.

In view of the current growing season of the crop, police are carrying out regular drives almost on a daily basis in the districts, including Ranchi and Khunti, known for growing the illegal crop. According to Criminal Investigation Department (CID) figures, poppy plants on about 320 acres of land have been destroyed in various parts of the state during the last two months with the maximum destruction of crops in Chatra district , where 272 acres of the crop were destroyed. Over 50 acres were also destroyed in Khunti while the crop in three acres was destroyed in Ranchi district . In the previous cultivation season, the state police had destroyed standing popply crop on over 1800 acres of land.

Ranchi SP (rural) Rishab Jha said, “We are using drones for tracking the crops, which are usually grown in remote and inaccessible areas. Use of drones is saving us a lot of time and manpower as it can fly for about an hour and up to a distance of 15km.”

Khunti SP Ashutosh Shekhar said, “Opium cultivation is concentrated in several police station areas, including Arki, Murhu, Saiko, Maranghada. A concerted drive is going on to destroy the crops. Locals are giving us maximum inputs.”

Notably, the CID has stressed on nabbing the kingpins involved in promoting cultivation and trade of opium. “We need to work on the big players with inter-state connections. As of now, they are not caught in large numbers,” CID ADG Anurag Gupta said.

NEW DELHI: As preparations pick up for US President Donald Trump ’s visit later this month, it is learnt that he is likely to land in Ahmedabad on February 23 where, apart from visiting Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram , he may address a town hall-like event.

The event is likely to include Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well, and might be even bigger than the ‘Howdy Modi’ function in Houston last year. The US advance team to finalise preparations are expected to arrive this week.

Trump is likely to come to Delhi that evening, beginning his official visit on February 24. It is unclear whether he will come with wife Melania or daughter Ivanka, who has already visited India, representing her father at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad in 2017.

After his official engagements, which include talks with Modi and a banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan among others, Trump may make a short trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal.

The visit will be Trump’s first to India as president, and has acquired significance since he will be coming just after a bruising impeachment trial and in an election year. The US and India are expected to conclude a limited trade deal during Trump’s visit that has been in negotiations for the past few months.

486,['4/02/2020'],Allow permit rooms in Tadoba resorts: Min,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Chandrapur: In a bid to maintain Tadoba’s competitive edge in attracting more tourists, state’s relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Monday demanded issuing liquor permits to resorts in the tiger reserve.

“Tourists from across the world come to Vidarbha for tiger tourism. While Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) is a popular tourist destination, tigers are also being sighted in nearby Pench reserve, Bor and Umred-Karhandla tiger sanctuaries. However, when it comes to facilities available for tourists, Tadoba lags behind in terms of availability of liquor,” said Wadettiwar, who is also guardian minister of Chandrapur.

“Due to liquor ban in the district, the possibility of tourists opting for tiger sanctuaries other than those in Chandrapur cannot be ruled out,” he said expressing his resolve to take up this matter with the state government.

The minister also pointed out that though liquor is banned in entire Gujarat state, it is made available under special provisions to tourists there. Similar relaxation can be given to resorts in Tadoba to run permit rooms, he said.

Wadettiwar also formally announced a nine-member committee instituted to analyse the outcome of liquor ban in Chandrapur. The committee comprises SP, ZP CEO, superintendent of excise department, prohibition experts and members of social organization. District collector would head the panel.

The panel will analyse facts on nine parameters related to prohibition and would submit its report within a month, he said. “After receiving the report, I will take up the issue in the state cabinet,” said Wadettiwar.

Wadettiwar also demanded survey of the tree plantation carried out in the state last year in which then forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has claimed to have planted over 33 crore saplings.

The minister said he has written to forest minister Sanjay Rathod seeking survey of the plantation carried out by forest department and other agencies last year. “If lapses are found, inquiry should be set up and action should be taken against guilty,” said Wadettiwar.

The 33 crore tree plantation drive was the dream project of former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar.

“Recently, Kamal Nath-led Congress government in Madhya Pradesh had carried out similar survey and found that only 17 lakh saplings out of the 7 crore plantations claimed by the BJP government have survived. All I want to check is how many of the trees were actually planted in Maharashtra, how many of them survived and what is the survival rate in the drive led by Mungantiwar,” said Wadettiwar. He also maintained that if the plantation drive turns out to be eyewash and major lapses comes to fore, then inquiry must be set up.

Nagpur: Environment enthusiasts teamed up on World Wetlands Day at Ambazari Biodiversity Park, Hingna, for a cleaning drive organized by the social forestry division and forest division on Sunday.

Nearly 200 volunteers participated in the campaign and started with the cleaning process at 8am. A truckload of litter was collected by them from Nag River and the Ambazari backwater areas. They were awarded with certificates of participation for their conscious efforts.

Speaking about the drive, divisional forest officer (DFO), social forestry, Geeta Nannaware said, “We celebrate this day every year. This time around, we decided to step out for a hands-on experience in sanitation. We were elated to see a great response from kids who tagged along with their families to display awareness.”

“Voluntary participation on a weekend is a sign that people are aware of the importance of this day. Ambazari is the heart of the city and the wetlands should be spic and span,” she said.

Nannaware said that around 20-25 garbage bags were piled up from the area.

Present at the drive were chief conservator of forest, Nagpur circle, Kalyan Kumar, deputy conservator of forests Prabhunath Shukla, divisional forest officer Deepali Talmale and assistant conservator of forest Rajan Talmale among others.

With fishing activities on the rise, several thermocol blocks were found at the site since it is used by fishermen to keep the nets afloat. Along with polluting the water bodies, thermocol is an extremely harmful substance for the aquatic life.

Kumar said it is a cause of concern that thermocol was collected in heaps.

Asked about finding an alternative to the hazardous effects of thermocol, he said, “It is not the domain of the forest department. We need to take technical advice from the fisheries department to come up with a sustainable measure so that aquatic life is not under any threat.”

Tailwind for project after new Metro GM’s visit in January

KOLKATA: India’s oldest ‘ Metro city ’ is set to get its second line, 35 years after the first opened, as the East-West Metro opens its doors on February 13, almost 12 years after it was sanctioned.For now, Kolkata’s biggest infrastructure project in several decades will operate on a truncated route of 5km, between Sector V and the Salt Lake stadium. The completed 16.5km corridor, when it opens, will connect Kolkata with its twin, Howrah, under the Hooghly, making it the country’s first underwater rapid transit system.The section that will be operational is an elevated stretch, consisting of six stations: Sector V, Karunamoyee, Central Park, City Centre, Bengal Chemical and Salt Lake Stadium.Commuters who avail themselves of the East-West Metro will get to travel in futuristic rakes that are capable to attaining speeds of 80kmph, completing the end-to-end trip in nine to 13 minutes. Three trains will be used at 20-minute intervals; they will halt for 20 seconds at each station. According to sources, in about three months, the service shall be extended to Phoolbagan, where the underground station has been built and the tunnel dug up to Sealdah.Railway minister Piyush Goyal is scheduled to flag off the route in a ceremony at the Sector V station on February 13, where CM Mamata Banerjee has been invited, said Union minister for state, Babul Supriyo. “I am happy to announce that the East-West Metro will be launched on February 13. The railway ministry will follow protocol; we don’t want politics. I had personally invited the CM for the inauguration. I have had PM Modiji’s permission to execute the project with the state government’s cooperation. Glad that has happened,” Supriyo said. Passenger services should commence soon after the inauguration.The Rs 8,575-crore project has suffered from several hiccups, the largest setback being the tunnelling disaster on August 31 last year, where one of the two tunnel-boring machines hit an aquifer, causing subsidence in Bowbazar and the collapse of several buildings. Around 700 residents were evacuated and put up in hotels. The last seven residents moved out of hotels to rented flats only last Saturday. Only 354 have so far managed to return to their own homes after repairs.Had that not happened, the entire stretch — Sector V to Howrah Maidan — would have been operational by end-2021, sources told TOI. The last bit of tunnelling, between Esplanade and Sealdah, has completely ground to a halt because of the subsidence disaster.Construction of the underground section between Phoolbagan and Sealdah has been over for three years now, but the stretch can’t be commissioned until the Esplanade-Sealdah tunnelling is complete. Underground tunnelling between Howrah Maidan and Esplanade, too, has been completed.Before the tunnelling disaster, the project had been mired in a land acquisition logjam, and 365m of the viaduct couldn’t be built at Duttabad, on the EM Bypass, because 80 families refused to shift. The matter was sorted by the chief minister at Supriyo’s request in 2015.While Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the special purpose vehicle created to implement the project, is currently engaged in strengthening the ground loosened by the tunnelling fiasco, permission to restart the tunnel-boring machine is pending at Calcutta High Court. The twin tunnels, covering 2.45km, would have been built by December 2020, paving the way for the commissioning of the entire 16.5km stretch in June 2021.For now, Kolkatans can only look forward to boarding hi-tech trains and using the six elevated stations.“That, in itself, is great news, considering the hiccups Phase 1 itself went through,” said an engineer involved in the project.Even as construction got over and everything in place, the Salt Lake section missed multiple deadlines. The Commissioner of Railway Safety, in giving its safety nod last August, had mandated opening the stretch by November 30. On Metro Railway’s request, the commissioner had to extend the validation till February 29. In December, Suneet Sharma, the Eastern Railway GM, officiating as the Metro GM, had formally informed the Railway Board that Phase 1 was ready for immediate launch. Then, the anti-CAA agitations started and no unveiling date was announced for more than a month. Service trials were done all over again. On January 18, Manoj Joshi, soon after taking over as the new Metro Railway GM, did his inspection and wrote to the railway board about the section’s preparedness.“Since July, 2018, we have been watching the standard-gauge six-coach cars puffing in and out of the Central Park depot and waiting impatiently to ride the trains. Thank God the wait is about to end,” said Promita Chatterjee, a 66-year-old resident of Salt Lake’s BE Block.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73927718,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-787762,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-track-first-phase-of-e-w-metro-to-roll-out-on-feb-13/articleshow/73917288.cms

492,['4/02/2020'],"Rose Valley scam: ED attaches a/cs linked to KKR, St Xavier’s","This story is from February 4, 2020

Kolkata: The Enforcement Directorate has attached several bank accounts, belonging to Knight Riders Sports Private Limited (owner of the IPL franchisee Kolkata Knight Riders), Multiple Resorts Private Limited and St Xavier’s College, as part of its probe in the Rose Valley scam.

The bank accounts attached on Monday have Rs 16.2 crore in them. The ED, probing the Rs 17,520-crore scam, also attached property worth Rs 53.9 crore, officials said.

The central agency started a probe into the alleged scam after a Securities and Exchange Board of India complaint accused Rose Valley of duping thousands of investors. The ED made its first arrest — that of Rose Valley head Gautam Kundu — in 2015.

There was no response from KKR CEO Venky Mysore to a query from TOI.

St Xavier’s College principal Fr Dominic Savio was unavailable on phone; messages sent to him went unanswered. But a college office-bearer said “all cooperation was being given to the probe”.

“The account was frozen three years ago and what happened on Monday was a procedural formality. We have also told the authorities that we want to return the amount under scanner, kept in this account, following the due legal process,” he added.

The agency initiated the probe against Knight Riders Sports as it had entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Rose Valley Group. The group, officials said, was KKR’s principal sponsor in IPL seasons 5 and 6 (for a total payment of Rs 11.8 crore during 2012 and 2013). The Multiple Resorts account attachment, officials said, was because of a Rose Valley acquisition of a resort (made against a payment of Rs 5 crore). The attachment of the three St Xavier’s College bank accounts was related to “a donation of Rs 96 lakh from Kundu for his son’s admission”, officials added.

Besides the bank accounts, a one-acre plot in New Town, a hotel on VIP Road, 24 acres in Ramnagar and Mahishadal (both in East Midnapore) and a flat in Mumbai were also attached, officials said.

493,['4/02/2020'],West Bengal assembly’s budget session to begin on February 7,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar with Amit Mitra and Partha Chatterjee at Raj Bhavan on Monday

KOLKATA: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has summoned the budget session of the Bengal assembly on February 7 at 2 pm in exercise of his powers under Article 174(1) of the Constitution. The session will begin with the governor’s speech and state finance minister Amit Mitra will place the Budget sometime later during the session.

Accordingly, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday placed the draft of the governor’s speech in the state cabinet meeting and got it approved before sending the speech to Raj Bhavan. Not only that, Mitra, prodded by the CM, called on Dhankhar to clarify the finer points of the state’s economy and its growth path when the governor has been at loggerheads with the government on several issues, particularly higher education. Two days ago, state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee met the governor with a request to call the budget session on February 7.

The Raj Bhavan visits by senior Trinamool Congress ministers gain significance in the backdrop of a development in Kerala, a week ago, when governor Arif Mohammad Khan wrote to the Kerala CM stating that he wouldn’t read the paragraph in his speech that states that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is “unconstitutional”.

Political observers do not rule out the Bengal governor raising questions over certain paragraphs of the governor’s speech. Leader of the opposition Abdul Mannan, who has been in parliamentary politics for long, said there was no scope for the governor but to read out the speech prepared by the state government. “The governor may seek clarifications, but has to make the speech as constitutional head of the state,” Mannan said. However, there are at least two instances where the governor held back two bills because the state government couldn’t clarify his queries.

Dhankhar made his constitutional primacy known and seized the opportunity to point out that the budget session couldn’t have been summoned unless he prorogued the assembly session on January 31, invoking Article 174(2) of the Constitution.

HK flights keep options open

KOLKATA: With the number of passengers travelling to China down to a trickle following the coronavirus outbreak in the country, airlines operating between Kolkata and different Chinese cities are either suspending flights or rationalizing them. Two Union health ministry advisories, the latest on Monday, asking people to refrain from travelling to China and adding that travellers on return from the country could be quarantined, has further aggravated the situation.While IndiGo has already announced suspension of its daily flight from Kolkata to Guangzhou from February 6, China Eastern Airlines that operated daily between Kolkata and Kunming will now fly only on four days from this week.IndiGo and China Eastern operate Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-800 — with capacity of 180 and 162 respectively — on the sector, and airport sources said, passenger count was as low as 35-40 on some days last week. In fact, China Eastern had to cancel its February 1 flight due to low passenger count.“From this week we will operate on Monday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday. The decision was taken after passenger load to China from Kolkata dipped significantly over the last few days. But we have no immediate plans to suspend the route as Kunming-Kolkata flights are still running near capacity,” a China Eastern official said.The Chinese carrier’s move comes two days after IndiGo announced suspension of all its flights to and from China. IndiGo said in a statement on Saturday that it was suspending its Kolkata-Guangzhou flight from February 6 to February 25 “in line with the WHO guideline to contain the spread of coronavirus”. An airline official said the suspension was temporary and a purely precautionary measure. “We will refund the full amount to the impacted passengers,” he said.Officials of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon, which run flights to Hong Kong from Kolkata, said they are yet to take any decision on suspending flights but are keeping an eye on the situation and are prepared to rationalize flights as and when necessary.“None of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon flights out of India has been cancelled. We will rationalise our flights in keeping with the demand. In most cases, these decisions are taken well in advance to avoid any inconvenience to our passengers,” said an official of Cathay Pacific.TOI had reported on January 25 that around 40% flyers scheduled to travel to China from the city in the last week of January and in February had already cancelled their journey following the coronavirus scare Industry sources said around 4,500 people travel to China from the city every month. “During this time of the year, the passenger count drops by around 25%-30% because most shops and stores in China are shut for two weeks for the lunar new year and spring festival celebrations. But because of the coronavirus scare, even Chinese nationals are skipping home visit this year. Also, the large number of Indian students sent back have been asked not to return till further notice. As a result, outbound passenger count from Kolkata has dropped drastically,” said a senior airline official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73921524,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-406531,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-china-flights-go-off-the-radar/articleshow/73917364.cms

The crew charted a route along river Matla in the Sunderbans

KOLKATA: The Indian Navy completed its first-ever exercise in inland waters on Sunday by charting a route for its boats along river Matla in the Sunderbans. This is the Indo-Bangladesh trade protocol route and the Navy has always been apprehensive of barges moving along it unchecked.

Till now, the Navy had operated at sea. This was the first time its boats entered the Sunderbans for the exercise named ‘Matla Abhiyan’.

“The coastal security exercise led by Captain Joydeep Chakraborty was flagged off from Kolkata on Wednesday. On Sunday, the two boats were flagged in by Commodore Suprobho K De, naval officer-in-charge, West Bengal , at the Man of War Jetty. The boats not only patrolled the protocol route (till Hemnagar on the Indian side) but also interrogated fishing boats, tankers and launches operating on the Matla, river Hooghly and the narrow creeks of the Sunderbans. During the patrol the boats stopped first at Namkhana, where sailors interacted with local fishermen. Thereafter, the crew interacted with marine police stations at Maipith, Gobardhanpur and Gosaba enroute to Hemnagar,” a senior naval official in Kolkata said.

At Hemnagar, the naval detachment interacted with Inland Waterways Authority of India and Customs officials. Chakraborty and his team also visited a school and interacted with students and teachers, distributing pamphlets about the Navy and details of how to join. The vessels left Hemnagar on Saturday and met BSF boat at the zero point along the Indo-Bangladesh border.

The naval boats were escorted by IWAI vessel Meghna, highlighting the strong inter-agency coordination among various stakeholders. IWAI vessels are used to the protocol route. Meghna also provided logistical support to the boats.

“Given the impetus being given to inland water transport, this exercise was very crucial. Now, barges primarily carry fly ash from India to Bangladesh along this route. Very soon, vessels will pass through the Sunderbans with all sort of cargo and enter the Brahmaputra through Bangladesh for easier transportation to the northeastern states,” the official added.

497,['4/02/2020'],UT plans to extend bar timings till 2am,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The UT administration is considering extending bar timings from 1 am to 2 am in the city, a suggestion the Chandigarh Hospitality Association members had made recently apart from lowering the drinking age limit from 25 to 21 years.

Sources said the UT officials will prepare a proposal, which will be taken up before the UT adviser and deputy commissioner who further discuss it with the UT administrator. “The proposal will be implemented only after the approval of the UT administrator,” said a senior official dealing with the excise policy.

The excise and taxation department on August 2 last year had suspended the liquor licence of a club in Industrial Area, Phase I, for keeping the premises and bar open after 1am. The department had sought suggestions from hoteliers and wine merchants’ body before finalising the policy. In the meeting with deputy commissioner Mandip Brar, the hoteliers had submitted the suggestions.

The administration is also considering increasing prices of premium brands of whisky and beer by 10% to 15% in the next excise policy, which will come into force from April 1. Sources in the administration said the officials were contemplating a hike in the prices of whisky and beer and those of wine and beer at microbreweries were likely to go down.

In the current excise policy, the prices of premium brands of whisky had gone up by around 20%. However, the rates of beer and wine had remained unchanged and those of beer at microbrewery had gone down.

According to the administration, the 2019-20 excise policy would help it earn a revenue Rs 600 crore as compared to Rs 510 crore in 2018-19.
