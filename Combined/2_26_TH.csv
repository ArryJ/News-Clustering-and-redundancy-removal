0,2020/02/26,"Overcoming the odds, lifting spirits","The incredible journey of Sanket and Prashant

One grew up in a village of weightlifters while the other grazes cattle to support his family. On Wednesday, both shattered the National record at the Khelo India University Games (KIUG).

Sanket Mahadev Sargar rewrote the record books, lifting a total of 244 kgs to clinch the gold in the men’s 55kg category. The 19-year-old has made the 55kg section his own — he won gold at the senior National and at the Khelo India Youth Games last month.

A student of Kolhapur’s Shivaji University, Sanket arrived in Bhubaneswar weighing 1.7 kilos more than the permissible limit and had to reduce his intake massively to be eligible to compete.

“I came here weighing 56.7kgs and had to completely cut down on my carbohydrates before the event. I ate boiled vegetables and salads, and even had to restrict my water intake. My calves have begun to cramp,” he said, grimacing as he clutched the back of his right leg.

Obvious choice

Hailing from the weightlifting belt of Sangli, the sport was an obvious choice.

“The children in our locality hardly play any other sport. I got into weightlifting when I was 13,” he said. Sanket trains for close to 12 hours a day and his hard work has paid off as he has been chosen for the National camp to be held in Patiala from March 10.

Sanket has set his sights on the 61kg category which is part of the Olympics roster. “I want to make it to the 2024 Olympics and will have to move to 61kg. It will be a huge jump and it will take me two years to be fully prepared for it, but I’m determined to get there,” he said.

Sanket was pushed to the limit by Prashant Suresh Koli, who scripted a new National record in snatch but had to settle for silver. Prashant has a similar tale, almost.

He was around 13 when his father lost his battle to cancer and the teenager had to chip in financially. While his mother works in a farm, his brother drives a tempo. Prashant used to contribute to the family’s coffers by grazing cattle in his village of Mhasavad in Jalgaon district in northern Maharashtra, before his cousin brother’s coach asked him to try his luck at weightlifting.

Prashant shot into the limelight when he won silver at the inter-University Games, but was soon dealt a blow as he suffered a bout of typhoid. He was confined to a hospital bed and was out of action for eight days.

The illness took away some of his physical strength, but that did not deter him. He returned to the training mat soon after and got back in shape, just in time for his silver-winning campaign here. “It feels good to be back,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/dk4ska/article30925062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27SANKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/overcoming-the-odds-lifting-spirits/article30925063.ece

Asked to re-appear in trials after not-so-strong performance at the Rome Ranking series event and the recently-concluded Asian Championships, the 18-year-old Sonam tore apart the challenge of established seniors in the 62kg competition.

She first got past Radhika and then caring little for reputations, Sonam beat the Asian Championship 59kg gold medallist Sarita Mor (3-1) in the semifinals before winning by fall against Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi in the final.

She pinned Sakshi in the second period when she was trailing 1-2 and one minute left in the bout.

Meanwhile, Kiran won the trial in 76kg.

World No. 1 Chen Yufei and defending men’s champion Viktor Axelsen will headline a star-studded international contingent when the 10th India Open Super 500 badminton tournament will begin here on March 24.

With the Olympic qualification cut-off set to end on April 26, the $400,000 tournament will see a galaxy of stars, including eight of the world’s top 10 women singles and three of the top 10 men’s singles players.

A number of top Chinese players are expected to participate in the event.

Besides Yufei, world No. 8 He Bingjiao and former All England champion Shi Yu Qi are the other stars of the Chinese squad who are expected to compete.

Yufei will be leading eight of the world’s top 10 women’s singles shuttlers. The others are Japan’s Akane Yamaguchi, China’s He Bingjiao, Spain’s Carolina Marin, Korea’s An Se Young, Canada’s Michelle Li, three-time champion Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand and P.V. Sindhu and Saina Nehwal.

While Axelsen will be gunning for his third title, he will have to contend with fellow top-10 players, B. Sai Praneeth and China’s Shi Yuqi.

For Saina and K. Srikanth the tournament will be crucial as they look to gain valuable points and materialise their Olympic dreams.

P. Kashyap, H.S. Prannoy, Sourabh Verma, Sameer Verma and Lakshya Sen are the other Indians who will present their challenge in the singles main draw. For Sindhu, it will be a perfect battleground to test herself against the world’s best in front of home supporters.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/yufei-axelsen-headline-star-studded-line-up/article30924968.ece
3,2020/02/26,"Goodbye, tennis: Maria Sharapova announces retirement","“Tennis - I'm saying goodbye,” Sharapova said in an article for Vogue and Vanity Fair magazines

Five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova, one of the world's most recognisable sportswomen, on Wednesday announced her retirement at the age of 32.

“Tennis - I'm saying goodbye,” Sharapova said in an article for Vogue and Vanity Fair magazines.

“After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I'm ready to scale another mountain - to compete on a different type of terrain.”

Sharapova burst onto the scene as a supremely gifted teenager and won her Grand Slams before serving a 15-month ban for failing a drugs test at the 2016 Australian Open. The Russian former world number one's ranking is currently 373rd.

Sharapova has hardly played in the past year because of long-standing shoulder problems.

When she did play she lost as many matches as she won and was dumped out in the first rounds at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and, most recently, the Australian Open in Melbourne.

Sharapova shot to fame as a giggly 17-year-old Wimbledon winner in 2004, the third-youngest player to conquer the All England Club's hallowed grass courts.

‘Tennis gave me life’

She became world number one in 2005 and won the U.S. Open the next year.

“One of the keys to my success was that I never looked back and I never looked forward,” Sharapova said on Wednesday.

“I believed that if I kept grinding and grinding, I could push myself to an incredible place.”

But in 2007 Sharapova began her long on-off battle with shoulder trouble.

She would win the 2008 Australian Open before a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, missing the U.S. Open and Beijing Olympics.

In 2012, the Siberian-born Sharapova captured the French Open to become the 10th woman to complete a career Grand Slam. She added Olympic silver to her resume that year.

Her 2014 French Open title was another high after a dispiriting injury low.

More fitness troubles followed before the bombshell announcement of her positive test for the banned heart drug meldonium.

Always a fighter — the seven-year-old Maria and father Yuri left for the U.S. in 1994 with just a borrowed $700 to their names — Sharapova returned to the sport in 2017.

“In giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life,” Sharapova said in her retirement missive.

“I'll miss it everyday. I'll miss the training and my daily routine: Waking up at dawn, lacing my left shoe before my right, and closing the court's gate before I hit my first ball of the day.

“I'll miss my team, my coaches. I'll miss the moments sitting with my father on the practice court bench. The handshakes - win or lose - and the athletes, whether they knew it or not, who pushed me to be my best.

“Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain. My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/b5xyv4/article30509940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSHARAPOVA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/goodbye-tennis-maria-sharapova-announces-retirement/article30923438.ece
4,2020/02/26,"COVID-19 | Six countries, including China, pull out of shooting World Cup in Delhi","The ISSF World Cup is slated to be held from March 15 to 26 at the Karni Singh Shooting Range here

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has prompted six countries, including the deadly disease’s epicentre China, to withdraw from next month’s shooting World Cup here, the National Rifles Association of India (NRAI) revealed on Wednesday.

The ISSF World Cup is slated to be held from March 15 to 26 at the Karni Singh Shooting Range here.

“There were some countries which were coming but because of the COVID-19 outbreak, their national policies dictate that they can’t come,” NRAI President Raninder Singh told presspersons.

Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?

“China has taken a wise decision on their own as a nation. They don’t want to infect others and hence won’t travel. Taiwan, which has locked down their entire island, Hong Kong, Macau, North Korea and Turkmenistan have also backed out because of national policies,” he added, referring to the domestic travel restrictions imposed by the governments of these countries.

Earlier this month, the Indian government refused to grant visas to Chinese grapplers for the Asian Wrestling Championship held here due to the disease which originated from Wuhan and has killed more than 2,600 and infected over 80,000 people all over the world.

The NRAI chief also informed that Pakistan will also not be competing at the event as the country’s shooters are busy familiarising themselves with a new coach.

Epidemic vs. pandemic? Glossary of terms for virus outbreak

“Don’t connect last time to this time. Pakistan were never coming. They have two athletes who have qualified for pistol events for the Tokyo Olympics,” he said referring to the denial of visas to Pakistani shooters in last year’s World Cup.

“My colleague Mr. Javed Lodhi [Pakistan shooting federation’s executive vice president] has informed me that ‘our coach in Germany is only available during that time and our shooters would much rather train with him for the Olympic events than participate in the World Cup,’” Mr. Singh added.

Last year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had suspended all Indian applications to host international events after two Pakistani shooters were denied visas to compete in the World Cup held here.

The sanction was later lifted after assurances from the Sports Ministry that political issues would not come in the way of granting visas to participating athletes.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/mgpq7l/article30922465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THPTIISSFWORLDCUP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/covid-19-six-countries-including-china-pull-out-of-shooting-world-cup-in-delhi/article30922466.ece
5,2020/02/26,Table Tennis worlds postponed over virus scare,"Table tennis’s world team championships, due to take place next month in South Korea’s Busan, were postponed on Tuesday following a leap in novel COVID-19 cases.

The International Table Tennis Federation said the event, originally planned for March 22-29, had been provisionally rescheduled for June 21-28 following an emergency meeting with local organisers.

South Korea’s K-league had already postponed the start of the new football season on Monday as the virus causes chaos in the country’s sporting calendar.

Volleyball, basketball and handball have taken similar measures as confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 893 in South Korea, with eight deaths. “In light of the emerging situation in Korea Republic and to best preserve the health and safety of players, officials and fans, the Hana Bank 2020 World Team Table Tennis Championships in Busan have been postponed with the dates of 21-28 June provisionally reserved,” said an ITTF statement.

“By continuing to work hard and in close cooperation with all stakeholders in Busan, the ITTF remains confident about putting on a great World in June.”

The COVID-19 has had a serious impact on sports events worldwide, with football matches in Italy, China and Japan postponed as well as the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens and elite women’s LPGA golf tournaments in Thailand, Singapore and China.

The Korean Volleyball Federation said it would hold matches behind closed doors until “an improvement in the situation”.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/table-tennis-worlds-postponed-over-virus-scare/article30915964.ece

The death toll in the clashes in northeast Delhi over the Citizenship Amendment Act rose to 24 on February 26. Over 180 people have been injured.

Clashes triggered on Sunday by pro- and anti-CAA protesters continued for the third day on Tuesday in northeast Delhi as the death toll mounted to 13. Most of the deaths were due to gunshot wounds, their families have told The Hindu.

Addressing a press conference later in the evening, Mr. Trump, however, said he had not discussed the specifics of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, that sparked the violence as he raised issues of “religious liberty” of “Muslims and Christians in India” with Mr. Modi.

India and the U.S. on Tuesday concluded defence deals worth over $3 billion for 24 MH-60R Seahawk Multi-Role Helicopters for the Navy and six AH-64E attack helicopters for the Army on the sidelines of the discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The political arithmetic will largely remain unchanged in the Upper House with elections to 55 seats, but the Opposition expects to bring in qualitative change by nominating many of its heavyweights to the Rajya Sabha.

An apex environmental screening committee has deferred a decision on clearance to the Parliament redevelopment project. This has been done on the grounds that there was a dispute, being heard in the Delhi High Court, regarding the land on which some of the proposed structures were to come up, a person privy to the meeting told The Hindu.

A tectonic shift in America’s relations with China under Donald Trump’s presidency — one that Indian officials believe is here to stay and will outlast the current U.S. President — is providing a new impetus to defence, security, trade and technological cooperation between New Delhi and Washington in the region.

Outside the mortuary of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Tuesday, families of deceased gathered to receive the bodies of their loved ones.

The Central Board of Secondary Education has postponed the Class 10 and 12 board examinations scheduled for Wednesday in 86 centres in northeast Delhi due to the violence that has rocked those areas for the third straight day.

The ruling is a major victory for the terminally ill patients, doctors and assisted suicide organisations who brought the case, complaining that the existing law went too far.

13,2020/02/26,Latin America reports 1st case,"The Brazilian man spent two weeks in northern Italy’s Lombardy region on a work trip, where he contracted the contagious virus, the health ministry said

Brazil’s government confirmed on Wednesday that a 61-year-old Brazilian man who travelled to Italy this month has Latin America’s first confirmed case of the contagious new coronavirus. “We will now see how this virus behaves in a tropical country in the middle of summer,” Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said.

The Brazilian man spent two weeks in northern Italy’s Lombardy region on a work trip, where he contracted the contagious virus, the health ministry said.

Authorities had already said Tuesday evening that a first laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus had a positive result, and were waiting for a second test to confirm.

Since the virus began to spread throughout the world from China, Brazil and other countries in the region have registered dozens of suspected cases, all of which previously had been discarded following tests.

According to the Health Ministry, the man began to show symptoms compatible with the illness, such as a dry cough, throat pain and flu symptoms. Lombardy is the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, and there have been hundreds of confirmed cases there as well as several deaths.

Sao Paulo’s Albert Einstein Institute, where the man received medical attention, carried out respiratory tests, and the Adolfo Lutz Institute in the same city carried out the subsequent test confirming the virus The man was in stable condition and in isolation at home in Sao Paulo.

Brazil’s national health agency Anvisa has been working to map all contact the man had with other people in the hospital, at home, and on the plane returning to Brazil. Yesterday Anvisa requested the flight manifest to investigate other possible cases.

Due to the spread of the virus worldwide, Brazil adopted the preventative measure of broadening its critieria for analysis of suspected cases on Monday. The Health Ministry had determined that people with fever and flu symptoms returning from Italy and six other countries should be considered suspected cases. Those countries are Germany, France, Australia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines.

The countries already on that watch list were China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/latin-america-reports-1st-case/article30925120.ece

Malaysia’s decades-old political rivals Mahathir Mohamad and Anwar Ibrahim set out claims to lead the Southeast Asian country on Wednesday after Mr. Mahathir’s shock resignation as Prime Minister sparked turmoil.

The struggle between Mr. Mahathir, 94, and Mr. Anwar, 72, who formed a surprise pact to win a 2018 election, has shaped Malaysian politics for more than two decades.

Also read: Editorial | Crisis in Malaysia

Mr. Mahathir proposed a unified administration without political party allegiances. “Politics and political parties need to be put aside for now,” Mr. Mahathir said. “I propose a government that is not aligned with any party, but only prioritises the interests of the country.”

Mr. Anwar later said he opposed forming a “backdoor government” and that three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition had proposed his name to the king as candidate for Prime Minister. “We wait for the decision of the king,” he told a news conference.

Mr. Anwar’s Parti Keadilan Rakyat has 39 seats and alliance partners could potentially give it another 62.

While some politicians have openly voiced support for Mr. Mahathir to stay in office, it was not clear whether enough of them would give him their backing.

A unity government cutting across party lines could give Mr. Mahathir greater authority than during a spell as PM from 1981 until his retirement in 2003. But the idea was rejected on Tuesday by an alliance of four parties, including the UMNO, which ruled Malaysia for six decades until being defeated by Mr. Mahathir’s coalition in 2018.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nugtlg/article30785166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHATHIRMOHAMAD-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysia-in-turmoil-as-mahathir-anwar-vie-for-power/article30925074.ece

16,2020/02/26,Sri Lanka notifies UN about rights resolution withdrawal,"We are committed to achieving sustainable peace: Minister

Sri Lanka on Wednesday formally notified the UN Human Right Council that it was withdrawing from the UN resolution on post-war accountability and reconciliation.

“I wish to place on record, Sri Lanka’s decision to withdraw from co-sponsorship of Resolution 40/1 on Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka,” Minister of Foreign Relations Dinesh Gunawardena said in Geneva. All the same, Sri Lanka was “committed” to achieving “sustainable peace and reconciliation”, through a process designed and executed domestically, the Minister assured.

However, Sri Lanka cannot pull out of the resolution until 2021, according to former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose unity government helmed by President Maithripala Sirisena co-sponsored the resolution. “We are co-sponsors till the end of the resolution, which is in 2021. You can’t just pull out. After 2021, you can decide whether you want to co-sponsor the next resolution or not,” Mr. Wickremesinghe told The Hindu in Bengaluru, on the side-lines of ‘The Huddle’, the newspaper’s recently-held annual thought conclave.

The UNHRC is yet to comment on the development.

Accusing the predecessor government of “violating all democratic principles of governance”, the Foreign Relations Minister on Wednesday told the Council that Sri Lanka co-sponsoring the resolution “remains to date a blot on the sovereignty and dignity of Sri Lanka”.

‘Pawn on chess board’

The commitments made bound the country to carry out an “impractical, unconstitutional and undeliverable” process, Mr. Gunawardena said, adding that they had made Sri Lanka “a pawn on the chess board of global politics”.

Mr. Gunawardena’s statement at the High-Level Segment at the ongoing UNHRC session follows President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s earlier announcements that Sri Lanka would not honour Colombo’s commitments to the Council. “We will always work with the UN, but I can’t recognise what they [UN] have signed with past governments,” Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the media during his campaign.

In 2015, six years after Sri Lanka’s bloody civil war ended, the UNHRC adopted a consensus resolution, asking Colombo to probe allegations of large-scale rights abuses. The resolution, which Sri Lanka co-sponsored, was at that time widely seen as a bold commitment to Sri Lankans and the international community.

Amid Tamil leaders’ growing concern over the pace at which Colombo implemented the resolution, Sri Lanka in 2017 sought an extension for two more years to fulfil its commitments. Last year, the Council approved giving another two years for Sri Lanka to take forward a credible probe into the alleged rights violations.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9e9de6/article30924950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Gunawardena,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-notifies-un-about-rights-resolution-withdrawal/article30924951.ece

19,2020/02/26,More new daily virus cases outside China than inside: WHO,"The U.N. put the number of new cases in China on Tuesday at 411 while those registered outside the country stood at 427

There are now more new cases of the COVID-19 reported each day outside China than inside the hardest-hit country, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.

“Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told diplomats in Geneva, according to a written version of his speech.

The U.N. health agency put the number of new cases in China at 411 on Tuesday and those registered outside the country stood at 427.

Governments worldwide are scrambling to prevent the spread of the new COVID-19 after a surge of infections in Italy, Iran and South Korea.

Mr. Tedros said the “sudden increase of cases” in those countries was “deeply concerning”, adding that a WHO team would travel to Iran this weekend to evaluate the situation.

Also Read All about the China coronavirus COVID-19

While new case numbers and deaths are dwindling at the disease epicentre in China, the country remains by far the hardest hit.

Mr. Tedros said that as of Wednesday morning, 78,190 cases of COVID-19 had been registered in China, including 2,718 deaths.

That compares with 2,790 cases and 44 deaths reported across 37 other countries.

But WHO has said the epidemic in China peaked and on February 2 and has been declining since.

Bruce Aylward, who headed a WHO-backed expert mission to China, hailed the drastic quarantine and containment measures taken by Beijing, saying the country had “changed the course” of the outbreak.

But he told reporters in Geneva that other nations were “simply not ready“.

In Wednesday’s speech, Mr. Tedros acknowledged that the hike in cases outside China had prompted a push for a pandemic to be declared.

“We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic,” he said, stressing that such a declaration could “signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true.”

“We are in a fight that can be won if we do the right things.”

But he insisted that WHO would not hesitate to declare a pandemic “if it is an accurate description of the situation.”

“I am not downplaying the seriousness of the situation, or the potential for this to become a pandemic, because it has that potential,” he said. “All countries, whether they have cases or not, must prepare for a potential pandemic.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v9us3/article30923575.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWITZERLAND-HEALTH-EPIDEMIC-WHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/more-new-daily-virus-cases-outside-china-than-inside-who/article30923576.ece
20,2020/02/26,"Coronavirus, U.S.-EU trade war, Gulf tension biggest threats to global economy: EIU","According to a whitepaper released by The Economist Intelligence Unit (The EIU), global growth is forecast to be 2.9% in 2020, close to decade lows.

The growth outlook for 2020 appears bleak, The Economist Intelligence Unit said on Wednesday and cited coronavirus, the U.S.-EU trade war, and the U.S.-Iran conflict as the biggest threats to the global economy.

According to a whitepaper released by The Economist Intelligence Unit (The EIU), global growth is forecast to be 2.9% in 2020, close to decade lows.

The EIU expects economic growth in the developed world to slow in 2020, driven by a moderation in the U.S. growth. While, the emergence of a novel coronavirus in China will dampen Asia’s growth perspectives.

The report titled the “Top five risks to the global economy in 2020” further noted that the social unrest seen across the world in 2019 looks set to continue in 2020 and will challenge both policy-makers and business models.

The EIU jotted down top five risks and their respective likelihood on the global economy, in which the U.S.-Iran conflict leading to a spike in global oil prices and trade war between the US and the EU topped the chart with 25%.

Other major risks to the global economy include coronavirus, debt burdens causing a recess across emerging markets and Hong Kong protests causing an exodus from Asia’s biggest financial centre.

The EIU said the trade truce between the U.S. and China remains “fragile”, and a flare-up in tensions between the world’s two economic superpowers cannot be excluded.

According to Agathe Demarais, the EIU’s Global Forecasting Director, the risk of an unintended slide into an escalating military conflict between the U.S. and Iran cannot be ruled out.

On coronavirus, the report said that its impact is set to be more profound than that of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), owing to the much larger role that China plays in the global economy.

The EIU expects a 20% probability that the virus will not be contained in China until mid-2020, and a 5% chance that it will remain uncontained beyond 2020.

Disruption of international trade would become entrenched as supply chains are diverted from China with some countries possibly placing heavy restrictions on bilateral trade, it noted.

Moreover, a growing number of international exporters would experience financial distress, as a persistent shortfall in Chinese demand depresses commodity prices and export revenues.

“Taking into account the direct impact of weaker demand in China, as well as potential economic disruption in other countries should the coronavirus outbreak spread further globally, our forecast for global real GDP growth could dip below 2.5% this year,” The EIU noted.

On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global health emergency.

21,2020/02/26,Egypt holds full-honours military funeral for Mubarak,"Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that swept much of the region

Egypt was holding a full-honours military funeral on Wednesday for the country’s former autocratic President Hosni Mubarak, who was for decades the face of stability in the Middle East but was ousted from power in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that swept much of the region.

A few dozen Mubarak supporters, clad in black and carrying posters of the former President, had gathered since morning hours at a mosque complex in an eastern New Cairo neighborhood, where Mr. Mubarak’s body was brought for the funeral service.

Military pallbearers carried Mr. Mubarak’s casket wrapped in the Egyptian flag into the mosque for prayers. Outside the sprawling mosque, a military phalanx waited to receive his coffin for burial.

The 91-year-old Mr. Mubarak died on Tuesday at a Cairo military hospital from heart and kidney complications.. He was admitted to hospital on January 21 with intestinal obstruction and underwent surgery, after which he was treated in intensive care.

To the outside world, Mr. Mubarak the strongman symbolised so much of Egypt’s modern history but his rule of nearly 30 years ended after hundreds of thousands of young Egyptians rallied for 18 days of unprecedented street protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and elsewhere in 2011, forcing him to step down.

Perhaps ironically, Mr. Mubarak’s funeral service was held at the Tantawi Mosque in eastern Cairo, named for now retired Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, who headed the military council that ran Egypt following Mr. Mubarak's ouster and until the election of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2012.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi attended the service, which was to be followed later in the day by burial at the cemetery in Heliopolis, an upscale Cairo district that was Mr. Mubarak’s home for most of his rule and where he lived until his death.

Pakistan on Wednesday summoned a senior Indian diplomat to protest against alleged ceasefire violations by Indian troops along the Line of Control in Kashmir.

The Foreign Office claimed that a 40-year-old civilian sustained serious injuries in the ceasefire violations by Indian troops in Nezapir Sector on Tuesday.

“This escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1,970 ceasefire violations,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.

“The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation,” it said, but did not identify the Indian diplomat.

Pakistan urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 Ceasefire arrangement; investigate these and other incidents of ceasefire violations; instruct the Indian forces to respect the ceasefire, in letter and spirit; and maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary.

India should permit UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions, it said.

23,2020/02/26,"Harvard’s ‘expansive use of race’ in admission violates civil rights law, Trump administration tells U.S. Supreme Court","Harvard’s admissions officers tended to evaluate Asian-Americans as compared to members of other racial groups as having less integrity, being less confident, constituting less-qualified leaders and so on: U.S. amicus brief

The “expansive use of race” in the admission process of the prestigious Harvard University violates the civil rights law, the Trump administration has told the U.S. Supreme Court as the Justice Department continues its probe into the allegations that the Ivy League college discriminated against Asian-Americans.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2017 launched an investigation into Harvard’s admission process after a complaint of discrimination was filed by more than 60 Asian-American organisations.

Indian-Americans feel that they get discriminated by the Massachusetts-based university under its current admission policy. The investigation remains under way.

Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division said that race discrimination hurts people and is never benign after the DOJ on Monday filed an amicus brief in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. versus President and Fellows of Harvard College.

In its amicus brief, the U.S. explains that Harvard’s expansive use of race in its admissions process violates federal civil-rights law and Supreme Court precedent.

Also read | Searching for veritas at Harvard

“Unconstitutionally partitioning Americans into racial and ethnic blocs harms all involved by fostering stereotypes, bitterness and division among the American people. The Department of Justice will continue to fight against illegal race discrimination,” Dreiband said.

As a condition of receiving millions of dollars in taxpayer funding every year, Harvard expressly agrees to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, a cornerstone civil-rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, colour or national origin in programmes and activities that receive federal financial assistance, the DOJ said.

In this case, Students for Fair Admissions, an organisation of students and parents, alleged that Harvard College intentionally discriminates against Asian-American applicants when making admissions decisions. The district judge denied Harvard’s various attempts to dismiss the lawsuit, and the case proceeded to a three-week trial in 2018.

Although the Supreme Court has held that colleges receiving federal funds may consider applicants’ race in certain limited circumstances, the district court’s factual findings demonstrated that Harvard’s use of race is anything but limited.

Also read | Affirmative action at the crossroads

The district court concluded that “more than one third of the admitted Hispanics and more than half of the admitted African-Americans, would most likely not be admitted in the absence of Harvard’s race-conscious admissions process”.

And these race-based bonuses come at a significant cost to Asian-American applicants, who collectively suffer a substantial penalty under Harvard’s race-based admission regime.

Nevertheless, the district court concluded that Harvard’s use of race in the admission process did not violate federal law or Supreme Court precedent, the DOJ said in a statement.

The U.S.’ amicus brief explains the evidence at trial showed “that Harvard actively engages in racial balancing that Supreme Court precedent flatly forbids”. The evidence also demonstrated that Harvard’s admission officers consistently score Asian-American applicants lower on the so-called “personal rating“.

“In other words, Harvard’s admissions officers tended to evaluate Asian-Americans as compared to members of other racial groups as having less integrity, being less confident, constituting less-qualified leaders and so on.

“That disparity is undisputed and explained,” the brief points out.

For these and other reasons, the US urged the appellate court to reverse the district court’s judgment.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/35gu9h/article30920524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARVARDUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/harvards-expansive-use-of-race-in-admission-violates-civil-rights-law-trump-administration-tells-us-supreme-court/article30920525.ece
24,2020/02/26,"Weinstein upbeat at Manhattan hospital after sex crimes conviction, lawyer says","One of his lawyers said he was “not a picture of health by any stretch of the imagination.”

Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was in good spirits on Tuesday, as he accepted visitors while under police guard at a Manhattan hospital, his lawyer said, despite having been convicted a day earlier of sexual assault and rape.

Weinstein had been expected to move to New York City's notorious Rikers Island jail complex following the verdict, but was admitted late Monday night to Bellevue Hospital a few miles away.

One of his lawyers, Arthur Aidala, told reporters after meeting with Weinstein that his 67-year-old client “looked like he was in good shape” but was “not a picture of health by any stretch of the imagination,” and doctors would decide when to release him.

“He was upbeat,” though “obviously he prefers being in his own house,” Aidala said.

Media reports said Weinstein had experienced chest pain or heart palpitations before being admitted to Bellevue, a public hospital.

Aidala said Weinstein was “somewhat flabbergasted by the verdict” and “cautiously optimistic” about his eventual appeal. ”I almost feel emboldened by Mr. Weinstein's spirits and his desire to continue to fight these charges,” Aidala added.

Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.

Jurors acquitted Weinstein on the two top charges, predatory sexual assault, which carried a maximum life sentence.

Those counts required jurors to consider accusations by the actress Annabella Sciorra, who testified that Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s.

The actress Ellen Barkin, a friend of Sciorra, tweeted on Tuesday: “Convicted rapist harvey weinstein is still not in jail. He is in a private suite in Bellevue hospital. This is not what the jury had in mind.”

Milestone for #Metoo

Weinstein's guilty verdict was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which was fueled by his case starting in late 2017.

The movement inspired women to accuse hundreds of powerful men – in entertainment, business, media, politics and other fields – of sexual misconduct.

Weinstein faces up to 29 years in prison, and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 11.

Aidala said he may seek an earlier sentencing date so Weinstein can appeal sooner. New York law requires a defendant to be sentenced first, he said.

He quoted Weinstein as saying after the verdict: “I'm innocent. I'm innocent. How can this happen in America?”

More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He has denied the accusations, and said any sexual encounters were consensual.

Weinstein was a key force behind acclaimed films such as “The English Patient” and “Shakespeare in Love,” which both won Oscars for best picture.

He had been free on bail during the trial, and on Monday morning ate breakfast with his lawyers at an upscale hotel.

Health issues

Weinstein, however, lost that freedom when the trial judge, Justice James Burke of state Supreme Court in Manhattan, ordered he be jailed following the conviction. Court officers led him away in handcuffs.

Aidala said Weinstein was not being handcuffed at Bellevue.

Weinstein was admitted to a unit that provides medical care for inmates.

A spokesman said earlier on Tuesday that Weinstein suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure.

During the trial, the former producer appeared frail and used a walker.

The Rikers Island jail complex, whose main building went up in 1932, has long been plagued by violence and neglect. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed in 2017 to close it within a decade.

Jail officials could place Weinstein in a private or semi-private cell to help ensure his safety.

Weinstein also faces several felony charges in Los Angeles in connection with his alleged sexual assaults against two women in 2013.

25,2020/02/26,U.S. NSA says Indians have friends in America and White House,"Major American newspapers prominently reported about the visit.

U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien has thanked the people of India who came out in support of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania during their visit to the country, saying they have friends in America and the White House.

The president was accompanied by a high-powered delegation comprising senior Trump administration officials including NSA O’Brien during his maiden official visit to India from February 24 to 25. They visited Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi before leaving for Washington on Tuesday.

The U.S. NSA, on his way back to the U.S., thanked the people of India for their support.

“Thanks to all the people of India that came out to support President Trump and the First Lady, Melania Trump, and the US delegation, affirming their friendship and partnership far into the future,” Mr. O’Brien said in a tweet.

“You have friends in the USA and in the White House,” the NSA said.

Separately, the White House in a tweet thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India for their incredible hospitality.

The White House in a tweet said that President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked at length about the India-Pakistan relationship.

The Foreign Policy magazine said that Mr. Trump left New Delhi without delivering on an “incredible” trade deal despite years of high-level negotiations.

“As Washington is discovering, it is not easy dealing with a country led by a populist leader with a strong mandate and a proclivity towards protectionism. Despite those hurdles, the broader trendlines in the U.S.-India relationship continue to seem robust, as shown by the visit itself,” the magazine said.

Major American newspapers prominently reported about the visit.

“As he completed his two-day stay, Mr. Trump focused only on the positive, offering validation of Mr. Modi as a champion of religious liberty even as the Indian government has adopted Hindu-first policies targeting Muslims,” The New York Times said.

“The president publicly accepted Mr. Modi’s word that he treats the 1.3 billion people in his diverse country fairly without regard to faith and made no mention of the months of protests by those who think otherwise.

“The president stressed the strength of his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in meetings long on symbolism and short on concrete agreements,” The NYT reported.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump’s diplomatic drop-in was as intense as it was brief, with his hosts providing expansive red-carpet treatment that the president used to celebrate the most politically favourable stretch of his presidency.

The daily said Mr. Trump’s momentum was greeted in India on Monday by a splashy, two-day display that combined Prime Minister Modi’s political power with the vibrant sights, sounds and spices of his nation’s culture.

In an op-ed on Fox News, James Jay Carafano said that there is a bipartisan character to U.S.-India relations in both countries. This is more than just two charismatic leaders and the offer of free hats pulling in a crowd.

“The U.S. and India have forged something new and unprecedented. We are not old-fashioned treaty allies, but we are way more than just friends. This is a vital strategic partnership. We know that from the most distant Pacific Island to the Middle East we have each other’s back. This is a new geostrategic reality in the world,” he wrote.

In a news report, USA Today said that Mr. Trump defended Mr. Modi’s government, saying it “worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom,” though critics say the law discriminates against Muslims.

Mr. Trump used the visit to highlight accomplishments on defence cooperation and strengthening ties between the two countries, The Hill Newspaper said.

“He celebrated U.S.-India relations and his bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as the Indian leader’s Hindu nationalist party came under further scrutiny for its controversial citizenship law during Trump’s visit,” it said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8578fx/article30919919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBRIEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-nsa-says-indians-have-friends-in-america-and-white-house/article30919920.ece

Iran's deputy health minister and a member of parliament have tested positive for the coronavirus as the death toll inside the country rose to 16 and Iranians worried that authorities could be underestimating the scale of outbreak.

Iran has the highest number of coronavirus deaths outside China, where the virus emerged in December and more than 2,600 have died.

“My corona test is positive ... I don't have a lot of hope of continuing life in this world,” Mahmoud Sadeghi, the parliamentarian from Tehran, wrote on Twitter.

Also among the infected was the deputy health minister, who posted a video online announcing his infection which was shown on state media.

“Among those who had been suspected of the virus, 35 (new cases) have been confirmed and two died of the coronavirus infection,” said Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur. He said 95 people had been infected across Iran. Jahanpur put the death toll at 15, but the state news agency later said one person infected by the virus had died in the city of Saveh. Some unconfirmed reports gave a higher death toll.

The outbreak in Iran has coincided with mounting U.S. pressure on Iran's clerical rulers that has hit the economy hard. In 2018, the United States exited Tehran's nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions.

Worried that official numbers could underestimate the scale of Iran's outbreak, many Iranians took to social media to accuse authorities of concealing facts.

Popular anger has been high for months over the handling of a Ukrainian passenger plane crash in January, which the military took three days to admit was caused by an Iranian missile fired in error.

The incident revived anti-government protests that rocked the country in November against a hike in fuel prices, which swiftly turned political with calls for Iran's rulers to step down, before authorities cracked down.

The head of the Medical Science University in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom, Mohammad Reza Ghadir, expressed concern over “the spread of those people infected by the virus across the city”, adding the Health Ministry had banned releasing figures linked to the coronavirus.

“Stay at home”

Authorities ordered the nationwide cancellation of concerts and soccer matches and the closure of schools and universities in many provinces, and have urged Iranians to stay home.

Iran said on Monday 900 cases were suspected, dismissing claims by a lawmaker from Qom who said 50 people had died in the city, the epicentre of the new coronavirus outbreak.

“It is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through ... this virus,” said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a televised speech.

Iran, which confirmed its first two deaths last week in Qom, has yet to say how many people it has quarantined, but the semi-official Mehr news agency said 320 people had been hospitalised.

The virus outbreak threatens to isolate Iran further, with several countries suspending flights after coronavirus cases in travellers from Iran were confirmed in Canada, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Some neighbouring countries closed their borders. United Arab Emirates state media said Dubai airport had suspended all flights to and from Iran.

Oman's Khasab port is suspending the import and export of goods to and from Iran from Wednesday, operator Marafi said on Twitter.

Six Arab countries reported their first cases, with those infected all having links to Iran. Kuwait said on Tuesday the number of infected people there had risen to eight.

China on February 26 reported 52 new coronavirus deaths, the lowest figure in more than three weeks, bringing the death toll to 2,715.

All the new deaths were in the outbreak epicentre Hubei province, which accounted for 401 of the 406 new infections reported Wednesday, the National Health Commission said.

The number of fresh cases has declined in China, with multiple provinces reporting zero new infections in recent days. Only five cases were reported outside the epicentre, the lowest in over a month.

But the disease, which originated in Hubei's capital Wuhan late last year and has infected over 78,000 in China, has now reached dozens of countries.

South Korea's death toll rose to 11 on Wednesday, as the country's total number of infections rose to 1,146, by far the largest outside of China.

Italy — which has reported 10 deaths and more than 300 cases — has locked down 11 towns. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said the measures could last weeks.

While Beijing's containment efforts initially focused on monitoring and restricting travel within the country, concern is growing that cases abroad could reintroduce new outbreaks into China.

32,2020/02/26,"Users would be willing to share their bank balance details with Facebook for $8.44 a month, finds study","The study is the first that attempts to quantify the value of online privacy and data.

German Facebook users would want the social media platform to pay them about $8 per month for sharing their contact information, while U.S. users would only seek $3.50, according to a study of how people in various countries value their private information.

The study by U.S.-based think tank the Technology Policy Institute (TPI) is the first that attempts to quantify the value of online privacy and data. It assessed how much privacy is worth in six countries by looking at the habits of people in the United States, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Columbia and Argentina.

It addresses growing concern about how companies from technology platforms to retailers have been collecting and monetising personal data. U.S. regulators have imposed hefty fines on Facebook Inc and Alphabet-owned Google's YouTube unit for privacy violations.

“Differences in how much people value privacy of different data types across countries suggests that people in some places may prefer weaker rules while people in other places might prefer stronger rules,” Scott Wallsten, president and senior fellow at TPI told Reuters.

“Quantifying the value of privacy is necessary for conducting any analysis of proposed privacy policies,” he said.

The study found Germans want to be paid more for letting technology platforms share their personal data with third-parties followed by U.S. consumers.

People across the board place the highest value on financial information such as bank balance and biometric information such as fingerprint data in particular, and consider location data the least valuable, the study found.

A technology platform, on average, across all people the study assessed, would have to pay consumers a monthly $8.44 to share their bank balance information, $7.56 to share fingerprint information, $6.05 to read an individual's texts, and $5.80 to share information on cash withdrawals.

By contrast, people wanted to be paid only $1.82 per month to share location data and nothing to be sent advertisements via text messages.

The study found Latin American consumers have a preference for seeing advertisements on their smartphone, in contrast to U.S. residents and Germans.

33,2020/02/26,Robert Iger steps down as Walt Disney's CEO,"Iger will assume the post of executive chairman and direct the company's “creative endeavors” until his contract ends

Walt Disney's Robert Iger will step down as chief executive officer, handing the reins to Disney Parks head Bob Chapek, the company said on Tuesday, ending years of speculation on who will take over Hollywood's most powerful studio.

“Iger is still keeping a significant role at the company. He will assume the post of executive chairman and direct the company's “creative endeavors” until his contract ends on December 31, 2021,” Disney said.

“The company has gotten larger and more complex just in the recent 12 months,” Iger said on a conference call on Tuesday, citing its purchase of 21st Century Fox and launch of direct-to-consumer services such as Disney+ last year.

“I felt that, with the asset bases in place and with our strategy deployed I should be spending as much time as possible on the creative side of our business.”

Chapek, who will be the seventh CEO in the company's nearly 100-year history, has most recently served as the chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Chapek will be reporting to Iger.

Analysts on the call, as well as two former employees Reuters interviewed, questioned if Chapek had sufficient experience in the entertainment business. The former employees expressed surprise that Kevin Mayer, chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and International, was not named to the top job, especially after the roll-out of the Disney+ streaming service, which attracted 10 million sign-ups in its first day.

In Chapek's new role, which is effective immediately, the company said he will directly oversee all of Disney's business segments and corporate functions.

As chairman of Disney theme parks division, Chapek oversaw Disney's largest business segment, including the opening of Disney's first theme park and resort in mainland China and the creation of the new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. He joined Disney in 1993.

“Chapek did a great job of growing the home entertainment business and built consumer products at Disney,” said Michael Wolf, founder of Activate, a technology and strategy consulting firm. “Bob is one of the best managers in the entertainment business. And not a lot of people know about him.”

Iger, who has been the CEO since 2005, built up the Disney brand through a series of acquisitions, including animation studio Pixar in 2006, Marvel in 2009, and “Star Wars” franchise owner Lucasfilm in 2012. His biggest bet was the purchase of 21st Century Fox, a deal that was instrumental in launching Disney+.

Disney-owned streaming service Hotstar India has taken down the latest episode of John Oliver's show, Last Week Tonight, which criticises Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and RSS.

In the Emmy-winning satire, Mr. Oliver examines PM Modi's journey from being denied an American visa after the Gujarat riots in 2002 to hosting American President Donald Trump in his home state of Gujarat. After blocking the episode, Hotstar has been unavailable for comment. The episode, however, is streaming on YouTube for free.

In the episode, Mr. Oliver highlighted the widespread protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and criticised Mr. Trump calling Mr. Modi ""the father of India"", given that Mahatma Gandhi has often been referred to as that. ""Calling Modi the father of India is stupid at best, and dangerous at worst,"" said Mr. Oliver.

35,2020/02/26,Meet Kochi’s Kashmiris,"The city’s 400-strong Kashmiri community just celebrated its first local wedding in three decades. We meet them over noon chai...

A lilting, unfamiliar, melody, accompanied by vigorous clapping and beats of the tumbakanari, float from an apartment in Pattalam, Fort Kochi.

Inside, Janat Altaf waits for the freshly applied henna on her hands to dry. Clustering around her are women dressed in loose salwar kameez with their heads covered as they sing of a grandmother’s blessing.

This is Janat’s pre-wedding mehndi ceremony. This is also the first traditional wedding in over three decades in the 400-strong Kashmiri community, which lives mainly in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry.

“So far we have all gone home to get married but as there is turmoil in the Valley we performed the nikaah here,” says Syeed Altaf, the bride’s father. “My daughter’s wedding is the first to take place in our community here. Peer Humza, the groom, is my friend Shaukat Peer’s son. They too live here. The nikaah was at Ansar masjid in Chullikal.”

Syeed says he had hoped to invite a Kashmiri cook to make the traditional wazwan, but instead the women rallied, cooking up a fragrant feast of mash kabab, aab gosht and zafran chai.

The songs and the food are a reminder of a home 2,500 kilometres away.

Although the Kashmiri community in Kochi is small, they are an integral part of Kochi’s multi-cultural fabric. Khurshid A Geelani, who runs three charming handicraft stores in the city, came to Kochi in 1987.

He says the city started opening up to tourists in 1992. “You could say Kashmiri traders follow the tourists. Wherever there is tourism potential, you will find Kashmiris arriving,” he says.

Though the Kashmiri flow into Kochi really began in 1993, when Gulshan Khatai, a revered name in the community, established a landmark store on MG Road retailing carpets, walnut wood furniture and pashmina shawls. The poet-businessman was the face of the community until he passed away in 2015. The trend he began continued. By the 2000s, the city had become a popular destination for tourists: Fort Kochi and Mattancherry saw Kashmiri handicraft stores open year after year, each bringing a different style of business.

Sajid Khatai, president, Kashmiri Traders Association, explains the migration differently. “The exodus began when militancy shot up in the Valley and tourists stopped coming there. We had to come out for our bread and butter,” he says. As most of the community is into retail of handicrafts, Sajid states that they are well known for their salesmanship. “It is commonly said that we can sell a comb to a bald man too,” he says with a loud laugh.

The Kashmiri Malayalis

“Though we are an orthodox community, we have integrated with the locals to some extent. A few of our men have married Malayali women. Our children speak Kashmiri at home and Malayalam with their friends,” says Sajid, whose daughters study in Kochi. His wife Rasiya works at the J&K Bank in Kochi.

Syed Reza Shah Madni, who is visiting from Srinagar, also has strong ties with Kerala. The first Kashmiri to come to Kerala as a student in 1958, the 80-year-old was here to attend the reunion of his batch from College of Engineering, Trivandrum.

“I have been coming for the reunion regularly since 2008,” says Madni, who was one of the two students from the State to be selected for the course. “It was a completely new world for us. We had heard of Madras but anything beyond was unknown. It took five days and five nights to reach, but our Principal Dr Keshava Rao organised everything.”

After Madni arrived in Thiruvananthapuram, he says many students followed. The first two girls to come were Krishna Dhar and Basanti Zutshi. “With them, we formed a Kashmiri Student’s Association,” he says, recalling his first experience of eating rice and curry off a banana leaf in the hostel mess.

For Krishna Dhar Bhan, Kochi became home serendipitously. Married to a Naval officer who was posted here, Krishna ran a dental clinic in Panampilly Nagar for many years before she retired. At 80, she looks back on her two worlds.

“Back in 1960, my father had to hide the fact that he was sending me to Kerala to study Dentistry from my relatives. He was a doctor and a progressive man, so he sent me so far away.” In 2017, when she last visited trouble-torn Kashmir, she says she visited her house on Gupkaar Road, now occupied by the military who let her in. She says she broke down in the office of the station commander, which used to be her bedroom. “They welcomed us. It was very moving to be in my house after all those years. I sat on my balcony and saw the mountains, clouds and chinar tree. Kochi is home; it has given me everything. But my roots are in Kashmir,” she says.

Tanveer Phumboo and Ashrat Mir have diversified, if only slightly, from the handicrafts business. Their three stores wear a distinctive look, unlike the Kashmiri shops and showrooms, as they deal with block printing and cotton fabrics.

“We entered fashion consciously. There’s a glut in the handicrafts market and also the dangers of fake products,” says Phumboo. Mir conducts block printing classes at the store and teaches tourists to print on T-shirts, which they take back as souvenirs. “It’s caught on well,” says Mir. For them, the most important Kashmiri thing to do is to have noon chai, a salty tea brew. “Our day begins with that. Sipping noon chai is our strongest connect with home.”

Phumboo points out that, over the last decade, entire families have moved to Kochi. “Earlier only the men came on work. Now we bring our parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts....You see them and meet them around here.” It is one such interesting meeting that Krishna Bhans’s daughter Ashima recently had on Princess Street, lined with Kashmiri shops. Growing up in Kochi, Ashima says, she is unconnected with the ground realities of Kashmir. But when she met Ashrat Mir, accidentally on the road, she felt she needed to go deeper into their history.

“I told him about my ancestral house at Gupkar Road in Srinagar and of my father’s at Habba Kadal. He told me the exact histories of these places,” she says, adding “It felt strange that the two of us were discussing our roots in a land so far away; it was an unreal bonding.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/xcdbax/article30922003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPKASHMIRITRADERS,https://www.thehindu.com/society/meet-kochis-kashmiris/article30922007.ece
36,2020/02/26,Tune in to the sound of the sea,"At this bustling seaside town, Kadal Osai, India’s first FM channel by and for fisherfolk, is creating waves with its shows on marine conservation and everyday life

“Appa, I hope you’re listening. I wish you get plenty of fish today.”

“Stay safe, appa. Don’t forget to wear your life-jacket.”

M Saleas, a radio jockey with Kadal Osai FM 90.4, is used to such lines spoken by fishermen’s children on her evening show. She invites a child a day to the studio and they interact with her, share jokes and experiences from their lives. Fun for the most part, there are days the show ends with long pauses, punctuated by a pleading voice. Like when 13-year-old M Subiksha requested her father to stop drinking, and spend more time with her. “He actually did,” recalls Saleas. This is among the Rameswaram-based FM channel’s numerous little joys. With several shows tailored for the fisherfolk, the community radio station’s core philosophy is to contribute for the betterment of the sea and her people.

Started by Pamban-based Armstrong Fernando, who is from the fishing community himself, the FM channel is the first of its kind in the country. “We are by and for the fishing community,” says the 43-year-old, the station director. With a state-of-the-art studio in Pamban town on Rameswaram island, the channel was launched in August 2016 and is 16-members strong. The RJs, who also double up as reporters, are all from the fishing community.

Kadal Osai (meaning ‘sound of the sea’) offers infotainment in a format that seamlessly merges with the lifestyle and ethos of its audience. “We cannot be too preachy,” notes station head Gayathri Usman. “But we slip in important messages wherever possible in subtle ways.” Their day kick-starts with the weather report, for weather dictates a fisherman’s schedule. “We share the weather report every hour actually,” adds Armstrong.

Their morning show Kadal Osai Thandora shares fish prices from sellers, diesel rates, and employment news pertaining to openings in the Indian Navy and Coast Guard. Reporters get the information directly from the field, fresh with the sound of waves in the background. Their 9am to noon game-show is popular, where RJs involve fishermen in some friendly banter. Fishermen get an opportunity to talk about themselves and share a few laughs. “We’ve had them reading out their poetry on the show,” says Gayathri.

The show Samudhiram Pazhagu has marine conservation at its core. They talk about sustainable fishing practices, importance of keeping our sea plastic-free, help local women making craft items out of shells market their products better, fishing craft of the past that were kind to Nature... “On one show, I told fishermen how important Olive Ridley turtles were for our eco-system,” says radio jockey Lenin Raj. “The turtles feed on jelly fish, which eat up fish eggs,” he adds. “I explained to them that by releasing turtles that get caught in their nets, they are keeping the numbers of jelly fish in check.”

A fisherman himself, Lenin is an Engineering graduate. “I enjoy my job,” he says. “I spend most part of my day interacting with fishermen. But if I were fishing, my interactions would have been limited to people in just one boat.” The 27-year-old says that his knowledge about the community helps him pose nuanced questions to his interviewees. “It is heartening when they actually listen to me when I encourage them to bring back to land plastic bags in which they take groceries for their fishing expeditions.”

The content for some of their shows, Gayathri says, comes from organisations such as the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Marine Police, and MS Swaminathan Research Foundation.

Right now, Kadal Osai’s transmission range is a little over 10 kilometres. “We do reach places 20 kilometres away on occasions,” says Armstrong adding that they hope that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting provides them more wattage allowance. “Ultimately, we want to reach more people,” he adds. “When cyclone Gaja loomed over Tamil Nadu, we swung into action, announcing the news to our people. As a result, not one life was lost in our region.”

Change is evident. Lenin says that he was thrilled to see videos his fellow fishermen shared of them releasing Olive Ridleys caught in their nets. This is the best thing about community radio; there is instant feedback and criticism. And some delicious crab curry, if they are lucky.

“We’ve had our listeners cook us a portion of their day’s catch and bring it to our office,” says Armstrong. For the fisherfolk of Pamban, or any region for that matter, offering a portion of their catch to someone is a precious expression of love. “This happens a lot of times,” adds Armstrong. “They come straight to our studio from the sea.”

39,2020/02/26,‘Auto firms must manage supply chains better’,"Industry must plan for risk, says TKM’s Vikram Kirloskar

Automobile industry has to manage supply chains better in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak in China, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) vice-chairman Vikram Kirloskar, who is also CII president, said on Wednesday.

“We have to learn how to manage our supply chains, and plan for risk to supply chains,” he said in a brief interaction at the national launch of Toyota’s Vellfire luxury, self-charging hybrid MPV here.

On the impact on component supplies from China for the Indian auto industry, he said “some impact will be there, [but] I understand factories in China have already started [again],” he said.

It, however, was not the first time the automobile industry was facing such a challenge. “We have gone through this kind of situation… there was a fire in a factory in Japan in 1995, affecting production. We had Thai floods which affected us badly. Then, we had Japanese tsunami which also affected us,” he said.

On the how was automobile industry’s prospects expected to do this year, he said it was expected to stabilise on the completion of transition to vehicles conforming to BS VI emission norms. “It is stabilising,” he said, adding the bigger challenge was on account of the bank NPAs and NBFC issues. “We will get over this hump,” he said, adding the ease of doing business measures and GST were working well.

On the BS VI transition, TKM senior vice-president Naveen Soni said TKM began the process of curtailing production of BS IV vehicles from September and from January end, was only making BS VI vehicles. Toyota customers are also preferring BS VI vehicles, as was evident from the one-month waiting period for Innova and Fortuner, he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/auto-firms-must-manage-supply-chains-better/article30925230.ece
40,2020/02/26,Toyota drives in Vellfire at ₹79.5 lakh,"Vehicle can run 40% of distance at zero emission

Japanese automotive major Toyota which, in India, operates through a joint venture with Kirloskar, has unveiled the Vellfire, a self-charging, hybrid electric, luxury multi-purpose vehicle, priced at ₹79.5 lakh ex-showroom.

Toyota, which has sold six lakh units globally, seems to have struck a chord with customers for the MPV too in India with senior vice-president of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) Naveen Soni saying the first three shipments of Vellfire, totalling 180 units, had already been sold out.

Of the bookings, Hyderabad accounted for 20%, he said at the national launch of the vehicle here on Wednesday. The Vellfire is imported from Japan as a CBU (completely built unit), and three shipments will arrive, one each a month, till April.

Describing India as a market with big potential for such luxury vehicles, TKM MD Masakazu Yoshimura said the Japanese parent had not made any allocation of Vellfire for the Indian market. Without sharing the specifics, he said Toyota, which globally has a caravan of luxury offerings, has lined up more products for India.

TKM vice-chairman Vikram Kirloskar said customers in India had been looking forward to the Vellfire roll-out for some years now.

Targeted at the ultra-rich, Vellfire is powered by a 2.5-litre 4-cylinder gasoline hybrid engine that offers 86 kW (115 BHP) power and a max torque of 198 Nm @2800-4000 rpm. It is rated for a fuel efficiency of 16.35 km/litre.

The engine is also coupled with two electric motors and a hybrid battery. Studies have shown that strong hybrid vehicles like Vellfire are capable of running 40% per cent of distance and 60% per cent of time on electric or zero emission mode with the engine off.

Investors can now directly purchase or redeem mutual fund (MF) units using the stock exchange platform, a facility that was hitherto only available to distributors or investment advisers.

In a circular issued on Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) extended the facility to all mutual fund investors.

“In order to further increase the reach of this platform, it has been decided to allow investors to directly access infrastructure of the recognised stock exchanges to purchase and redeem mutual fund units directly from mutual fund/asset management companies,” stated the circular.

In 2013, the capital market regulator had allowed mutual fund distributors to use the stock exchange mechanism to purchase or redeem mutual fund units on behalf of thier clients.

Thereafter, SEBI Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) were permitted a similar facility in 2016.

43,2020/02/26,Daimler India eyes new sectors to de-risk business,"Defence, off-highway vehicles on the company’s radar

Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Pvt. Ltd. (DICV), a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler AG, will focus on new sectors such off-highway vehicles, defence and freight aggregation to de-risk its business, said a top executive.

“Apart from making buses and trucks, we have started studying the possibility of making engines for off-highway vehicles. It fits very well into our offerings,” said Satyakam Arya, managing director and chief executive officer, DICV.

Stating they had started the feasibility study by interacting with customers on their requirements, he said the company looked to zero-in upon earth moving machines such as dumpers and loaders. Commercial vehicles business was cyclical and hence, DICV had to look at other business avenues, he added.

While DICV had almost exhausted its BS IV inventories in India, it would be offering BS III and BS IV range of engines for off-highway customers. Besides,it has also started eyeing the defence sector to offer its 4X4 trucks.

“Currently, foreign companies are not allowed to participate in the tenders due to certain restrictions imposed by the Centre. We are seeking some relaxations or changes in the law. We expect the Centre to come out with fresh regulations by April 2020,” he said.

Mr. Arya said that they were also looking at entering the fast-growing freight aggregator space, which had many players. DICV had initiated talks with some existing players while studying other geographies, too.

Regarding the impact of COVID-19, he said Daimler had large manufacturing plants in China that were currently partially working. It was also closely tracking supplies.

For the year ended 2019, DICV recorded a drop of 36% in its domestic truck sales to 14,474 units against 22,532 units. It was in line with the 35% drop in industry sales volume.

Mr. Arya said the drop in truck business in the first half was 15% and in the second half it was 54%. It was mainly due to new axle norms, liquidity crunch, GST, BS IV inventory corrections and economic slowdown.

On exports, he said DICV had sold 8,000 units against 7,000 units, to more than 50 countries.

Thomas Fricke, managing director, Daimler Buses India, said that the unit posted a 11% rise in domestic sales, 12.5% rise in revenue and 56% increase in exports. “The long term outlook for buses remains positive and we are set to grow 5% annually,” he said.

Mr. Arya said that DICV expected to steadily grow its domestic and export business in 2020 with the an all-new product portfolio premiered in January.

“During 2019, domestic truck sales were down. However, DICV remained in the black by managing costs and increasing exports. It would take at least a year for the commercial vehicles business to come out of the economic slowdown,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rr54ev/article30925193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DaimlerSatyakam-Arya-MD-and-CEO-DICV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/daimler-india-eyes-new-sectors-to-de-risk-business/article30925194.ece

45,2020/02/26,Q3 GDP to grow at 4.5%: SBI,"Lender raises FY20 estimate to 4.7% from 4.6%

The GDP growth for the October-December quarter is estimated to be 4.5%, according to a State Bank of India (SBI) report.

For the full year, the projection has been revised upwards to 4.7% from 4.6%.

The economy grew by 5% in the first quarter and 4.5% in the second quarter — the lowest in 26 quarters.

“Our composite leading indicator (index of 33 major leading indicators) suggests that GDP growth will remain flat at 4.5% in Q3 of FY20,” the report, authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI, said. The government is scheduled to release Q3 GDP data by the end of this week.

“Trade policy uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and idiosyncratic stress in key emerging market economies continued to weigh on global economic activity — especially manufacturing and trade. Considering all these factors, we now foresee a GDP growth at 4.7% in current fiscal,” the report said.

Global slowdown

The report pointed out that the growth rate in FY20 should be looked at through the prism of synchronised global slowdown, and India cannot be an isolation.

There is worry that the impact of COVID-19on India could occur with a lag and the outbreak was now expected to cause a growth erosion of 100 basis points in China alone, it said adding new hotspots had emerged in South Korea and in Italy and these will result in more quarantines, border closures and disruptions in economic relations.

“Thus, the cost of death, even though it might be limited, the economic impact could be significantly large,” the report said.

SpaceX, the private rocket company of high tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, won final approval on Tuesday to build a research and manufacturing plant for its deep-space Starship project on a tract of vacant land at the Port of Los Angeles.

The Los Angeles City Council granted a permit for the facility by a unanimous 12-0 vote, paving the way for Musk, also the founder of Tesla Inc electric car company, to proceed with an accelerated development of a new spacecraft and rocket system designed to carry humans to the moon and Mars.

The L.A. Board of Harbor Commissioners gave its go-ahead to the 10-year permit last week.

“It's crazy that here we are in 2020 preparing ourselves to send people to Mars, and it's going to happen in our backyard,” Councilman Joe Buscaino, whose district includes the port, said before Tuesday's vote. “We are becoming a spaceport.”

Operations at the facility will actually be confined to research, design and fabrication of aerospace components. Space vehicles built there are not permitted for launch but will be transported out of the port complex by barge or ship.

The council action clears the way for SpaceX to begin leasing 12.5 acres (5 hectares) of property on Terminal Island for its Starship plant at a starting rent of $1.7 million a year, with an option to expand its site to 19 acres.

The company, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, has an option to terminate the permit within 180 days.

SpaceX secured a similar permit two years ago, but canceled it and moved its initial phase of the Starship project to Texas, where the company has developed and tested an early prototype dubbed Starhopper.

The Los Angeles Port site will bring further Starship development closer to SpaceX's headquarters in the L.A. suburb of Hawthorne, where it has manufactured its workhorse Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon crew capsules.

The future facility, which may incorporate renovations to abandoned warehouse and workshop structures on the site, is expected to provide 130 new jobs, according to Musk.

As designed, the Starship itself is actually the top half of a colossal interplanetary rocket system that will stand 387 feet (118 meters) tall and be capable of ferrying dozens of humans to the moon and Mars in a single launch.

Musk has said that he hopes the Starship will be ready for its first orbital test flight later this year.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/d911v9/article29950940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPACEXLAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/musks-spacex-rocket-production-facility-approved-by-port-of-los-angeles/article30919532.ece
48,2020/02/26,Amit Shah acted swiftly to curb violence: govt.,"His Cabinet colleagues rally round him, accuse Sonia of playing “dirty party politics”.

On a day when Congress president Sonia Gandhi called for the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah over the violence that left 20 dead in north-east Delhi in the past few days, the Union government was quick to rally round him.

While his Cabinet colleagues Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad reacted quickly to Ms. Gandhi’s statement, accusing her of playing “dirty party politics”, government sources gave out details of Mr. Shah’s “hands on” approach to dealing with the situation.

“The first news of violence came in around 4 p.m. on February 24. Mr. Shah called a high-level meeting of the Home Secretary, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), senior IB officers and the Delhi police commissioner at his residence by 7 p.m. Instructions were issued to the Delhi police on how to tackle the violence,” said a government official. “At 1 a.m., again he reviewed the situation,” added the source.

Analysis: Centre, Delhi govt. are both responsible for inadequate response to riots in city

The next day too, said sources, he started with review meetings at 9 a.m. Thereafter, he called an all-party meeting, attended by Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and the leaders of the Congress and the BJP in Delhi, Subhash Chopra and Manoj Tiwari. “At that meeting, he appealed that all MLAs and corporators tour the affected areas and provide succour, as well as opening a dialogue through peace committees,” said the source.

Several other meetings were held through the day, with the Home Secretary and the Deputy National Security Adviser in attendance; thereafter, S.N. Srivastava was appointed Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order).

Significantly, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, who hit the streets from midnight Tuesday, was not present at any of these meetings. BJP leaders, however, rejected the notion that Mr. Doval’s action pointed at anything other than a simple administrative calculation. “If the Home Minister had toured the area, it would have scaled up the situation. The two Ministers of State, Nityanand Rai and G. Kishen Reddy, are political men, and may not have had the desired effect.

49,2020/02/26,"News Analysis: Nitish catches ally, rivals off guard with resolution against NRC","A day after the Bihar Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against implementing the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and for updating the National Population Register (NPR) based on the 2010 format in the State, some local leaders of the ruling alliance partner, the BJP, acknowledged on Wednesday that they had been “caught off guard”.

Also Read Paswan hails Bihar Assembly resolution on NRC, NPR

Describing the move as a “master stroke” by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, political analyst Ajay Kumar said the JD(U) President had simultaneously achieved multiple objectives.

“With this single stroke in the Assembly yesterday, Nitish Kumar did three things: he silenced the Opposition’s protest to make the CAA, NRC and NPR a big issue in the State; assuaged the ruffled feelings of the Muslims here; and thirdly, relayed a message to the BJP loud and clear that only he is the big brother in Bihar,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu. He added that “by declaring that the government would implement the NPR in its 2010 format, Nitish Kumar also sent a message to his Extremely Backward Class (EBC) voters, who would have had to face more inconvenience in filling up the new format containing more complex clauses”.

On Tuesday, Bihar became the first NDA-ruled State to unanimously pass a resolution against the proposed NRC and sources in the ruling alliance told The Hindu that the “script for it was written when BJP president J. P. Nadda had met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during his recent visit to Bihar”. However, only a select few senior State BJP leaders were privy to the development. “We were caught completely off guard with the BJP MLAs supporting the resolution in the Assembly yesterday… when the BJP changed its strategy on the issue was not known to us or, not been informed,” State BJP leader and party MLC Sachhidanand Rai said. Earlier, party MLA and minister Prem Kumar too had expressed surprise over the “sudden development”. Some other BJP MLAs, who spoke to The Hindu, also echoed a similar sentiment, adding that they had been told not to make any comment to the media on the issue. “When our top State party leaders did not oppose or say anything on it, what do you expect us to say…its up to them to take a call on it,” was a common refrain among these leaders.

Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi observed that it was a ‘smart move’ by the JD(U) leader, before adding, “if he comes to the grand alliance he would be our chief ministerial candidate”.

Leaders of the opposition RJD, however, asserted that Mr. Kumar had been forced to introduce the resolution because of the sustained protests against the CAA, NRC and NPR. “The government surrendered to unanimously pass the resolution against NRC and NPR in Assembly because of our sustained protests against it… we’ll protest implementation of CAA as well in the State”, tweeted Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Tejashwi Yadav. He also took a dig at the BJP MLAs and remarked that “they just gawked in utter surprise over the development”.

JD(U) leader and Parliamentary affairs minister Shrawan Kumar, however, dismissed the opposition’s attempts to take credit and said, “Tejashwi Yadav may claim that the resolution against NRC and doing NPR in the 2010 format in the Assembly was a victory for them but, actually Nitish Kumar has exposed the Opposition and their attempt to malign the government on the issue”.

Meanwhile, poll strategist and erstwhile JD(U) leader Prashant Kishor, who had earlier urged Mr. Kumar not to support the CAA, NRC and NPR in the State, took to Twitter on Wednesday to thank the Bihar chief minister for “sticking up to his words”. “But, beyond this, there are larger issues concerning the interest of Bihar and the social harmony around us. We can only hope that you would stay true to your inner conscience and stand up on both these counts as well,” tweeted Mr. Kishor.

Both, Mr Kishor and former party leader Pawan Varma were recently expelled from the JD(U) for questioning the party’s stand on the issues of CAA, NRC and NPR.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8ymr4h/article30925320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27NITISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-analysis-nitish-catches-ally-rivals-off-guard-with-resolution-against-nrc/article30925321.ece

Searched were conducted at at least five locations in a fresh clampdown against the militant outfit. Official sources said the house of JeM local commander, Zahid Ahmed Wani, in Pulwama's Karimabad, was raided under a heavy security cover of the police, the Army and the CRPF.

Bhat, a driver by profession, was arrested from the truck carrying militants during the Nagrota attack.

A search was also carried out at the house of Ghulam Nabi Bhat in Pulwama's Drubgam village. Bhat's son was questioned during the raid.

The Gujarat government has granted promotion to retired IPS officer D.G. Vanzara, who was a key accused in fake encounters of Sohrabuddin and Ishrat Jahan and others, with retrospective effect after he was discharged from the cases. He has been promoted from Deputy Inspector General to Inspector General (IG) level with effect from September 29, 2007.

Mr. Vanzara retired from service on May 31, 2014. Later on he was discharged by court from both cases in which seven persons were allegedly killed by police in staged encounters.

He was arrested by the Gujarat Police CID (Crime) in 2007 after his name cropped up in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case. Subsequently, his name emerged as a key accused in the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case as well.

“Consequent to clean chit received from Judiciary in all Encounter Cases which were concocted by Anti-National Forces against me & Gujarat Police, I am given Post-Retirement Promotion of Inspector General of Police wef 29-09-2007. I am thankful to both Govt of India & Govt of Gujarat,” Mr. Vanzara tweeted along with the copy of the government notification.

The Sohrabuddin case was transferred to Mumbai in September 2012. He was serving as Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Border Range at the time of his arrest.

Sohrabuddin Sheikh was killed in an alleged fake encounter near Gandhinagar in November 2005, after which his wife disappeared. According to the CBI, she, too, was killed.

With the Balakot air strike, India has clearly demonstrated “its strong will against terrorism” and now “we do not hesitate to cross the border to protect India against terrorism”, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday on the first anniversary of the air strike.

“Our Government has adopted a different approach from earlier governments. Now we do not hesitate to cross the border to protect India against terrorism,” he said on Twitter.

‘New India’

Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought about a change in India’s approach against terrorism and ways to counter terror, Mr. Singh said, “The surgical strikes of 2016 and the Balakot air strikes of 2019 are testimony to this change. This is certainly a new and confident India in making.”

To mark the anniversary, Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S. Bhadauria flew a MiG-21 fighter jet of the Indian Air Force (IAF) 51 Squadron from Srinagar Air Base.

To mark the anniversary, Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S. Bhadauria flew in a five aircraft mission at Srinagar Air Base along with aircrew from squadrons that had participated in the operations on February 26 and 27 last year. He flew in a MiG-21 Type 69 aircraft along with the Commanding Officer of 51 Squadron, Group Captain Kamran Nazeerin, in a formation comprising of one MiG-21, two Mirage-2000s and two Sukhoi-30 MKIs, the IAF said in a statement.

In a pre-dawn attack on February 26, 2019, 12 IAF Mirage-2000 fighter jets struck the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training camp in Balakot inside Pakistan with SPICE-2000 precision guided glide bombs. A day after, on February 27, 2019, an aerial engagement ensured after Pakistan Air Force jets came close to the Line of Control (LoC) and attempted to bomb Indian army installations. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman in a MiG-21 Bison fighter jet shot a Pakistan F-16 but was also shot down and landed in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK). He was handed over by Pakistan to India at the Wagah-Attari border crossing on March 1.

Top priorities

The IAF has since identified Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft and Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles as top priorities. ACM Bhadauria and former IAF chief ACM B.S.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharman on Wednesday said the government is keeping a close watch on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Indian economy.

The minister also said that the process of merger of public sector banks was underway as per the schedule. The government has announced to merge 10 sector state-run banks to create four bigger lenders.

Over 2,700 people have died due COVID-19 while the number of those infected is around 80,000. In the wake of the virus outbreak, whose epicentre is China, many airlines, including Indian carriers, have cancelled some of their overseas flights.

On bank mergers, Ms. Sitharaman said there is “no uncertainty about bank merger” and the process is on as per the schedule.

Last year in August, the government announced merger of 10 public sector banks into four. United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce are to be merged with Punjab National Bank, making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank (PSB) from April 1 this year.

It was also decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, and Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India.

54,2020/02/26,79 arrested in RPF’s crackdown on illegal e-ticket rackets,"Railway Police Force has identified 16,735 user IDs for blacklisting, besides blocking 27,948 tickets worth ₹7.96 crore for upcoming journeys.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has busted countrywide illegal e-ticket booking rackets and arrested 79 persons, a top official said in Mumbai on Wednesday.

It has also identified 16,735 user IDs – through which tickets were booked illegally – for blacklisting besides blocking 27,948 tickets worth ₹7.96 crore for upcoming journeys, said Arun Kumar, director-general of the RPF.

ANMS and MAC, the illegal software which the racketeers used for booking e-tickets fraudulently by getting around One Time Password (OTP) and CAPTCHA systems, were completely “neutralised” by RPF sleuths, he said.

“Tickets valued around ₹30 crore, which were already used by passengers, were also seized,” he said.

The racket existed since 2012 but became more active in the last two or three years, Mr. Kumar said.

As many as 79 persons have been arrested in connection with the rackets which were suspected to have links to terror financing, he added.

The arrests were made in various parts of the country and the accused included owners of the illegal software. No agents have been arrested yet, he said.

RPF sleuths deactivated ANMS software on January 23 and MAC on February 8, he said. Similar softwares had been deactivated in the past, he said.

The illegal ANMS software had captured nearly 80 per cent of the ticket booking market, Mr. Kumar said.

The “master” or the owner having a password and ID for the software would sell “layers” of the software to agents for a specific time slot for booking tickets, the RPF DG said.

Some other illegal software are available in the market but they do not work, Mr. Kumar claimed.

“We are aware that some software are still there in the market. We are working on them and trying to neutralize them as well,” said Mr. Kumar.

The RPF was working closely with the Centre for Railway Information System (CRIC), IRCTC and the Commercial Departments of the railways, and CRIS keeps updating security features and disrupting the function of such software, he said.

The RPF top boss also said that investigation revealed that these software also bypassed OTP systems used for online transactions, and it was brought to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India, asking it to make online payment for railway ticket booking more secure.

For online payments upto ₹2,000, OTP is not required, he said.

“We have taken up this with RBI and told them that as far as railway tickets are concerned, single payments (without OTP) should not be bypassed (allowed),” Mr. Kumar said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fo4gj2/article30923962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY15-RPF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/79-arrested-in-rpfs-crackdown-on-illegal-e-ticket-rackets/article30923810.ece

A day after the visiting U.S. President left, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) met in Delhi to not only discuss the Delhi riots that have killed 20 but also decided to submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind against the Delhi Police’s inability to contain the riots.

On Tuesday, the party’s chief spokesperson had appealed to both the Centre (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah) and Delhi’s elected Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to immediately restore peace in the city, parts of which have been torn apart by ugly communal clashes.

“Do not fail this country just because you belong to different political parties,” said the Congress’ communication chief Randeep Surjewala, who claimed to made the appeal “on behalf of the people of Delhi”.

Learning from mistakes

For a party that was handed a resounding defeat in the recent Delhi Assembly elections, with only three of its 70 candidates managing to retain their security deposits, it isn’t a case of the party trying to reach out to the people who didn’t vote for them. Rather, it could be case of learning from their past mistakes. In December 2012, when the gruesome Nirbhaya gang-rape incident took place, most Congress ministers and leaders were not only found wanting but seemed almost insensitive to the massive protests that broke out. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was nowhere to be seen and the party’s former chief minister, the late Sheila Dikshit, was jeered when she went to Jantar Mantar to light a candle and express solidarity.

In fact, in the unforgiving world of social media, Mr. Kejriwal was reminded of his June 2013 tweet just as critics of Mr. Modi juxtaposed pictures of Delhi burning with those from Ahmedabad, where the PM was busy hosting President Trump and his entourage at the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. “Sheila Dikshit’s response after each rape — ‘what can I do? Delhi police not in my control’. Do we want such a helpless CM?” Mr. Kejriwal had tweeted on June 27, 2013.

The city replied soon after and Mr. Kejriwal has since been elected for a third term in a row. Now that he is in power, has he done anything to shake off this helplessness?

AAP’s leadership

While it’s true that the Delhi CM does not control Delhi Police in a way that he can order them to take action but the Indian Institute of Technology graduate-turned-politician surely understands that a riot cannot be controlled only by firing bullets. Communal riots need a pro-active leadership reaching out to community leaders, forming peace committees of prominent citizens in a mohalla (locality), appealing for peace by going out as far as possible to the affected areas.

Has his government done any of this?

On Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal had convened a meeting of all MLAs, in which some of these points, such peace committees and peace marches, were mooted, and directions were issued to District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates of the affected districts in Delhi.

On Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal attended an all-party meeting with Union Home Minister and Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal; appealed for peace by sitting at Rajghat, Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial; met the injured in a government hospital in east Delhi; apart tweeting his satisfaction that U.S. First Lady Melania Trump had attended a happiness class in a Delhi government school.

‘Alarming’

Describing the situation as alarming, Mr. Kejriwal on Wednesday once again tweeted that he would asking the Home Minister to call in the Army. But an elected Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues should have led from the front, beyond Twitter and social media.

As Delhi continues to be tense and counts its losses, it is clear that both the Centre and the Delhi government will have to share responsibility for the grossly inadequate response from the authorities.

While the Centre seemed too taken up with the visit of the U.S. President visit and ignored the fallout of statements made by Aam Aadmi Party-turned Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra’s open threats of communal disturbance, Mr. Kejriwal’s poor political response is a reminder of his June 2013 tweet on Delhi’s “helpless” Chief Minister.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ej15qg/article30906662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THCLASH-10,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-centre-delhi-govt-are-both-responsible-for-inadequate-response-to-riots-in-city/article30923405.ece

60,2020/02/26,IAF flight leaves for China carrying 15 tonnes of medical supplies,"It will bring back around 120 citizens and five infants on its return trip early today.

India on Wednesday sent a heavy lift military transport aircraft to coronavirus-hit Wuhan in China. The C-17 Globemaster III aircraft carried 15 tonnes of medical supplies as a goodwill gesture from the Government of India and will bring back around 120 citizens and five infants on Thursday.

Apart from the Indian nationals, the flight is expected to bring back citizens of friendly countries early in the morning on February 27. An Indian based in Wuhan said the Indian Embassy in Beijing had asked citizens to be ready for evacuation and the official process was under way till late on Wednesday evening.

India had reached out to China on February 13 seeking permission for sending the aircraft with medical supplies. It subsequently accused China of deliberately delaying the process, causing considerable friction between the two sides as India said the delay was causing hardship for its citizens in Wuhan. China had, however, mentioned that the delay was part of the usual process on the ground which was complex in view of the outbreak.

A Chinese source familiar with the exchanges said that there was no “deliberate delay” for flight permission to Wuhan. “The Chinese side takes the health and safety of foreign nationals, including Indian students in China, seriously like its own citizens,” said the source

This is the third aircraft that India is sending for evacuation of citizens from the coronavirus-hit region of China. The previous evacuations were conducted by civilian aircraft.

62,2020/02/26,SC Bar association condemns Justice Mishra’s open praise of PM,"Justice Mishra had hailed the “versatile genius” of Mr. Modi to “think globally and act locally”.

The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), in a resolution passed on Wednesday, strongly condemned senior Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra's praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an international judicial conference last week. Such statements “reflect poorly on the independence of the judiciary”, it said.

Also Read Modi a versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally: Justice Arun Mishra

Justice Mishra had hailed the “versatile genius” of Mr. Modi to “think globally and act locally” while delivering the vote of thanks at the inaugural session of the conference. Mr. Modi was present on the dais along with Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde. Judges from the Supreme Court, high courts, retired judges and judges from over 20 nations who had come to participate in the conference were in attendance at the time. Justice Mishra hailed Mr. Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary”.

“The SCBA believes that any such statement reflects poorly on the independence of the judiciary and so calls upon the Honourable Judges not to make any statements in future nor show any proximity or closeness to the Executive, including Higher Functionaries,” an SCBA statement said. However, its resolution was not unanimous.

The Supreme Court lawyers’ body, led by president and senior advocate Dushyant Dave, said it “believes that the independence of judiciary is the basic structure of the Constitution of India and that such independence be preserved in letter and spirit”. The SCBA expressed a “deep sense of anguish and concern” at Justice Mishra’s remarks made during the vote of thanks.

Bar Council of India chairperson, senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra, however, reacted that ""Justice Mishra's speech was in the capacity of a host and he used best of words for all the guests who graced the occasion. He was not holding a court at that time. The Prime Minister and Union Law Minister were the chief guest and guest of honour [respectively] of that function. I myself was present in that function, but I did not find anything wrong in Mr. Mishra’s speech"".

BAI statement

However, the concern among lawyers was not restricted to the SCBA. The Bar Association of India (BAI) had also issued a formal statement to convey its concern and dismay over the “effusive terms of praise and adulation” used by Justice Mishra for Mr. Modi. It said Justice Mishra’s words went “beyond the terms of formal courtesy extended during a vote of thanks address”.

The BAI, a federation representing lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar to the local courts, law societies and firms across the country, said it was the “foundational obligation [of judges] to maintain a discreet and dignified distance from the Executive branch of the government”.

The BAI statement said, “Such an act serves to dilute the perception of impartiality and independence and diminishes the confidence of general public as judges of Supreme Court are expected to decide cases against the executive branch while upholding constitutional principles and the Rule of Law as paramount”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4nbttw/article29786098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Justice-ARUN-MISHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bar-association-dismayed-at-justice-arun-mishras-praise-of-pm-modi/article30922443.ece

The government on Wednesday approved setting up of a National Technical Textiles Mission with a total outlay of ₹1,480 crore with a view to position the country as a global leader in technical textiles.

The Mission will have a four year implementation period from financial year 2020-21 to 2023-24.

The decision was taken at a meeting of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here.

“The Mission will aim at average growth rate of 15-20% per annum taking the level of domestic market size to $40-50 billion by the year 2024 through market development, market promotion, international technical collaborations, investment promotions and ‘Make in India’ initiatives,” an official statement said.

It envisages export promotion of technical textiles, enhancing it from the current annual value of approximately ₹14,000 crore to ₹20,000 crore by 2021-22, and ensuring 10% average growth in exports per year up to 2023-24.

An Export Promotion Council for Technical Textiles will be set up for effective coordination and promotion activities in the segment.

Addressing a press conference on Cabinet decisions, Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani said arrangements have been made under the Mission for skill development of 50,000 people in the field of technical textiles.

“We have mandated use of technical textiles in 9 ministries and 92 products and our hope is that with convergence of efforts with the technology group we will see a new future for especially MSME and technologists in the field of technical textiles, thereby making India self sufficient specially in strategic fields like defence and aerospace,” the minister said.

She observed that the target is to nullify the burden of technical textiles segment on India’s trade deficit in the next one year.

The minister informed that she had requested the technology group established in the previous Cabinet meeting to work in tandem with the National Technical Textiles Mission.

She said the industry has on several occasions in the past raised demands for a technical textiles mission.

The Mission will have four components including research, innovation and development with outlay of ₹1,000 crore; promotion and market development; export promotion; education, training and skill development.

Besides, the Mission will promote technical education at higher engineering and technology levels related to technical textiles and its application areas covering engineering, medical, agriculture, aquaculture and dairy segments.

Skill development will be promoted and adequate pool of highly skilled manpower resources will be created for meeting the need of relatively sophisticated technical textiles manufacturing units, the statement said.

Technical textiles are futuristic and niche segment of textiles, which are used for various applications ranging from agriculture, roads, railway tracks, sportswear, health on one end to bullet proof jacket, fire proof jackets, high altitude combat gear and space applications on the other end of spectrum.

In India, the segment is estimated at $16 billion (about ₹1.14 lakh crore) which is approximately 6% of the $250 billion (about ₹17.75 lakh crore) global technical textiles market.

The penetration level of technical textiles is low in India, varying between 5-10% against the level of 30-70% in developed countries.

The Mission will focus on usage of technical textiles in various flagship missions, programmes of the country including strategic sectors.

The use of technical textiles in agriculture, aquaculture, dairy, poultry, JalJivan Mission, Swachch Bharat Mission, Ayushman Bharat will bring an overall improvement in cost economy, water and soil conservation, better agricultural productivity and higher income to farmers per acre of land holding in addition to promotion of manufacturing and exports activities in India, it said.

The research output will be reposited with a ‘Trust’ with the government for easy and assessable proliferation of knowledge gained through research innovation and development activities.

Mission Directorate in the Ministry of Textiles headed by an eminent expert in the related field will be made operational. The Mission Directorate will not have any permanent employment and there will be no creation of building infrastructure for the Mission purpose.

Concerned over the deteriorating law and order situation in the national capital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval the mandate to restore normalcy in riot-hit northeast Delhi where at least 20 people have been killed in the communal violence, officials said on Wednesday.

Immediately after taking over the assignment, Mr. Doval undertook a late night tour of the riot-hit areas on Tuesday accompanied by Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik and newly-appointed Special Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and other senior officers, they said.

He visited the affected northeastern parts of Delhi, including Jaffrabad and Seelampur, where he met police officers and gave them necessary directives, besides meeting leaders of different communities to assuage the tensed situation, the officials said.

Mr. Shrivastava is believed to have been handpicked by Mr. Doval himself after Mr. Patnaik faced flak for failing to curb spiralling violence in the national capital in the backdrop of high-profile visit of U.S. President Donald Trump, they said.

The Press Club of India and the Indian Women’s Press Corps have expressed serious concern over the attack on journalists covering the communal violence in northeast Delhi since last Sunday.

“Several of them have been hospitalised. They have been punched and attacked by communal mobs, and police were either absent or have not come to help. Shockingly, mobs were checking religious credentials of journalists,” said the joint statement on Wednesday.

Gunshot injuries

A television journalist sustained gunshot injuries, while another was hit in the face and has several teeth missing. “A woman journalist has also sustained injuries. Television media seem to have been specially targeted,” it said.

The organisations said: “We have little doubt the attackers actively sought to prevent videography or photography that may lead to them being identified. A lethargic police and politicians instigating communal violence cannot escape blame for attacks on the media.”

A few weeks ago, they said, journalists were physically assaulted by the police when they were reporting the violence during the Jamia protests.

“The tragic events since last Sunday have a history, design and pattern. It was evident even during the Delhi elections. Several BJP leaders made inflammatory statements intended to create an atmosphere of fear and hate,” she said. In particular, she referred to BJP leader Kapil Mishra’s statement on Sunday, setting an ultimatum for the Delhi police to get evacuate the protesters from Shaheen Bagh.

Ms. Gandhi said the violence was the result of the “collective failure” of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Arvind Kejriwal government in the State.

Reading out the CWC resolution, Ms. Gandhi said, “After reviewing the situation, the CWC is of the firm opinion that what has happened in Delhi is a colossal failure of duty for which the entire responsibility must be borne by the Central government, particularly the Home Minister, and calls upon the Home Minister to tender his resignation immediately.” The Chief Minister was equally responsible for administrative inaction. “The Chief Minister must be visible in the affected areas and in constant communication with the people,” she said.

The CWC posed five questions to the Delhi and Union governments. “Where was the Home Minister and what was he doing since last Sunday? Where was the Chief Minister of Delhi and what was he doing since last Sunday?”

Ms. Gandhi also questioned the evident lack of intelligence reports after the conclusion of the Delhi Assembly election. “What was the strength of the police force deployed on the night of Sunday when there were clear indications that violence will break out? Why were additional security forces not called in immediately when it was clear that the situation was beyond the control of the Delhi police?”

She called upon Congress workers and leaders to visit the affected areas, extend help to the families of the affected and help build bridges between communities.

She said the Modi government should have called a meeting of all political parties to brief them of the situation and the action taken by the government. “Whenever there was a crisis of any kind, whether in Kashmir or any other part of the country, the first thing the Vajpayee government would do was to call leaders of all parties. But, unfortunately and sadly, ...ever since Mr. Modi entered office in 2014, as far as I know, no such meeting has ever been called,” she said. Ms. Gandhi also expressed the fear that the violence could spread to other parts of the country.

The Congress planned a march to the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday, but put it off after the President’s office did not give an appointment. “The President of India communicated to Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad that he is unavailable today and has given us time tomorrow. Upholding the respect for his high office, we have deferred the march, and we shall give a memorandum tomorrow on the grim situation in Delhi and loss of lives,” Mr. Surjewala said.

Union Ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar hit out at Ms. Gandhi and the Congress. Mr. Javadekar accused Ms. Gandhi of “playing dirty politics” over the violence. “In such times, all parties should ensure that peace is maintained, blaming the government instead is dirty politics. Politicising this violence is wrong,” he said.

Mr. Prasad said he condemned Ms. Gandhi’s statement. “Tension in Delhi should end. Many people are spreading violence here. At a time when Delhi is returning to peace, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s remark is untimely. When peace is required, there should be no politics,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/b8bhsp/article30920603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/soniagandhi-cwc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-leaders-to-march-to-rashtrapati-bhavan-to-seek-normalcy-in-delhi/article30919952.ece

76,2020/02/26,"Restrain CAPFs, police from wearing combat fatigues, says Army","It may be seen as Army is being deployed for internal security duties and elections, it tells MoD

The Army has written to the Ministry of Defence, saying that the police and the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) personnel must stop using combat fatigues. The move came after some CAPF and police personnel with the Delhi police were seen wearing Army pattern combat fatigues during security duties at the protest against the citizenship law on Sunday. The Army said it could be misinterpreted as the Army being deployed for internal security duties.

“Wearing of combat dress by CAPFs and State police forces may be misinterpreted as the Army being deployed for internal security duties and elections… Indian Army has again written to the Department of Military Affairs on February 24 requesting MoD and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to issue following guidelines for immediate implementation,” an Army source said.

The guidelines requested include that combat dress should not be worn by the CAPFs across India while being employed to handle law and order situations as also while being deployed in urban areas affected by terrorism, as the surroundings do not demand such a requirement.

“Use of distinctly different disruptive dress, both in colour and pattern, by CAPFs and State police forces should be restricted only to employment in jungle terrain in Left Wing Extremist (LWE) affected areas,” the source said adding the Bullet Proof Jackets (BPJ) cover most parts of the torso hence, the BPJs should be of plain khaki colour and not of combat colour.

The source said the sale of the Army pattern clothes in the open market needs to be regulated and private vendors in open market should establish the identity and maintain a record of personnel to whom such clothes, including accessories and accoutrements, are being sold, as proposed by the MHA on March 31, 2016.

77,2020/02/26,J&K high-speed Internet restoration put off,"VPNs being misused by anti-national elements, says government

The Jammu & Kashmir administration has decided not to restore high-speed Internet till March 4. The administration has once again underlined “the misuse of virtual private networks by anti-national elements” for continuing with the low-speed 2G Internet service. The Internet blockade and limited access have been in force for seven months now.

“It has came to the fore that VPNs were being used by handlers from across the border to bypass Internet restrictions to coordinate with their operatives within the UT of J&K, plan terror acts and scale up anti-national activities,” said a new government order.

After considering the available alternatives, and subject to further review, the directions on restrictions shall continue to remain operative till March 4, said J&K Principal Secretary Shaleen Kabra.

“Mobile data services in some areas of the Kashmir Valley had to be suspended, although for limited periods of time, due to militancy related activities over the last week and the apprehension regarding disruption to public order with the larger aim of causing dissatisfaction and discontent,” said Mr. Kabra.

Internet services were snapped on August 5 last year and was restored in January. However, only 2G speed is available and access to sites has been limited.

Meanwhile, the administration is constantly increasing the number of white-listed sites in J&K, especially service-related websites. Less than 1500 white-listed websites can be accessed now. However, all the social media platforms remain banned in J&K.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jk-high-speed-internet-restoration-put-off/article30917179.ece

The accused was produced before a court that granted 10-day custody to the CBI.

80,2020/02/26,Apex environment body defers decision on Parliament revamp plan,"The department had also asserted that there were no court cases pending against the project and/or the land.

An apex environmental screening committee has deferred a decision on clearance to the Parliament redevelopment project. This has been done on the grounds that there was a dispute, being heard in the Delhi High Court, regarding the land on which some of the proposed structures were to come up, a person privy to the meeting told The Hindu.

‘Land-use change’

The petitioner in the Delhi High Court has pleaded that no environment clearance be given, as the alterations which are proposed will involve land-use change not in conformity with Delhi’s Master Plan. The petitioner also prayed that no permission be granted to cut trees for the expansion and renovation of the Parliament building, which is part of the Central Vista Redevelopment project and involves redeveloping the 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi.

‘As soon as possible’

Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued notice to the Ministry of Housing and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) seeking their stand on the petition and ordered that the decision of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) be conveyed to the court “as soon as possible”.

The revamp, which was announced in September, envisages a new triangular Parliament building that is targeted to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

The CPWD applied to the environment ministry on February 12 as part of a formal process. In its application, the department sought permission to fell 194 trees and plant 250 new trees as compensation.

‘No cases pending’

The department had also asserted that there were no court cases pending against the project and/or the land. However, two petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court against the Delhi Development Authority’s proposed land use change of several plots, including for the new Parliament. One of the plots had been earmarked for recreational use in the Master Plan for Delhi-2021, and the DDA had proposed changing it to “Parliament House” on December 20, 2019.

‘No problem on trees’

“The land use dispute has to be resolved before the EAC can take a decision,” the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. “However we don’t see a problem regarding the trees, given that the plan involves making good the losses,” the person added.

82,2020/02/26,‘ZBNF fast becoming a buzzword in State’,"Govt., field staff ready to help and guide farmers: expert

Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) expert and State resource person K. Gangadharam on Wednesday said the concept was fast catching up in view of its health benefits and efforts would be made to promote it across the State.

Dr. Gangadharam was speaking at the one-day training session organised by the Rural Organization for Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES) and Children Believe, a Canadian INGO, in association the agriculture and allied departments for small and marginal farmers of SC/ST communities, at Bangarupalem mandal headquarters.

About 200 farmers from the targeted group took part in the training programme as part of which demonstrations and digital presentations were made.

“It has been proven beyond doubt that though chemical farming results in high and quick yields in the initial days, prolonged use of inorganic manure proves hazardous to living organisms in the soil adversely affecting its health,” Dr. Gangadharam said. The experience was no different abroad, he added.

The ZBNF functionary said Agriculture Department officials and NGOs involved in community health were actively involved in propagating methods of preparing manure for natural farmers.

“Just one cow and its dung could do miracles in over 30 acres, providing raw material for various sprinklers and organic manure such as ‘Jeevamrutham,’ ‘Ganamrutham’ and ‘Brahmastram.’ Other vital ingredients for manure such as neem, jaggery, barks and leaves can be be procured from the farmland itself, ” he said.

Dr. Gangadharam urged farmers to utilise the ZBNF schemes and subsidies from the government, apart from freely interacting with the field staff, and taking their suggestions.

MLA vows to do his bit

Puthalapattu MLA M.S. Babu said he would galvanise the ZBNF concept in the constituency which has maximum number of farmers hailing from the SC community with meagre income sources.

The government is providing house sites to more than 50,000 families belonging to the BC, SC and ST communities within Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) limits, said YSRCP MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy(RK). The YSRCP government has promised that it will provide house sites to 25 lakh new beneficiaries by Ugadi.

“I am proud to say that we are providing house sites to more than 50,000 families belonging to socially and economic backward communities in the region, while the previous TDP government had made it impossible for the common man even to buy a cent of land in Amaravati. Why should TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu be sad about this? He should welcome this initiative,’’ Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy, who represents Managalagiri in the Assembly, told reporters at the YSRCP central office at Tadepalli on Wednesday.

‘Compensation insix working days’

Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy maintained that the government was not forcibly acquiring land from any farmer. Under the new provisions of the AP Land Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, the landowner would get compensation within just six working days of signing an agreement with the revenue official concerned.

‘Narayana Seva’, the process of distributing food, clothes and other forms of goodies to the poor marked the 185th birth anniversary celebrations of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa at Sri Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama at Vinayaka Nagar here on Tuesday.

He said Sri Ramakrishna stood as a symbol of spiritualism beyond religions. “I have practised all religions – Hinduism, Islam and Christianity and I found that it is the same God towards whom all are directing their steps though along different paths,” he said, quoting Sri Ramakrishna. He also inspired Swami Vivekananda to spread Dharma and Bharatiya tradition around the world and Vedanta in the west, he said.

On Yoga, which has become a rage across the globe now, Swami Anupamananda said it was Sri Ramakrishna who had instructed people to practise Yoga.

96,2020/02/26,"Police, jail staff help accused run fake certificate racket from prison","Anantapur police arrest three more associates of Glenn Bricks

The kingpin of the ‘fake certificates racket’, who is lodged in the Guntakal Sub-Jail following his arrest on February 1, continued his operations and maintained contact with his wide network, with the help of two policemen.

Anantapur police during their investigation and interrogation of Glenn Bricks found his links to yet another gang and arrested three persons on Tuesday. The police had earlier made arrests on three occasions this month (February 1, 19 and 20) and the magnitude of the racket is getting bigger by the day, said Additional Superintendent of Police G. Ramanjaneyulu.

At a press conference here, Mr. Ramanjaneyulu said the arrested were S. Venkateswarlu, a Government Railway Police constable at Guntakal and B. Thimmappa, 32, and K. Yellappa, 32, both hailing from Guntakal.

Material seized

Among the materials seized from them were 393 fake certificates, 215 fake papers related to certificates, 138 fake seals, blank registration stamp papers, fake house site pattas, demand drafts, three two-wheelers and some holograms. The fake certificates were related to government institutions and some private institutions.

Even while lodged in the Gooty Special Jail, Glenn Bricks was in touch with his gang members through cell phones provided by the jail staff. All the call data (1,165 calls) had been recovered and details of all the persons he had contacted after his arrest were being gathered, Mr. Ramanjaneyulu said.

The matter came to light during the interrogation in the Anantapur II Town case. Glenn Bricks was accused in two other cases in Anantapur. The two mobile numbers from which the accused had talked to people outside belonged to Special Jail constables Sudhir Reddy and Phanibhushan Reddy and they allegedly received money for making that favour. Departmental action was being initiated against them, the police officer added.

Key member

Mr. Thimmappa was the driver of Mr. Glenn Bricks and had been associated with him for the past 15 years in the fake certificate operations. He was also an accused in some cases in Bellary. The 2012 batch Armed Reserve constable Venkateswarlu was in touch with Mr. Glenn Bricks for the past four years and had been assisting him in making and selling fake certificates. “He used to pass on sensitive police information to Glenn Bricks,” the Additional SP observed.

He had also passed on information related to call data of some phone numbers from the ‘Third Eye’ database of police to Mr. Glenn Bricks with the help of a Guntakal Railway IT Core Team member Shameer. K. Yellappa, the third accused, was also an accused in two other cases in 2011 and 2012 and was a very close associate of Mr. Glenn Bricks, Mr. Ramanjaneyulu said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pato78/article30917306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26VJFAKECERTIFICTES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-jail-staff-help-accused-run-fake-certificate-racket-from-prison/article30917307.ece

Principal Secretary, Department of School Education, B. Rajsekhar on Tuesday said if in the past, long distance between home and school was a challenge, imparting quality education was a daunting task today.

Addressing the 14th annual State conference on “Dalit Girl Children-Access to Quality Education”, organised by Dalit Sthree Sakthi (DSS), Mr. Rajsekhar explained the need for English as a medium of instruction, especially for Dalit students, and cited the examples of schools in Delhi. He said that instead of handing over their children to the schools and the government and shirking their responsibility, parents should play an active role in moulding their children into responsible citizens. At home, they should create a conducive atmosphere for them to learn their lessons.

Mr. Rajsekhar said education was a priority sector for the Jagan Mohan Reddy government and parents should make the best use of this opportunity.

Retired civil servant Chaya Ratan reiterated that both parents and teachers should take responsibility to give a bright future to the students.

National convenor of Dalit Sthree Sakthi Geddam Jhansi said the organisation had conducted a campaign on gender equality last year in villages with an aim to educate Dalit women on her rights and enable them to join the mainstream.

Later, Mr. Rajsekhar and Ms. Chaya Ratan released the DSS report.

Prakasam police have achieved a breakthrough in a major cybercrime with the arrest of a Nigerian national and his accomplices from New Delhi.

Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal told a media conference here on Tuesday that the Nigerian, Onyech Hyginus(43), created a fake page on social media and befriended one Achaiah from Prakasam district who used to hold prayer meetings in Baptistpalem in Podili.

Promising to give him 20% of USD 2.4 billion meant for construction of places of worship and hospitals in the district, he lured him to New Delhi. Then he made Achaiah believe that he was in trouble in the absence of necessary Customs and RBI clearances from the authorities for bringing in foreign exchange and got transferred online ₹14.67 lakh to his bank accounts on the pretext of making payments to the authorities. With passage of time, Achaiah realised that he had been cheated and lodged a complaint with the Podili police.

After registering a case under IPC Section 420 and Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, a special team was formed to crack the case. It camped in Delhi for several days and achieved the breakthrough with the IT core team providing the back-end support.

Recovery initiated

Police seized five mobile phones, nine ATM cards, 22 cheque books issued by different banks and an identity card of the main accused who had come to India as a football coach in 2014. He had served two years’ simple imprisonment for overstaying in the country.

The SP said the process of recovery of the transferred amount and freezing of accounts of the accused with various banks had already been initiated.

The arrested, including Shahid Khan (32) and Md. Yaqoob (36) from Bareily in Uttar Pradesh, were brought here on Tuesday after obtaining transit remand from a court in New Delhi four days ago. “We are closely working with police in other States to investigate the online frauds,” the SP said.

The SP appealed to the public not to reveal the one time password (OTP) generated during online transactions to anyone, even if a person posed as a bank staffer. They should also not respond to emails and messages claiming that they had won lotteries and need to pay processing fee for getting the amount.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nigerian-among-three-held-for-online-fraud/article30917279.ece

Showering praise on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his government, the visiting World Bank team on Tuesday said that it was impressed with the e-governance through village and ward secretariats, welfare schemes and initiatives in health and education sectors.

In an hour-long interaction with the Chief Minister, the WB team led by Director (Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice) Lynne Sherburne Benz enquired about skill development initiatives, village clinics, Rythu Bharosa and other such schemes.

The World Bank team promised to extend help to the State in the fields of health, education and social security, according to a release from the Chief Minister’s Office.

The World Bank team said that Mr. Jagan initiated several reforms based on the issues he learned during his padayatra, which culminated early last year. The things which Mr. Jagan learned during his 3,648-km padayatra clearly reflected in his policies. “We have learnt about Mr. Jagan’s padayatra. The impact of the padayatra is clearly visible in the Chief Minister’s words, thoughts and actions. They clearly reflected the things at the ground level,” the release said quoting members of the visiting delegation.

Skill development

The government’s plan to establish skill development colleges in each parliamentary constituency was lauded as it would benefit the industry sector. The institutes being planned to impart high-end skills would be much more rewarding. Investment on human resources would ensure positive results and lead to realistic development. Steps in education and health sectors were inspirational. Efforts to improve high-end skills among youth were the best. Bringing in e-governance through village and ward secretariats was also appreciated.

Mr. Jagan explained to them about Rythu Bharosa, e-governance, and registration of lands at village and ward secretariats in the next three years. He told them that the living standards and incomes of people in villages would go up with the government schemes like Rythu Bharosa. The rural people would not think of migrating to other places in search of livelihood, the release said.

Mr. Jagan elaborated on the various initiatives of his government like developing school and healthcare infrastructure, introduction of English medium in all government schools, establishing village clinics and Rythu Bharosa Centres as one-stop shop for farmers.

Youth from Jammu and Kashmir, participants of an exchange programme promoted by Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanghatan, expressed despair at the way they have been treated so far, but hoped that the ‘open’ era will soon dawn in the valley.

At an interaction with their counterparts at SSBN Degree College here on Tuesday, they said: “We live in a disputed land and are at the receiving end both from militants and security forces and live in constant fear.”

A team of 150 youth have been enjoying their stay in the city since their arrival on Sunday.

“We cannot dream of moving on the streets forgetting our identity cards at home. I was surprised to see police personnel performing duty without weapons in this State. In Kashmir Valley, the personnel possess at least an AK rifle,” said Burhan Mir, a journalist for the past five years with a local news channel at Pulwama. Working as a journalist in the valley is a risky affair, said Mr. Burhan. Jammu and Kashmir is always portrayed in a negative aspect in the media and all positive things get buried, he lamented.

Ashaq Hussain Ganie, another youth from Anantnag, said wearing Pathani dress was the culture of Kashmir, but now if youth wear it, they are viewed as anti-social elements or criminals.

‘Testing times’

“We are leading a lonely life, seeing blood everyday and every family is worried as schools and colleges are closed for most part of the year. I had my examinations and wrote a paper on August 3 and before I could write the next paper, abrogation of Article 370 happened and I got to write my next examination only after four months. There was no Internet, no information, no way to continue studies. From outside Jammu and Kashmir looks like heaven, but for us it is hell,” he said.

Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanghatan Vice-Chairman S. Vishnu Vardhan Reddy and Superintendent of Police B. Satya Yesu Babu spoke to youth and hoped that their interaction would help people from both the States to get a realistic perspective about their lifestyles.

107,2020/02/26,BJP opposes TTD’s mono rail proposal at Tirumala,"It will hurt sentiments of devotees, says party spokesperson

BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy has demanded that the TTD drop the idea of starting a light metro rail or mono rail between Tirumala and Tirupati as it would severely hurt the religious sentiments of devotees.

Questioning the propriety behind the proposal, he said the sacred hill, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, was a spiritual town and not a tourist centre. The onus of protecting the sanctity of the town rested on the shoulders of all. The TTD would have to face a public agitation if it went ahead with the proposal, he said.

He also expressed his concern over the financial capability of the TTD which had already given its consent to share 67% of the cost involved in the construction of Garuda Varadhi (flyover) at Tirupati costing ₹470 crore. With such a huge drain on its coffers, how could the TTD think of yet another highly expensive undertaking like the mono rail project, he wondered.

Demands White Paper

According to the TTD Act 30 of 1987 the temple funds, he said, should be utilised only for dharmic activities.

Already the corpus fund was being diluted and the income derived from the temple hundi, which ought to be deposited in the banks in the form of fixed deposits, was being spent at the whims and fancies of the administrative authorities, he alleged.

“The devotees have the right to know the details regarding the spendings and hence the TTD should come out with a White Paper on the expenses incurred during the last five years,” he demanded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-opposes-ttds-mono-rail-proposal-at-tirumala/article30917203.ece

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University Vice-Chancellor Koona Ramji said that the university was planning to introduce more job-oriented courses from the academic year 2020-21 after taking the opinion of academicians and heads of industrial bodies. Courses related to fire safety, marine and naval architecture were under active consideration due to their job potential.

Mr. Ramji told The Hindu that advanced courses in yoga, medical records-health information keeping and Gandhian studies would also be introduced very soon. “North Andhra is turning into a major industrial hub and it needs trained manpower. The courses are being planned to meet the needs of various industries including sea ports, airports, fisheries and pharmaceutical industries. The students who pursue these courses are likely to be picked up in campus placement drives by various industries,” Mr. Ramji said.

UGC funds

“The university could meet the expectations of the UGC by improving the infrastructure in the last few years. Under 12B rule, UGC will provide assistance for research activity, improvement of library facility and others. This will help the university to improve its infrastructure on a par with that of old and well-established institutions in the country,” said the Vice-Chancellor.

According to him, all 130 affiliated colleges were also advised to improve laboratory and other facilities. The institutions had been told to involve students in field study which had already been made mandatory for PG students of the university. “We are giving two credit points for each student who successfully completes field study under public outreach programme. Students are actively participating in field studies which include visit to industries and study of government policies. The information thus gathered will be given to various government departments for follow-up action.

So far, nearly 7,000 job aspirants have applied online, while 2,000 more are expected to register during the event.

Speaking to The Hindu, Ramesh Desai, District Skill Development Officer and member secretary of the job mela, said that preparations are under way for the event.

He said that over 70 companies are participating in the event to provide jobs to potential aspirants.

“We have allowed every person even those with minimum qualification of SSLC to participate in the fair to seek jobs. We are hoping that they will secure jobs based on their qualification,” Mr. Desai said.

Asserting that communication skills are vital today in getting jobs in any sector, mainly service and marketing sectors, he said that to provide basic information about this to the aspirants, skill development training sessions would be held during the event.

“We are inviting experts to share their views on skill development and educate students about its importance in getting jobs. Students from North Karnataka region, though are academically excellent, often fail to get good jobs because of weak communication skills. Therefore, we are focusing more on giving the required skills to the aspirants here to find jobs,” Mr. Desai said.

114,2020/02/26,Conservation breeding of Indian bison to start soon,"CZA programme aims to safeguard endangered species with captive breeding

The conservation breeding of gaur (bos gaurus) or Indian bison, an endangered species, is expected to take off soon at the Mysuru zoo, which is the coordinating zoo for the conservation breeding programme (CBP) announced by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). The process of identifying the animal from the wild for captive breeding complying with the guidelines was remaining and the zoo was keenly awaiting to give the much-needed push to the national programme.

The zoo’s facility at Koorgalli on the city outskirts which houses the rescue, conservation and rehabilitation centre is the site for the conservation breeding. Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai and Bondla Zoo in Goa are supporting Mysuru zoo in the ambitious programme.

Once the animal pairs (founders) from the wild are identified for breeding, they would be taken to Mysuru and the participating zoos for launching the programme.

It’s a CZA programme and the approval for locating the wild species has to come from the Centre, which was expected to ask the Chief Wildlife Warden of Karnataka to identify the healthy wild breeding species for the project. There are many formalities that need to be completed since the animals had to be sourced from the wild – may be from one of the national parks such as Bhadra, Dandeli or others.

The CBP has identified about 73 species for captive breeding in the selected zoos with 35 species getting priority with financial assistance. The captive breeding of some species has taken off in some Indian zoos.

The Mysuru zoo was identified for the programme since it has to its credit many successes of captive breeding of animals such as tigers and giraffes.

Zoo Authority of Karnataka Member Secretary B.P. Ravi told The Hindu the zoo had received in-principal approval and the wild stock of the species had to be identified for starting the programme.

Habitat loss was among the reasons cited for the wild animals becoming endangered. The zoos also have to play the role of conserving the populations in the wild in addition to safeguarding those in their captivity.

Breeding lion-tailed macaque on the cards

Even in the case of captive breeding of lion-tailed macaque (LTM), reckoned to be most endangered species, which is also among the list of animals identified for the conservation breeding programme, the Mysuru zoo was awaiting ‘founders’ (species from the wild) for expediting the breeding.

The Chennai zoo is the coordinating zoo for the LTM breeding while the Mysuru and Thiruvananthapuram zoos are assisting it. Only 51 LTMs are found to be in captivity in the Indian zoos (as per the CZA statistics as on 2017-18).

ZAK member secretary B.P. Ravi said 60% of the financial assistance for the breeding programme comes from the Centre while the remaining has to be borne by the State for establishing the infrastructure necessary for the programme. “Even the rescued or injured species can be used for the captive breeding. We need to build enclosures and other facilities from the funds sourced for the programme,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hum9qc/article30925127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MYSBISON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/conservation-breeding-of-indian-bison-to-start-soon/article30925128.ece

The controversial statement of Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, BJP MLA, who termed H.S. Doreswamy “a fake freedom fighter” and “a Pak. agent”, saw protests by some quarters while Housing Minister V. Somanna came in defence of the legislator.

Speaking at Koppal on Wednesday, Mr. Somanna accused the freedom fighter of creating a space for such controversies. He went on to advise Mr. Doreswamy to have “control over his tongue.” Mr. Doreswamy has been an active participant in anti-CAA protests.

When asked to respond to Mr. Yatnal’s remarks, Mr. Somanna said: “In such a ripe old age, Mr. Doreswamy too should have control over his tongue. One’s language reflects one’s personality. Now he has completed 100 years. Shouldn’t he understand the fact that he has been living in this country, which has a great history? Mr. Yatnal might have emotionally said a few words.

122,2020/02/26,Pride in tractor ownership driving farmers in rural areas into debt trap?,"Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association to launch awareness drive about benefits of renting farm machinery

Mahesh, a farmer from Kothegala village in T. Narsipur taluk, got the shock of his life when he received a notice from the Calcutta High Court for defaulting on tractor loan. The loan was taken two years ago and Mahesh, who has about five acres of land, had defaulted on repayment.

An arrest warrant was issued to him by the court as the company, which extended the loan, had its headquarters in Kolkata and had filed a case. Following the intervention of the local farmers association, which contacted the company, efforts were being made for an out-of-court settlement.

“Imagine a farmer in Kothegala fighting a case in Kolkata,” said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association that intervened to get the case rescinded.

More bizarre is the case with respect to Nagendra, a landless farmer in Ambale village of Nanjangud taluk. A suave salesman induced him to buy a tractor on the grounds that he would be eligible for government subsidy. Nagendra, who pondered over the offer, gave in imagining that he could rent the tractor and make a decent income out of it. A few months later, he defaulted on the EMI and the private financiers were at his doorsteps pressurising him to repay the pending amount.

This led the farmers of the region to stage a protest and a counter complaint was registered against the private financiers on charges of harassing farmers. Though Nagendra asked the financiers to take away the tractor, the latter insist on repayment of loan and threatened to drag him to court.

Such incidents are not new. But, in recent times, more farmers are opting to buy tractors without considering the economic implications and falling into the debt trap.

Besides, there is also a false sense of pride that is associated with owning a tractor among people in rural hinterland, as a result of which many of them fall prey to the tractor loan schemes, Mr. Shanthakumar added.

“This is mostly an issue with private financiers as public sector banks release loans based on the extent of land held. It is minimum of five acres in case of wet land and 10 acres in case of dry land,” according to a senior official in one of the banks. Tractors are financially viable in case of large landholdings but most farmers own about 2 to 3 acres of land and hence, it is not economically viable.

At a time when the agricultural sector is in crisis and income from farming activity is on the decline, farmers continue to fall prey to smooth and glib talking salesmen who are selling them tractors. So much so that a small village with about 100 families in Kurubur has nearly 35 tractors and this is widely prevalent in rural areas, said Mr. Shanthakumar. Hence, the association plans to caution and launch an awareness drive about the cost-economic benefits of renting agricultural machinery, including tractors, rather than outright purchase.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5v9xht/article30924752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGTRACTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pride-in-tractor-ownership-driving-farmers-in-rural-areas-into-debt-trap/article30924753.ece
123,2020/02/26,Kateel sees Congress conspiracy behind Delhi riots,"The Congress hatched a conspiracy to organise riots in Delhi, BJP State unit president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said in Chikkodi on Wednesday.

He was participating in a swearing-in ceremony for new office-bearers of the party unit there.

“The Congress is playing politics by setting fire to the nation. There have been uninterrupted protests in Delhi for the last two or three months. They were peaceful and there was no violence. The government did not use force against them. Neither the Centre nor the State governments tried to evict these protesters. They closed the road and were protesting. The case went to court. Just when U.S. President Donald Trump was to visit Delhi, the riots started. Why? How did the violence coincide with the visit? That is because the Congress wants to malign this country, the Union government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. The Congress is behind all this,” he said.

“We see that young protesters are carrying guns. From where did they get those weapons? These are all questions we need to raise now,” he added. He said that some vested political interests had provided arms to the young protesters.

Earlier in Belagavi, Mr. Kateel said that the Congress was orchestrating riots across the country. “This is nothing but anti-national mentality,” he said. Congress leaders are doing this only to bring a bad name to the Prime Minister. Earlier, Congress leader Siddaramaiah had extended support to the sand mafia and cow slaughterers. Several Hindu activists were killed during the rule of H.D. Kumaraswamy, he said.

He said that it was a matter of pride that Mr. Trump had addressed Mr. Modi as his brother. He is the President of the same U.S. that had denied visa to Mr. Modi, Mr. Kateel said.

133,2020/02/26,Deputy Commissioners will monitor upcoming SSLC exam: Suresh Kumar,"Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar on Tuesday said the SSLC examination, scheduled to be held in March and April, would be conducted with utmost care and caution, with the Deputy Commissioners of all districts shouldering the responsibility of conducting them smoothly.

The Minister was replying to a question from a student during an interactive session with SSLC students at a private school in Nanjangud near here. The student, citing the recent question paper leak during the SSLC preparatory exam, asked the Minister whether such incidents would not cause anxiety and panic among the students preparing for the board examination.

Mr. Kumar, in his reply, said the question papers for preparatory exam were given three days in advance to the heads of schools, and the leak occurred owing to the indifference of the authorities. “There is no need to panic as the SSLC examination will be conducted with the DCs overseeing the process,” he said.

In another question to the Minister, a student asked why the State could consider introducing multiple sets of question papers, as is done by the CBSE for its Class 10 examination for apparently dealing with question paper leaks. The Minister said the matter would be discussed at the next meeting of the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board. “However, the CBSE follows multiple question paper sets for catering to students who are ‘average’ as well as ‘intelligent’. We consider our students as intelligent, and accordingly prepare only one set of question papers for each subject,” he said.

When asked whether he had felt examination pressure when he was in school, Mr. Kumar said, “We had no pressure and we used to play during exam season. In our times, there was tuition for average students, but now even very good students go for tuition.”

‘It is a festival’

The Minister advised students not to get unnecessary confused, as this would not be the only examination they would face. “As Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, examination is not a war, it is a festival. Therefore, enjoy writing the exam. Most importantly, give importance to your health,” he said.

Mr. Kumar also said the SSLC question paper pattern had been modified this year for developing writing skills among students. “This will help them in higher education and won’t be causing any inconvenience to students,” he said.

Mr Kumar also advised parents not to exert unnecessary pressure on their children for more marks. He advised them to establish a favourable atmosphere for them at home during exam season and to firm up their confidence.

On the occasion, 25 teachers were conferred with awards in recognition of their teaching skills. MLA Harshavardhan, joint director Rajendra and DDPI Panduranga were present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/deputy-commissioners-will-monitor-upcoming-sslc-exam-suresh-kumar/article30917231.ece
134,2020/02/26,Administrative reforms in State on the cards,"5-member Cabinet sub-committee to take a call

The State administration could be in for rationalisation in the near future with the merger of some departments and removal of cadres that do not fit, besides the transfer of officials from over-staffed to under-staffed departments.

Secretariat sources confirmed that discussions have been taking place on the merger of departments to help ensure better functioning. Departments like the sericulture one have field staff beyond the traditional mulberry growing area where there is hardly any work, while the Agriculture Department has nearly 50% staff shortage on field and is struggling to maintain Krishi Samparka Kendras that are of utmost importance to reach programmes to farmers, sources said.

While the Treasury Department with more work is struggling with staff shortage, staff in the small savings directorate, KGID and others where work has reduced, can be merged, sources said. “With promotions happening, many departments are also facing shortage of staff at the field level, hampering the implementation of government work,” they pointed out.

When the matter came up before the last Cabinet, it was decided to set up a five-member Cabinet sub-committee to study the issue and report to the government. “The positives of many recommendations of the Karnataka Administrative Reforms (ARC) Commission headed by the late Harnahalli Ramaswamy that were implemented, have been nullified over the years. Bureaucracy needs to be made effective,” said a Cabinet Minister.

Incidentally, the latest move on administrative reforms comes nearly two decades after the recommendations made by Karnataka ARC. The recommendation of 6th Pay Commission had also included rationalisation to boost efficiency.

“The matter was taken up informally during the Cabinet meeting, but received good support with many Ministers acknowledging the need for reforms in bureaucracy that led to the formation of the sub-committee,” a Minister told The Hindu. He said at least ₹65,000 crore of the total budget size of ₹2.34 crore goes towards the payment of salaries and pension. It was imperative that the work has to be rationalised. “For example, in the engineering cadre, there is huge duplicity of work with several engineers from different departments doing the same work when one engineer could do all of it. These are highly-paid engineers but under-employed due to wrong postings.”

The Minister further pointed out the problem in Indian Forest Service officers deployment. “The allotment of IFS to a State is based on the extent of forests. In Karnataka, due to the increased number of IFS officials, we have IFS officers deployed to universities, academies and zilla panchayats, among other places. What does forest official have to do with these postings?”

Sources said that the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR) has now sought the opinion of several departments before it issues the order. “It is still not clear whether a commission will be set up or the Cabinet sub-committee will deal with the matter. The current inclination is to set up a committee,” an official said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8n53l9/article30917219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGVIDHANASOUDHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/administrative-reforms-in-state-on-the-cards/article30917220.ece

143,2020/02/26,Kisan Sabha to intensify stir against Centre,"Protest against ‘anti-farmer policies’ of the govt.

The All India Kisan Sabha annual State meet that concluded at Adoor on Wednesday decided to intensify the agitation against the anti-farmer policies of the Union government.

The meeting also maintained that the LDF government in the State that raised objections against the Centre’s anti-farmer policies was the only hope for the people. The Centre that allotted flood-relief of ₹5,908.54 crore to seven States in 2019 consciously excluded Kerala from the list of beneficiary States, disregarding the floods that wreaked havoc in northern Kerala, the meeting alleged. The Union government had even cut the State’s credit limit, besides leaving the State’s share of GST worth ₹3,000 crore in arrears, the Kisan Sabha alleged. The meeting alleged that the State was yet to receive the Centre’s contribution worth ₹1,035 crore for procuring paddy.

144,2020/02/26,‘Tender cancellation vindicates Oppn. stance’,"Graft alleged in ₹180-cr. traffic project

The recommendation of the technical committee to cancel the tender for the ₹180-crore Integrated Digital Traffic Enforcement System vindicates the Opposition’s charge that corruption is rampant in the higher echelons of the State police, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said.

He was speaking to reporters here on Wednesday.

90% from fines

“The move was to entrust a private company with the installation of surveillance cameras and to check traffic violations.

The firm would keep 90% of the amount generated from fines. The issue will not end with the cancellation of the tender. A comprehensive probe should be conducted to find those behind the corruption,” Mr. Chennithala said.

The Leader of the Opposition further alleged corruption in the implementation of ₹160-crore Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS). “The contract signed with Galaxion for the CIMS project should be cancelled immediately,” he said.

Mr. Chennithala alleged that phones of the Leader of the Opposition and mediapersons were being tapped by the police.

“Ever since the corruption against the police came to the fore, they are engaged in tapping my phone along with some journalists,” he said.

He said that the State was facing an acute financial crisis and termed the decision to hire a helicopter for various operational purposes of the police ‘extravagant.’

The district Animal Husbandry Department will begin the first phase of the preventive vaccination drive against the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) under the National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) in Kottayam on Thursday.

According to Philomina, deputy director, district Animal Husbandry office, all arrangements have been made to complete the vaccination drive within the scheduled period of 21 working days.

“In the first phase, vaccine will be given only to cows and buffaloes. The vaccination will be done completely free of cost,” she said.

The NADCP aims to control the disease before 2025 and to completely eradicate it by 2030, thereby achieving self-sufficiency in the production of milk and meat, boosting the export of meat and increasing the revenue of farmers.

Officials said calves should be given primary vaccination at the age of 4-5 months and its booster dose should be given after a period of one month. The preventive vaccination should be given twice a year with an interval of six months.

A 41-year-old tribal forest beat officer (watchman), A.S. Biju of Laha Anjilimoodu, was killed when a wild elephant attacked him on Wednesday afternoon. The elephant had strayed into human habitation near Madanthamon Vaaruchal area, adjoining the reserve forests in Ranni taluk.

The incident occurred at Chembanoly Moonnekkar Thottumkal curve, hardly a kilometre from the Rajampara Forest Station limits, around 3 p.m.

Biju, along with a few local people and Forest Rapid Response Team personnel, was trying to force the violent pachyderm return to the forests by bursting crackers.

147,2020/02/26,KSEB directed to shift electric posts,"For work under KIIFB-funded Kuttoor-Kizhakkan Muthoor road project

Electricity Minister M.M. Mani and Kerala State Electricity Board Chairman N.S.Pillai have directed board officials to shift all electric posts that posed hurdles to the ongoing development work under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board-funded Kuttoor-Kizhakkan Muthoor road development project.

In a statement here on Wednesday, Mathew T.Thomas, MLA, said that the decision was taken at an official meeting convened by the Minister here on Tuesday.

75% complete

The Public Works Department undertook the road development project 16 months ago and almost 75% of the work has been completed.

However, many electric posts standing on the developed road portion have been posing problems for the contractors to complete the raising and surfacing of the road. The MLA said 480 persons have surrendered the land required for developing the 12-km stretch of the road to national standards. Meanwhile, KIIFB had rejected the estimate of ₹1.14 crore for shifting 12 electric posts, finding it exorbitant, disrupting the roadwork three weeks ago. Shaji Mathew, director of Palathra Constructions Limited that has undertaken the ₹26.8-crore road work, said the KSEB had demanded ₹91,686 for shifting two electric posts, which, he said, has no justification at all.

Remitted later

The MLA had taken up the matter with the Minister and the KSEB Chairman, who, in turn, directed the board officials to shift the posts on an emergency basis, after obtaining an undertaking from the PWD authorities that the cost incurred for the work would be remitted later.

PWD Executive Engineer Anilkumar and Asistant Executive Engineer Subhash said the raising of the road and its resurfacing could be completed in two weeks itself, once the KSEB removed the electric posts from the road portion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/urymq2/article30925628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv27electdidpo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kseb-directed-to-shift-electric-posts/article30925619.ece
148,2020/02/26,Shifting of KIP offices opposed,"Will affect the irrigation project: MP

N.K. Premachandran, MP, has sent a letter to the Minister of Water Resources against the move to shift the Kallada Irrigation Project (KIP) circle office and annexes.

“Stopping the operations and shifting the offices to other places will affect the functioning of the project. What we need now is consistent monitoring along with steps to ensure irrigatio. Preventing encroachments in the area, dam maintenance, protection and maintenance of canals, monitoring the reservoir water level and flood control are more important, the current move cannot be justified,” he said.

The KIP, the largest irrigation project in Kerala, had four circle offices, 22 division offices along with sub-division and section offices in the beginning. At present the project has two circle offices located in Kottarakara and Kollam, seven sub-division offices and 21 section offices. The Right Main Canal (RMC) of the project is 69.7 km long with its three branches running up to 53.1 km and it has been irrigating vast areas in Kallam, Pathanamthitta and Alapuzha districts. The Left Main Canal (LMC) is 56.01 km long with its three branches running up to 61.7 km.

“During summer months the canal water is released to solve drinking water shortage in all the three districts. Along with paddy other crops, including coconut, areca nut, banana, pepper and vegetables, are being cultivated in the area. Instead of shifting the offices, they should be operated in a more efficient manner,” Mr. Premachandran said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/shifting-of-kip-offices-opposed/article30925601.ece
149,2020/02/26,QR codes in all textbooks for classes 8 to 12 next year,"This will promote a culture of self-learning among students

The General Education Department will introduce QR codes in all textbooks for classes 8 to 12 in the next academic year.

This follows the success of the Diksha programme for grades 9 and 10 in the current academic year. Diksha was launched on recognising the role of good digital content in enhancing teaching and improving learning outcomes.

As part of Diksha, ‘energised’ (QR-code imposed) textbooks were introduced for students of classes 9 and 10. The QR codes were placed at hard spots identified by subject experts. A total of 1,703 QR codes were placed in 108 textbooks across four mediums – Malayalam, English, Tamil, and Kannada.

The QR codes simplified access to digital content, developed by a pool of trained teachers from across the State for topics in the syllabus, providing interactive audio-visual content and illustrations. This made learning more interesting and promoted a culture of self-learning among students.

Since the beginning of the academic year, the QR codes have clocked 85 lakh scans. The usage is particularly high during the examination season. While there were 3.65 lakh scans in a 10-day period during Onam examination, it went up to 5.5 lakh scans during Christmas period.

To cater to students’ demands, additional resources that would help in examination preparation had been added to the last QR code of the class 10 English textbooks, a statement from the State Council of Educational Research and Training said.

150,2020/02/26,Census authorities for updating NPR in State,"‘No document or biometrics will be collected’

The National Population Register (NPR) will be updated in Kerala despite the opposition of the State government to the project.

Vivek Joshi, Registrar General and Census Commissioner, has informed the Chief Secretary that “State government officials will be deployed for the Census field work from April 15 to May 29 and the same officials will carry out the NPR updating too.”

Comprehensive database

“The objective of the NPR, created in 2010 and updated in 2015, is to have a comprehensive database of usual residents in the country,” he said.

After West Bengal, Kerala was the second State to declare that it would not update the register. With widespread apprehension that the updating would eventually lead to the preparation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), several sections of society had come out against the programme.

Govt. stand

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, while repeatedly asserting that the State would not update the register, had stated that the government would cooperate with the Census. The Census authorities plan to update the NPR from April to September this year along with the first phase of the Census. As the controversy raged, the State government and the Census Directorate, Kerala, had omitted all references to the NPR from the communications related to Census to avoid social friction in the State.

In his letter, the Registrar General noted that “there is no reason for any apprehension among any section of society"" and “at present, there is no proposal to create countrywide NRC. No document or biometrics is being collected during the NPR updating.” Incidentally, the official has also acknowledged the State's stand towards the NPR in his communication.

“The Principal Secretary of the General Administration Department has intimated that all activists connected with the updating of NPR have been stayed in Kerala,” he said.

The letter also indicated that “a pre-test for the Census and the NPR updating was conducted from August 12 to September 30, 2019 in all the States, including Kerala.” The training for the national trainers and master trainers for Kerala had already been completed, the Census authorities said.

Mr. Joshi solicited the cooperation of the State for the “successful conduct of training for the field staff and the timely stay of the NPR updating work in the State.” CPI(M) sources said the government had already made its stand clear on the issue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/oxopo7/article30926548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVKIUNIONHOMESECRETARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/census-authorities-for-updating-npr-in-state/article30924009.ece
151,2020/02/26,NCP may consider a debutant,"Party leadership meet in Kochi on Thursday may take a call on the candidate

The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is likely to consider a debutant for the Kuttanad Assembly byelection.

Party leadership meetings scheduled to be held in Kochi on Thursday are likely to take a call on the candidate for the seat that fell vacant following the death of Thomas Chandy, sources privy to the process told The Hindu.

Brother stakes claim

Chandy’s brother Thomas K. Thomas has staked a claim for the seat, but neither the NCP nor the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leadership is favourably inclined to fielding him. This has eventually prompted the party to explore other options and the leadership may opt for a new face, preferably a woman candidate, sources said.

A split in the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena, a prominent constituent of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, is likely to spoil the chances of the alliance in Kuttanad, considered to be one of the party’s strongholds in the State.

The BJP State leadership is yet to make a serious bid to revive the NDA and it does not seem to have sufficient time to put the alliance in order before the byelection. Ironing out a settlement between two factions of the BDJS is rather a tough proposition.

Buoyed over the victory of the Left Democratic Front in a string of Assembly byelections held recently, especially by NCP leader Mani C. Kappen in Pala, the front is facing the bypoll with confidence. But the LDF is unlikely to leave anything to chance and would be cautious in candidate selection. Fielding a debutant is seen as a better option than experimenting with others.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7ikm9s/article30926606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/image,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncp-may-consider-debutant-for-kuttanad/article30923506.ece
152,2020/02/26,UDF may go tough on Kuttanad,"Crucial meet in Kochi on February 29 to work out deal

Even as the standoff between the warring Kerala Congress (M) factions over the Kuttanad seat continues, all eyes are now on a high power committee meeting convened by the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kochi on February 29.

The meeting, to be attended by IUML leader P.K. Kunhalikutty, senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy, KC(M) faction leader P.J. Joseph and Jose K. Mani, is expected to work out a deal between the rival groups.

“Considering that the bypoll is most likely to take place in the second half of April and that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has almost zeroed in on its candidate, the UDF cannot allow the KC(M) groups to continue with their self-defeating war as witnessed during the Pala byelection. Hence, a final decision regarding the allocation of seat will be taken during this meeting,’’ said a senior UDF leader.

While Mr. Joseph has already expressed his interest in fielding Jacob Abraham as the candidate, the rival group has kick started candidate selection procedure for the seat. As part of it, a sub-committee led by Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, held consultations with party workers and leaders at Ramankaray on Wednesday.

According to Mr. Chanzhikadan, suggestions have been received from the party leaders and office-bearers from the Kuttanad Assembly segment and based on it, the committee will prepare a list of possible candidates for consideration of the party high power committee. Besides the MP, senior party leaders, including Joseph M. Puthussery, V.T. Joseph, V.C. Francis and Jacob Thomas Arikupuram took part in the interactions.

Meanwhile, rumours are rife that the Joseph group may be open to a proposal on giving the seat to the Congress in exchange of the Muvattupuzha seat. According to these reports, senior leader Joseph Vazhakkan and the Alappuzha District Congress Committee president M. Liju were among the names under consideration of the Congress as its candidate in Kuttanad.

The group leaders, however, sought to dismiss these reports at the first place and pointed out that the seat belonged to the Joseph group since 1979. “It was the KC(M) founder K.M. Mani, who issued a whip for Mr. Abraham to contest in the Assembly election of 2016,’’ said a senior Joseph group leader.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qq0ylq/article30926569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/image,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-may-go-tough-on-kuttanad-seat/article30923359.ece
153,2020/02/26,IUML delegation to visit riot-hit regions in Delhi,"They will meet Shah, Kejriwal and Sonia on Thursday

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) State working committee has sought the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the indifference of the Delhi police in preventing the riots that occurred there for the last few days.

A meeting of the committee chaired by party State president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal here on Wednesday decided to sent a delegation comprising MPs and MLAs to take stock of the situation in riot-hit areas of north-east Delhi on Thursday. It demanded that the police file a case against BJP leader Kapil Mishra for his allegedly provocative speeches that aggravated the volatile situation in Delhi.

The delegation, including national general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, organising secretary E.T. Mohammed Basheer, treasurer P.V. Abdul Wahab, all MPs; State general secretary K.P.A.Majeed; Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly M.K. Muneer; and Lok Sabha Parliamentary Chief Whip Navas Kani; will meet the Union Home Minister, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and other Opposition leaders and hold discussions with them.

The meeting deplored the Delhi police for allowing the Sangh Parivar elements to have a free run against the people carrying out peaceful protests against the recently legislated Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The police remained mute spectators when rioters went on rampage attacking people and property. It was a shame for Indians that the violence took place in Delhi when U.S. President Donald Trump was on a visit to India, Mr. Kunhalikutty said.

The party accused the LDF government of trying to weaken the anti-CAA stir in the State. Even now the government remained ambiguous about the process of the National Population Register.

The meeting flayed Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for casting aspersions on former judge of the Kerala High Court B. Kemal Pasha who had taken a strong stand against the CAA. It was unfortunate that the government chose to be intolerant against those criticising its policies, it said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iuml-delegation-to-visit-riot-hit-regions-in-delhi/article30923010.ece
154,2020/02/26,Maoist posters appear at Ambayathode town,"Handwritten posters allegedly put up by Maoists, calling for a ‘revolt’ against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and boycott of the Census, surfaced at Ambayathode town, near Kottiyoor, here on Wednesday.

The posters, in the name of the Western Ghats special zone committee of the CPI (Maoist), appeared two days after a four-member Maoist team reportedly visited the Aralam farm and collected rice and other items from houses there.

Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan are having the same stance with regard to the CAA, the poster said adding both the Centre and State are trying to implement the CAA.

The posters cautioned against the ‘communal agenda’ of ‘fundamentalist organisations’ such as the Popular Front of India (PFI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) against the backdrop of anti-CAA protests. “Resist the attempts of the PFI and SDPI to implement their fundamentalist communal agenda by making use of the communist-Maoist and Dalit organisations,” it read in Malayalam.

The poster also targeted the Chief Minister over his stand on Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act cases and alleged that he was hand-in-glove with the Centre. It further claimed that the letter sent by Mr. Vijayan to the Centre seeking to transfer the case against two students who were charged under the UAPA for their suspected Maoist links back to the Kerala Police was an attempt to hoodwink the people.

The Kelakam police have registered a case and the Special Branch of the Kerala Police has started an investigation into the matter. ‘‘The posters were found in the morning and we were informed by the locals. It’s mainly against the CAA,’’ the police said.

The Maoists had visited the place and pasted posters two months ago.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/80ywsv/article30922912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mavpist-poster,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maoist-posters-appear-at-ambayathode-town/article30922913.ece
155,2020/02/26,Guruvayur temple elephant dies at 84,"The elephant Guruvayur Padmanabhan was presented to the temple by two brothers from Ottapplam in 1954.

An elephant credited with carrying the “Thidambu” – the miniature of the presiding deity of Lord Krishna of Guruvayur temple – for several decades during temple rituals died on Wednesday at the age of 84, a top Gurvayur Devaswom official said.

The elephant named Guruvayur Padmanabhan, who gained the title of ‘Gajaratnam’ due to his attractive features such as long trunk touching the ground and well-carved shape, died at 2.10 p.m., Guruvayur Devaswom Chairman K.B. Mohandas told the PTI.

He said the tusker had been undergoing treatment for the last few weeks after it suffered swelling on its body.

With the death of Padmanabhan, the number of pachyderms in the elephant sanctuary managed by Guruvayur Devaswom has come down to 47, he said.

Padmanabhan, one of the oldest elephants in the captivity, was much sought-after during the temple festivals across the State including famous Thrissur Pooram.

He got the highest pay of ₹2.22 lakh in 2014 for participating in famous Nenmara-Vellangi Vela festival in Palakkad district in 2004, temple officials said.

The elephant was kept at Anakkotta (the elephant sanctuary) located in the vicinity of the Guruvayur temple.

The sanctuary managed by the Devaswom attracts a number of devotees and tourists visiting the temple town every year. When Padmanabhan was brought to Guruvayur in 1954, there were only few elephants there. The elephant was caught from the Nilambur forest. He was presented to the Guruvayoor temple by two brothers from Ottapplam in 1954, temple officials said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tzedpj/article30922419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26IN-ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/guruvayur-temple-elephant-dies-at-84/article30922069.ece

A comprehensive dry season bird survey that concluded in the North Wayanad forest division of the district on Monday recorded 166 species.

The three-day survey was organised jointly by the State Forest Department and Hume Centre for Ecology and Wildlife Biology as a part of the ambitious Kerala Bird Atlas Project, an ongoing citizens’ science project in the State.

When the project would be completed, it could provide a complete profile of bird distribution and abundance in the State, said C.K. Vishnudas, district coordinator of the bird atlas project.

As many as 10 species of raptors such as Egyptian vulture, crested serpent eagle, Oriental honey buzzard, shikra, crested goshawk, common buzzard, rufous-bellied eagle, common kestrel, white-eyed buzzard and black eagle were sighted from the North Wayanad mountain ranges during the survey. Raptors come under Schedule I species of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and have apex predator status in an ecosystem, said Mr.Vishnudas. The Egyptian vulture was spotted at the Brahmagiri hill region.

Seven species of pigeons, eight species of woodpeckers, four species of drongos, six species of bulbuls and nine species of babblers were also recorded.

A rare sighting of blue-breasted quail was recorded at the Banasura grasslands. Endemic birds including grey-headed bulbul, Malabar grey hornbill, rufous babbler, Nilgiri wood pigeon, Nilgiri flycatcher, white-bellied treepie, flame-throated bulbul, white-bellied blue flycatcher, crimson-backed sunbird and Malabar barbet were spotted in various parts of the region.

The police have arrested seven persons for allegedly kidnapping and murdering a 22-year-old daily wage worker at Kottakuppam on the East Coast Road on Monday evening.

The police gave the names of the arrested as Arun Kumar, 22, Dinesh alias Praveen Kumar, 23, Ranjith Kumar, 25, Prakash, 40, of Kottakuppam Colony, and Santhosh, 19, Balaji, 21, and Sanjay, 20, of Samipillaithottam in Puducherry.

S. Raghavan of Periya Kottakuppam was riding his bike along with his friend Sivanesan on the Kottakuppam bypass when the accused waylaid and kidnapped him. They later took Raghavan to a farm land behind a local temple at Kottakuppam and allegedly murdered him.

The police said Raghavan was in love with a woman hailing from the same area. The woman’s family opposed their relationship following which she reportedly committed suicide in her house on February 22.

The woman’s uncle planned to eliminate Raghavan and he convinced the victim’s friend Sanjay to bring him to Kottakuppam. When Raghavan arrived with his friend Sivanesan, the gang led by Prakash kidnapped him after assaulting Sivanesan, the police said.

They took Raghavan to a secluded spot behind a temple and allegedly hacked him to death. They later allegedly doused the body with petrol and burnt it, the police said.

160,2020/02/26,Edappadi says proof documents not compulsory for NPR,"The Chief Minister said there was no need to provide documents to verify details under the National Population Register

With reference to the National Population Register (NPR), the Centre has clarified that there is no need to provide documents to prove the details provided. Submission of documents for proof was not compulsory, and therefore, this was acceptable in the State, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Wednesday.

Speaking to the media after supervising construction work at Mukkombu barrage, Mr. Palaniswami said, “As for the NPR, it was introduced in 2003 during the then NDA regime of which the Dravida Munnetra Kazham was a part. The Congress-led government at the Centre implemented the NPR across the country in 2010. The DMK government implemented it in the State in 2011.”

In addition to the original format of the NPR, the Centre had included three more aspects this year: language, birthplace of parents and Aadhar identity card, voter identity card and family card. The Centre had also provided an option for the people to furnish these details. “If they have the documents, they can submit them. Else, the details can be left out. It is not compulsory..” Mr. Palaniswami added.

When his attention was drawn to the resolution passed against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the Bihar Assembly ruled by an ally of the NDA, Mr. Palanisamy had a short reply: “It is under the consideration of the State government.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/brvh6i/article30922324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTH-EDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/edappadi-says-proof-documents-not-compulsory-for-npr/article30922325.ece

Anna University’s Syndicate has decided to appoint retired professors to teach students. The University has not been able to appoint faculty to vacant posts pending petitions in the court for over two years.

The University’s Annual Quality Assurance Report 2017-18 has listed 193 vacancies and no posts were filled that year. Professors say vacancies could be over 200 as a few more faculty members have retired.

A senior professor said such appointments had been made earlier too, by the University.

University Vice Chancellor M.K. Surappa said such a scheme existed in all universities across the country.

No of faculty appointed in 2017-18

“The scheme is designed to use the services of eminent faculty, not from other States but from within the State. Central institutions such as the IITs and the IISc followed this method. The emeritus professors could apply to national agencies for funds and research projects and fellowships. The appointment would only be for a limited period and the retired faculty would be hired from within the State,” he said.

Though the Syndicate had approved a salary component of around ₹1.20 lakh, the University had not yet implemented it. An IIT professor had chosen NIT over the University as the salary was poor here, Mr. Surappa said.

But a senior faculty pointed to a government order denying re-employment for University teachers beyond 60 years of age.

163,2020/02/26,Containers from China stranded at Chennai Port get clearance,"Chennai Customs has waived late fee for Bills of Entry

After several days, containers from China stranded at the Chennai Port have got clearance. Nearly 120 containers have been taken out and 100 more are waiting, sources said.

Owing to the COVID-19 epidemic, most of the offices in China were shut and documents having details of the consignees were lying there. Hence, the containers could not be cleared, sources said.

Now, in a big relief to consignees and agents, Chennai Customs has waived late fee for Bills of Entry (BoE) that are filed late. “Keeping in view the exigency because of COVID-19 in China and in order to facilitate clearance of the consignments, it is decided in the public interest that Bills of Entry filed late for clearance of import consignments from China will not attract any late fee charges...” the circular read.

BoE shows information of goods in the container, like its type and quantity and where it came from.

After a container gets to the port, the consignee or the agent should file the BoE within a day, failing which they have to pay a penalty of ₹5,000 for first three days and ₹10,000 for every day after that, sources said. “Now, the consignees and the agents have found alternative ways; they have now shown a copy of the original document and getting it cleared; later, they have to produce the original and get it regularised,” another source said.

Chennai Customs also has set up a help desk to resolve issues that arise out of late filing of BoE in getting documents from Chinese supplier, the circular said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/containers-from-china-stranded-at-chennai-port-get-clearance/article30917498.ece
164,2020/02/26,Two teachers sentenced under POCSO,"Acquittal order of Mahila Court reversed

The Madras High Court on Tuesday sentenced two teachers of a government girls’ higher secondary school in Chengalpattu to five and three years of rigorous imprisonment for having sexually harassed many Class XI and XII students in 2012. It expressed regret about its inability in awarding much severe punishment owing to the trial court’s failure to frame charges under stringent provisions of law.

After reversing the March 2018 acquittal order of a Mahila Court in Chengelpet, Justice P. Velmurugan said, “unfortunately” the trial court had framed charges under limited provisions of law and he could not convict them beyond those charges without affording them an opportunity of defence. Further, it would not be proper to order retrial in the case at this stage considering the future of the victims, he said.

The judge pointed out that the convicts G. Nagaraj and G. Pugazhenthi were teaching Chemistry and Physics respectively. They often sexually assaulted girl students by touching their private parts. The students were threatened of being awarded less marks in practical examinations, part of the public examinations, if they divulged the happenings in the school to their parents.

However, one of the girls informed her mother who took the assistance of a local All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) leader to lodge a complaint with the Collector as well as the Superintendent of Police in January 2013. Yet, there was no action and a First Information Report was registered only after the victims and the activists held protests.

Subsequently, they had to stage one more protest to get the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of 2012 included in the FIR.

Though as many as eight students deposed against a judicial magistrate regarding the activities of the two teachers, four turned hostile during the trial. Hence, the Mahila Court acquitted the accused for non examination of all 20 students in the class.

Justice Velmurugan disagreed with the decision of the trial court while allowing an appeal preferred by the complainant through her counsel K.C. Karl Marx. The judge held that the deposition of the four victims clearly proved the guilt of the accused.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/two-teachers-sentenced-under-pocso/article30917472.ece
165,2020/02/26,Report sought on plea about 41 missing case diaries relating to idol thefts,"PIL favours constitution of a team under retired police officer to prosecute those responsible

The Madras High Court on Tuesday sought the response of the State government as well as the Idol Wing-Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on a complaint of as many as 41 case diaries relating to various idol theft cases registered across the State having gone missing mysteriously.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha called for a report following a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate ‘Elephant’ G. Rajendran seeking the constitution of a team headed by a retired police officer to prosecute politicians, police officers and others responsible for the missing case diaries.

Relying upon information obtained by him under the Right to Information Act of 2005 when retired Inspector General of Police (IGP) A.G. Ponn Manickavel was heading the Idol Wing CID in March 2018, the advocate asserted that as many as 41 case diaries had been either stolen or gone missing. He pointed out that in reply to his queries under the RTI Act, the police department had conceded that three files relating to idol thefts reported in Tiruvannamalai district, 12 from Tiruvallur and five from Cuddalore falling under the North Zone of department could not be located and had gone missing.

Similarly, two each from Salem and Dharmapuri districts and one each from Krishnagiri, Erode and Namakkal falling under the West Zone had gone missing. In the South Zone too, three case diaries from Ramnathapuram district, two from Tirunelvei and one each from Theni and Thoothukudi were missing.

The highest number of seven case diaries from Perambalur district followed by six from Nagapattinam district had been reported in the Central Zone of the police department, the RTI reply stated. Wondering how case diaries that contain details of investigation could go missing, the litigant urged the court to take serious note of the issue.

He also suspected that the case diaries could have been stolen by police officials themselves at the behest of some politicians and Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department officials who were hand in glove with the idol theft offenders and insisted that a retired police official must be appointed to cull out the truth.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3pus5l/article30907773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/report-sought-on-plea-about-41-missing-case-diaries-relating-to-idol-thefts/article30917470.ece

So far, six persons have been arrested in this case.

According to police, on Sunday a youngster from Elathur village was reportedly riding through the Dalit colony as he was in a rush to meet his friend who was at a hospital.

Other villagers rushed Kalaiarasan to the Tiruvannamalai Government Medical College Hospital. However, he died on the way to the hospital.

Angered over the incident, youngsters from the Dalit colony set fire to the five bikes left behind by the attackers.

A complaint was lodged about the incident and policemen were deployed to prevent the quarrel from escalating.

Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Vellore range, N. Kamini, DIG, Vellore range, M.R. Sibi Chakravarthi, Superintedent of police, Tiruvannamalai and other officers visited the spot.

170,2020/02/26,CWMA drops discussion on Mekedatu dam,"TN, Puducherry oppose it at the meeting

Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday strongly objected to Karnataka’s bid to seek approval for the Mekedatu dam project at the fifth Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) meeting in New Delhi. Following the objections, the CWMA dropped the discussion on Karnataka’s application.

Tamil Nadu Public Works Department Principal Secretary K. Manivasan told mediapersons after the meeting that Tamil Nadu had consistently maintained that the dam should never be built and that two cases were pending before the Supreme Court.

“As per the directions of our Chief Minister, we strongly opposed Karnataka’s proposal for constructing the dam and informed the meeting about the cases at the Supreme Court and that this proposal should not be discussed,” he said.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had written to Union Minister for MoEF Prakash Javadekar in October last year objecting to Karnataka’s project proposal and that it had no right to construct a reservoir on an inter-State river without the consent of the lower riparian State.

171,2020/02/26,Commission to issue fresh summons to Rajinikanth,"Sealed questionnaire has been sent to actor

The Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission, which is probing the police firing on anti-Sterlite protesters that took place in Thoothukudi in 2018, has made it clear that actor Rajinikanth must appear before it to provide any information or evidence he may have in connection with the incident.

However, in the interim, the Commission has sent him a sealed questionnaire through his lawyer.

In response to a summons issued by the Commission, Mr. Rajinikanth, who had earlier claimed that anti-social elements had indulged in violence, on Tuesday submitted an affidavit seeking exemption from personal appearance. But the Commission was not inclined to grant him the relief.

Addressing reporters after Mr. Rajinikanth’s advocate Ilambharathi filed the affidavit, the Commission’s advocate, Arul Vadivel Sekar, pointed out that the actor, who had earlier stated that he would appear before the Commission if summoned, had subsequently sought exemption from personal appearance, saying his presence in Thoothukudi could cause problems to the public.

Moreover, he had to fulfil “professional commitments” he had made before receiving the summons. “Hence, the Commission has given a set of questions to the actor, who needs to file his reply in the form of an affidavit. Nonetheless, he will be asked to appear before the Commission on a fresh date, based on his replies,” Mr. Sekar said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/commission-to-issue-fresh-summons-to-rajinikanth/article30917223.ece
172,2020/02/26,Centre justifies reduced allocation of PDS kerosene to T.N.,"State has achieved very high LPG coverage and 100% electricity supply, Union govt. tells HC

The Central government has told the Madras High Court that it has substantially reduced the quantity of kerosene allocated to Tamil Nadu only because the State has achieved a very high rate of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) coverage, besides ensuring 100% electricity supply to households, as per the latest statistics.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan was told by the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that the number of LPG connections in the State had increased from 174.30 lakh out of 203.20 lakh households as of July 1, 2017, to 209.51 lakh out of 210.71 lakh households as of December 1, 2019.

The court was informed that as per the dashboard of the Union Ministry of Power, electricity coverage in Tamil Nadu had increased from 99.98% as of October 10, 2017, to 100% as of March 31, 2019. After recording these submissions, the judge dismissed a writ petition filed by the Tamil Nadu Kerosene Dealers’ Association.

In its affidavit, the association expressed concern over the Centre having reduced the allotment of kerosene to the State from 48,444 kl to 32,292 kl per quarter, to be supplied through the public distribution system (PDS). This had affected licensed wholesale dealers, who had invested a huge amount of money on creating infrastructure, it said.

The association alleged that there had been gross discrimination in per capita allocation of kerosene, with the Centre adopting varying standards for different States with Gujarat being given 17.2 litres per head, Goa – 16.2 litres, Maharashtra – 14.7 litres, Chandigarh – 14.9 litres, West Bengal – 11.1 litres and Tamil Nadu – just 6 litres per head..It was claimed that every consumer was entitled to an equal amount of kerosene under the Tamil Nadu Kerosene Control Order of 1973 and that the wholesale dealers were being forced to undergo heavy losses despite having invested huge amount of money for purchasing lands, constructing storage tanks and setting up machinery.

On its part, the Centre filed a detailed counter affidavit and justified the reduction in allocation to the State on the ground that it had been done on the basis of studies conducted a per the Superior Kerosene Oil Control Order of 1993. It stated that Centre basically allocated kerosene to different States only for cooking and illumination purposes.

Public sector oil marketing companies had to bear huge subsidies to the tune of ₹30,574 crore in 2013-14; ₹24,799 crore in 2014-15 and ₹11,496 crore in 2015-16. However, now that people were shifting to use of LPG, which was a relatively cleaner and environment-friendly fuel, the Centre had been reducing the quantity of kerosne allocation, it said.

Taking note of these submissions, the judge said the court could not examine the policy of the Centre while exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.

The petitioner association also do not enjoy any fundamental right to seek or compel the Centre to allocate a particular quantity of kerosene as desired by them, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-justifies-reduced-allocation-of-pds-kerosene-to-tn/article30917217.ece
173,2020/02/26,"Declare Eastern Ghats UNESCO cultural heritage sites, say environmental groups","‘Five States encompassed by the Ghats should come up with action plan’

All the historically and culturally significant mountains of the Eastern Ghats should be declared UNESCO cultural heritage sites, and the five States that the Ghats encompass – Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Odisha — should prepare an action plan to protect and conserve their ecology and natural resources, the Greens’ Alliance for Conservation of Eastern Ghats (GRACE) and the Council for Green Revolution (CGR) have said.

They have demanded that the Central government form a Regional Coordination Committee of States on Eastern Ghats with a mandate for linking and coordinating activities relating to the Ghats, and have sought the appointment of a Nature Ombudsman for the Eastern Ghats and the publication of an Environmental Atlas of the Eastern Ghats, incorporating various ecological, social, cultural and heritage information, among others. These were all laid out in a report titled ‘Eastern Ghats - Environment Outlook’, released here on Tuesday.

The report said the degradation of the Eastern Ghats, which began a century ago, had accelerated since the 1970s, and the ecosystem of the hills had lost their natural species composition, forest structure, size, scale and character.

According to the report, the situation was grave due to the threats and challenges to floral and faunal elements, and the bio-geographic significance of the Eastern Ghats was declining fast. “The time has come for all the local governments to ensure that the conservation of the Eastern Ghats and the regeneration of all its biodiversity are top priority,” the report said. “The region hosts wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves and Ramsar convention sites. However, a large part of the Eastern Ghats wilderness is yet to be covered under the conservation umbrella,” it added.

Session for MPs

“It is incumbent on the five States to make efforts to protect the fragile ecosystem that is home to nearly 5 million tribal people belonging to nearly 60 indigenous communities,” environmental scientist N. Sai Bhaskar Reddy said.

“A session for Members of Parliament from the five States is being planned to educate them about the gravity of the situation and the need to protect the Ghats, so that they can make efforts to bring in policy measures to ensure that the fragile ecosystem is protected,” he said.

“The tribes of the Eastern Ghats are stifled in conflicting interests between governments, corporate and neighbouring lowland societies and militants. Their lands have become sites for clandestine dumping of toxic waste, illegal mining, poaching and hunting, including human trafficking,” according to the report.

Former Madras High Court judge, Justice T. Mathivanan, who released the report, said, “I am afraid to know that nearly half of the forest ecosystem has been wiped out of the Eastern Ghats.” He added that the biological integrity of the Eastern Ghats had to be protected on a war-footing, and a Marshall Plan was needed for the revival of its natural glory and green cover and for ensuring that wildlife were free from the fear of extinction.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ki6bxm/article30917206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th26ghatscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/declare-eastern-ghats-unesco-cultural-heritage-sites-say-environmental-groups/article30917207.ece
174,2020/02/26,The ChangeChitra Film Festival 2020 and its mission to ignite social change,"The purpose of the films at the festival is to inspire people to get involved in social change, says founding director Jessica Mayberry

Some of the most compelling documentaries continue to leave a lasting mark on not just audiences, but on society and policy too. Blackfish, From Darkness To Light, Food Inc. and An Inconvenient Truth are just some that come to mind. However it is also worth looking at the untapped reservoir of projects in India made by people who care just as much for the ripple effect than for the art.

One of these reservoirs is from Video Volunteers and their touring ChangeChitra Film Festival, which comes to the city this weekend. Jessica Mayberry, its founding director, says the film festival received positive feedback from its first stop in Mumbai, where Kinaarpatti, a documentary about the Koli fishing community, did quite well. A TED fellow and having served on the board of WE Charity (formerly Free the Children), Jessica’s work focusses a lot on guiding filmmakers through a social activism channel.

Jessica Mayberry, founding director of Video Volunteers

Video Volunteers is a media, non-profit organisation which has been active for around 16 years. “Our main work is to get people from villages and rural communities to produce content on different social change issues. As India’s largest non-profit YouTube channel, VV produces around 3,000 short, web-ready videos a year for community audiences, panchayats and district offices,” explains Jessica, “The purpose of these films is to inspire people to get involved in social change and look at various social problems from a new perspective. Around 400 times a year, these videos are able to solve a problem.” The themes of the videos address the socially-stratified communities as well as institutionally-induced problems, but they also have audiences looking at themselves to solve issues.

‘Power of communication’

Eighteen months ago, VV received a grant from the US Embassy to train novice filmmakers to make documentaries. In total, there are 65 filmmakers, of which 15 are VV correspondents. Many of the other filmmakers work in NGOs, students, nascent filmmakers and people who essentially want to hone the power of communication and film for social change. Hyderabad, the second of the five festival legs, will see 16 films, though; one large screening will take place at a US Embassy venue while other screenings will be community screenings.

But the project does not cease at the film festival. Once the films go online, VV ensures that they are being used by appropriate groups and media partners. For example, a film about trafficking can be used by a group which fights against it. “Our projects should go beyond the screenings and properly advocate the causes mentioned. And when people at the film festival see it, a deeper discussion about the film and the bigger picture can take place,” comments Jessica. The final stops for the film festival are Chennai for March 6, Kolkata for March 11 and Delhi for March 20.

The line-up

Many of VV’s films are in Hindi, Bengali and Oriya but the festival ahead promises some content from the south. Nobody Knows! is a film by Ananya Pandey and Parij Borgohain from Telangana. The film follows the search of the elusive government agency responsible for reporting and developing a strategy to combat the rising crimes against women in the state. Another Brick In The Wall by Rana Prathap, Jogi Raju, Puli Sudheer and Jagdish Kumar from Andhra Pradesh – a young migrant worker and an underpaid graduate are just two other bricks in the wall of the system that might fall any minute. It is the quality of bricks, their arrangement and the system that holds them together that determine the nature and strength of the wall. These two films are not confirmed for screening at the festival, though.

Made In Madras by Shikha Kumari, Aishwarya Ashok and Mohit Arora from Tamil Nadu is about an 18-year-old girl from the streets of Chennai, who was a child labourer and winds up playing international football. Avalokanam by Dheeraj Aithal and Siddhartha Reddy from Bengaluru is an exploratory journey of an organic farmer’s life in solitude, which contrasts with the chemical-fuelled agricultural society around him.

Some projects relate to the ongoing NRC and CAA strifes and gender issues. Assam-based Indranee Kalita and Vikramjit Barua’s 2nd November centres on a mother who mourns the killing of her two sons, a daughter weeps for her father, and a wife describes the shootout of her husband in the midst of communal riots. Delhi-based Aatur Sharma, Vikas Yadav, Ashish Kumar, Alya Ekta, Mohd. Wazid and Ankita Menon’s Atah Nashedi narrates the journeys of drug addicts coming from myriad socio-economic classes. Then there is MangalaMukhi by Arpita Singh, Mohd. Zeeshan, Mohd. Ragib and Madhuri Chauhan from UP. This personal documentary shows us the lives of Guddi and Kanchi who struggle to survive as eunuchs, dealing with civil rights issues.

Venues and timings

The Hyderabad festival is scheduled for February 28 at St Francis College, Lamakaan on February 29, and Phoenix Arena on March 1.

The Chennai festival is scheduled for March 6 at the US Consulate-General Chennai, Anna Salai, besides a community screening with Sangeetha, Wall Tax Road on March 7 and on March 8 at The Hive, Thirumangalam.

175,2020/02/26,10 Years of ‘Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya’: Breaking down the greatness of ‘Aaromale’ in words,"On the 10th anniversary of Gautham Menon's 'VTV', we argue why ‘Aaromale’ is the single most defining moment in Karthik-Jessie’s relationship

There was a moment. She was ready to take the leap, leaving everything, everyone behind for him, perhaps for the first time. But that moment drifted away — like the long, fable-like night in Alappuzha, where they shared their first real kiss. “This is over. Please forget,” she texts him, on the pretext of walking out of his life. But he’s here. He’s come all the way. For her. It’s always been her. That’s the problem.

There’s pleasure in suffering, she knows. In fact, she treasures it. They talk it out. They argue. They debate, endlessly. And they part ways. He’s naturally perplexed. Because one day she smiles and the next day, she glares. She pushes him out of her life. While at it, she asks him a question that he himself had been trying to find an answer for, for the longest time: “There are a thousand women out there, why did you fall for me?”

His world just collapsed in front of his eyes. Nobody except her can hurt him, he knows. Maybe that’s why her seemingly innocent question pierces his heart, like a dagger. But he doesn’t show that. He’s a tough guy, boxer to be precise. A faint smirk escapes his face, as she closes the gate.

Karthik. Jessie.

It’s been 10 years since they broke up. Theirs isn’t the story about two marvellously messed up characters from the now-classic, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya. It’s as much your story as it’s mine.

Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya (VTV), the movie that prompted every engineer to contemplate a future in filmmaking; the movie that gave us fake hopes about train journeys; the movie that contributed to the sales of striped, blue cotton saris; the movie that made Christian weddings mainstream, has completed 10 years. But this article has less to do with the timeless nature of VTV and more to do with ‘Aaromale’ and the emotional depth that runs through the song.

The scene preceding ‘Aaromale’ is a crucial episode in Karthik’s life, that forms the backbone of the latter part of VTV. It’s when Nandini expresses her interest in him and plants an unplanned kiss on his cheek. It’s a clear violation of consensual borders, yes. But Karthik says/does nothing. Perhaps he’s clouded by the thoughts of the time he made a similar move on Jessie, on their train journey together. Perhaps that’s when it hits him that...she is still inside him. Perhaps that’s why, in the next scene, he says, “I’ve finally got an idea. I am going to write,” with a gentle guitar string, whose vibrations send a jolt through our hearts. This is where the wonderfully-worded, beautifully-composed and brilliantly-cut ‘Aaromale’ begins.

Let’s get this out of the way: no other filmmaker seizes the opportunity to capitalise on the filming location, the way Gautham Menon does. His frames effuse grace and elegance in equal proportion, even if it oft-comes at the expense of a lingering sense of deja vu for the audience. And let’s admit, he’s bloody-good at tricking us into buying his deceptively-simple world. By now, you must be aware that he holds a PhD in Montage Songs. But ‘Aaromale’, unlike ™ GVM songs, has a nested, meta structure in its broader scheme of things. What we see, essentially, is a song about a filmmaker with a writer’s block, struggling to write a movie about his life.

The first line that comes to Karthik’s mind | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Four and a half minutes. That’s all Gautham could afford. In that timeframe, he has to show the gradual, almost parallel progression of Karthik, the protagonist of VTV and the director of Jessie. They say art that births out of personal (tragedy?) marks the beginning of an artiste. In that sense, Karthik is a true artiste. He unearths his most personal story in ‘Aaromale’. And where does he begin? With this: “I think I’ll start with this line — Why Jessie?” Little nuggets of memories that he holds dear begin to unfold on a piece of paper. There’s a sketch of the house where he lived. There’s a sketch of the boat house and the church in Alappuzha. Of course, there’s Jessie. He revives and relives whatever life he has lived so far on the screen — like the bunch of VTV fanboys (this writer included) and girls who revisited the movie, when it had a re-release recently.

‘Aaromale’ is a visual exposition of Karthik’s internal struggle with the exterior world. The song dedicates most of its time to show his transformation as a filmmaker. Therefore, the real-life Karthik takes a back seat to ensure that the filmmaker wins. Only towards the end comes the definitive yet soul-crushing scene of the entire movie. Karthik is occupied with work, momentarily. He is shooting a song sequence somewhere in the US. Something is bothering him. Time hasn’t healed him unlike a Raghavan. Perhaps he feels a little alienated from the place, the people and the setting. He takes a quiet stroll and begins to see life as it is. Flashes of faces appear before him, only to be juxtaposed with his own facial expressions. He finds a familiar face amidst them.

When Karthik meets Jessie in the US | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

It’s her, Jessie. He takes a pause, to breathe. You take a pause, to breathe. What are the odds, you wonder. But the worst happens; she spots him too. Their eyes meet, with Alphonse Joseph letting out a shriek, extending the ‘Aaromaleee’ bit. Alphonse does a fantastic job in this portion of the song — as if it’s the voice of the Universe and it wants Karthik and Jessie to be together. She walks towards him, for the first time. His heartbeat touches a million — trust me, I carried BP tablets just for the sake of this scene. The song, that was projected as a time lapse video, gets a closure towards the end.

But that’s not the beauty of it. You realise it’s a clever ploy. Jessie never met Karthik on Brooklyn Bridge. If you come to think of the plausibility of events, it might even come across as absurd and unrealistic. Life doesn’t give you second chances. But, for a second, Gautham Menon convinced us that it does. He made us believe that they live happily ever after.

There are very few filmmakers who have the capacity to a) write and pull off a wholesome moment such as the Brooklyn Bridge sequence and b) pass on the emotional heft on to the audience. Gautham Menon, the quasi-Kodambakkam guy who makes ‘classy’ movies, is one.

Jessie walks away from Karthik in that scene, like the way she does throughout the movie. There’s a great chance that they might have moved on. But those of us, who queued up outside Thyagaraja Theatre on a bright day to watch the first-day, first-show in 2010 and later when it got a re-release, haven’t.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/amtv29/article30921845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MPVTV-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vinnaithaandi-varuvaaya-turns-10/article30921849.ece
176,2020/02/26,How Atharvaa’s ‘Kuruthi Aattam’ recreated the ‘Madurai effect’ in Chennai,"On the sets of the upcoming film directed by Sri Ganesh, which also stars Priya Bhavani Shankar and Radikaa Sarathkumar, we interact with artistes and behind-the-screen personalities who bring the scene to life

Films are alternate realms. It is the distinct feel generated by shooting locations should you ever walk into one of them.

Sample this: It is not uncommon to stumble into temple festivals (read: koil thiruvizha) in Chennai. But how often would you come across one where attendees look like they have been transplanted from the temple city of Madurai?

Men sporting handle bar and gunslinger moustaches, women draped in yellow saris and carrying steel pots with holy ash and/or sandal paste smeared onto them; neem leaves threaded to these vessels hanging from its necks, a Ferris wheel, Merry-go-round and shops selling anything from utensils, inflated and plastic toys, flowers, bangles and colour powder set up nearby to resemble a fair reminiscent of such festivals... the extent of such preparation points to director Sri Ganesh’s desire to turn fiction into reality.

Action extravaganza

For Ganesh, Kuruthi Aattam — starring Atharvaa Murali, Priya Bhavani Shankar and Radikaa Sarathkumar — is his sophomore film.

“It is a gangster film with Madurai as its backdrop. The action element may be the external layer but beyond it you would find this is a deeply emotional subject,” he says. The gangster part is quite evident in the banners erected around the “set”, which is actually a public ground abutting the Aavin Parlour in Virugambakkam.

It declares a warm welcome offered to “akka” — Radikaa, her image taking up more than 75% of the banner space — by fictional characters. “Gandhimathi akka is her name in the film,” says actor Kanna Ravi, who plays her son in the film.

Kanna’s last film Kaithi, where he played the undercover cop Ajaz Ahmed, also had actor Vatsan Chakravarthy, playing one of the four trapped college students inside a police station. Vatsan is the primary antagonist in Kuruthi Aattam.

The film crew has set up a fire bed (to enact a thee mithi vizha) using black and red-coloured thermocol illuminated by extra lights from a pit below to generate the desired effect, but there is more here than what meets the eye.

“This is a crucial scene in the film. We will find out what brought the hero here, and what happens to him,” says Ganesh, but Vatsan obliges us with a spoiler. “I make an attempt on Kanna’s life, but he escapes,” he smiles.

As we speak, we are joined by another young actor Prakash Raghavan and a familiar face, M Chandrakumar, whose debut novel Vetri Maaran turned into a film that became India’s official entry for the Oscars in 2016, Visaaranai.

Chandrakumar, 58, plays a jail bird, an aged don, while Prakash is part of the gangsters club, who meets him in prison.

The film is likely to feature as many as seven action sequences, we are told. Inspiring the young actors to attempt some of the stunt sequences on their own is Chandrakumar, who Vatsan is in awe of.

“I call him ayya. In one sequence, he scaled a 14 feet high wall and jumped to the ground. It was a jaw dropping moment for the three of us,” says Vatsan. Chandrakumar adds: “I’ve been trained in martial arts and I have been a gym master for 35 years. So it is alright with me.”

Secret superstars

With the crew taking a brief break to film a different sequence, Atharvaa heads back to his caravan while Priya drags a chair and whips out her mobile phone and continues what seems like a conversation that was interrupted because of the shoot. The entrepreneur in Radikaa, meanwhile, engages a few visitors in what looks like a business meet on the move.

We utilise this time to go around the shooting set to interact with a few of the people who make such alternate realms a possibility.

One such person is S Saravanapandi Kannan from Jayanthipuram in Madurai. He and his crew of 15 people have been engaged on a one-day contract worth ₹70,000.

His job? “The carnival items, parai musicians and other items that make this a temple festival are all courtesy my company,” he says. This has been his job for the last 14 years, ever since director Ameer engaged him for a similar task in Paruthiveeran (2007).

“Until then, I would set up my stalls in different temple festivals in south Tamil Nadu. Since then, I have been taking up contracts in films that have a rural setting. Mostly, such films will have a festival backdrop sequence,” he says, adding, “I’ve supplied for recent films like Vijay’s Master, Vishal’s Sandakozhi 2, a Sibiraj film shot in Pudukottai recently among others.”

The break was also a godsend for a few children from Kannagi Nagar, who have been brought to set by their “supervisor”, a woman in her 40s, as atmosphere artistes. The children, all aged between 11 and 13, are middle school students, and have been brought to shoot for a wage of ₹200.

“We have to be at the spot till 2 am.” Won’t they miss school the next day? “No, I’ll make it,” says Reshma, studying in Class IX. “But I will bunk class,” says Lux.

That is not his real name. Lux is originally Rex Antony but is called so because it rhymes with his name. But Sudalai Kani has a different reason for changing his name. “I don’t like my name. These boys tease me. So I call myself Vel now,” says the confident 12-year-old.

The children have been shooting for films consistently in the last 18 months. “We have met many actors. I collect autographs from them,” says Rex, and recalls his interaction with Vijay Sethupathi. “I went up to shake his hand. He looked at me and asked which class I was studying in, and he asked me to focus on my studies,” Rex adds, before quietly slipping out of our conversation to go shake Atharvaa’s hands, as the hero returns to set following the break.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/aw9h8w/article30921390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPKURUTHIAATTAM1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-atharvaas-kuruthi-aattam-recreated-the-madurai-effect-in-chennai/article30921394.ece
177,2020/02/26,"‘HIT’ is a racy thriller, says Garry BH, who is fast becoming the go-to editor for thrillers in Telugu cinema","The film stars Vishwak Sen and Ruhani Sharma, and is directed by newcomer Sailesh Kolanu

This time it isn’t an engineer who has switched to a career in films, it’s a dentist. Editor Garry GH hails from Visakhapatnam. He took up photography before joining the Kshanam team as an assistant director and then became an editor.

His new film is HIT, releasing this week. It stars Vishwak Sen and Ruhani Sharma, is directed by newcomer Sailesh Kolanu and produced by actor Nani and stylist Prashanti Tipirneni.

He didn’t go to a film school but writer Abburi Ravi mentored him on the narrative styles and perspective of watching films and Adivi Sesh’s supervision and Sai Kiran Adivi’s encouragement helped him to analyse the technicalities of editing. His work got noticed through Kshanam, and soon he got offers to work on films such as Goodachari and Jersey; Garry has edited more than 20 films in the last four years.

Isn’t he being typecast as an editor for thrillers just as Sricharan Pakala is being signed on as a music composer for the same genre? “My last film was Aswathama and now there’s HIT coming up. Mallik Ram’s film and the Sushanth starrer is my next. Sricharan and I worked together for 14 films. Probably yes, but the two films I mentioned — a rom-com and a love story — will help break that image,” says Garry.

Ask Garry if he doesn’t lose perspective as editors sometimes do online editing from day one, and how does he deal with directors who don’t allow certain scenes to be chopped off? At the time of reading or hearing the script, he says the editor has a clear picture and a conviction about certain parts of the film and knows what has to be retained. The emphasis should be on improving the graph [of the story or character].

Garry gives us an insight shared by editor Sreekar Prasad, “When I was editing for Ghazi, Sreekar Prasad told me that after writing the script, director Mani Ratnam would spend at least a month discussing it with the editor. Before the shoot they edit the whole script and as a result, there won’t be unnecessary footage. Sreekar Prasad still does script editing with Mani Ratnam. I tried asking my folks but it never worked here.” Garry explains that in most Indian films, editors are roped in barely 15 days before the shooting commences and there’s no time for prior discussion: “We can save money for the producer if we do script editing, but directors shoot so much because they love their script. The creator doesn’t see the film from the audience’s point of view and also there are many generic equations. They work under constraints because the heroes have a certain craze and they need to keep commerce in mind. It’s often said that a film is made or slayed at the editing table. A bad film can be made into a hit and a great film can be killed by an editor.”

Editing is an underrated craft and only in recent years editors have begun getting their share of recognition.

Garry states there is no hard and fast rule that a film’s duration should last only 2 hours 15 minutes. He cites an example of Arjun Reddy which was three hours long and still managed to keep the audience hooked. “What’s important is to convey the right emotions and sustain interest. Editors watch a film as an audience, think like them and edit,” he says.

The freedom that an editor gets depends on the director. Garry on his part has had his share of debates and discussions and finds a middle ground. How does he edit a thriller? He shares, “The graph of a thriller lies in how the suspense is built and unveiled. At every interval, there should be a high point to keep audience engaged. The interval is based on the first, second and third acts of the film. The graph changes based on the momentary interest and interest the scenes can generate.”

Garry explains that thrillers are of various types — informative, horror, or action. Goodachari is an action thriller. HIT is an informative thriller.

Talking about director Sailesh, Garry is all praise and says that the had immense clarity and every gesture of the actors have been written in the script. The minute detailing makes editing easier. “The pace and emotion of the film was challenging. It had to be tight and gripping,” he explains. HIT has a racy but non-linear screenplay and Garry’s job was to ensure that it reaches the audience.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8o1asx/article30921154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Garry-BH-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vishwak-sen-starrer-hit-is-a-racy-thriller-says-garry-bh-who-is-fast-becoming-the-go-to-editor-for-thrillers-in-telugu-cinema/article30921156.ece
178,2020/02/26,Karky and the kids: How Baahubali’s ‘Kiliki’ language was born,"The inception of film lyricist Madhan Karky’s CLIQ, which is the source for the language Kiliki in the 'Baahubali' movies

The origin of Kiliki, a unique language created by Madhan Karky for the superhit film Baahubali, does not begin in Hyderabad or Chennai. It begins a little more than 7,000 kilometres from India — in a little pretty home in Australia.

That is where, many years ago, Karky was baby-sitting a few Tamil children in his spare time. “I used to teach them the languages I knew,” he recalls, “They found a lot of differences and complications in each language. Why do we have to remember the gender of an object too?”

The phonetics of the English language and the way each letter is interpreted in Tamil proved to be a challenge for ‘teacher’ Karky. “Any language can easily be mastered if it follows a certain logic; but traditionally-spoken languages don’t have that simplicity.”

A thought passed by Karky’s mind: Why not create a simple language for these children? “We named it ‘CLIQ’ because we wanted it to be as easy as a mouse click,” he smiles.

The children thought it was cool: they read it as ‘See, I Like You.” Karky and the kids got together to develop a small book that contained 50 words, and even conceptualised a song in that language. It turned out to be an exercise only for a few weeks.

A new creation

Cut to many years later, Karky remembered CLIQ when director SS Rajamouli described the war sequences he had written for Baahubali. “Since the tribes were a brutal lot, he (Rajamouli) did not want them to speak in an existing language, lest it hurts people who speak it.” The minute Rajamouli uttered the words, “Let’s create a new language”, Karky’s mind flashed back to that little pretty room in Australia many years ago.

A simple Kiliki explainer

He rushed back to his laptop, opened that file and started polishing it. The challenge he had now was to retain the emotions in this new-spoken language that needed to be understood by the audience without the use of subtitles. “That was difficult,” recalls Karky, “If you take current-day languages like Tamil, the sound of a few words have a certain pleasantness because of the place of articulation (how we utter them) though its meaning might be very different.” He cites the example of two words: sakkarai (sugar) and nilavembu (a bitter tonic). “A non-Tamil speaker, would tend to think that nilavembu is a sweet word while sakkarai is a ‘harsh word.’ The sweetness of ‘sakkarai’ is not in the word.”

Karky wanted to have this correlation in Kiliki. “When I created a word, I wanted soft sounds or hard sounds, depending on the meaning,” he recalls.

Kiliki was thus developed over three months, with Karky and Rajamouli doing a lot of back-and-forth on how it should pan out. “There was a lot of challenges while it was being shot too; I remember Nasser sir recalling the first time he heard the tribes speaking this... he said that he was taken back,” says Karky. That reaction of Nasser and the others during the shoot was not captured, but what was chronicled was the overwhelming response that the audience gave when the film released.

Beyond barriers

When Baahubali hit screens, Kiliki was one of its talking points. Karky not only got a lot of appreciation, but also several enquiries on social media. “People wanted to know how to learn it; some of them wanted it to be a secret language with which they could communicate with their loved ones.”

Thus, Karky sat down to challenge himself and develop what he describes as the ‘world’s easiest language.’ After a two-year effort, it’s online today — at www.kiliki.in — and can be learnt by anyone. The lyricist-dialogue writer plans to create an entire universe around this language, and hopes that it will be one “that will unite the world, beyond caste, religion and country.” “I wish Kiliki will become the language of people.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/f6xd7d/article30920980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MPkadky77JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-inception-of-baahubalis-kiliki-language/article30920983.ece

180,2020/02/26,This doctorate scholar in theatre arts is looking to change Tamil cinema’s approach to casting,"Acting coach first, casting director next and then an actor, Sugumar Shanmugam made a breakthrough in Tamil cinema with Priya Krishnaswamy’s ‘Baaram’. He discusses why adopting a casting methodology could help Kollywood churn out better quality films.

Sugumar Shanmugam presents a contradiction in terms of artistes in Tamil cinema.

For one, he prefers to identify himself as an acting trainer and a casting director more than an actor; though it was an acting assignment — as Veera in Priya Krishnaswamy’s National Award-winning film Baaram — that put the spotlight on him.

Also, very few actors, if any, in Tamil cinema discuss Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov in their interviews, especially with the effortless ease Sugumar does. When we meet, he is holding a monthly Tamil film magazine in his hands.

The edition, an ode to the Vetri Maaran film Asuran, has an essay that Sugumar penned, wherein he discusses why the filmmaker struck gold with the film’s casting. “Chekhov says the point where the psyche and physique conjoin is when one begins to understand the character. I saw that in Dhanush in Asuran. I relate to these aspects due to my academic background,” says Sugumar.

Casting right

Hailing from a family of therukoothu performers, Sugumar holds a Master’s degree in Drama and Theatre Arts from Pondicherry Central University. Subsequently, he aced a diploma course in intensive acting from the National School of Drama (Bengaluru).

Since 2015, he has been pursuing a doctorate in Theatre Arts with the Department of Performing Arts in Pondicherry Central University; his research topic is Characterisation, actor’s physiology and bio-psychology. He also runs the Pondicherry Theatre Arts Academy in Kalapet, his hometown, where he trains 18 students.

As a casting director, he names people like Kim Ki-duk and Woody Allen as inspirational.

“If you do the right casting, I believe that you have completed 30% of the movie before it is shot. I learnt this from painters. The ideological emotions they capture with people’s faces or animals... that process is casting. The painter does his casting after determining if it would help sell his art. So casting is important not only in the film business,” he says, adding, “The best casting director that I know of is Charlie Chaplin. I don’t think there has ever been someone better or that there ever will be. He understood the importance of characters.”

Sugumar Shanmugam | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

It was after working as a casting director in a Kannada movie, Beerangipuram, which Sugumar says was “shelved after its first schedule”, that an opportunity to meet Baaram’s director Priya Krishnaswamy materialised.

“She had reached out to my Head of the department (R Raju who played the central character Karuppasamy in Baaram). She told him that casting was important for her film and he (Raju) pointed her to me,” says Sugumar.

When the duo met, he told Priya that there were two approaches to casting that he is offering her.

“One, I could get experienced professionals, but I should give them a workshop and brief them of the character, backstories, economic backgrounds, period, geography and other details. The second option was to find real people who live as these characters, and give them a workshop on how to face the camera. Priya liked the second option more though I told her that we may not get an exact likeness to how she visualised the character in her script,” he adds.

Characters like Nagamma (the maid whom Karuppasamy’s son hires), Buchi (the shepherd) and the women with whom Veera discusses Thalaikoothal were all selected through such a process.

Psychological process

Sugumar’s academic footing helps establish a certain aesthetic that his line of work helps to add in the filmmaking process. But he has a gargantuan task at hand: convincing an industry of a process that helps deliver better output.

“In Hollywood, even for commercial films, they engage casting directors. I don’t know what understanding filmmakers here have about a casting director but it certainly doesn’t mean that directors cannot do casting. It is a simple psychological process. There may be a thought process that casting directors may get involved too academically, and would end up confusing the actors. That is not true. A doctor does not diagnose a patient by telling him the chemical, physiological definitions of the person’s problem. Likewise, I train them in a way they will understand the theories I have learnt,” he says.

However, getting the Tamil film industry to take to a novel idea is a huge task.

“Which is why we must appreciate directors like Ram, Mysskin, Vetri Maaran, Lokesh Kanagaraj and Karthik Subbaraj to name a few, who draw quality work out of their artistes despite the restrictions,” he adds.

Quiz him on what constitutes good acting and he retorts: “Acting is being a character. I don’t know how you categorise talent though. What you consider as good acting itself is a conflict. Say, a mainstream actor whom you think doesn’t belong. You may think he is not the best actor out there but he may have been true to the character he plays, and the audience must have felt it. That is all that matters. There is no hard and fast rules to acting. It is not classical dance... for you to practice mudras in just the right way to convey the meaning lest you get it wrong,” he says.

His exploits in Baaram has brought him appreciation from filmmakers, most of whom were curious to figure out who he was, and what he brings to the table as an acting coach and a casting director.

“I’ve been booked for two films now as a casting director. I was already doing another film when Baaram released, where I play the second lead and am also the casting director. I’m doing a Kannada film but in the capacity of an acting coach. It is a satisfying feeling. I’m getting the recognition for the years spent on academic work,” he concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/m4mbue/article30920374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPSugumar-Shanmugam-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-doctorate-scholar-in-theatre-arts-is-looking-to-change-tamil-cinemas-approach-to-casting/article30920376.ece
181,2020/02/26,"‘I am getting positive vibes,’ says debut director Munna Dhulipudi about ‘30 Rojullo Preminchadam Ela’","After being an AD with Sukumar, the filmmaker awaits the release of his debut feature that stars Pradeep Machiraju

Munna Dhulipudi (Pradeep) began writing poems as a child with the pet name ‘Munna’, which won him awards and accolades. A native of Yanam, 37-year-old Munna’s directorial debut 30 Days Lo Preminchatam Yela is releasing later this month. A software professional, he was noticed by director Sukumar and roped him in as an assistant director for Arya 2. Then he directed two short films while working in an IT company that fetched him awards in the short film festival. It was then Sukumar adviced him to quit his job and join his team which was into making 100% Love. “Sukumar encouraged me to complete my masters in computer science. Having done that, I worked in an IT company and then moved to work in his team. He has inspired me to move forward in life,” he says.

Munna Dhulipudi

Munna recalls how he found the hero for his debut film and sounds very satisfied with his choice. He says, “My wife and my mother-in-law were watching television one evening and were heaping praise on Pradeep Machiraju, his looks and acting skills. I thought instead of struggling to get a mainstream hero’s dates why can’t I introduce Pradeep to the big screen and launch myself as the director? I also understood that many heroes don’t give dates to newcomers because they have their own fears. Trusting newcomers with two or three crore project is not a joke.”

He then immediately spoke to his producer and got in touch with Pradeep and narrated the story. Pradeep thought about it for a day and gave his green signal. He only had a doubt if he would suit the story and not in his acting ability. The duo took the project ahead, Anup Reubens was given the task of scoring music.

About the story, the lead pair can’t stand each other but they need to fall in love within 30 days. It is actually hate at first sight but is it possible to impress each other or organically fall in love?

“The song Neeli Neeli Aakasam rendered by Sid Sriram got 25 million views already. We shot it at Athirapally in Visakhapatnam. The story idea is given by my friend and I had written the dialogues and screenplay. I am getting all the positive vibes and just waiting for the release of the film. There is no tentative date as such for the release but we could inform the media very soon,” winds up Munna.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/e9pgk7/article30920000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym26munna1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/munna-dhulipudi-talks-about-directorial-debut-with-30-days-lo-preminchatam-yela/article30920004.ece

KARIMNAGAR: The flood flow canal to fill minor irrigation tanks had breached in Mannempalli village of Thimmapur mandal on Wednesday inundating several houses, and damaging properties including food items.

The Irrigation Department had constructed a flood flow canal from Thotapalli reservoir in Bejjanki mandal in Siddipet district to fill minor irrigation tanks in Thimmapur and Manakondur mandals. Two days ago the canal had breached, and authorities had plugged it. But the canal breached again at the same spot on Wednesday inundating the village, with water entering more than 50 houses damaging household properties in Mannempalli village.

Self-help

When Irrigation Department officials failed to arrive at the spot, the villagers, under the leadership of sarpanch Medi Anjaiah and upa-sarpanch Ponnam Anil Goud pressed into service an earthmover and closed the breach by creating another breach so that the water would enter the village tank.

The muddy flood waters had caused extensive damage. Essential food commodities and harvested crop like maize, etc. were damaged. The villagers had a tough time clearing the muddy waters in their houses skipping farm work.

Further, villagers flayed the irrigation authorities for poor quality works and not visiting the spot in spite of informing them. They demanded the government construct a permanent canal of good quality, and provide compensation to the villagers who lost their household properties, especially food items.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bnw3h3/article30925815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27BURADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/flood-flow-canal-breaches-at-mannempalli/article30922046.ece
184,2020/02/26,Police kicking suicide victim’s father goes viral,"Inter student’s family was demanding action against college management for ‘negligence’

Tension prevailed for sometime at the area hospital in Patancheru on Wednesday when the parents of an Intermediate first year student at Narayana College, who committed suicide by hanging on Tuesday, held a protest and police forcibly took away the body of the deceased in the freezer box.

While doing so, the police kicked Chandrasekhar, father of the girl, and it went viral on social media.

The Inter student had committed suicide in the hostel bathroom and Chandrasekhar had lodged a complaint with BDL Banur police station alleging negligence of college management. Though she was suffering from fever for the past one week the college authorities failed to send her home or get her treated, he alleged.

Parents and relatives held a dharna in front of the police station on Wednesday morning when the body was brought for post-mortem to the area hospital, demanding justice and action against the college management. Not only that, they obstructed the police from taking the body for post-mortem. Some of the students too joined them in the protest

At this point police used force, pulled Chandrasekhar aside and in one of the videos that went viral a policeman is seen kicking him with his boot.

Responding to the video, Superintendent of Police said in his twitter handle @spsangareddy: “Police were trying to prevent agitators taking law into their hands at the mortuary, yet suitable action will be taken for any wilful misbehaviour exhibited by the officers on duty as alleged in the video.”

Post-mortem completed

Meanwhile, post-mortem examination was done on the student’s body at the government hospital in Patancheru amid heavy police security. Police had a tough time dealing with relatives and students, who demanded justice to the family. Though post-mortem was completed by evening, her parents reportedly refused to accept the body, demanding compensation from the college management.

However, late in the night the college management reportedly agreed to pay a compensation of ₹ 15 lakh and with this, the relatives took the body to their native place in Mahabubnagar district for last rites.

Punitive action

In a turn of events, Superintendent of Police (in-charge) Chandana Deepti has directed attachment of constable Sridhar, who allegedly kicked the Inter student’s father, to the Armed Reserve Headquarters on Wednesday, according to a release here on Wednesday.

Ms. Chandana Deepti said: “We regret the incident. Constable was attached to AR Headquarters and disciplinary action will be initiated after enquiry.”

185,2020/02/26,Woman kills son with paramour’s help near Nalgonda in Telangana,"The nine-year-old was strangulated as he was witness to their affair

The suspicious death of a nine-year-old boy in Buddaram village last week was caused by strangulation, allegedly by his mother and her paramour to hide their affair, Nalgonda police said on Tuesday.

Producing the accused Paleti Vijaya (28), and Thokala Venkat Reddy (59), before the media on Tuesday the police said the duo strangulated Nagaraj, a third standard student, fearing he would disclose the matter in the family.

Illicit affair

According to the police, Venkat Reddy, a farmer, lent money to Paleti Venkanna two years ago. He got closer to the latter’s wife Vijaya in the process of collecting loan instalments

Police said Nagaraj complained to his father Venkanna about a similar incident in the past which resulted in a family dispute, but was settled.

On February 21, when the village was busy with Maha Sivarathri celebrations Venkat Reddy and Vijaya had consumed alcohol, and were together. Nagaraj, who got up from sleep witnessed their act. The couple used a towel to strangulate him to death, the police said. Both of them fled Buddaram after their plan to bury him secretly failed.

Sufficient evidence

Police said it retrieved sufficient evidence, such as the towel, empty liquor bottles, torn shirt pocket and a spade intended to dig the grave, from the crime scene.

The accused were arrested at around 10 a.m., when they were spotted near Munugode Y junction, the police said.

186,2020/02/26,Violence will be dealt with firmly: Kishan Reddy,"Is it ‘patriotism’ to throw stones even while holding a national flag, asks Minister

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy strongly condemned the violence in Delhi, but said the situation was very much in control and paramilitary forces have been pressed into service to restore peace in trouble-torn areas there.

However, “whoever is responsible for the violence, destroying or setting on fire private/public properties will not be spared. All the anti-social elements will face punishment and the government will probe into these incidents which are pre-planned to time with the visit of US President Donald Trump to lower the country’s image,” he said.

At a press conference at the party office, Mr. Reddy said he was rushing to Delhi in light of the incidents cutting short his visit by a day and wondered whether it was “patriotism” to throw stones even while holding a national flag in one hand. “For the last two months the government has allowed peaceful demonstrations throughout the country but violence will not be tolerated. I appeal to all political parties and others to observe restraint and help usher in peace. Violence has not solved any problem but only through dialogue. The Centre is ready to discuss any contentious issue whether it is the Ctizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or anything else,” he said.

The Union Minister reiterated that there was not a “single word” in CAA which is against the citizens of the country or the minorities and challenged critics for a public debate to prove him wrong. “Time and again the Centre has tried to remove misgivings on CAA; yet a vicious propaganda has been unleashed to foment communal trouble by instigating people. This is not at all good for the country,” he maintained.

“As Minister of State for Home I wish to assure my minority brothers that the CAA is only a humanitarian law to help persecuted minorities in the neighbouring countries. It is not even against Pakistan or Bangladesh. The false narrative that minorities will be targeted is a real low in politics,” Mr. Reddy asserted. He felt that since the Opposition could not accuse the Narendra Modi government of being corrupt, dynastic or indecisive, it has been resorting to spreading lies on CAA.

190,2020/02/26,Harish Rao’s all-out effort to keep his promise,"Minister visits Sangareddy and Sadashivapet municipalities to address people’s problems

In trying to keep the promises made while campaigning for the municipal elections, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao is making all efforts to visit the municipalities in Sangareddy and Sadashivapet and solve people’s problems.

“Vote for TRS in municipal elections and I will take the responsibility of your municipality and address all your problems,” was what Mr. Rao said when electioneering was at its peak in January.

In both Sangareddy and Sadashivapet municipal elections, the fight was mainly between Mr. Rao and Congress MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy.

In both these municipalities, the TRS won hands down and the entire credit goes to Mr. Rao.

Exactly a month later, Mr. Rao was at the district headquarters on Monday to launch the Pattana Pragathi programme. He participated in the programme at Sadashivapet on Tuesday.

True to his words, the Minister selected Narayanareddy Colony in the town, one of the backward areas, to start the programme. He promised to address all the problems raised by residents of the colony, but with a rider.

“People are telling me that drains are overflowing and garbage is being thrown into drains. So, we will distribute baskets to residents so that they can segregate garbage at source. Please segregate it. This will save a lot of time and money of the municipalities. A penalty of ₹500 will be imposed if anyone throws garbage in the open. We are going to buy the required number of tractors to collect garbage and a person will come and collect it,” he said, and urged the public to cooperate with the authorities concerned.

Later, he met locals at Ellammakunta and interacted with them for more than an hour.

193,2020/02/26,Forums to hone one’s craft,"The call of informal professional groups has never been so irresistible

Professional forums demand a level of commitment and sometimes require its members to make smart and quick adjustments in their schedules — for, that long-awaited mega meet-up may come up just when a project deadline looms on the horizon.

Therefore, many professionals either avoid or put off joining such forums despite being aware of the benefits they can bring to their careers.

However, in this digital age, it is difficult to be dismissive of these forums. For, these forums offer the best of two worlds — they will usually have regular meet-ups, and at the same time, offer avenues for more regular online interactions.

Last week, the Facebook pages of the Society of Women Engineers in India ran a campaign — #IntroduceAGirlToEngineering — inviting people to participate in it if they are an engineer.

They could talk about the biggest inspiration in their professional lives.

Lean In India, the official chapter of Lean In, a not-for-profit founded by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to empower women to realise their ambitions, is another example. One can either join any of the existing circles or start one.

Meetup.com, a platform to organise online groups that host in-person events, is among such growing professional communities. From a meet-up on psychometrics to one on entrepreneurship for those aged above 40, these circles are quite varied in their character and offerings.

Besides this, there are many sector-agnostic groups that help with mentorship, career transition or with general workplace-related issues.

The appealing features of these groups include their flexibility in terms of both structure and time.

A snapshot of a Cloud Computing and DevOps meet-up in Bengaluru.

Hari Kiran and Ganesh Samarthyam first started a meet-up group, primarily to find a platform to share their insights into Java programming, which they had presented in their joint book. Slowly, this meet-up group was extended to discussing other subjects.

Today, the two run nine meet-up groups with over 40,000 members in Bengaluru. Later, they expanded the scope of these meet-up groups to organise conferences.

“Both the meet-up communities and developer-centric conferences serve as platforms for learning new technologies, networking with like-minded professionals and exchanging professional ideas,” says Samarthyam.

Localisation matters

The longevity and effectiveness of professional forums depend on how localised they are and how regularly they engage with their members.

Last year, the tagline for a conference organised by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was ‘meet locally, learn socially’.

These groups usually work with a sense of social consciousness. For example, among the many initiatives started by SWE in India is the support it extends to those pursuing careers in STEM , says Suchismita Sanyal, a member of SWE. “By affiliating with colleges, we are trying to bridge the gap in STEM education,” she says.

It is five years since Lean In was started in India, and it has so far reached out to more than 5,000 women through its network in 13 cities.

“We have achieved this level of engagement through our circles, which is a small group of women coming together to talk about issues at their workplaces,” says Rashmeet Kaur, co-founder of Lean In India. Along with Sanya Khurana, she started the circle with 10 members, and today Lean In India has 110 such circles.

These circles being small is what makes them attractive. Participants are confident of speaking in a circle and this confidence is carried over to the workplace, says Rashmeet.

Most of those running forums understand the necessity of being open to change.

Suchismita says feedback is taken seriously by SWE.

“A feedback we received from last year’s conference was that the panel discussion was not engaging enough. This year, for our yearly conference scheduled for April, the team has dropped the panel discussion from the agenda,” says Suchismita.",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/em43b5/article30920051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26OPLeaninjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/forums-to-hone-ones-craft/article30920053.ece
194,2020/02/26,"Illustrator Adrija Ghosh on her new book, ‘Rats Bigger Than Cats’","Written in playful verse by Maegan Dobson Sippy and illustrated in mixed media, the story is of two unlikely groups coming together

“If you go out in the night on the streets of any city, you will see these large bandicoots that look even bigger in the dark. The cats look much smaller and so, maybe they are of the same size. But when a rat runs across the street and a shadow of it is cast on the wall (as shown on the book cover), it looks huge and scary,” says Bengaluru-based Adrija Ghosh, the illustrator of Rats Bigger Than Cats written by Maegan Dobson Sippy.

Written in playful verse and illustrated in mixed media, the story is of two unlikely groups coming together. One of the main points that Adrija had to keep in mind while illustrating was the size of the rats and making sure that they were, in fact, bigger than the cats. “That was a very important thing. I got feedback multiple times from the publisher (Karadi Tales) saying that the rats on this page are not big enough, they have to be larger,” she laughs.

“But also not completely real, it is not realistic. It can be a possibility but also if you give way to imagination, which is, I think, a very important part of children’s books or picture books, you can actually have anything. You can have a giant rat in front of a cat and it will still make sense,” she adds.

Born in Kolkata, the 26-year-old decided to bring her love for the city to the page. “When I went through the manuscript I realised it could be placed in a particular geographical location that I was very familiar with. Because it is such an old city, you see cats and rats going about. That was the starting point. I researched by checking old photographs of the city. The visual memories I had were not enough because I wanted a particular kind of perspective and images. Anyone who has grown up in Calcutta or has any knowledge of the city would recognise it, I hope.”

Additionally, since the story begins at twilight and ends in the morning, that too informed the colour palette. Says Adrija, “Another thing about the lighting was that in Calcutta, it is mostly yellow tungsten bulbs; the really old ones that you don’t see in other metros much. There is a particular kind of colour palette in Calcutta at night, which is mostly browns and yellows and maybe a fluorescent coming in from somewhere.”

As for the theme running through the book and what drew her to the story, she says, “As children we would see, especially with Tom and Jerry on TV, that rats are always chased by cats and they are not friends. You even have the phrase cat-and-mouse game. That is where Maegan’s writing is so beautiful. You think that the rats and cats are going to fight a lot, but in the end, it is a good resolution.

“Also, in a time like this when there is so much hatred around, it is nice to see that even if you are warring, you can still be cordial or friendly with each other and learn to accept differences. In the text, you see that the cats get all the good treatment, and the rats are mostly eating out of garbage. I wouldn’t say it has a deeper, political meaning but it is a nice thing to read to children these days. So that way the narrative feels wholesome.”

195,2020/02/26,Sapna Reddy’s photographs celebrate nature through meditative visuals,"Radiologist and fine art photographer Sapna Reddy believes in using visual imagery to heal, in both her professions

If things had gone per plan, Sapna Reddy would have been exploring a mountainous region of China on a photography expedition, but the outbreak of Coronavirus forced her to rethink. The Hyderabadi who now lives in California is in the city to deliver a talk, hosted by Telangana Photographic Society on February 29.

Sapna is a paediatric radiologist and a photographer. “I am a visual person and both my fields have to do with images,” says Sapna, when we begin talking about the meeting point of her dual professional interests. In radiology, she has to meticulously analyse visuals for patterns and tonality to spot abnormalities, which help in diagnosis and cure. As a fine arts photographer, she captures visuals that celebrate nature and are therapeutic to viewers.

Born and raised in Hyderabad, Sapna moved to the US to study medicine and began as a hobby photographer, documenting the places she visited and posting them on social media for friends and family. “I am an outdoorsy person,” she says, and it’s evident as one browses through her Flickr stream (sapna reddy) or on Facebook (sapnareddyphotography). The photographs she has posted were born out of expeditions into the wilderness.

“I cannot paint, so I photograph,” she says, to explain her visual aesthetics. Her images have a painting-like quality that comes from waiting for the right time to capture an image. There are times when she does a location recce and camps there, without her camera, to “bond with a place and understand how light works during different times of the day”.

When she visited the Valley of Flowers in California, she found it beautiful but overwhelming with an abundance of flowers. She wanted images that are soothing and meditative. “I wanted the flowers to be backlit so that they appear luminous,” she recalls. Sapna waited for the light to fall on the flowers in that manner and took the photograph. “When I have an end result in mind, I work backwards to see if I can make it happen,” she adds.

Sapna works three days a week as a radiologist and three days a week as a photographer, training aspiring photographers and delivering talks on the healing nature of fine art photography. “My sessions deal with transitioning from a photographer into an artist,” she says.

She often hikes carrying heavy gear — camera equipment, tent for camping, food and water. This necessitates physical training to be fit enough to face rough weather conditions. “If I am hiking in high altitude and have to cope with less oxygen, I sign up with a personal trainer and my fitness regimen is planned accordingly. I don’t want to let physical limitations come in the way of capturing images or teaching my students how to photograph,” says Sapna.

She’s been a professional photographer since 2011 and it has helped in stress management: “When I overhear a colleague complaining of stress, I feel it [day-to-day routine] isn’t stressful. Roughing it out in sub zero temperatures for photography expedition is tougher. When we push ourselves and do something different, it gives us the ability to handle our work like a piece of cake. And when you are out in nature, there’s time for quiet contemplation. Our problems seem insignificant.”

Some of Sapna’s large format images adorn the walls of hospitals and cancer centres in California for their therapeutic quality. Her paintings are also available through her website and yellowkorner.com worldwide.

196,2020/02/26,Take decision on FIRs: Delhi High Court,"Court questions delay in action against BJP leaders

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi police to take a “conscious decision” on registering FIRs against the three BJP leaders accused of making hate speeches, observing that the city could not be a witness to another 1984-like riots. The police have to communicate the decision by Thursday.

During the hearing on a petition moved by human rights activist Harsh Mander and activist Farah Naqvi, four video clips were submitted. The court observed that they “ex facie appear to be answering the description of the crime of hate speech” under Section 153A (a) and (b) of the Indian Penal Code, both of which are cognisable and non-bailable.

‘We want peace’

Expressing anguish over the delay in lodging FIRs, the court asked the police: “Why are you not showing alacrity when it comes to registration of FIR in these cases?... We want peace to prevail. We do not want the city to witness another 1984 riots. This city has seen enough violence and anguish. Let it not repeat 1984.”

Special Commissioner of Police Praveer Ranjan was present during the hearing, while the petitioners were represented by Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves.

“If you don’t have an FIR, how are you going to proceed. These speeches are leading to more speeches and yet you are saying it is not the appropriate stage. Just register the FIRs Mr. Ranjan. And communicate this to the Commissioner in the same spirit forthwith,” said the court.

The Bench of Justices S. Muralidhar and Talwant Singh, in its order, said it posed specific queries to the police officer about the consequences of delay in filing FIRs for each of the speeches played in the court.

The order said Mr. Ranjan had assured the court that he would sit with the Police Commissioner on Wednesday itself, view all the videos, not limited to those played in the court but any other videos that might be provided to them and which they perhaps already are in possession of, and take a conscious decision, which will be communicated to the court tomorrow itself,” said the order.

It added that the police “should seriously consider the consequences” of the delay in registering FIRs, not only on the basis of the video clips played in the court, but all the others disclosing commission of an offence.

Of the four video clips, one was of a speech by Union Minister Anurag Thakur on January 21, and the second clip was an interview given by MP Parvesh Verma on January 28.

The third was a speech by BJP leader Kapil Mishra on February 23 in the presence of Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast Delhi), while the fourth clip showed Delhi MLA Abhay Verma on February 25, repeating the very slogan that featured in Mr. Thakur’s speech.

Earlier, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Delhi police, told the court that he had not watched any of the videos, following which Justice Muralidhar ordered that Mr. Mishra’s video clip be played.

197,2020/02/26,Assam at the centre of fresh border row,"Mizoram seeks revision of boundary

Assam is at the centre of a fresh inter-State border row in the northeastern region.

The Mizoram government has sought the revision of the boundary with Assam, based on the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation (BEFR) of 1873 and the Inner Line of the Lushai Hills Notification of 1993.

This followed an alleged bid by the Assam police on February 19 to pitch a camp at Umlawi in West Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, bordering Assam’s Kamrup district, and a Nagaland group’s reported attempt to grab land in eastern Assam’s Jorhat district on February 12.

Also Read 3 communities wary of Clause 6 in 1985 Assam Accord

The BEFR allows Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland not to let non-resident Indians in without an inner-line permit for a temporary stay. Mizoram used to be the Lushai Hills district of Assam before being made a Union Territory in 1972 and a State in 1987.

“We sent a letter to the Union Home Secretary on December 15 last, asking for a revision of the boundary with Assam. We are hopeful of a response from the Centre soon,” Mizoram Home Minister Lalchhamliana said.

Mizoram shares a 123-km border with southern Assam and has been claiming a 509-square mile stretch “occupied” by the neighbouring State. Both States have been disputing an extensive stretch of this boundary. The last stand-off at Zophai in March 2018 left several people injured.

On Tuesday, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said he discussed the problem at Umlawi with his Assam counterpart Sarbananda Sonowal. “The situation is under control now. We have decided to meet after our Budget sessions for easing tension,” he said.

The Budget session of the 60-member Meghalaya Assembly ends on March 26.

A fortnight ago, a board put up by the Ao Students’ Conference of Nagaland in the New Sonowal area, 14 km inside the Assam-Nagaland border, triggered fears of encroachment. “The board was removed and my counterpart in Nagaland’s Mokokchung district regretted the matter,” Jorhat Deputy Commissioner Roshni Aparanji Korati said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/usqx28/article30925080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26MANIPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-at-the-centre-of-fresh-border-row/article30925081.ece

Mr. Patel told the House in his Budget speech that the main focus had been placed on social sectors like health, education, water management, animal husbandry, rural and urban development, agriculture, and overall social development.

In education, ₹650 crore will be spent in building 7,000 new class rooms in primary schools in rural areas, while a new Department for Defence Studies will be set up with the Defence Research and Development Organisation in Gujarat University.

199,2020/02/26,3 communities wary of Clause 6 in 1985 Assam Accord,"The clause seeks to ascertain who fits into the definition of an Assamese.

Three major communities, perceived to be migrants in Assam, have expressed concern over the recommendations of the high-powered committee on the implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord of 1985.

These communities are the Bengal-origin or Bengali-speaking Muslims referred to as Miyas, Bengali Hindus and Gurkhas.

Clause 6 envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative measures to safeguard, protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people. It also seeks to ascertain who fits into the definition of an Assamese.

Constitutional safeguards for indigenous people a must: Assam students’ body

On Wednesday, the Asom Miya Parishad said the Assamese people would not be safe if the Bengal-origin Muslims are excluded from the list of indigenous communities.

“More than 80% of us have been living in Assam for centuries and 24 MLAs of our community had in 1946 voted against Assam becoming a part of Pakistan post-Partition,” said M. Mahar Ali, general secretary of the Parishad.

CAA will fix unresolved issues of Assam Accord: Himanta Biswa Sarma

He also cautioned that the Assamese would become a minority if the Miyas are not regarded as indigenous. “Data say that the Assamese population in Assam was 34% in 1931 but became 62% in the census of 1951. This was because the Miyas had used Assamese as their mother tongue,” he said.

Gurkhas’ plea

The Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangha (BGP) too said Gurkhas in Assam should be recognised as indigenous community to ensure that their constitutional and land rights are protected.

“Since we don’t have a homeland in India, we must be recognised as indigenous across the country so that constitutional rights including land rights of Gurkhas are protected everywhere,” said Prakash Dahal, president of the BGP’s Assam unit.

The BGP also requested the Centre and the West Bengal government to bring an early resolution to the long-pending demand of Gorkhaland.

On Monday, the All Assam Bengali Youth Students’ Federation (AABYSF) objected to the purported suggestion of the Clause 6 panel to make 1951 as the base year for defining Assam’s “indigenous people.” The federation said Bengali Hindus, most of whom have been residing in Assam prior to the March 1971 (cut-off for detecting and deporting foreigners), deserved to be called indigenous.

“We don’t know what exactly is there in the report of the Clause 6 committee but reports suggested people who have been settled in Assam from before 1951 and their descendants will be viewed as indigenous people. If that is the case, the Bengalis in Assam will lose all rights as their migration to the State took place after 1951. They will be reduced to mere voters,” AABYSF founder president Sahadev Das said.

The All India United Democratic Front led by MP and perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal and the All Assam Minority Students’ Union also said 1951 as base year would be “gross injustice” to a large section of Assam’s population.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3-communities-wary-of-clause-6-in-1985-assam-accord/article30924840.ece
200,2020/02/26,Kafeel Khan’s wife fears threat to his life in jail,"Shabista Khan writes to authorities demanding better security for the detained doctor

Days after Gorakhpur-based doctor Kafeel Khan’s maternal uncle was shot dead, his wife on Wednesday wrote to authorities stating that she feared a threat to his life and demanded that the detained paediatrician be provided better security in jail.

Dr. Khan is lodged in Mathura jail, after being booked under the National Security Act for allegedly delivering a provocative speech at a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at the Aligarh Muslim University.

Also Read Perverse zeal: On Kafeel Khan arrest

Shabista Khan wrote to the Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Uttar Pradesh’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) and the Director General of Police (Jail) of the State asserting that she fears he could face a murder attempt and that “some innocent prisoner would be falsely implicated” by the administration to shift responsibility.

Ms. Khan demanded that her husband be kept away from “active criminals” and be lodged with ‘ordinary prisoners’ in the jail, and also be provided security.

“My husband is being mentally tortured in jail and is being subjected to inhuman behaviour,” she alleged.

Nusratullah Warsi, a businessman and Dr. Khan’s maternal uncle was shot dead late on Saturday in Gorakhpur. In June 2018, Dr. Khan’s younger brother Kashif Jameel was grievously wounded after being shot thrice.

Superintendent Mathura jail, Shailendra Maitrey, dismissed the allegations made by Dr. Khan’s wife and said the detained paediatrician was being “treated normally like ordinary prisoners.”

Mr. Maitrey said Dr. Khan was already being provided security “as per the resources available” and was also being granted regular mulaqats (visitor meetings) with his relatives.

“Every 30 minutes, we check on his well-being through the in-charge personnel,” the superintendent said.

Mr. Maitrey also asserted that in case Dr. Khan wanted to report harassment faced by him in jail, he could easily do so at the weekly inspection by the district legal cell secretary, who is of the rank of an additional chief judicial magistrate. “There cannot be more transparency than this,” he said.

Dr. Khan’s older brother Adeel Khan said his sister-in-law’s apprehensions were based on the two incidents — the shooting of his younger brother and the murder of their uncle last week. He suspects there could be a link between the attacks and Dr. Khan’s activism after the BRD hospital tragedy in Gorakhpur in 2017.

“Kashif was shot at in June 2018 but the shooters have still not been arrested. Doctor Kafeel received threats on phone and through messages on several occasions in the past,” Mr. Adeel said. Also, the police were yet to trace the shooters of his maternal uncle, he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wyijda/article30899323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-omar-Kafeel-GNJ75HLA64jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kafeel-khans-wife-fears-threat-to-his-life-in-jail/article30923815.ece
201,2020/02/26,Both Maharashtra Houses nix BJP’s demand for resolution on Savarkar,"BJP members among themselves “passed” a resolution honouring Savarkar before leaving the House

BJP’s demand for a state government resolution honouring Hindutva icon Vinayak Damodar Savarkar for his contribution to the Independence struggle did not find support in both Houses of the Maharashtra Legislature on Wednesday.

While Assembly Speaker Nana Patole rejected the BJP ’s demand, triggering protest from its leaders, in the Legislative Council, Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe refused to entertain the saffron party’s move as she adjourned the House when a BJP leader stood up to speak about it.

Speaking in the Assembly, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded that the government move a resolution on the death anniversary of Savarkar for his sacrifices and contribution to the freedom struggle.

He also demanded the government ban “Shidori”, the in-house magazine of the Maharashtra Congress for publishing “objectionable” references to Savarkar. He also tore a copy of the magazine.

To this, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that Fadnavis, a former chief minister, had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 20, 2018 and January 17, 2019 urging the Centre to honour Savarkar with Bharat Ratna.

“I wonder why there had been a delay when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra and also at the Centre,” he said.

“Modi had been the PM for more than five years now, while Fadnavis had ruled the state for the last five years.

Like today, Savarkar’s death anniversary falls every year,” he said.

Second list of loan waiver beneficiaries on Feb 28: Maharashtra government

Mr. Fadnavis said he had sought Bharat Ratna for Savarkar as well as Mahatma Phule and Savitribai Phule.

“I am confident that the demand will be accepted. But what is the harm if the state assembly passes a resolution to honour Savarkar?” he asked.

Mr. Fadnavis targeted the Congress for making “derogatory” comments against Savarkar in its in-house magazine.

“Insult of Savarkar will not be tolerated. This is the reason why we want a resolution to honour him,” he said.

BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said as Savarkar has been insulted (in the magazine), a resolution to honour him was necessary.

NCP ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Jayant Patil objected to the references made to Savarkar by Fadnavis while quoting from the magazine.

Mr. Bhujbal, who is the state Food and Civil Supplies Minister, said the resolution demanded by BJP does not fit the legislature rules.

“The resolution is not only to honour Savarkar, but also to criticise somebody else,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pawar said that everyone has respect for Savarkar and his contribution to the freedom struggle, but not everyone agreed with some of his views.

At this point, Patole rejected the demand of the BJP for the government resolution on honouring Savarkar and continued with the rest of the agenda, which angered the MLAs of the BJP.

Some MLAs of the BJP entered the Well of the House holding placards and photographs of Savarkar and shouted slogans against Shiv Sena, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

Sensing the mood, the Speaker rushed through the business, including the passage of some bills and a calling attention notice on crime against women.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced that an Act on the lines of the Disha Act of Andhra Pradesh government will be introduced in the ongoing budget session.

The Speaker then adjourned the House for the day.

Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray was not present in the House.

Meanwhile, BJP MLAs who squatted in the Well of the House held parallel proceedings in which Fadnavis accused the Sena of being “desperate” for power and turning a blind eye to insult to Savarkar by Congress leader and former Union minister Manishankar Aiyar.

“I recall how Balasaheb Thackeray had protested by hitting Mani Shankar Aiyar’s photograph with chappals when the then Union minister had made critical remarks against Savarkar and removed the plaque from the Andaman Cellular Jail,” he said.

BJP members among themselves “passed” a resolution honouring Savarkar before leaving the House.

Earlier in the day, the BJP legislators donned the caps with ‘Mi pan Savarkar’ (I am also Savarkar) printed on them.

In the Upper House, after a Bill making Marathi mandatory in all the schools in the state was passed, Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar stood up to move the motion on Savarkar. However, Ms. Gorhe, who was aware of a similar attempt made by the BJP in the Assembly, immediately adjourned the House. She left the House along will all the ministers and members of the council from Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.

Normalcy was returning to the Khambhat town in Gujarat’s Anand district on Wednesday following communal clashes during the previous three days, the police said.

As many as 84 persons have been arrested, officials said.

Seven First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered since Sunday, including one against former BJP MLA Sanjay Patel, members of the Hindu Jagran Manch (HJM) and some local councillors, the police said. Sanjay Patel has not been arrested.

He and others were accused of breaching a notification issued by the district magistrate imposing prohibitory orders restricting movement of groups. They had organised a rally on Tuesday.

At the rally held near Gawara Tower, attended by over 6,000 people, they allegedly made provocative speeches, as per an FIR registered at Khambhat city police station under the Gujarat Police Act.

Tensions flared up on Tuesday amid the bandh call given by some Hindu outfits, leading to incidents of arson.

No untoward incident was reported on Wednesday. The people who had fled their homes fearing violence were returning and markets remained open, a senior police official said.

“In all, 84 persons have been arrested in seven FIRs lodged in connection with communal clashes that followed the bandh call yesterday,” Inspector General of Police (Ahmedabad range) A.K. Jadeja said.

“The situation is returning to normal. We carried out patrolling last night and today. Sufficient police deployment has been made,” Jadeja said.

At least 20 houses and as many vehicles were torched during the violence which began on Sunday.

What triggered the violence was not yet clear, with some reports saying that it was spill-over from clashes that had erupted during the Uttarayan festival in January.

Director General of Police Shivanand Jha visited the town on Tuesday and met people from both Hindu and Muslim communities.

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday sought to know the Maharashtra government’s stand in the cases, where the identity of sexual assault victims is revealed on social media platforms.

A division Bench of Justices R.V. More and S.P. Tavade noted that revealing the names of rape victims was a cognisable offence punishable up to two years in jail under section 228A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

“Tell us what action the State will take in such cases. What is the State government’s stand,” the court asked.

The Bench was hearing a petition filed by a rape victim seeking directions to the State government and the Centre to strictly follow the provisions of law, which prohibits disclosure of names and photographs of rape victims.

The petitioner’s lawyer Madhavi Tavanandi pointed out the recent Hyderabad rape and murder case where the victim’s name and photograph was published across Twitter and other social media platforms.

The lawyer further said that the content is still available online.

On the last hearing, the Bench had directed the petitioner to serve a copy of the petition to social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and search engine Google.

On Wednesday, advocates appearing for the companies said the petitioner will have to implead their U.S.-based counterparts as they have control over the content.

The lawyers said the petition has tagged Twitter India, Facebook India and Google India, which only take care of marketing and advertising.

The Indian-based companies have no role to play in the content being uploaded on the social media platform and also cannot delete any content.

209,2020/02/26,M.P. official removed as govt. magazine editor for publishing essay glorifying Godse,"“There was a lot written about Godse, which was not required,” says State Law Minister.

The Congress government in Madhya Pradesh has removed the editor of one of its magazines for publishing in the January edition an essay that glorifies Mahatma Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse as a “martyr”.

The essay Mahatma Zinda Hai (Mahatma is alive) by Hyderabad-based independent writer Shweta Rani was published in the government’s Public Relations Department’s magazine Sandesh. “For some Godse is a killer, while for others he is a martyr who had great respect for his religion,” she wrote.

That Gandhi died on January 30,1948, of bullets and Nathuram Godse after being hanged on November 15, 1949, was not the case, the article said. “Neither has Godse died, nor has Gandhi, as ideas never die. Both live on in our minds. It is for us to decide whose ideology we should promote.”

Acting on a complaint, Law and Public Relations Minister P. C. Sharma removed Manoj Khare, Joint Director, as the publications wing in-charge and as its Editor on February 22 and served a notice on him, a development that came to light recently. Earlier, on February 18, a suspension order was issued, but it was later revoked.

“There was a lot written about Godse, which was not required. When your article is on Mahatma Gandhi, then you must only talk about him,” Mr. Sharma told The Hindu. “Such an article was not required in the first place.”

An official of the department, requesting anonymity, said each issue of the 116-year-old magazine is referred to its Commissioner for approval before being published. Mr. Khare refused to comment, while Commissioner P. Narahari did not take phone calls.

In October last year, Mr. Narahari had issued a letter lauding Mr. Khare for a 224-page book titled ‘Madhya Pradesh and Gandhiji.’ He has received three awards as the Editor since 2014.

An official of the publications wing, requesting anonymity, said there was tremendous pressure in December, given that the government had completed a year in office, and wanted to publish its achievements. This was compounded by an acute shortage of staff, he contended. Against a sanctioned strength of six senior officials, there is just one, and eight to ten staff members for 25 posts.

In November last year, when Bhopal MP Pragya Thakur described Godse as a “patriot” during a debate in Parliament, Chief Minister Kamal Nath had rebuked her and said the BJP should clarify whether it was with Gandhi’s ideology or Godse’s.

Purportedly quoting from a book titled ‘Why I Killed Gandhi’ written by Godse’s brother Gopal, the essay said: “Godse believed that Gandhi played a major role in the country’s Partition. He started believing his life’s main mission was to protect Hindus and Hindutva. He thought by protecting Hindus and Hindutva and organising them, complete freedom could be achieved.”

According to him, tall leaders then were trying to make the country secular. “However, this country’s name is ‘Hindustan’, that is Hindu nation, and giving even a little space to any other religion was unacceptable to Godse.”

That day, Godse had merely riddled a body with bullets, but the supreme spirit of Gandhi is found in people even today, the essay goes on to say.

A disclaimer in the index of the monthly magazine states that views expressed are the author’s own, and that it was not necessary the “government agreed with them”.

“We are clear Godse was a killer,” said Lokendra Parashar, BJP State media incharge. “But the sad part is Congress has even killed Gandhi’s ideas. That’s why there is an atmosphere of violence and division in the country.”

Meanwhile, Vishvas Sarang, BJP MLA and former State Cabinet Minister, told The Hindu that the developments showed the Congress was two-faced. “What will change by removing just one official? On the one hand, they claim to go against Godse, and on the other allow such essays to be published. They clearly follow his ideas.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/x0r15w/article30921122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Essay-MP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-official-removed-as-editor-of-govt-magazine-over-essay-glorifying-godse/article30921123.ece
210,2020/02/26,24 dead as bus falls into river in Rajasthan,"The accident occurred near Papdi village, 75 km from Bundi district headquarters, when the driver lost control of the vehicle while traversing the bridge.

At least 24 persons were killed and five sustained injuries when a private bus fell into the Mej river from an 80-foot bridge in Rajasthan’s Bundi district on Wednesday. The deceased include 10 women and three children. The victims were members of a marriage party carrying mayra (gifts) for the bride.

The accident occurred near Papdi village, 75 km from Bundi district headquarters, when the driver lost control of the vehicle while traversing the bridge. The bridge had no walls or railings. The bus submerged in the waters, making rescue difficult for the State Disaster Response Force team.

Residents from nearby villages rushed to rescue the passengers and joined the SDRF team.

Bundi Collector Antar Singh Nehra said the passengers were travelling from Kota to Sawai Madhopur via the Kota-Lalsot mega highway.

The injured were admitted to the government hospital in nearby Lakheri. The bodies were shifted to Kota, where they were cremated at the Kishorepura crematorium in the presence of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot expressed condolences on the death of the large number of people, most of whom were from the same family.

211,2020/02/26,"Mehbooba’s daughter seeks direction to J&K police to produce her mother in Supreme Court, case listed on March 18","Iltija Mufti pleads that the court quash the February 5, 2020 detention order of her mother under the Public Safety Act

The government dossier justifies detaining former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti under the draconian Public Safety Act (PSA) on grounds such as she was “scheming, hard-headed and a daddy’s girl” with a “short-lived marriage”, Iltija Mufti, her daughter, informed the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

In a habeas corpus petition, Ms. Iltija Mufti sought a direction to the J&K police to produce her mother in the Supreme Court and set her at liberty. She also sought the court to quash the February 5, 2020 detention order of her mother under the PSA.

A three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra issued notice to the J&K government. It then listed the habeas corpus case on March 18, nearly a month later. The habeas corpus petition of another former Chief Minister of J&K, Omar Abdullah, is also pending in the Court.

The petition said Ms. Mufti had been termed ‘Kota Rani’ in the dossier. The name was an insult as it referred to a “Muslim queen who rose to power by dubious means such as by poisoning her opponents”.

The dossier called Ms. Mufti’s politics “cheap” and her mindset “communal and divisive”. Her “main motive is to create an atmosphere of fear and chaos”, it said.

According to the petition, the dossier mentioned that the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Democratic Party (PDP) was of a “dubious nature” and questioned its “green-coloured flag”.

Ms. Iltija Mufti questioned how the PDP had been termed “dubious” when it had come to power twice and its last alliance in government was with the ruling party at the Centre — the BJP.

Refusal to sign bond

The petition said the “foremost” ground for the PSA detention was that Ms. Mehbooba Mufti refused to sign a bond or surety, which required her to not speak, comment or make statements in public about events “related to the recent events in J&K since it has the potential to to disturb the peace and tranquillity and law and order of J&K”.

In short, it was a demand for her to give a “blanket undertaking” to the government that she would not go public about the abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 and the restrictions on public movement in the erstwhile State.

The dossier also mentioned some dozen or so “willy-nilly references” to “utterances” the former Chief Minister had made on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the anti-triple talaq law.

The petition asked what was wrong in criticising the CAA as even the Supreme Court had found it necessary to examine its constitutionality.

Secondly, the passage of the anti-triple talaq law, which made instant ‘talaq’ a crime and not a civil wrong, punished Muslims alone. Criticism of the law did not have the remotest possibility to incite disorder. Discussion of such a law confined to Muslims would naturally refer to Muslims only, the petition said.

Detention was a gag in the guise of a preventive detention order. If the utterances were criminal why not employ the normal criminal process. The detention under the PSA showed non-application of mind and was based on stale grounds, it said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7m98yi/article28814293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEHBOOBAMUFTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mehboobas-daughter-seeks-direction-to-jk-police-to-produce-her-mother-in-supreme-court-case-listed-on-march-18/article30920135.ece

216,2020/02/26,Pakistan stuns West Indies,"Knight stars for England

Skipper Bismah Maroof anchored the chase admirably as Pakistan shocked former champion West Indies by eight wickets in its opening match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here on Wednesday.

Diana Baig’s fierce spell of fast bowling exposed the Windies top-order as it posted 124 for seven, courtesy Stafanie Taylor (43) and Shemaine Campbelle (43).

In reply, Pakistan openers Javeria Khan and Muneeba Ali put on 58 before Maroof’s unbeaten 38 steered her side to a comfortable win with 10 balls to spare.

Earlier, England captain Heather Knight smashed the first century of the Twenty20 World Cup as her team got its campaign back on track with a crushing 98-run win over minnows Thailand.

The 2009 champion had looked vulnerable as it crashed to a six-wicket defeat against South Africa in the opening Group B game on Sunday, following a shock 10-wicket hammering by Sri Lanka in the final warm-up last week.

Knight hit an unbeaten 108 in a tournament-best 169-run partnership with Natalie Sciver (59 not out) to secure a vital win. England's 176 for two was also the highest score by any team so far.

England plays Pakistan on Friday, while South Africa faces Thailand.

“We were gutted after the performance the other day so it was very important that we bounced back with a decent performance here,” said Knight.

“It was a challenging game for us, but we tried our best,” said Thailand captain Sornnarin Tippoch.

The scores:

England 176/2 in 20 overs (Natalie Sciver 59 n.o., Heather Knight 108 n.o.) bt Thailand 78/7 in 20 overs (Nattakan Chantam 32, Anya Shrubsole 3/21).

217,2020/02/26,Sri Lanka thumps West Indies,"Sri Lanka crushed West Indies by 161 runs in the second one-day international to clinch the series here on Wednesday.

Chasing 346 for victory, West Indies was bowled out for 184 in 39.1 overs, with wrist spinners Wanindu Hasaranga and Lakshan Sandakan taking three wickets each.

Avishka Fernando, who blasted 127, and Kusal Mendis, who made 119, put on 239 runs in Sri Lanka’s highest third-wicket stand as the hosts amassed 345 for eight after being put in to bat.

West Indies won the toss and elected to bowl in its bid to square the three-match series, and paceman Sheldon Cottrell did not disappoint with twin strikes on successive balls in the fourth over.

Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne went for one and Kusal Perera fell for nought in his 100th ODI before Mendis denied Cottrell a hat-trick and combined with Fernando to thwart the opposition bowling.

Mendis got a reprieve on two when West Indies skipper Kieron Pollard dropped a simple chance at first slip off Jason Holder. He went on to score his second one-day hundred.

Sri Lanka took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series after edging the first game by one wicket.

218,2020/02/26,India eyes third victory against NZ,"Team has been impressive both in batting, bowling, takes on NZ

On a high after two victories on the trot, including one against defending champion Australia, the Indian women’s cricket will aim to inch closer to a semifinal berth when it takes on New Zealand in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here on Thursday.

India hardly broke a sweat during its 17-run and 18-run wins over host Australia and Bangladesh in its previous two matches and is perched atop the five-team Group A standings with four points from two matches.

A victory against New Zealand on Thursday will take the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side on the threshold of a knock-out stage spot, to be competed among the top two teams from Groups A and B.

India has been impressive both in batting and bowling in its two matches.

The 16-year-old sensation Shafali Verma has been a standout with the bat. She scored a whirlwind 17-ball 39 against Bangladesh, following 29 against Australia.

No. 3 Jemmiah Rodrigues has also been among the runs with knocks of 26 and 34.

Among the top order, only captain Harmanpreet has not scored many runs and is due for a big innings.

Smriti set to return

India is also likely to be bolstered by the return of star opener Smriti Mandhana, who missed the match against Bangladesh due to fever.

The middle order has also done its bit with Deepti Sharma playing a major role against Australia with an unbeaten 49 while Veda Krishnamurthy hit a match-defining 11-ball 20 not out for a late flourish against Bangladesh.

The bowling has been led admirably by seasoned leg-spinner Poonam Yadav — seven wickets in two matches — with pacer Shikha Pandey ably supporting her with five scalps.

New Zealand, though, has a better head-to-head record against India in recent years, having won the last three matches between the two sides.

Exactly a year ago, it defeated India 3-0 in a three-match T20I series at home.

India will, however, remember its 34-run win over New Zealand in the previous edition in 2018 in the West Indies. Harmanpreet had struck a memorable 103 to lead her side to victory.

Top-class players

New Zealand has some top-class players in its ranks in the form of captain and all-rounder Sophie Devine and top-order batswoman Suzie Bates. Pacer Lea Tahuhu and leg-spinner Amelia Kerr will lead the bowling department.

The team will go into this match on a high after an easy seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka on Saturday. Devine had led from the front with an unbeaten 75 off 55 balls at the top of the order.

The teams (from):

India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Shafali Verma, Poonam Yadav, Radha Yadav, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Harleen Deol, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Richa Ghosh, Veda Krishnamurthy, Shikha Pandey, Arundhati Reddy and Pooja Vastrakar.

New Zealand: Sophie Devine (Capt.), Rosemary Mair, Amelia Kerr, Suzie Bates, Lauren Down, Maddy Green, Holly Huddleston, Hayley Jensen, Leigh Kasperek, Jess Kerr, Katey Martin (wk), Katie Perkins, Anna Peterson, Rachel Priest and Lea Tahuhu.

219,2020/02/26,Edgar goes down memory lane,"Bruce Edgar was a tenacious left-handed opener who took on the fastest of bowlers in the golden era for pacemen — the 70s and the 80s — without flinching.

People who saw him bat talk about his courage and heart. And Edgar, the New Zealand chief selector not too long ago, has interesting tales to tell.

The southpaw was part of a competitive New Zealand side, making 1958 Test runs and 1814 ODI runs at 30.59 and 30.74 respectively. He often opened on green seaming pitches where the ball bounced and seamed all day.

And Edgar, who looks much younger than his 63 years, recollects the first Test of the series against the all-conquering Clive Lloyd’s West Indians at Dunedin in 1980.

Flying kick

Michael Holding sent down a vicious delivery that hit John Parkar on the gloves and then travelled to ’keeper Deryck Murray. The umpire shockingly gave ‘not out’ and Holding produced a flying kick to knock the stump out of the ground.

Edgar saw the humorous side of it. “It was funny. Parkar was in pain. He even removed his gloves! The ball had struck him there. But then, the umpire had given him not out!”

The former Kiwi opener had his theory for the umpiring lapses in that series. “The umpires were crouching on their knees looking for no-balls. By the time they looked up, the ball had already passed the batsman and was being relayed by ’keeper Murray to Alvin Kallicharran at gully! Those guys were so quick.”

Edgar made a typically gutsy 65 in the first innings. But he too could not escape a sharp comment. “Kallicharran, always talkative, shouted from gully after an appeal was negated. ‘Is he [the umpire] your father?’”

Blood and guts

New Zealand won the series 1-0 and Edgar made blood and guts 127 in the third Test at Auckland, taking on Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft.

The southpaw, a chartered accountant by profession, said, “Holding was the quickest, Roberts spoke very little and hated batsmen, Garner had bounce and Croft was awkward with his run-up and angle.”

In an eventful career, Edgar was part of the infamous ODI where Greg Chappell asked his brother Trevor to bowl underarm. “Greg bullied Trevor to bowl underarm. I became good friends with Greg later. And I told him he had done the single biggest thing to promote cricket in New Zealand!”

Edgar played his cricket in a different era where his mom used to stitch his chest guard. And the New Zealanders, minutes before entering the arena for the WSC games in front of 50,000 spectators, would be washing and ironing their clothes in their hotel rooms.

And exchanging jerseys with Gundappa Viswanath, “a fine player and a lovely chap,” remains among his favourite memories. Edgar is never short of a tale.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/x5xngz/article30925243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27EDGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/edgar-goes-down-memory-lane/article30925244.ece
220,2020/02/26,"Bumrah, Shami must get their act together","Both got their lengths wrong at the Basin Reserve and the pacemen’s failure let the Kiwi tail wag and accumulate precious runs

India has a bunch of world-class pacemen who have been slicing through lines-up both away and home in the last two years.

And there is intense competition for places. Not many teams would have someone of the quality of Umesh Yadav cooling the bench.

But the pace attack on view at the Basin Reserve, with the exception of Ishant Sharma, largely disappointed.

Let’s take the case of Jasprit Bumrah. He was among the key factors in India’s maiden Test series triumph in Australia last season. With his whippy and deceptive action, he was quick off the pitch, had a nasty short ball and a telling yorker.

Bumrah moved the new ball just enough to find the edge and, when the sphere became older, struck with reverse swing. His pace seldom dropped below 140 kmph even at the fag end of the day, something that impressed pace legend Glenn McGrath.

Just a shadow

Yet, the Bumrah seemed a shadow of his former self at the Basin Reserve. The nip off the track was missing.

Bumrah had spent a long period in the sidelines tending to a rather serious injury, stress fracture of the lower back.

He did not undergo surgery and when he came back, he was drafted into the shorter formats. Except for the game at Mount Maunganui, where he scalped three, Bumrah had a lacklustre T20I series in New Zealand.

And in the ODI series, he conceded 50 or more runs in each of the three games without picking a wicket. The alarm bells were ringing.

Also Read New Zealand beats India by 10 wickets in series-opening test

In the first Test at the Basin Reserve, one got the impression that Bumrah was not letting it rip; perhaps the back injury was playing on his mind.

There were times when Bumrah appeared pedestrian. The explosive release with the arm-speed was absent and the Kiwis were able to play him comfortably.

Down on speed

Bumrah appeared down on speed and was not bowling the right length for the Basin Reserve surface. The seamer pitched short of a good length when he should have, ideally, pitched the ball up.

By not pitching up and drawing the batsman into a drive, Bumrah was not giving the ball a chance to swing. And he was bowling on middle and off-stump when his line should have been off-stump or just outside it.

In fact, it was this line that fetched Bumrah his only wicket of the Test when he had B-J. Watling caught behind.

This was a Test where even the Kiwi lower order batsmen were able to pick his yorker — a major delivery in Bumrah’s arsenal — and dig it out. Bumrah was missing the extra speed that gave his bowling the cutting edge.

No reverse swing

And there was no reverse swing for him either. If someone such as Bumrah finishes with 1/88, the Indian bowling has a problem.

Mohammed Shami too had an ordinary Test, given the high benchmark he has set for himself. Like Bumrah, he, carried away by the grass, bowled the wrong length, only rarely pitching the ball up. Shami is a paceman who relies on the fluency of his run-up to generate speed. Then he uses his wrists and seam position for movement.

However, the stiff breeze at the Basin Reserve appeared to have adversely impacted the rhythm in Shami’s run-up and the rest of his bowling suffered.

India normally blows away the tail. In the first Test, the last three New Zealand wickets added 123 precious runs.

It was a massive phase of the match. The pacemen have to get their act together at Christchurch.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mze202/article30925211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27BUMRAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bumrah-shami-must-get-their-act-together/article30925212.ece

Richardson dislocated his shoulder ahead of last year’s World Cup in England but was recalled for the T20I series against South Africa which ends Thursday and will remain with the team for the one-dayers.

222,2020/02/26,Day-night Tests best way to move forward: McGrath,"Feels India will initially find it difficult to adjust with the pink ball in Australian conditions

For Glenn McGrath, Test cricket is the ultimate format of the game. The former Australian pace ace is not in favour of the proposed four-day Tests, but sees a future in day-night Tests. He is looking forward to the pink ball clash between India and Australia later this year.

After its initial reluctance, India played its first-ever pink-ball Test against Bangladesh in November 2019, and it turned out to be a one-sided affair. Virat Kohli’s men clinched the Test in just three days. But it won’t be as easy Down Under.

“Obviously, there will be other challenges that the Indian team hasn’t come up against in day-night Tests. T20 is taking the world by storm, just that it’s bringing a lot more people to the game. We need to filter that in Test cricket and keep it alive,” McGrath said on the sidelines of an event organised by Tourism Australia.

McGrath has no doubt that India will initially find it difficult to adjust with the pink ball in Australian conditions.

“Australia has got a lot more experience. They have played a lot more day-night Test cricket now, they know how it works,” the 50-year-old said.

But then, he is also excited to see how the star-studded Indian team overcomes the odds.

“Virat (Kohli) is a quality captain. They will be up for the challenge. I am not expecting them to give a walk-over. Australia has lot more advantage in day-night Tests. That will be in their favour and also, the home advantage,” McGrath, who donned the Baggy Green in 124 Tests, said.

At a time when most of the Test-playing nations are taking baby steps towards day-night cricket, McGrath also agrees that it is important to make it a regular affair.

“I think that’s obviously the best way to move forward. The way to gain experience is by getting out there and playing it. We do need to keep Test cricket the ultimate. If you’re successful at Test level nine times out of 10, you will be successful at the shortest level as well. You’ll be pretty successful in the shorter version, get your name in the IPL contract.”

“It all works hand-in-hand. I like the fact that we’ve got three formats, and I think we need to do everything to keep them as healthy as possible,” McGrath said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/661snq/article30924796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27MCGRATH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/day-night-tests-best-way-to-move-forward-mcgrath/article30923295.ece
223,2020/02/26,Kohli loses top spot in ICC Test Player rankings,"Indian skipper slips to second position in Test rankings

India skipper Virat Kohli lost the top spot in the ICC Test Player Rankings after managing only 21 runs in the first Test which his side lost to New Zealand by 10 wickets in Wellington.

Kohli, who has 906 points, slipped to the second position in the list which also features Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Mayank Agarwal at the eighth, ninth and 10th place respectively.

While India vice-captain Rahane, who scored 75 in the opening Test, gained a spot and Mayank returned to a career-best 10th position after amassing 92 runs, which included a second-innings half-century, Pujara dropped two places after returning with identical scores of 11 in the two innings.

Kohli’s slump meant Australia’s Steve Smith was back on top of the list for the eighth time after first occupying the top position in June 2015. The last batsman apart from Smith and Kohli to be number one is New Zealand’s Kane Williamson, for an eight-day period in December 2015.

In bowling chart, off-spinner R. Ashwin, who took three wickets for 99 in the first innings against New Zealand, slipped a place to ninth but remained the only Indian featuring in the top 10 with 765 points.

Fast bowler Ishant Sharma, who took a five-wicket haul on his comeback from injury during the opening Test, gained a place to be at the 17th spot.

New Zealand pacers Tim Southee and Trent Boult made big gains after finishing with nine and five wickets, respectively in the first Test against India.

While Southee advanced eight spots to take sixth position, which is his highest since a career-best fifth place in June 2014, Boult moved up four slots to take joint-13th position.

The all-rounders’ list feature R. Jadeja and Ashwin at the third and fifth positions respectively. While Jadeja didn’t play the first Test, Ashwin scored 0 and 4 in the two innings to lose a place.

In the ICC World Test Championship, India continues to be placed at the top with 360 points, followed by Australia (296).

New Zealand is on 120 points after gaining 60 points for the Wellington victory. It had won 60 points in a 1-1 draw against Sri Lanka.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/88ccve/article30922700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ICCTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kohli-loses-top-spot-in-icc-test-player-rankings/article30922701.ece
224,2020/02/26,The influencers in Indian cricket in the last half century,"Virat Kohli must be one of the most influential cricketers to have played for India. ‘Influential’ is not a word used often in a sporting context. It has more than one aspect to it, though — influence within the team, and influence on the larger public outside it.

Many players have influenced one of the groups, but few both. If youngsters in the 1970s, for example, went around with thick sideburns and long hair, they were paying a tribute to the likes of Farokh Engineer, Tiger Pataudi, B.S. Chandrasekhar, S. Venkatraghavan and Salim Durrani. Bollywood stars and cricketers set the fashion then. When schoolboys walked around with their collars raised, they were hoping to attract some of M.L. Jaisimha’s wonderful gifts as a batsman, too.

Then came Sunil Gavaskar — his influence was deeper, longer-lasting and often coloured the thinking of a whole nation. But more of that later.

Respecter of the game

When Kohli was in contention for the leadership role, many assumed he would have a negative effect. It was easy to make this mistake. It failed to take into account two important elements in his evolution. One, that his occasional boorish behaviour on the field came in the days when he was too young to know better and two, he was always a respecter of the game and its traditions. Critics found it difficult to reconcile the two Kohlis — the aggressive player and the long-standing traditionalist. But the rough edges were easily smoothened out and India had a captain they could be proud of.

When the Kohli beard changed shape and size, so too did those of his teammates and a good chunk of the 20-to-32 demographic in the country. But it wasn’t just that, of course. Kohli’s fitness and his example brought about some of the fittest teams to have taken the field for the country. No longer were fielders escorting the ball to the boundary or sharp chances being allowed to die.

In the 1960s and 70s, perhaps even later, the cricket captain tended to reflect the Indian people. Or perhaps it was the other way around.

Tiger Pataudi, the Oxford-educated Nawab was an aspirational figure, seemingly a notch or two above the rest of his team or indeed the rest of the country. He made the former difference work for him (it was easier to command from a height) while the latter dissimilarity ensured that he twice lost the elections to the Lok Sabha.

Bishan Bedi whose influence on the field was considerable as bowler and later as captain, often reminded everybody, player and public, what ‘cricket’ stood for.

The Great Influencer

With Gavaskar came the middle-class, English-educated player with one quality the previous generation of similar players lacked — self-belief. Not for him the standard response to the question asked of touring cricketers in England, for example, which was usually answered thus: “We have come here to learn.” Gavaskar went to teach, even if he didn’t actually say that.

Two months after the One-Day International was born out of rain and boredom in Melbourne, Gavaskar made his Test debut and finished the series in the West Indies with 774 runs. Indians who laid great store by orthodoxy — and not just in cricket — welcomed him. They loved what he loved, and dismissed what he dismissed. Gavaskar set the agenda: Love the straight bat, love Test cricket, look down upon the cross bat, ignore limited-overs cricket. And India listened. One-day cricket was anathema to Gavaskar, and by extension, to the nation. The format might have disappeared had India not won the World Cup in 1983.

Gavaskar’s influence on the team, straight bat apart, was in instilling a sense of their commercial worth in the players.

He was — and continues to be — the Great Influencer in Indian cricket, with lessons absorbed by Kapil Dev and the Sachin Tendulkar generation.

Tendulkar could not be paid the tribute of imitation for he was inimitable. But he was the poster boy of the ‘New India’ with its greater disposable income.

His colleagues, Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni were influencers who helped spread the game beyond the traditional centres in the big cities. One came from the lap of luxury, the other from the opposite end of the economic spectrum, yet both played key roles in demonstrating that ‘India’ included ‘Bharat’ too.

Kohli’s focus

Kohli is focused on winning, on retaining India’s position at the top of the points table, and taking the team into the final of the World Test Championship next year. Like Gavaskar, he sees the five-day Test as the best the game has to offer, but is modern enough and gifted enough to make a mark in the shorter formats too.

Kohli might well be the most powerful man in the game today, influencing the Board of Control for Cricket in India which is chief influencer of the International Cricket Council. And he has 34 million followers on Twitter — a new element in the whole equation.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/40sniq/article30858647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKETSLTOURININDIA2NDT20,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/the-influencers-in-indian-cricket-in-the-last-half-century/article30915749.ece
225,2020/02/26,Australia vs. South Africa | Smith and Warner return to scene of ‘sandpapergate’,"Australia and South Africa meet in series-deciding T20I

Australia’s Steve Smith and David Warner will return to Newlands on Wednesday, less than two years after they were central figures in one of cricket’s biggest scandals at the ground.

They will be playing in a series-deciding third Twenty20 International against South Africa in front of an expected capacity crowd where “maximum security” will be in operation to prevent any abuse of players.

Smith and Warner were captain and vice-captain of Australia on March 24, 2018 when teammate Cameron Bancroft was caught on television hiding a piece of yellow sandpaper in his trousers during the third day of the third Test.

That evening Smith and Bancroft admitted at a press conference they deliberately tried to tamper with the ball. It quickly emerged Warner was the instigator in the “leadership group” that decided on the sandpaper ploy.

Smith and Warner were banned by governing body Cricket Australia for a year and Bancroft for nine months. Furthermore Warner was stopped from leading his country for life and Smith for a year.

The sandpaper scandal came against the background of an already fractious tour in which Warner became a crowd target after an altercation with South Africa’s Quinton de Kock during the first Test in Durban.

Nearly two years on, Smith and Warner have played in front of packed houses in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth in the first two matches of the series without being subjected to undue abuse.

“We’ve been pretty much overwhelmed by the support we’ve had from fans,” Warner said. “Port Elizabeth was outstanding. They were very respectful. I didn’t cop anything (fielding) on the fence. The kids were yelling out for autographs and we obliged. It was a great atmosphere.

“Being back in Cape Town, it is one of the most picturesque grounds in the world, the ground’s always in good condition, we’ve had success here as a team and me as an individual. I’m chomping at the bit to go out there and share it with the rest of the guys,” said Warner.

Clifford Dodgen, the Newlands stadium manager, said he did not anticipate any problems but there would be “zero tolerance” for unacceptable verbal abuse aimed at any player.

“We’ve got maximum security, with over 200 private security personnel as well as police and metro police,” said Dodgen. “We will have plainclothes people in the crowd and if there is any serious misbehaviour the people responsible will be asked to leave the ground.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2oir6o/article30915869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26SMITH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-vs-south-africa-smith-and-warner-return-to-scene-of-sandpapergate/article30915870.ece
226,2020/02/26,Activist Piyush Manush arrested for threatening house owner,"Activist Piyush Manush was arrested by the city police here on Wednesday on the charges of threatening his house owner and hurting her.

The activist is a tenant since 2015 at a house owned by couple N.N. Singh and Asha Kumari (53) of Kondappanaickenpatti. After the death of Mr. Singh, Asha Kumari moved to Bengaluru and is living with her son.

Since the agreement between the owner and the tenant lapsed in 2019, Asha Kumari asked the activist to vacate the house to which he refused.

She said that she along with her daughter went to the house on February 23 and asked him to vacate. She claimed that the activist had pushed her down.

On February 24, she submitted a petition to the district administration during the weekly grievances redress meeting that the activist had not paid rent for the past one year and was refusing to vacate the house. Also, she submitted a petition to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday at his residence during his visit to Salem. The petition was forwarded to the Kannankurichi police station.

On Wednesday, Assistant Commissioner of Police Eswaran and Kannankurichi Police Inspector Thangavel held inquiries with Piyush Manush and Asha Kumari at the police station. Later, the police registered a case under Sections 294 (b) (uttering obscene words in public place), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (i) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, and arrested the activist. He was produced at the magistrate’s house who sent Piyush Manush to judicial custody till March 11.

227,2020/02/26,Water connections to houses to be completed within a month,"Dedicated Water Supply Scheme to be commissioned by Chief Minister in April

Service connections to 10,000 houses to provide protected water under the Dedicated Water Supply Scheme will be completed in a month after which the project is expected to be commissioned in April.

Currently, the civic body receives 54.09 million litres per day (MLD) of water from River Cauvery and also from borewells that is supplied to residents and commercial establishments in all the 60 wards. The current scheme provides 108 litres per capita per day and the ₹484.45 crore scheme ensures 135 litres per capita per day for the residents in the city. The scheme, implemented by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board aims to supply 81.10 MLD and work commenced in June, 2017.

Raw water is to be drawn from River Cauvery at Varadanallur village at Uratchikottai in Bhavani and treated and pumped to two sumps in the city from where it will be distributed to reservoirs and later to the people. TWAD Board engineers said that of the 21 new reservoirs to be constructed, 17 were completed and finishing work is in progress at four reservoirs. They added that 46 existing service reservoirs will also be used for water distribution.

Of the total 731.82 km distribution network, work is in progress for laying 30 km pipelines while service connection is yet to be given for 10,000 houses while connections were given for 1.20 lakh houses.

Officials are hopeful that house service connections work would be completed within a month and trial run would commence after that. “The scheme could be commissioned in April by the Chief Minister”, they added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ajaag1/article30925861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER27-WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/water-connections-to-houses-to-be-completed-within-a-month/article30925862.ece
228,2020/02/26,Corporation to ease traffic bottlenecks in city,"Seeks ₹ 20.92 crore from the Local Planning Authority to acquire lands

To ease traffic bottlenecks in the city by widening motorable space, the Coimbatore Corporation has sought ₹ 20.92 crore from the Local Planning Authority (LPA).

Sources familiar with the development said the civic body had sought the money that the LPA had under the infrastructure development fund meant for city development. The Corporation had proposed to use to the funds to acquire lands at five places to ease to widen the motorable space – carriage way – or construct new roads so as to form new scheme roads.

The locations identified were two in the East Zone – the ‘S’ bend on Vilankurichi Road and Sowripalayam Road, two in South Zone – Kulathupalayam Road and near Selvachinthamani Tank, and one in North Zone – Ganapathy bus terminus.

To kick start the process in the five places, the sources said the Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath visited the Ganapathy bus terminus recently. There, the Corporation proposed to acquire around 5,242 sq.ft. land north of the terminus to widen the road to establish a link to Old Sathyamangalam Road, where the Corporation had a year go demolished encroachments.

The problem at present was that for vehicles proceeding north from the terminus the road was not straight as they would have to swerve right to move ahead. The land acquisition and development of the area to widen the carriage way would make the exit easy and also give an alternative way for those proceeding to Maniakarampalayam, the sources pointed out.

The cost of the project ₹ 2.76 crore as the Corporation had proposed to pay 2.25 times the guideline value.

As part of this project, the Corporation had also proposed to acquire 2,345 sq.ft. near the Avarampalayam Junction on Sathyamangalam Road (Moore Market) at ₹ 85 lakh to widen the carriage way.

The project on Sowripalayam Road was to widen the carriage way from 12 feet for a 200m stretch from Mariamman Temple to Mahalakshmi Temple. This was a bus route and therefore saw congestion almost several times a day.

The Corporation proposed to acquire more than 8,000 sq.ft. at an estimated cost of ₹ 4.31 crore, the sources said.

Likewise, in near the Selvachinthamani Tank the Corporation proposed to acquire land to construct a new road to establish a scheme road that connected Thadagam Road to Perur Road through Selvapuram North Housing Unit.

In Vilankurichi too, the Corporation proposed to acquire 11 properties that were right in the middle of a four-way junction on Thanneerpandal Road. The move would help movement of vehicles on all the four directions. In the South Zone in Kuniamuthur, the Corporation proposed to establish a link in Kulathupalayam.

Though the Corporation had written to the LPA a year ago, there had been no forward movement on this project. Now, the Corporation proposed to revive the project by getting the funds first as it was a prerequisite for acquiring lands, they added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/xe10te/article30927645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Cbecorpo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-to-ease-traffic-bottlenecks-in-city/article30925840.ece

233,2020/02/26,Eight animals electrocuted in Gudalur,"They were hit by power leakage from a high-tension line in a private estate

An elephant, four wild boars, two mongooses and a cobra died after being electrocuted due to power leakage from a high-tension line in Cherambadi Range in Gudalur.

The electrocutions occurred over a week but Forest Department staff found the remains of the animals only on Tuesday and post-mortems were conducted on Wednesday.

Lack of maintenance

The forest officials said a high-tension power line was passing through a private tea estate in Cherambadi, carrying power to Erumadu village, located along the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border.

The lack of maintenance could have led to the leakage, officials said.

Forest officials think that the elephant, an eight-year-old tusker, could be the first of the victims, followed by the four wild boars that had come to scavenge on the remains of the pachyderm, then the mongooses and the cobra.

“We think that the incident happened around a week ago, but as it happened inside a private estate, we received information about the incident only on Tuesday,” said Sumesh Soman, District Forest Officer, Gudalur.

Postmortem

A postmortem was conducted on the remains of the animals on Wednesday.

Forest department officials said that a case has been registered against the Tangedco lineman for negligence, while top officials have also written to the superintending engineer calling for better maintenance of power lines, electricity poles and increasing the height of power cables to ensure that animals do not accidentally come in contact with them.

“The Forest Department has already written to Tangedco to ensure safety of wildlife numerous times in the past, we will once again reiterate our request,” a senior official said.

Tangedco officials said they would step-up regular maintenance of power lines in the Gudalur region, while also looking into the possibility of raising the height of power lines from the ground level in areas requested by the Forest Department.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/eight-animals-electrocuted-in-gudalur/article30925790.ece

After experimenting various measures to tackle the straying of elephants into human habitations, the Coimbatore Forest Division is all set to introduce colonies of honeybee to tackle the problem.

Soon, the forest division will have a chain of about 2,000 beehives installed along forest boundaries in all the seven forest ranges, the buzz from which will act as a natural elephant deterrent, a method used in many foreign countries.

As part of launching the initiative, the Forest Department is providing training in apiary to 200 families in villages along the forest boundary, who will maintain the beehive boxes. The Department will give each family 10 such boxes free of cost, each to be placed at distance of 10 feet. The Department will use colonies of an Indian honey bee variety in the boxes.

According to Forest Department sources, beehive boxes will be introduced first at places like Chadivayal. Singapathi and Vellapathi coming under Pooluvapatti forest range.

The off white walls of children’s ward at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) got an aesthetic facelift as Chandrans Yuva Foundation and student volunteers from Sri Krishna Adithya College of Arts and Science decorated them with paintings on Wednesday.

After launching the beautification works, CMCH Dean B. Asokan said the paintings on the walls of the 120-bedded paediatric ward would create a soothing atmosphere for paediatric patients. “Psychological well being plays an important role in treatment. The paintings will improve the atmosphere of the ward,” he said.

While the Public Works Department handles painting of hospital buildings, public private partnership activities like the beautification paediatric ward were welcomed, he added.

Around 200 volunteers painted the walls where trained artists had already drawn outlines. Some student volunteers also donated blood to CMCH’s blood bank.

Shasikala Sathiyamurthy, chairperson of the foundation, said that the beautification works were also aimed at improving social responsibility among students.

237,2020/02/26,More special teams formed to nab bank robbers,"Burglars seem to have good knowledge of the security system and experience in breaking into banks, says SP

More special teams have been formed to crack the burglary at State Bank of India’s branch at Kallipalayam near Palladam in Tiruppur district on the night of February 22. Superintendent of Police Disha Mittal said on Wednesday that the number of special teams formed to nab the accused was increased to 11. Initially, four teams were formed. These were increased to six susbequently, and now to 11.

Ms. Mittal said the heist seemed to have been executed in a “professional” and “systematic” manner. “It was done by someone who has good knowledge of banking, security, and someone who has done this many times [before],” she told The Hindu.

The accused entered the premises on the night of February 22 through a window near the back entrance of the bank. Prior to the heist, the burglars disconnected the burglar alarms, CCTV cameras, telephone lines and even the computer servers, Ms. Mittal said. So clandestine was their entry into the bank that the police personnel who were on night rounds were unable to detect any suspicious activities that night, Ms. Mittal said. Besides, the spot through which the burglars gained entry into the bank had no access road that the police could have covered in the routine patrol.

As on Wednesday, the worth of cash stolen was pegged at ₹18,97,000. The accused had opened 31 out of 114 lockers, for which the stolen jewellery was estimated to be at least 230 sovereigns, based on inputs from the locker customers.

However, K.R. Arul, Inspector at Kamanaickenpalayam police station where the case has been registered, said that the estimates are not final as the veracity of the customers' claims could not be confirmed.

No security

Following a similar break-in attempt at the same branch, through the same access point, in October 2019, the bank had transferred a security guard from its Dharapuram branch. However, the guard was deployed at the branch only for a month and was transferred back to the Dharapuram branch. leaving the Kallipalayam branch with no security guards for nearly three months, preliminary police investigations revealed.

Deputy Inspector General of Police (Coimbatore range) G. Karthikeyan and Inspector General of Police (West Zone) K. Periaiah visited the bank on Tuesday. They are closely monitoring the case and are being regularly updated on the developments in the case, Ms. Mittal said.

Although it is estimated that at least four persons were involved in this heist, the SP said that it is “too early” to comment on the identities and whereabouts of the accused.

SBI statement

Two days after the break-in was reported, SBI issued a statement on Wednesday evening saying that three locker cabinets were “partially broken open by the intruders” and that the gold jewellery pledged with the bank were not “tampered with”.

“After this incident, we have been individually contacting the customers whose lockers are affected and the process of verification of the contents of the lockers has commenced (sic),” the statement said. Customers may contact V. Kanagaraj from the SBI Regional Business Office in Tiruppur at 94433 12088 for clarifications, the statement said.

Sources with the SBI said that 31 lockers in the three locker cabinets were damaged. As on Wednesday, 13 lockers were verified with customers and 17 are yet to be verified, with one locker found to be vacant. The Kallipalayam branch was categorised as a “normal risk” branch, due to which there were no full-time security guards, according to sources.

According to officials from the Fire and Rescue Services Department, they received information about the fire at around midnight. Two fire tenders rushed to the spot and managed to put out the blaze in a couple of hours.

The fire and rescue services personnel combed through the buildings, most of which were temporary structures with tin sheets, to make sure that no one was trapped in any of the shops. They said that there were no injuries or deaths caused by the fire. The personnel said that eight fruit shops and three provision stores were gutted.

The personnel went to the area on Tuesday morning to cut a tree that had been burnt, and the branches of which were in danger of falling on pedestrians.

“The cause of the fire has been narrowed down to either being caused by a short circuit or by someone accidentally setting fire to a mound of garbage disposed behind the shops,” said Mr. Immanuel.

241,2020/02/26,Corpn. has rethink on command and control centre project,"The Coimbatore Corporation, it appears, is having a rethink on having an integrated command and control centre.

The Corporation had proposed the establishment of such a centre at ₹ 120 crore at its head office in Town Hall.

The centre with giant screens would relay real time data on various aspects of the Corporation’s administration – water supply, street light, road work and health among others – so that any point in time, the senior officers at the Corporation would get to know the number of leaks in the city or their area of operation, number of faulty street lights, traffic on city streets, among others.

But it appears that the Corporation is having a rethink.

The civic body had proposed to develop its own version of such a centre after integrating various functions, said a senior officer.

At present, the task was to digitise the monitoring of various functions, starting with street lights.

The Corporation was installing automated switches, using which it could remotely switch on or off the lights and also get to know which street light on which pole was dysfunctional.

Likewise, the Corporation would establish a system for monitoring water supply – not just to identify leaks in or damages to the distribution system, but also know how much water was supplied.

On the tax collection front, the Corporation had digitised the collection.

After automating or digitising every aspect of its administration so that the supervising officials had data at the click of a button, the Corporation would go in for integrating those into a centre, the officer said and added that at present the Corporation would not like to take up the integrated command and control centre as proposed earlier.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corpn-has-rethink-on-command-and-control-centre-project/article30917001.ece

Around 50 scientists, research scholars and forest officials across the nation participated in the workshop to discuss issues pertaining to climate change. The workshop was inaugurated by Professor Raman Sukumar, (IISc, Bengaluru) who highlighted the importance of permanent monitoring of forest plots to study climate change.

“M.P. Singh, Director, IWST, Bangalore, appreciated the efforts made by the team of scientists for formulating and execution of the project nationwide as per international protocols formulated by Centre for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS),” a press release from the IWST said.

“During the workshop, methods to establish permanent plots to study forest dynamics were finalised. Aimed at precision, uniformity, and large scale of international acceptance, scientists discussed [ways] to lay down country wide permanent plots (preferably of 10 hectare) in major forest types of the country,” the release added.

Hands-on training on establishment and enumeration of experimental plots was imparted by H.S. Suresh and his team from the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

Soil monitoring and enumeration of forest tree species will be conducted though this massive effort initially for 5 years.

243,2020/02/26,Bus stand project: Corporation studying land lease agreement,"The Coimbatore Corporation was studying the lease agreement it had signed with the Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Pvt. Ltd. to explore ways to proceed with the construction of the integrated bus stand project in Vellalore.

The Corporation had signed the lease agreement with the company in October 2008 leasing 180-odd acre in Vellalore to help the latter establish a waste processing plant. The lease was for 20 years starting from the date the company would commence operations.

As the company had started operations in April 2011, the land would be with the company till March 2031.

While the land was in the company’s possession, the Corporation had a few weeks ago launched the project at ₹ 168 crore to construct the bus stand on 60 acre, a parcel of land that fell within the leased 180-plus acre.

After The Hindu reported the issue, the Corporation was looking into the issue by studying the lease document.

It would then engage with the company to explore ways to get back the land – either by signing a fresh lease agreement or trading equal measurement of land for the 60 acre or some such means, said an officer.

An argument that the Corporation would advance was that the company had not used most of the land in question and whatever structures it had erected were temporary and therefore it should not be difficult for the company to part with the land.

The officer said after studying the lease agreement, the Corporation would talk to the company in the next couple of weeks, for it did not want the lease agreement to be an irritant in the bus stand project.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bus-stand-project-corporation-studying-land-lease-agreement/article30916979.ece

246,2020/02/26,Demand up for affordable houses in Coimbatore,"Houses that are priced between ₹ 25 lakh and ₹ 30 lakh and located in the city or in the fringe areas have good demand

Residential units that are relatively smaller in size, come with basic facilities and priced below ₹ 30 lakh seem to be getting a better traction in the city and on its outskirts.

Affordable housing is a segment that has only a few promoters developing such projects in the city. However, the projects that are launched in this segment are said to be seeing good demand that is growing too.

According to JLL India, apartments or independent houses that are priced between ₹ 25 lakh and ₹ 30 lakh and located in the city or in the fringe areas have good demand. It is a volume business and most of the projects are located on the outskirts so that land cost is affordable to the promoters. Further, raw material transport should be cost-effective. The demand for these houses is not only from the city, but also from Tiruppur, Karur, and Erode. Those who have shifted to Coimbatore for work and want to buy a house look at this segment. There are also a number of small independent houses that are coming up in the areas just outside the city limits. This is a demand driven market, says a JLL representative.

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana supports those who want to buy an affordable housing by providing credit linked interest subsidy. Awareness about the scheme and how to get the support should improve, the representative adds.

Rajesh B. Lund, head of the environment committee of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI), says Chennai and Coimbatore have a few projects in this segment. The main raw material for the housing projects is land and it should be at an affordable price. The CREDAI has been appealing to the government to increase the size of the houses to 60 sq.mt. carpet area for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and 90 sq.mt. for the Low Income Group (LIG). This will enable more promoters to get into the segment.

Builders Association of India Coimbatore centre head V. Sivarajan says there are several small residential units that have come up on the outskirts of the city and these are all less than 900 sq.ft area. The cost is also less than ₹ 35 lakh. Several builders are into this project in the recent years. The PMAY scheme is helpful to beneficiaries who want to buy a house and are eligible. It is more of a support. The market itself is huge for the affordable housing segment, he says.

District Lead Bank Manager S. Venkataramanan says that outstanding housing loan amount given by banks in the district as on December 31, 2018 was ₹ 4,737 crore and it was ₹ 4,892 crore as on December 31. 2019. Loans given for affordable houses are not monitored separately. But individual banks take steps to extend loans for affordable houses. Credit extended under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is only for beneficiaries in the EWS or LIG segments. They need to get certificates from the officials concerned to benefit from the scheme. So far, there is no complaint about loans extended under the scheme in the district.

RR Housing has done four to five affordable housing projects in the city and the response is good, says its managing director R. Karanaboopathy. The demand is for two bed room houses within the city. “We cut on the size and not on quality,” he says. Most of the buyers are first time home owners and buy it for self-occupancy, he says. About the challenges in affordable housing, Mr. Karanaboopathy says the home buyers may have taken bank loans for other purposes, some may have defaulted on repayments too. So, rejection of applications for loans under this segment is almost 40 %. The buyers face a lot of challenges and hence the risk is high.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/z4dwfi/article30916958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26cbmsp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/demand-up-for-affordable-houses-in-coimbatore/article30916959.ece

The surgery was performed at Kovai Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) on November 2019. According to a statement from the hospital, the boy was initially diagnosed with advanced stage kidney failure due to a rare genetic condition called Alport syndrome. After his maternal uncle offered to donate one of his kidneys, the doctors discovered that both of them suffered from haemophilia, a genetic condition where a person's blood does not clot properly.

“Surgery in these cases will be very risky as it carries a high risk of uncontrollable bleeding,” the statement said. A team consisting of nephrologist V. Mangalakumar, two urologists and a vascular surgeon performed the surgery. The hospital said the donor and the recipient had recovered following the transplantation surgery.

Dr. Mangalakumar told The Hindu that the chances of survival for the boy was less had the hospital opted for a donor from Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (Transtan). “The [Transtan] waiting list was too long.

250,2020/02/26,CBSE puts off exam in 80 centres in Delhi,"Fails to comply with HC order to give future schedule

The Central Board of Secondary Education has postponed Thursday’s Class 12 English board examination for students at 80 centres in the violence-affected areas of northeast Delhi. However, the CBSE failed to comply with a Delhi High Court order directing it to announce by 6 p.m. whether it planned to postpone examinations for Friday and Saturday as well.

The court also told the CBSE to present a plan for alternative ways and means for holding the exams. While rescheduling, the board must keep in mind that Class 12 students would soon need to sit for entrance examinations and seek admission to colleges and universities, said the court order.

The High Court was hearing a plea by a private school in east Delhi which has students living in violence-hit areas.

During the hearing, Justice Rajiv Shakdher told the CBSE that students should not be informed about the schedule on a piecemeal basis. “You cannot decide only for tomorrow or day after. Take a call for the next 10 to 15 days. The children need to know. They cannot wait each day for the next day,” said the judge, according to a report by the Press Trust of India.

In his final order, the judge noted that CBSE regional office deputy secretary L.L. Meena had informed the court that the board would “take a decision concerning examinations slated to be held on 27.2.2020, 28.2.2020 and 29.2.2020 qua grade X and grade XII by 5.00 pm today.” Class 10 students have their Hindi examination on Saturday, apart from a number of vocational and elective subjects.

While the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has postponed Wednesday’s Class 10 and 12 board exams at 86 centres, students who live in the area but have exam centres elsewhere have been left stranded. Other students who have exams later in the week are also worried about the fate of those papers.

Swati* is a Class 12 student who lives near Karawal Nagar and is worried about how to reach her examination centre near Karkardooma Court for Thursday’s English paper.

“I live inside the narrow lanes. Everything is calm here now because the whole neighbourhood was awake last night and guarding themselves. But I really don’t think it will be safe to go for my exam because I have to pass through Bhajanpura to reach the examination centre which is the most affected area,” she told The Hindu on Wednesday morning.

Her worried family asked her to contact the CBSE and she called the number found on the board’s website. “I don’t know who picked up the phone. They just said, ‘You have to manage by any means,’ ” she said.

With a large number of students and worried relatives complaining to the CBSE as well as the State government, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is raising their concerns with the board, according to a tweet by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi late on Tuesday night.

No response yet

The Hindu has also asked the CBSE secretary and spokesperson what the Board plans to do about these stranded students. There has been no response yet.

On Twitter, Karawal Nagar resident Rajesh Gupta said his Class 10 daughter had her examination centre in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar where examinations continue as scheduled. “How will she reach the exam centre? Please help us. Please take action,” he tweeted, in response to tweets by Mr. Sisodia and the CBSE. Class 10 students are scheduled to write English exams today.

“What about those who live near North East and have centre out of North East. My younger brother is in 10th class and here current situation is critical. Kindly please analyse the situation and Sir, please postpone the paper,” said a tweet from Muhammad Iftikhar.

“But what about those living in NE Delhi and have to appear for paper in Lodhi road? How will I reach the centre?” said a tweet from Amaan Ahmad.

Pulkit Arora tweeted a video of police announcing a strict curfew in the area, and asked, “How could we the residents of Maujpur would be able to give the exam! Its not possible for us too! Please see this matter again!”

Police recovered the body of a 26-year-old man, identified as Ankit Sharma, from a drain in Chand Bagh area. He was working as a security assistant with Intelligence Bureau. He was missing from Tuesday evening when he was attacked by some people.

Tensions remained high in northeast Delhi on Tuesday, with shops and vehicles being torched and rioters running amok in several parts, especially Maujpur, Brahampuri, Chand Bagh and other adjoining areas.

The death toll in the violence, that took a communal colour and spread to the neighbouring areas on Monday, rose to 23 on Wednesday, including the police head constable Rattan Lal. Organised groups had attacked each other.

253,2020/02/26,Delhi violence: Defiant BJP leader Kapil Mishra says did not commit crime by supporting CAA,"Kapil Mishra led a gathering in support of the CAA at Maujpur Chowk in Jafarabad area on Sunday, after which violence erupted between pro- and anti-CAA groups.

Facing flak for his speech during a gathering in favour of CAA at Maujpur Chowk in northeast Delhi, BJP leader Kapil Mishra remained defiant on Tuesday saying he was not scared of the “massive hate campaign” against him for “speaking truth” and supporting the amended citizenship law.

Mr. Mishra, a former AAP MLA who unsuccessfully contested the recent Assembly polls on a BJP ticket from Model Town, led a gathering in support of the CAA at Maujpur Chowk in Jafarabad area on Sunday, after which violence erupted between pro- and anti-CAA groups.

In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Mr. Mishra said that he was being abused and issued “death threats” and stressed that he did not commit any crime by supporting the amended citizenship law.

“I have received calls by many to kill me. Many people including politicians and journalists are abusing me. But, I am not scared because I have not done anything wrong,” Mishra told PTI.

BJP’s East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir on Tuesday supported strict action against anyone, including Mr. Mishra, if they gave “provocative” speeches.

“Whoever, no matter which party he belongs to, whether he is Kapil Mishra or anyone else, who gave speeches to provoke people, action should be taken against them,” Mr. Gambhir told reporters after visiting injured police officers admitted at Max hospital in Patparganj.

During his pro-CAA demonstration at Maujpur Chow, Mr. Mishra had also issued an ultimatum to police to vacate the roads blocked by anti-CAA protesters in Jafarabad and Bhahanpura areas in three days, warning that he will come back on the streets if no action was taken.

Mr. Mishra also attacked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who held a meeting with MLAs of violence hit areas in north east Delhi on Tuesday.

“Why did you not appeal in your speech to open the blocked roads in Delhi? Being the Chief Minister, you should immediately appeal for opening of roads. Why are you saving rioters blocking the road?” Mr. Mishra alleged in a tweet.

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari appealed to all the BJP leaders to do everything possible to establish peace in Delhi.

“No leader should do such a thing that causes confusion and sends a wrong message among the people. Everyone should refrain from making inflammatory statements,” Mr. Tiwari said in a statement.

Mr. Mishra, however, received support from some BJP leaders including party MLA and former Delhi president Vijender Gupta who tweeted: “Some friends in media and so-called intellectuals are saying that Kapil Mishra is responsible for violence in Delhi, while they keep mum on statements on those like Waris Pathan. They do not want to stop violence, but are sharpening their agenda in the fire of violence.”

Mr. Pathan is an AIMIM leader.

Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinderpal Singh Bagga also tweeted in support of Mr. Mishra.

Without naming Kapil Mishra, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi alleged that the violence was a result of “incitement by a former MLA and BJP leader” and it cannot be termed as communal riot.

“I believe that this whole thing cannot be called a communal riot. It started because an ex-MLA of BJP stood shoulder to shoulder with a DCP and openly gave an ultimatum,” he alleged in his interaction with mediapersons in Hyderabad.

254,2020/02/26,Delhi violence | Video of inflammatory slogans at BJP MLA’s march surfaces,"Abhay Verma says the slogans were raised, but that was by “common people” in the area and not his supporters.

BJP MLA Abhay Verma on Tuesday night led a march in his area in Laxmi Nagar, east Delhi, during which people allegedly chanted “Police ke hatyaaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko [Shoot the people, who murdered the policeman]"".

In a video of the march, the group was also heard chanting “Jo Hindu hit ki baat karega, wohi desh pe raj karega” (People who talk about the welfare of Hindus, only they will rule in the country) and “Jai Shree Ram”.

When contacted, Mr. Verma confirmed that both the slogans were raised, but that it was by “common people” in the area and not his supporters. “You see the videos, I’m waving my hands and asking people not to raise the slogans. But in a mob, who will stop whom,” Mr. Verma told The Hindu on Wednesday.

In the video, a person walking very close to Mr. Verma, on his right side, is raising the slogans, while others surrounding him completed the slogans. Mr. Verma is seen waving his hands, at least when the group was chanting “Hamara vidayak kaisa ho... Abhay Verma jaisa ho”.

It is not audible or clear from the video whether Mr. Verma was asking people not to raise slogans, but the BJP MLA did not stop the march even after the “goli maaro” slogans, which were raised at least twice.

Amit Shah has failed: AAP

The AAP attacked the BJP for the slogans raised during the march. “Delhi is burning since last 48 hours. Home Minister @AmitShah has completely failed to control the law and order situation of Delhi. BJP Delhi vice-president who’s MLA from Laxmi Nagar can been seen inciting violence in Delhi. Will @AmitShah act?” AAP said in a tweet.

“What is this Laxmi Nagar BJP MLA doing? Amit Shah, holds all-party meeting, pretending to restore peace and their MLA is engaged in inciting riots,” AAP MP Sanjay Singh said in a tweet while sharing the video on Tuesday.

Mr. Verma said that around 6 p.m. on Tuesday he received many phone calls from people in the area who were worried that there would be riots in the area and shops were being closed. “As a public representative, I reached Vijay Chowk main market and urged shopkeepers to open the shops and assured that everything will be peaceful. To instil faith in the people we then took two rounds in the area. Because of this, there was no problem in the area and everything was peaceful.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ae2rac/article30917599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26DEFIRE-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-violence-video-of-inflammatory-slogans-at-bjp-mlas-march-surfaces/article30920322.ece
255,2020/02/26,"Delhi violence | Timely action by police could have saved lives, says Supreme Court","Supreme Court judge K.M. Joseph slams ‘lack of professionalism’.

Lives could have been saved and the spiral of communal mob violence stopped had the police acted in time to halt people from making inflammatory remarks, Supreme Court judge K.M. Joseph hit out at the Delhi Police on Wednesday.

When Solicitor General Tushar Mehta tried to hush the judge lest his oral remarks “demoralise the police” during these tense times, Justice Joseph said, “I will talk! I will talk because of my loyalty to this institution”.

Both Justices S.K. Kaul and Joseph told Mr. Mehta there was no harm in hearing them out first.

“Lack of professionalism of the police is the main problem here. If you had not allowed people to get away after inflammatory remarks, all this would not have happened. If you act the way law requires to act, you will see the difference,” Justice Joseph observed orally.

Also Read Delhi HC issues directions to help city’s riot victims

“One of my constables has died. My DCP is injured. He is on ventilator. Let us not demoralise the police by saying anything now. We don’t know what the situation on the ground is,” Mr. Mehta kept repeating.

“This will happen if you allow people to get away. Unless you get the police to act, there will be no difference. Look at how police acts in the U.K. Do they require somebody’s nod? If somebody makes an inflammatory remark, police swings into action immediately,” Justice Joseph responded.

Justice Kaul said what had happened (riots) in the last few days had been “unfortunate”.

But Mr. Mehta urged Justice Kaul to refrain from using term “unfortunate” as it may “legitimise” whatever had happened.

“Who can deny that whatever has happened is not unfortunate? Yes, many unfortunate things have happened. It should not have happened,” Justice Kaul addressed the law officer for the government.

“Of course... But you have to know the ‘whys’, ‘hows’ and ‘whats’,” Mr. Mehta responded.

Both Justices Kaul and Joseph, however, conveyed their “absolute” opposition to the “expression of dissent in violence”. Justice Kaul said contrarian views should be debated without violence.

Advocate Mehmood Pracha, one of the lawyers present, said, “Houses are being burnt even as we talk”.

Shaheen Bagh protests

The court was hearing a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni to shift the Shaheen Bagh protesters to an another site as they had been “blocking” public movement and causing traffic snarls in the area.

Noting that it would not “expand the scope of the petition”, the Bench disposed of an application of former Wajahat Habibullah and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, to provide protection to the Shaheen Bagh protesters.

The apex court also did not pass any interim orders on the application that referred to media reports about how BJP leader Kapil Mishra instigated violence at a rally near Maujpur-Babarpur metro station on February 23. It left the issue in the hands of the Delhi High Court.

Last week, the Supreme Court appointed interlocutors - senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran – to coax the Shaheen Bagh protesters to shift to another site.

However, Justice Kaul indicated that the interlocutors report was inconclusive. “There are too many 'ifs' and 'buts',” he said.

As of now, the apex court refrained from intervening further, saying the “atmosphere is not conducive” for passing orders on the petition seeking the removal of the Shaheen Bagh protesters.

The Delhi High Court in a midnight hearing on Wednesday ordered the Delhi Police to ensure safe passage of about 22 riot victims stuck in a “fairly small” hospital in northeast Delhi to a government hospital with better facilities. The court also ordered to ensure that the victims received immediate emergency treatment.

The hearing was held at 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday at the residence of Justice S. Muralidhar and was attended by Joint Commissioner of Delhi Police Alok Kumar and Deputy Commissioner of Police (crime) Rajesh Deo.

The death toll in Delhi’s worst-ever communal violence since 1984 rose to 27, with 14 more persons succumbing to injuries sustained in clashes that began over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Sunday evening.

After four days, both the Centre and the Delhi government swung into action, with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal going to the disturbed parts of the city on Wednesday to rebuild confidence among people.

In a walkabout shown live on television, Mr. Doval spoke to residents, some of whom posed tough questions. A bearded man could be heard telling him: “Muslims are being killed wherever their numbers are few.”

“The situation is under control and people are satisfied. We have confidence in law enforcement agencies. The police are doing their job and are alert,” Mr. Doval said, suggesting that the demand for calling out the Army was not under consideration.

Minutes after Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanded the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm and normalcy to be restored at the earliest. These were his first public comments on the violence since Sunday.

Earlier, at an unprecedented midnight hearing, the Delhi High Court directed the police to ensure safe passage for ambulances from a small hospital in the affected area to a better-equipped hospital.

Addressing the Assembly, Mr. Kejriwal, who has come under fire for not reaching out to the people, said, “This was not done by Delhi’s common people. It was done by people from outside, political and anti-social elements. Because of the actions of these people, some areas of Delhi are burning.”

“We are hearing that it is a Hindu-Muslim fight. Hindu and Muslims are not fighting in Delhi,” he said. He then read out the names of those who have died in the violence in north-east Delhi and said both Hindus and Muslims had died.

Though Wednesday witnessed fewer incidents than the previous three days, reporters saw fresh cases of the wounded and dead being brought to Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital.

Delhi police PRO M.S. Randhawa said a total of 18 FIRs had been registered and 106 people arrested for indulging in the violence and killings.

“We have obtained CCTV footage of miscreants to identify them and are using drones to check rooftops. We will take action against the building owners if stones are found on the rooftops. On Wednesday, we conducted route marches, and calls to police control rooms were monitored by senior police officers,” Mr. Randhawa said.

The list of the dead at GTB Hospital is Deepak (34), Ishak Khan (24), Mohammad Mudassar (30), Vir Bhan (50), Mohammad Mubarak Hussain (28), Shan Maohammad (35), Pravesh (48), Zakir (24), Mehtab (22), Ashfaque (22), Rahul Solanki (26), Shahid (25), Mohammad Furkan (30), Rahul Thakur (23), Ratan Lal (42), Ankit Sharma (26) and Dilbar.

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari appealed to all the party leaders on Tuesday to work towards establishing peace in the national capital and not to do anything that causes “confusion” and sends a “wrong message” to people.

Mr. Tiwari, who attended an all-party meeting convened by Union Home Minister Amit Shah earlier in the day, also said everyone should refrain from making “inflammatory” statements.

BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who led a pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) rally at the Maujpur Chowk on Sunday, has been accused of delivering a “provocative” speech at the event.

“Shri Tiwari appealed to all the BJP leaders to do everything possible to establish peace in Delhi. No leader should do such a thing that causes confusion and portrays a wrong message among the people. Everyone should refrain from making inflammatory statements. Intentionally some people are trying to mislead the common people of Delhi,” a statement issued by the Delhi BJP said.

Strongly condemning the violence that has claimed 13 lives in the national capital since Monday, the statement said all political parties should rise above party politics to restore peace in Delhi as soon as possible.

“The violent incidents taking place during the protests are disturbing. All the people in the country have the right to speak and hold peaceful protests but not to disturb the public in the name of demonstration,” it added.

Accompanied by Union minister Harsh Vardhan, Tiwari also met the family members of Delhi Police Head Constable Ratan Lal, who was killed in the violence on Monday.

He expressed grief over Lal’s death, saying attacks on policemen and common people were extremely unfortunate.

Later in the night, Mr. Tiwari and Harsh Vardhan met those who were injured in the violence at different hospitals in the city.

Former Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra, who also attended the all-party meeting called by Shah, said he recommended formation of peace committees and strict action against those making “provocative” statements.

At 3 p.m. on Durgapuri’s 100 Foota Road — adjacent to Babarpur — in north-east Delhi, members of two communities clashed, hurled stones and fired gunshots with not even a single police officer in the sight for more than an hour.

At the spot which was about a km away from Durgapuri Check Post, a group of men with faces covered and lathis in hand continued to throw stones and bricks at each other.

A group of people, sporting tilak on their foreheads, chanted “Jai Sri Ram and Har Har Mahadev” during the attack while another set of crowd abused them.

Meanwhile, a bike, a mini-truck and a shop— all owned by members of minority community — were set ablaze. Our reporter at the crime spot could hear 11 gunshots in six minutes. It is unclear as to who used the firearms.

At 3.45 p.m., members from the minority community with glasses in their hands were met with those from the majority community, carrying sticks and bricks. “Aamne samne ki ladai hai… bahar aao… kab tak andar rahoge [It’s a face-off…come out…how long will you stay inside your homes],” said a member of the majority community.

Talking about the situation, members of the majority community said they are not clashing because of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but because they want the roads cleared.

“We want all the roads cleared. They can’t turn the entire Delhi into Shaheen Bagh. Our people are facing problems for so many days now. If they want to stay in Delhi, they have to stay with us,” said a man who identified himself as Abhishek Sharma.

In between the violence, there was a rumour — a temple in the middle of the street has been vandalised — which worsened the scenario in the area.

The locals, who were not part of the clashes in the area, stayed indoors. Some of them peeked from their galleries to see the situation.

They said it was peaceful till 11.30 p.m. but tension escalated afterward, leading to shopkeepers pulling down their shutters.

“The police had come in the morning to disperse the crowd but after they left, it started again,” said a resident.

The women were protesting at the spot since Saturday night against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). A protester, Naushad, said: “The outsiders creating problems in the area have also been removed.”

Faizi said that a bullet hit him when he was out looking for his brother at 7 p.m. on Monday.

“As I stepped out, I saw a boy, younger than me, bleeding because of a bullet injury. I was helping him when a bullet hit me from somewhere. People were firing from the terraces,” the Class 7 boy said.

His family immediately rushed him to a nursing home from where he was taken to GTB Hospital.

The family, while showing the boy’s X-ray, said the doctors told them that the bullet cannot be taken out because of its location inside the body.

264,2020/02/26,Grief and fury grip families which lost loved ones in violence,"Unsure of faces behind the killings, kin of victims wait outside GTB mortuary to receive bodies; some blame police for inaction

Among the people who lost their lives in the violence on Monday was a policeman who reported for duty despite being unwell, a man whose wife is three-month pregnant, and a brother whose sister is scheduled to get married in April.

Outside Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital mortuary on Tuesday, the families of these three victims were seen waiting to receive the bodies. The victims who have been identified are head constable Ratan Lal, Mohammed Furkan, Shahid Khan, Nazim, Vinod and Rahul Solanki.

‘An honest officer’

Lal’s brother-in-law Deepak Bari remembered the constable as an honest officer who did not take a penny of unearned money. “He had a high fever on Monday. His wife asked him to take a leave but he still reported to duty. What else could he do in such a situation and when there were fewer officers?” said Mr. Deepak from Jaipur.

Lal, the sole breadearner in his family, lived in Burari with his wife and three children. Mr. Deepak said Lal’s wife received a call at 4 p.m. stating that he has been injured and is critical. “She then called us. We switched on the television when we saw news of his death. We immediately left for Delhi,” he said. She does not believe that Lal is no more, Mr. Deepak saidon Tuesday afternoon. “She is in a state of shock and is telling me to bring him home. She is waiting. What should I say to her?”

Advised not to cry

Another victim, Shahid, whose wife is three-month pregnant has been advised not to cry. The two got married in September 2019. The 22-year-old victim from New Mustafabad used to drive an autorickshaw for a living.

Shahid’s brother Imran (25) said their cousin received the news of his death on WhatsApp in their hometown in Bulandshahr. “He received Shahid’s photos on WhatsApp and called me. We went looking for him but couldn’t find him for two hours. After some time, we were told that he was shot in Bhajanpura,” Mr. Imran said.

Subsequently, the family was informed that he has been brought to a nursing home close to their residence. The family then went there to receive his body. “We kept his body on the street for an hour not knowing what to do. Elders in the area then suggested to take him to hospital for post-mortem. He was shot in the chest,” Mr. Imran said, adding that they don’t know who shot him. “He had left for work in the morning and that is all we know”.

A resident of Dayalpur’s Babu Nagar, Hari Singh Solanki, lost his 26-year-old son Rahul in the violence. He blamed the police for his son’s death. “The situation near our house was getting tense when I called 112 [emergency helpline number of Delhi Police] at around 3 p.m. twice. I also called a few police officers. They kept assuring me that they would turn up but not even a single officer came to the spot,” he alleged. At 5.45 p.m., Rahul left home to get milk and never returned. Sometime later, his father was informed that someone shot Rahul. “We took him to a nearby nursing home but they refused to treat him. We wanted to take him to GTB Hospital straight but the road was blocked due to the clashes. We then took him to a Loni government hospital but we had lost him by then,” the father said.

Rahul’s sister was due to get married on April 27 but “now what will happen?” the father cried. Another victim Vinod Kumar from Brahmpuri was stoned to death on Monday night, his family said. Vinod’s son Monu said they had gone out when stones were pelted at them. “Nobody came to help us,” said the son, who also sustained injuries. On Monday, Mohammed Furkan’s brother Mohammed Imran said he looked for him in GTB Hospital’s Emergency for a while before he could finally find his body. “I asked the doctor if I could take him to a private hospital but he said he was dead,” the brother said. Mr. Imran said his brother was not a part of the protest.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xq93po/article30916428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-FAMILY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/grief-and-fury-grip-families-which-lost-loved-ones-in-violence/article30917573.ece

266,2020/02/26,"Students, anti-CAA protesters appeal for peace, seek Mishra’s arrest","Former JNU students’ union president to set up 30 peace committees in violence-affected areas

Students and anti-CAA protesters under the banner — Young India — on Tuesday appealed for peace in Delhi and called for the active intervention of local MLAs, heavier police deployment and immediate arrest of BJP leader Kapil Mishra for allegedly instigating violence.

“We need to make sure that something like 1984 or 2002 does not get repeated,” said former JNUSU president N. Balaji. He said he will set up at least 30 peace committees near protest sites such as Nizamuddin, Hauz Rani and other areas, especially those near educational institutions, that would speak to locals and appeal for clam. The group also appealed for MLAs to “leave their offices and go meet the public”.

Social activist Kavita Krishna attacked the BJP, holding it responsible for the current environment in Delhi. “The U.S. president is in the country now, perhaps which is why the riots are taking place..We need to send a message to the world that the largest democracy is in danger,” she said.

‘Police doing nothing’

Comparing the current state of the city to the 1984 riots, Ms. Krishnan said the police did nothing to end the violence and instead are helping the mob. An anti-CAA protester, who has been a part of the demonstrations at Eidgah, said the current situation has risen out of statements made by the Prime Minister like “you can identify rioters by their clothes”. She also said the anti-CAA protesters were non-violent. “We follow the path of Gandhi...please stop dividing this country,” she appealed.

Other anti-CAA protesters in Wazirabad, a Dalit rights group from Uttar Pradesh — Blue Panthers — and doctors’ association from the across the city also attended the press conference. The group also denounced the CAA, NRC and NPR, calling them “communally divisive and unconstitutional”.

268,2020/02/26,IIT-Delhi students develop ways to curb air pollution,"Union Minister calls upon everyone to join the national effort to fight pollution

Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi hosted an exhibition on ‘Clean Air Prototypes’ developed by pan India IITs on Tuesday. The exhibition was inaugurated by Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Sanjay Dhotre.

The exhibition showcased prototypes from IIT-Bombay, IIT-Delhi, IIT-Dhanbad and IIT-Ropar that dealt with issues like filtration of particulate matter, measurement of AQI, how to use agricultural waste to make eco-friendly products and innovations to avoid stubble burning.

Speaking at the event, Mr. Dhotre said, “We need to abandon our conventional mentality of acting only when the problem directly affects us. We need to thank Delhi for creating an awareness in the country. Today, we know about AQI because of Delhi.”

The Minister added that the government was making serious efforts to drastically reduce pollution levels in the country but it was important for every citizen and every organisation to make concerted efforts by joining in the national effort to fight air pollution.

‘Ready for deployment’

IIT Director V. Ramgopal Rao said that all the prototypes are in working condition and ready to be deployed to curb pollution in Delhi so that the impact can be studied. “We have one planet and I think it’s everybody’s responsibility to protect it,” Mr. Rao said.

Aerogram-Ezio, a start-up incubated at IIT-Delhi said that their prototype was based on the idea that people should know what they breathe. The device uses sensors to depict AQI levels in 100 metre vicinity and has been tested in different pockets of IIT-Delhi campus.

The founders hope that they will be able to create a database of AQI levels in different areas during variable time periods to identify the hotspots. The identification will further help in choosing the course of action.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday gave the go-ahead to the Nauroji Nagar redevelopment project where a commercial hub, including a World Trade Centre, has been planned.

A Bench of Justices G.S. Sistani and Jyoti Singh vacated the August 30, 2018 order by which the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) was restrained from any further construction at the project.

The court said that once the issues of water and traffic congestion have been taken care of and there are no objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective departments, it was satisfied that there was no impediment in completion of redevelopment projects at Nauroji Nagar in south Delhi.

“There is no violation of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act and there is adequate compensatory plantation in lieu of felling of trees at Nauroji Nagar,” the Bench said.

The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Tuesday lashed out against the university’s “hasty and authoritarian move” to push forward with its proposal to get an Institute of Eminence (IoE) status without prior statutory approvals, it said.

“Though the V-C has called an emergency meeting of the Executive Council to get formal approval for the IoE proposal, he has not allowed the statutory authorities any reasonable time to apply their minds and debate the implications of the problematic proposal,” DUTA said in a statement.

The union argued that prima facie, the proposal was a “blueprint for steady commercialisation of the university through an undertaking to start self-financing courses and online degree programmes at a massive scale..”

The IoE proposal put forward by DU undertakes to hike student fee, hire up to 20% foreign faculty on an incentive-based differential pay structure, DUTA said.

It also bound the university to an obligation to raise at least ₹95 crore towards meeting recurring expenses like salaries and ₹350 crore towards non-recurring capital expenditure by 2025, the statement read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/teachers-lash-out-at-dus-push-for-eminence-tag/article30917526.ece
272,2020/02/26,Ghaziabad most polluted city in the world: report,"‘India is 5th most polluted country’

India was the fifth most polluted country in 2019 with Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region ranking as the most polluted city in the world, according to a global compilation of PM2.5 particulate pollution data by a company that primarily works on air filtration.

On the whole, air pollution in India decreased in 2019 from 2018 though about half of the 50 most polluted cities were in India, the report by IQAir noted.

India launched a ‘National Clean Air Programme’ (NCAP) in 2019 that commits to reduce air pollution in 102 most polluted cities by a maximum of 30% by 2024. The report, however, noted that the reduction in pollution in 2019 couldn’t be attributed to the NCAP but rather due to “slowing of the market place.” The economic growth rate in India is expected to slow down to 5% in 2019-20 from 6.1% in 2018-19 and 7% in 2017-18, according to the Economic Survey in January.

“Whilst cities in India, on average, exceed the World Health Organisation target for annual PM2.5 exposure by 500%, national air pollution decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019, with 98% of cities experiencing improvements,” the report said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/t7iqed/article30919131.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ghaziabadjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ghaziabad-most-polluted-city-in-the-world-report/article30917518.ece

In the midst of the ongoing violence in the Capital, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has ordered repatriation of Sachidanand Srivastava, a 1985-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to the Central AGMUT cadre here on Tuesday.

Mr. Srivastava, who was posted as Special Director General (Training) in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) prior to his repatriation from central deputation, was, in a subsequent order from the Delhi Home Department, appointed Special Commissioner of Police (law and order) in the Delhi Police.

Sources in the MHA claimed that Mr. Srivastava, who held various posts in the Delhi Police, including traffic and the elite special cell, was pipped to replace outgoing Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik whose month-long extension in view of the Delhi Assembly elections will end on February 29.

“Mr. Srivastava, currently appointed as special Commissioner of Police [CP] law and order, would be CP on February 29. He is the same batch as the outgoing Commissioner and is the senior most IPS officer on a three-member panel,” the MHA source claimed.

“He has already taken charge of his new role which will put him in a better position to take charge as the Commissioner given the current law and order situation in the city,” said a police source.

274,2020/02/26,National Population Register-Aadhaar seeding began in 2015,"The exercise continued till late 2017

The Telangana government embarked on a massive Aadhaar - National Population Register (NPR) updation exercise and seeding exercise across the State as early as 2015 and funds were released for this work till as late as September 2017.

Seeding in this context implies linking of Aadhaar numbers with NPR data.

“NPR updating and its seeding with Aadhaar in the NPR database was done on the basis of a notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs. As a part of the process, names were rectified and number of persons living in homes were corrected, and Aadhaar numbers added,” a source requesting anonymity said.

Enumeration was done for all erstwhile composite districts under the previous NPR format, which did not contain the now controversial questions such as those related to date and place of birth of the respondent’s parents.

A perusal of documents shows that the Telangana government issued budget release orders to the tune of approximately ₹8 crore in 2015. In 2016, the government sanctioned and released over ₹ 4.61 crore for updating NPR and seeding it with the Aadhaar. Another ₹ 6 crore only for data entry work pertaining to NPR updating in 2017. The funds were released for the erstwhile composite districts in the State with Mahbubnagar receiving the largest allocation.

Touching upon the issue of consent on linking Aadhaar with the NPR database, another official aware of the exercise, on the condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that Aadhaar numbers were taken from only those who were issued cards and were willing to share information voluntarily.

“When NPR was being updated, we sought Aadhaar numbers and added them only if they wished to share them with us,” the source said, adding that the seeding was done only for access to welfare schemes.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bnl1rp/article30926065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27NPR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/national-population-register-aadhaar-seeding-began-in-2015/article30925888.ece
275,2020/02/26,HC takes up PIL on unauthorised temple,"Appoints advocate commission to submit a report

Taking a serious note of authorities becoming mute spectators to emergence of structures in the name of freedom of religion on government lands, Telangana High Court on Wednesday said the State government cannot keep quiet on such matters.

Hearing a PIL plea challenging construction of a temple in Rock Gardens of Madhavapuri Hills of Ameenpur on city outskirts, the HC ordered for an advocate commission to conduct field visit and submit a report to the court. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy directed the temple committee to pay ₹50,000 to the advocate commission member Praveen Reddy.

Details like when was the temple constructed, how much money was spent for it, if it was erected in the space meant for park, the temple plan and other documents should be presented to the advocate commission for perusal, the bench said. Directing the commission to furnish report by March 13, the bench posted the matter to March 16 for next hearing.

Counter affidavit

Expressing dissatisfaction over the government’s counter affidavit in the petition, the bench said it did not contain the report submitted by Sangareddy District Collector. The affidavit also had no information about the report presented by Ameenpur Tahsildar to the Collector. The authorities washed off their hands by serving notices to the temple committee, the bench observed.

The authorities failed to furnish information on the status of the case filed by temple committee in Sangareddy court. The bench remarked that it was surprising that officials served notices to temple committee in 2017 and 2020 while the temple was built in 2014.

“If the government did not respect and enforce the law, who would do it? Is the government unable to protect its own land?”, the bench said. By taking firm steps in Ameenpur temple matter, the government should send signals about its policy to entire State on erection of religious structures in government lands, the bench said.

The government counsel responded stating that the counter affidavit would be withdrawn and a fresh one would be filed with complete details. He apologised to the bench for failing to incorporate all information about the case in the affidavit. Municipal Administration and Urban Development Principal Chief Secretary Arvind Kumar, appearing before the bench, said that government had decided to conduct a comprehensive survey on religious structures erected illegally. The bench sought to know how many such illegally constructed religious structures were pulled down since the government came out with an order on the matter 10 years ago. It remarked that government should take stringent action against construction of religious structures in government lands and prove that even god was not above the law.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-takes-up-pil-on-unauthorised-temple/article30925849.ece

“When the police did not give any orders to fire, how did so many people receive bullet injuries during the riots? This aspect has to be probed deeply,” he said.

278,2020/02/26,October deadline set for ongoing SRDP works,"Works inordinately delayed, partly for lack of funds and partly for land acquisition issues

GHMC officials have a humongous task ahead of them in order to finish the ongoing works pertaining to the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) within the coming eight months.

Orders for completion of all the ongoing works by October-end were issued by Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) K. T. Rama Rao during a review meeting held on Monday. The Minister directed the GHMC engineering officials for deployment of additional men and machinery for speedy completion of the works.

The works have been inordinately delayed on several stretches, partly owing to lack of funds and partly to issues encountered in land acquisition. With roads dug up in half, the works have been causing nightmarish ride to commuters.

Locations where SRDP components such as flyovers, elevated corridors and underpasses are in progress include LB Nagar, Bairamalguda, Nagole, Gachibowli, Bahadurpura, Owaisi Hospital, Jubilee Hills, Durgam Cheruvu, Balanagar, Amberpet, Shaikpet, Kondapur and Kothaguda.

With GHMC elections round the corner, the government is giving special attention to these projects, keeping in view the electoral dividend they can gain with their completion, as well as to avoid wrath of the commuters on these stretches.

GHMC’s present governing council was constituted in February, 2016, and speculation is rife that the corporation could go for early elections this year.

The works, however, will have to overcome several hurdles before they are completed. Even where land acquisition is completed, mere construction needs continuous work of six months, officials say.

For the work to progress without a hitch, the respective locations need to be shut down for traffic, which could be next to impossible on some stretches with no alternative routes. GHMC has been constantly at daggers drawn with traffic police over the issue, and there have been instances where its staff were taken into custody to prevent the work.

Utility shifting poses another challenge. Water and sewerage pipes, and electricity poles need to be shifted immediately after property acquisition for the works to go non-stop. Often, the shifting takes tediously long time, owing to bureaucratic processes involved in it.

During Monday’s meeting, the Minister promised to redress the situation on the traffic side, while Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar was said to have taken it upon himself to ensure speedy shifting of utilities.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/october-deadline-set-for-ongoing-srdp-works/article30925253.ece

280,2020/02/26,New CC roads for city peripheries,"GHMC Commissioner holds review with officials

Several colonies in the city peripheries are set to get a facelift soon, with the GHMC deciding to lay internal CC roads in place of gravel paths in many locations.

GHMC Commissioner D. S. Lokesh Kumar has, through a press statement, announced that CC roads had been sanctioned wherever gravel roads existed, provided the locations already had underground drainage and drinking water supply lines.

A quick survey has revealed 580 such stretches across the six zones which have not been laid so far, which extend to over 291 kilometres of cumulative length.

L. B. Nagar Zone has the maximum number of such stretches at 299, while Serilingampally has the maximum length of 106 kilometres. Khairatabad, on the other hand, has merely one stretch with 0.13-kilometre length. The total amount sanctioned for the project stands close to ₹171 crore.

The condition of drainage and drinking water has been incorporated so that the CC roads are not dug up in near future for laying pipelines, officials said.

During a review meeting with zonal and additional commissioners on Wednesday, Mr. Lokesh Kumar issued various directions pertaining to the ongoing surveys respectively on illiteracy and beggar rehabilitation, Basthi Dawakhanas, modern toilets, protection and beautification of lakes, sanitation and de-silting of nalas.

He asked the officials to observe both sides of the roads while travelling rather than be immersed in mobile phones. Such attentiveness about surroundings will help them observe the ongoing development activities, besides condition of sanitation, lighting, water leakage, and potholes on the roads, so that they can take corrective action soon, Mr.Lokesh Kumar said.

Beggars should be identified from important junctions, religious places and on roads in the coming four to five days, and arrangements should be made to shift them to night shelters, he said.

He directed the officials to have meetings with circle level committees, and ensure food, newspapers and television at night shelters.

The task of beggar rehabilitation will be given to agencies based on their previous performance in running similar homes for the aged and orphans. Entitlements such as Aadhaar card and ration card will be provided to beggars besides inclusion in relevant welfare schemes.

On the sanitation front, the Commissioner asked the officials to ensure two bins for garbage segregation in front of shops and establishments and commercial complexes.

Of the 300 Basthi Dawakhanas aimed to be established, 122 are already functioning and 40 are ready to be launched. In 54 centres, facilities are yet to be provided, while in relation to 83, locations have been identified and works are yet to be taken up.

With regard to modern toilets, 500 in each zone, a total of 1661 locations were identified so far, Mr. Lokesh Kumar said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cc-roadsfor-hyderabad-peripheries/article30925138.ece
281,2020/02/26,Toyota drives in self-charging hybrid electric Vellfire sporting a ₹ 79.5 lakh price tag,"First three shipments of 180 units of the luxury multi-purpose vehicle already sold out

Japanese automotive major Toyota, which in India operates through a joint venture with Kirloskar, has unveiled the Vellfire - a self-charging,hybrid electric, luxury multi-purpose vehicle - priced at Rs.79.5 lakh ex-showroom.

A product well received globally - selling six lakh units in other markets - the Vellfire seems to have struck a chord with customers in India too with Senior Vice President of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) Naveen Soni saying the first three shipments had already been sold out.

From Japan, as a CBU

Stating that each shipment consists of 60 units, he said 20 per cent of the 180 bookings were from Hyderabad, something that made the company roll out the luxury offering nationally from the City of Pearls on Wednesday. The Vellfire is imported from Japan, as a CBU (completely built unit), and three shipments are going to arrive, one each a month, till April.

Mr.Soni, however, refused to specify the sale targets the company is pursuing for Vellfire.

Describing India as a market with big potential for such luxury vehicles, TKM Managing Director Masakazu Yoshimura said no allocation has been made by the Japanese parent for the Indian market. It would actually depend on the market in the country, he added.

Destination sustainable mobility

“Globally, we have a caravan of luxury offerings and the launch of Vellfire in India marks a significant moment in our journey. The launch is a significant step in our mid-to-long-term plan to achieve zero CO2 challenge. We will continue to work for mass electrification thus moving towards the goal of sustainable mobility,” he said, adding, without sharing specifics, that more offerings have been lined up.

Targetted at the ultra rich, the vehicle boasts of luxurious and spacious interiors and delivers a powerful driving experience while ensuring low fuel consumption and carbon footprints. The 2.5-litre 4-cylinder gasoline hybrid engine offers 86 kW (115 BHP) power and a max torque of 198 Nm @2800-4000 rpm. It is rated for a fuel efficiency of 16.35 km/litre.

Zero emission mode at 40:60

The Vellfire engine which is also coupled with two electric motors, and a hybrid battery ensures low emissions. The company said studies have shown that strong hybrid vehicles like Vellfire are capable of running 40 per cent of distance and 60 per cent of time on electric or zero emission mode with the engine off. A release said the price will be same across the country at ex-showroom level, except in Kerala.

Besides the features that define its spaciousness inside, the Vellfire has a three-zone AC, 16-colour ambient roof illumination, twin sunroof, one-touch power slide side doors, seven airbags, Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM), which is a proactive safety feature for providing stability to the vehicle based on vehicle performance control technology and panoramic view monitor.

TKM Vice Chairman Vikram Kirloskar said customers in India were eagerly looking forward to the Vellfire rollout for sometime now.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/toyota-drives-in-vellfire/article30922444.ece

The Hyderabad police have registered cases against poet Imran Pratapgarhi and two organisers of a poetry programme for violating conditions pertaining to the conduct of an event.

The programme (Ehtaji Mushaira) was held as a mark of protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at QQ Stadium, Charminar, late on Monday.

During the protest, Mr Pratapgarhi said “Mujhe hairath hey ki us Hyderabad mein koi Shaheenbagh kyu nahi hai” (I am shocked that there is no Shaheen Bagh in Hyderabad).

It was stated in the FIR that the statement was made in ‘provocative manner’. However, the Charminar police said that the cases may or may not be extended against Mr Pratapgarhi after investigation.

Hyderabad’s Additional Commissioner of Police granted permission to conduct the poetry programme on the conditions that the meeting should be conducted between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. and provocative speeches or slogans which can hurt feelings of public or any sections should not be made.

Nearly 3,000 people attended the Mushaira, which started at 6.30 p.m. However, the programme went on till 9.48 p.m. The police said that though they had asked the organisers to conclude the programme at 9 p.m., they — Syed Sleem and Khaja Bilal — did not do so.

With the fortnight-long Sri Rama Navami Brahmotsavams scheduled to begin at the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam on March 25, the district administration has set in motion an exercise to chalk out arrangements for the mega religious carnival.

Arrangements for the ensuing annual fete were discussed elaborately at a review meeting chaired by Collector M.V. Reddy in Bhadrachalam on Tuesday.

The meeting decided that special committees be constituted to oversee the segment-wise arrangements under the supervision of a nodal officer to cater to the needs of devotees and make the fete a success.

It was also decided in the meeting that the Mithila Stadium be categorised into 35 sectors to enable devotees to watch Sitarama Kalyana Mahotsavam in a hassle-free manner on the occasion of Sri Rama Navami slated for April 2.

Addressing the meeting, the Collector directed the officials to install CCTV cameras and LED screens in each sector at the venue of the celestial wedding. He said control rooms will be set up one at Tanisha Kalyana Mandapam and another at the TTD Centre to monitor the smooth conduct of Brahmotsavams.

Focus on sanitation

Stressing the need for proper sanitation, he exhorted all the departments to work in tandem to provide all the necessary amenities including adequate drinking water to the devotees and create a perfect ambience to make the fete a pleasant experience for pilgrims.

He wanted the officials to take safety precautions at the bathing ghats along the Godavari and erect tents to provide shade to devotees along the karakatta to prevent incidents of heat exhaustion.

Mr Reddy suggested that a documentary film be made highlighting the rich heritage of the historic Bhadradri temple and cultural programmes be organised on all days during the fortnight-long fete.

According to sources, the meeting deliberated in detail on arrangements for sale of tickets for Tiru Kalyana Mahotsavam and Maha Pattabishekam events, accommodation, first-aid and vehicle parking facilities besides bandobust for visit of VVIPs to the shrine during the fete.

290,2020/02/26,Municipality ordered to stop installation of incinerator,"Action following inspection of waste dumping yard at North Kalamassery

The Kerala State Pollution Control Board has issued a notice to the Kalamassery municipality to immediately stop the installation of an incinerator at the civic body’s waste dumping yard at North Kalamassery for violation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

The board’s report has been submitted to the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management constituted by the National Green Tribunal for follow-up action. A show-cause notice will be issued to the Secretary of the municipality for carrying out alteration works without prior sanction from the board. The report was filed after carrying out an inspection at the yard as per the directive of the committee on February 18. The visit was done to assess the damage caused owing to a fire breakout at the site on February 17.

“It was seen that an incinerator was being installed at the dumping yard. A single chambered incinerator connected to a water scrubbing system was seen there and a 30-metre high chimney has been erected for allowing emissions from this [incinerator]. However, the chimney has not been connected to the scrubbing system till now and seems to be not used till date. The chimney is provided with a ladder, port hole and platform,” according to the report.

The board officials informed the SLMC that no responsible official of the civic body was present at the site and workers told them that the incinerator (supplied by a private firm in Panayikkulam near North Paravur) was meant for burning the paper waste brought to the yard.

“Though specific directions were given to officials for keeping logbook for plastic collection and transfer, no such logbooks were seen there for spot verification of the quantum of waste flow. It may be noted that no prior sanction was obtained from the board for the installation of the incinerator. Also, the dumping yard is mainly for the purpose of plastic waste and there is no proper storage facility for other dry waste such as paper,” the report pointed out.

The arrangements provided at the site for the proper segregation of waste were not effective and no guarantee could be offered for the usage of plastic materials in the incinerator. There was a minor fire at the yard on February 17 and a small amount of plastic was burnt. In such a condition, it cannot be ensured by the municipality that this incinerator will be used only for burning dry paper waste. Further, single-chambered incinerators cannot be granted permission by the board as it’s insisting double-chambered incinerators so as to meet the standards specified in Schedule II (b) of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/i76po6/article30924846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27kikalamassery,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/municipality-ordered-to-stop-installation-of-incinerator/article30924847.ece
291,2020/02/26,Two more plastic shredding machines at Brahmapuram soon,"This would help shred four tonnes of plastic daily at yard which has nearly 1-lakh tonne plastic waste

The Kochi Corporation is likely to get two additional plastic shredding machines soon to deal with mounting plastic waste at the Brahmapuram dumping yard, after the existing unit fell into disuse around six months ago.

An order was placed for two plastic shredding and baling units from Clean Kerala Company Limited at a cost of around ₹8 lakh per unit, and a tender would be invited to operate it, corporation officials said. While the order, which was placed a few months ago, had faced a few procedural hurdles, the process was expedited recently, they said. “Though the decision to purchase two machines had been taken a while ago, the paper work is still ongoing,” said Minimol V.K., member of the Health Standing Committee.

The existing unit, which could handle around a tonne of plastic waste daily, was not in use since it had been launched on a pilot basis, and a formal agreement had not been drawn up with the contractor handling it. In the absence of an agreement, the contractor had ceased operations, officials said. A second unit was also present at the site, but has not been functioning for years.

With the installation of the two new units, the facility at Brahmapuram would be able to shred around four tonnes of plastic daily. Another contractor was recovering a tonne of plastic waste daily from the pile of non-biodegradables at the site and supplying it to recyclers, paying a small amount to the corporation.

Around 85 tonnes of shredded plastic from the existing unit had been sold to Clean Kerala Company Limited after the unit was set up in 2016. The sale had fetched the Corporation around ₹9 lakh, officials said. The company has been supplying it to local bodies Statewide for polymerised roads. Officials at the Clean Kerala Company said that they had not purchased plastic pellets from the Kochi Corporation for over a year.

Not a solution

Shredding was an inadequate solution to the nearly 90 to 100 tonnes of plastic being dumped at the site daily, the officials said. The corporation itself had not been using plastic pellets to tar its roads, they said. The total volume of plastic waste lying at the site would be a little short of 1 lakh tonnes.

A shredding unit that can handle around 400 kg of plastic daily was set up at Ravipuram in 2009 by the corporation, and has been operated since then by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) under its Clean City Movement.

“The unit receives plastic waste from nearly 400 apartment complexes in the city and collects around 60 tonnes per month. But we have been struggling to find buyers even among local bodies. The Clean Kerala Company refused to purchase it since we function as an NGO and their tie-ups are mostly with local bodies,” said Joby Jacob, chief operations manager, Clean City Movement.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/two-more-plastic-shredding-machines-at-brahmapuram-soon/article30924829.ece

O.V. Salim, vice chairman of the municipality, said that a system had been arranged to collect plastic waste from wards once a month and other inorganic refuse and e-waste once in three months. Most residents were cooperating with the municipality for the project, Mr. Salim said.

With the government implementing plastic ban, the municipality could not utilise its own fund for plastic waste management, said Mr. Salim. So it was decided to charge ₹100 from each household to keep the project going.

The State Pollution Control Board has proposed reassessment of the environment compensation slapped on the Kochi Corporation for its failure to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, at its Brahmapuram facility.

Interestingly, the move to carry out a reassessment of the quantum of environment compensation has come at a time when the headquarters of the board in Thiruvananthapuram is sitting on the assessment of ₹10.05-crore environment compensation on the civic body made by its regional office in Ernakulam in last October.

The proposal to carry out a reassessment of the environment compensation has found place in a report filed by the board before the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management after a major fire breakout at Brahmapuram on February 18. The assessment report filed by the regional office of the board on October 18 had mentioned that the period [of assessment] was from April 9, 2019 to October-end.

In its findings, the board had blamed the civic body for its failure to make improvements or take sufficient rectification measures at Brahmapuram for the past nine years. The dump site of the corporation had been functioning without the authorisation of the board as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, it said.

The Environment Compensation of ₹10.05 crore had included capital cost, operation and maintenance cost and environment externalities by considering the average waste generation as 365.19 tonnes a day (April 9, 2019 to October-end based on the quantity of waste collected for May, June, and July). It was fixed presuming that the corporation had provided waste management facility for only 10% of the total waste generation (considering that it is transferring a portion of plastic waste to recyclers) as per the formula derived by the Central Pollution Control Board and as directed by the National Green Tribunal at its hearing held on October 14.

Repeated efforts to contact S. Sreekala, Member Secretary of both the board and the SLMC respectively, on why the board had not yet acted on the ₹10.05-crore environment compensation assessment made in October, proved futile.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/porync/article30924763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27kibrahmapuram01jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-moots-reassessment-of-environment-compensation-on-corpn/article30924764.ece

“Bring your own containers to the shop and join the fight against plastic,” he says about the concept shop that he runs in Kolencherry town. He was in Kakkanad on Wednesday to interact with a group of people who wanted to know more about reducing plastic use. The programme was organised by the Thrikkakara municipality as part of its zero-waste drive.

He says that buying daily supply of grains, cereals and other products, including dish washers and toilet cleaners, in containers cuts down plastic use drastically. According to him, about 90% of the plastic waste that end up in public spaces or at collection centres come from these sources.

Mr. John says that bringing one’s own containers to buy products also save money for the shopper. He cites the example of a brand of flour where the buyer can save up to ₹30 a kg if the shopper used containers brought from home instead of relying on the packaged product.

He claims that the response to the concept is enthusiastic.

296,2020/02/26,Zero-waste drive gets under way in Thrikkakara,"Bio-composting and gas-from-waste units distributed to beneficiaries

Thrikkakara has rolled out an ambitious programme to convert itself into a zero-waste municipality through a slew of programmes that include encouraging people to set up composting and gas-from-waste units in their own homesteads so that dependence on a public, centralised facility can be reduced to the minimum.

The municipal authorities inaugurated the distribution of heavily-subsidised potting, bio-composting and gas-from-waste units on Wednesday, said Health Standing Committee chairman M. M. Nazar here.

He said that the municipality would spend ₹2.9 crore on 2,000 biopots, 1,500 ring composting units and 500 biogas units. A biopot will cost ₹1,800 apiece. The beneficiary will pay up 10% of the cost and the rest of the amount will be paid by the municipality. Similarly, biogas and ring composting units, costing ₹15,000 and ₹2,800 each respectively, would be supplied free of cost to chosen beneficiaries, said Mr. Nazar.

According to a senior official of the municipal administration, about 10 to 12 tonnes of food and other degradable waste are generated daily within the municipal limits. Added to this is plastic waste that is collected on a weekly basis and sent out for processing with the help of the State Sanitation Mission. It is expected that setting up small units that can handle biodegradable waste will help reduce the burden on the municipality for centrally handling waste.

Chairperson Usha Praveen said at the inauguration of the zero-waste drive that the municipality would adopt a policy to get rid of plastic, especially one-time use materials to contain environmental damage. An exhibition of replacement materials for plastic was also part of the programmes on Wednesday.

Pay and park

Meanwhile, the municipality has come out with a scheme to convert public spaces, that have been evicted of street vendors and taken possession of, into parking spaces for motor vehicles.

The new pay-and-park facilities will come up in places such as Vazhakkala, NGO Quarters at Kakkanad, near the Cochin Special Economic Zone and the district collectorate, said Mr. Nazar.

297,2020/02/26,CBSE blames Arooja’s school management,"It did not have affiliation and permission to register Class 10 students, board tells High Court

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Tuesday informed the Kerala High Court that it was highly improper on the part of the management of Arooja’s Little Stars School, Moolamkuzhi, to have allowed 29 students to continue their education in spite of not granting it affiliation by the board.

In a statement filed before the court, the CBSE said no school was permitted to register students of Class IX or no admission could be made to Class IX without obtaining recognition from the State government and affiliation to the CBSE. In May 2012, the CBSE had issued a letter to the management intimating about the deficiencies and informed it that the application for affiliation had been rejected.

The school management had initially tried to register their students through the SDPY school.

Later the SDPY school had informed the CBSE that the students of the Arooja’s school were not studying in their school.

Deficiencies

The CBSE pointed out that the school management did not rectify the deficiencies pointed out by the board. The CBI had asked the management to establish a composite science lab and math lab. Besides, the classrooms, computer science lab and library were undersized. The board also pointed out that the school was required to procure a minimum of 1,500 books.

The statement was filed in response to a writ petition moved by Maggie Arooja, manager, Arooja's Educational and Charitable Trust, Moolamkuzhi, and Sindhu Mohan, Principal of the school. When the petition was taken up for hearing, the court wondered why 29 students of Class 10 had not yet sought to implead in the petition.

The school management said in the petition that despite earnest efforts and filing necessary application, the CBSE had refused affiliation for the school. The school management was discriminated against.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cbse-blames-aroojas-school-management/article30919259.ece
298,2020/02/26,When vehicles just vanish from records,"No monitoring to ensure that inter-State transfer of ownership is effected

During a routine vehicle checking earlier this week, Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) officials waved down a motorcycle along the Aluva-Munnar route. The two riding on the vehicle, however, dumped the motorcycle way ahead of the officials and fled. Officials and local residents tried to track them down in vain.

On further probe, it emerged that the Aluva Sub-Regional Transport Office had issued No Objection Certificate (NOC) for transfer of ownership of the vehicle to Murshidabad in West Bengal in January 2016, proving that it was being illegally used here for more than four years. Transfer of ownership is expected to be effected within six months of the issue of NOC.

Untraced

“Such a practice poses a law and order threat as these vehicles will be literally off the records. If such vehicles are involved in an accident or used for a criminal act there will be no way to trace them.

And if they are abandoned, tracking down the owner will not be possible,” said MVD officials.

Authorities believe that many such vehicles might be in use in the migrant worker-intense regions of the district. It is also believed that vehicles issued NOC in other States for registration in Kerala could also be operated here without effecting the transfer of ownership. Transfer of ownership of a vehicle within the State does not pose such a problem as it happens simultaneously along with the issue of NOC over the pan-India Pari Vahan software of the Transport Department.

Stipulation

However, in the case of inter-State transfer of ownership, the Regional Transport Office from where the vehicle is being transferred issues NOC and the buyer will have to get it registered with the Regional Transport Office of the State to which it is transferred, which will then duly assign a new registration number.

“The fact remains that there is no mechanism to check whether the transfer of ownership is effected once the NOC is issued. Since the non-transport private vehicles need not approach the MVD either for fitness or re-registration for a period of 15 years, vehicles could be operated without effecting the transfer for years together with the only possible detection being any chance encounter with the enforcement officials,” said MVD officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-vehicles-just-vanish-from-records/article30919217.ece
299,2020/02/26,Kolkata’s anti-CAA protesters turn ‘extra-cautious’ after Delhi violence,"Women at the ongoing Park Circus Maidan sit-in are ensuring calm prevails.

Anti-CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act) protesters in Kolkata, whose ongoing sit-in at the Park Circus Maidan is now more than 50 days old, on Wednesday said they were taking extra precautions after the violence in Delhi to make sure no one made speeches that were remotely inflammatory.

‘Shameful’

“What has happened in Delhi is shameful — they are simply killing humanity. But I am not scared. If I was scared, I wouldn’t have started this protest in the first place. Our protest is not political or against any community, but against a law that divides people on communal lines,” Asmat Jamil, the housewife who initiated began the protest on January 7 along with other Muslim women in the neighbourhood, told The Hindu.

Also Read Supreme Court must ensure our safety: Shaheen Bagh protesters

“We are making sure no one here makes a speech that is even remotely provocative. We were already cautious about it, we are now being extra cautious. What helps is that this is Bengal and not Delhi, where the police is openly biased. Here, even the West Bengal government is against CAA,” Ms. Jamil said.

The protesters in Kolkata are eager to drive home that a parallel should not be drawn between Park Circus Maidan and Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, where the ongoing protest had caused obstacles to movement of traffic.

Normalcy unaffected

“That is Delhi and this is Bengal, you cannot compare the two. Here, we are making sure that the traffic and normal life is not affected by our protest. We even changed the positions of the loudspeakers so that children studying for their exams are not disturbed,” said Debu Shaw, one of the volunteers at Park Circus Maidan.

“Every participant is now a volunteer, whose job is to watch out for potential mischief-makers and to caution speakers against provocative speeches. We are also keeping an eye on new faces walking into the venue,” said Mr. Shaw, a hardware engineer who has not been taking up assignments for the past one month because he is at the venue most of the time.

‘Gandhi’s India’

Said Ms. Jamil: “We want to keep this protest peaceful. We simply cannot afford anything going wrong or else the whole purpose will be defeated. The fight is to turn India into Mahatma Gandhi’s India, to rid society of hatred. We are not going to stop until we have achieved this.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/7fxlxy/article30923592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26IN-CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/kolkatas-anti-caa-protesters-turn-extra-cautious-after-delhi-violence/article30923435.ece
300,2020/02/26,Senior citizen seeks reward for providing information on fraud,"‘Respondents covering up corruption by shoddy probe’

A septuagenarian resident of Manesar village here has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking reward for giving information about alleged leakage of government revenue and the loss of public funds, and demanding action against the erring officials.

The Haryana government has sought time to ascertain the status of enquiry, if any, in the matter.

Ram Avtar Yadav, 73, in his petition before the court of Judge Sanjay Kumar, said that he, duty-bound by Article 51A of the Constitution, had provided written information about panchayat funds being siphoned off allegedly by corrupt officials, defeating the purpose of development of village through grassroot democracy.

No case registered

He added the government had directed the State Vigilance Bureau to conduct investigation into the complaints of the petitioner and the Flying Squad of the Chief Minister had also initiated an investigation, but no case was registered after more than a year. Mr. Yadav, through his advocate Pardeep Kumar Rapria, said the respondents — the Haryana government, the State Vigilance Bureau and the Development and Panchayats Department — appeared to be covering up the rampant corruption by “inaction and shoddy investigation”.

Additional Advocate General Rajesh Gaur has sought time to ascertain the status of enquiry, if any, that has been initiated upon the petitioner’s representation.

301,2020/02/26,Vets for mapping poultry farms to tackle antimicrobial resistance,"‘Spreading awareness among the large breeders within the industry could be a start’

Veterinarians on Tuesday called upon the Madhya Pradesh government to map and register poultry farms, in effect draw up regulations to track and better guide the industry, in a bid to combat drug resistance in humans caused by excessive use of antibiotics in poultry.

At a workshop for the doctors here, Robin J. Paul, nodal officer, Kerala State Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, highlighted Kerala’s regulatory framework wherein all poultry farms were geotagged, enabling better regulation. “This can be the first step towards tackling antimicrobial resistance. Mapping can help track transportation, use of antibiotics and breeding conditions of the poultry overtime,” he said.

Use of growth promoters

Last year, Madhya Pradesh had followed Kerala’s lead in chalking out the plan to deal with the resistance, a natural phenomenon accelerated by usage of growth promoters in poultry, use of chemicals, including antifungal chemicals, in agriculture, and unhygienic conditions in hospitals causing infections. This results in prolonged illness, extended therapy duration and a higher mortality rate and cost of treatment. Since 1987, no new antibiotic has been discovered, and developing resistance to the existing ones can prove fatal.

Before mapping farms, spreading awareness within the industry could be a start, said D.P. Ahuja, Principal Secretary, Madhya Pradesh Veterinary Department. “Mapping farms straightaway might spook away breeders. First, awareness is necessary among them, that too among the larger breeders so that the message percolates to others. We need to create a win-win situation wherein incomes are increased and resistance is tackled,” he said.

Emerging issue

At the workshop, veterinarians stressed the need to spread awareness about biosecurity practices, among farmers especially. Pankaj Shukla, Joint Director, National Urban Health Mission, Madhya Pradesh, had earlier told The Hindu antifungal resistance, found in agricultural fields, was an emerging issue in the State.

The health community must not preach the use of antibiotics, but exercise restraint, said Pallavi Jain Govil, Principal Secretary, Madhya Pradesh Health department. “Consuming antibiotics creates a false sense of security that a disease won’t spread to others then. We need to encourage healthy habits,” she said.

Stating that collaboration with different government departments was the biggest challenge, she added, “The West is no more discovering newer antibiotics as they have addressed these problems to a large extent.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/vets-for-mapping-poultry-farms-to-tackle-antimicrobial-resistance/article30917662.ece
302,2020/02/26,Cut in NHM funds to hit primary healthcare services in Rajasthan,"Right to Health Act not mentioned in budget speech: experts

The ambitious goal of “Nirogi Rajasthan” set by the Congress government is unlikely to be met this year with the State budget for 2020-21, presented last week, making a negligible increase of 6.8% in the allocation for medical, health and family welfare. The massive cut of ₹502.42 crore in the funds for the National Health Mission is also likely to hit primary healthcare services.

Health activists attached to the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, which functions as the State chapter of the People’s Health Movement, here on Tuesday expressed concern over budgetary treatment of the health sector. The activists described the allocation of ₹14,533.37 crore to the health sector as inadequate and wondered why the Right to Health Act had found no mention in the budget speech.

Poll promise

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who also holds the Finance portfolio, had earlier announced that the Right to Health Bill would be shortly introduced in the Assembly to guarantee common people’s access to high-quality healthcare services. This was also one of the significant promises made in the election manifesto of the Congress.

Chhaya Pachauli, director of voluntary group Prayas, said the reduction in NHM budget from ₹2,002.85 crore last year to ₹1,500.43 crore, as well as in the National Rural and Urban Health Missions’ funds, would impact a wide range of healthcare services. Some of the crucial health programmes, such as immunisation, adolescent health, community-based interventions and allocation of human resource for healthcare, were linked with these missions.

Moreover, the budget for sub-health centres has been reduced from ₹133.95 crore last year to ₹105.90 crore and that for the primary health centres from ₹335.98 crore last year to ₹309.84 crore.

Intervention needed

“This slash signifies a clear undermining of primary healthcare services which are already in dire shape and are in need of urgent interventions for a thorough revamping,” Ms. Pachauli said.

Though Mr. Gehlot laid a lot of emphasis on the “Nirogi Rajasthan” campaign in his budget speech, it would fail to yield any productive results in the absence of an effective primary healthcare system, Ms. Pachauli said. On the other hand, the State health insurance scheme under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana has got a substantial increase in allocation from ₹631 crore last year to ₹1,241.51 crore.

The flagship free medicine and free diagnostic tests schemes, initiated by Mr. Gehlot during his previous tenure, have witnessed a negligible increase this year.

According to the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, this indicates a “fast-growing inclination” of the State towards implementation of health insurance scheme rather than promoting universally accessible free healthcare programmes.

‘Lessons not learnt’

Ms. Pachauli said the State government had not learnt any lessons from the recent incident of children’s deaths in Kota and was not serious about improving the public healthcare system, which was low on service delivery, poor on quality standards and far from the reach of those who most needed it.

“This would mean that little change is expected in the year to come and a large number of people will still have to depend on private sector and unqualified practitioners,” she added.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/1z1i7e/article30917659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26GEHLOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/cut-in-nhm-funds-to-hit-primary-healthcare-services-in-rajasthan/article30917660.ece
303,2020/02/26,U.P. govt. changes State university name ‘partially’,"Amendment to be brought in varsity Act

The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday said it has decided to change the name of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti Urdu-Arabi-Farsi University, a State University in Lucknow.

The university would now be called Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Bhasha Vishwavidyalaya (Language University), the government said in a statement.

The ‘partial’ name change came after Governor Anandiben Patel last year during the university convocation suggested that it drop the ‘Urdu-Arabi-Farsi’ bit from its name.

‘Global identity’

The government said the change in name would provide the university a “global identity” and fulfil the State’s need for a language university, while expanding the scope of employment for students studying various languages. An amendment would be brought in the U.P. State Universities Act, 1973, the government said.

The government said that apart from Urdu, Arabic and Persian, various other languages were taught at the university, including, Sanskrit, Hindi, Pali and Prakrit, and foreign languages like German, Japanese, French and English.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/fy6cci/article30917653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26GUV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/up-govt-changes-state-university-name-partially/article30917654.ece
304,2020/02/26,‘Kartarpur Corridor will remain open’,"Apprehensions stem from Pakistan’s bad intent, says CM Amarinder Singh

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said on Tuesday that the Kartarpur Corridor would remain open regardless of security concerns.

His remarks in the Assembly came amid the furore over Director-General of Police Dinkar Gupta’s statement on the threat from the Kartarpur Corridor.

‘Issue over’

Capt. Amarinder said the apprehensions about a threat were “serious”, but they did not stem from the corridor but from Pakistan’s “bad intent”. “We will not let the Kartarpur Corridor be closed,” he said. “The DGP has apologised; everybody makes mistakes; even I make mistakes... This issue is over now. Let us concentrate on peace and ensure that the difficult times that Punjab had gone through do not recur.”

Capt. Amarinder said his government was in possession of classified documents that he could not circulate in the Assembly. “After meddling in Kashmir for long, Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has only one task now: to disturb peace in Punjab,” he said. “Pakistan was blatantly trying to foment trouble in the State.”

Showing pictures of Chinese drones, the Chief Minister said these had been seized from a man swimming through the Ravi, but there might be others who had not been caught. “Who knows what their motive is,” he added. “What problem the ISI has with the Taliban, Iran or Balochistan, we don’t know. But what they have been doing in India is known to all. Earlier it was Kashmir, and now even Punjab is their target,” he said.

The Assembly passed a resolution seeking waiver of passport and a more simple process for visiting the Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan. It urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk Pakistan into cutting the $20 fee charged from Indian pilgrims.

Capt. Amarinder also rejected as baseless former DSP Balwinder Singh Sekhon’s charge against Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. “All cases referred to by Mr. Sekhon had been scrutinised through judicial processes, and no fresh evidence has been filed by the DSP,” he said.

Mr. Sekhon on Sunday had accused Mr. Ashu of masterminding a bomb blast at Gur Mandi in Ludhiana in 1992.

Members of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party raised slogans demanding action against Mr. Sekhon and Mr. Ashu. Then they staged a walkout.

Later, outside the Assembly, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia demanded immediate dismissal of Mr. Ashu. Leader of the Opposition Harpal Cheema of the Aam Aadmi Party demanded that criminal cases against Mr. Ashu be reopened.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/k21vw/article30917645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26NEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/kartarpur-corridor-will-remain-open/article30917646.ece

Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala on Tuesday said that stricter provisions have been incorporated in the new excise policy, and now anyone involved in liquor smuggling will not get bail before six months. Earlier the time period for the same was only 15 days.

Mr. Chautala was speaking during Zero Hour in the ongoing budget session of the Assembly.

He said to put an end to ‘Inspector Raj’, for the first time, online permits have been provided for serving alcohol during social celebrations. “The duration has been fixed from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning and the fee has been increased from ₹500 to ₹1,000,” he said.

The new policy includes a fine on distilleries involved in supply of illicit liquor. Mr. Chautala added that the timing for movement of trucks for liquor transportation has been fixed from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

During Question Hour, Health Minister Anil Vij said that to tackle the problem of shortage of doctors and ensure their availability in government hospitals, the government has decided to make MBBS students sign an affidavit, at the time of admission, committing to two years of practice in government hospitals once their study is completed. Mr. Vij added that the government has also initiated the process of regular recruitment of 447 medical officers through the Haryana Public Service Commission.

308,2020/02/26,Reaction to CAA to be expected: Amarinder,"Shiromani Akali Dal demands probe into Delhi violence

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre was attempting to trample India’s cherished democratic ideals of socialism and secularism through “this draconian legislation [CAA]”.

“Naturally, there had to be a reaction,” he said, adding that the people’s angst would not end but would “only grow bigger till the Central government realised its mistake and withdrew the legislation”.

“The BJP-led Central government had failed to factor in the possible reaction of the people to its plans to impose the Citizen Citizenship Act, as well as the NRC [National Register of Citizens] and the NPR [National Population Register], on the nation,” Capt. Amarinder said outside the Assembly here.

The Shiromani Akali Dal, an alliance partner in the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, has demanded “a thorough probe by the government into the incidents of violence in Delhi” over the CAA.

SAD chief and Lok Sabha MP Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday told The Hindu that violent incidents should be investigated. “Violence is not acceptable at all and the government should find out who was behind the violence. Is it a conspiracy? A probe should be undertaken to find out the cause behind the violence, and whether there is any force behind it or if it is a general normal conflict,” said Mr. Badal.

It seems that it is a mischievous attempt.”

309,2020/02/26,Vellayil post office neglected by authorities,"The 90-year-old building is in a dilapidated condition

At a time when the Department of Posts is trying to widen its services so as to stay useful in the era of online communications, the Sub Post Office at Vellayil here is the ultimate picture of neglect and lackadaisical approach of the authorities.

The post office, which offers almost all services of the department, is situated in a building that may crumble any moment. The old building is so dilapidated that termites have eaten up a large part of the wooden structure of the roof. The branches of a nearby tree have grown into the roof and unsettled the tiles. The walls have not been painted for at least a decade and the plastering is wearing off. The premises are covered in unwanted shrubs and small trees and badly needs a clean up. The well behind the building too is in unusable condition.

“This building is around 90 years old. It was closed down in 2003 and was reopened following public demand, in 2006. But since then, the authorities have turned a blind eye,” said Sudheer Sekhar Palakkandy, a resident of Vellayil, who has been fighting a lone battle to get the post office on track.

The dilapidated building is a threat to the lives of the two employees working in the office. They are making do by covering the roof with flex sheets and inserting metal rods where the wooden structures used to be. Even the visitors are under the threat.

The department had plans to build a parcel hub in the 30 cents plot behind the sub post office. However, the plan never materialised. “The parcel hub, if set up, will be quite profitable to the department, considering the number of government offices and institutions in its proximity,” Mr. Sudheer said.

At present, the post office is just a dispatch centre with no delivery service. The delivery to this area is from the Nadakkavu post office. The department has paid no heed to the requests from local people to start delivery service here.

Meanwhile, the local officials of the department seem to be clueless about the whereabouts of the sub post office or the parcel hub. An official at the office of the Director of Postal Services in Kozhikode said that the plans for the parcel hub was in cold storage.

On the other hand, neither the Director nor the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices were available for comments.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/7ks3nc/article30924497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26KI-POSTOFFICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/vellayil-post-office-neglected-by-authorities/article30924498.ece

311,2020/02/26,Protest brewing against quarry project,"The proposed mining site is only 100 m away from a vested forest under the South Wayanad Forest Division and less than 100 m off a government primary health centre and an Anganwadi.

Protest is brewing against a move to set up a granite quarry inside a private coffee plantation at Padivayal, near Kadachikunnu, in Muppainad grama panchayat in the district.

The owners of the estate had acquired the quarry licence by misleading the Kerala High Court with the support of some government officials, alleges N. Badusha, president of the Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti.

The area is a biodiversity hotspot in the Western Ghats and the zonalisation map of the District Disaster Management Authority identified the area as highly susceptible to landslip, he says.

The owners are yet to obtain permission from the State Revenue Land Board to convert the land for setting up a granite mining unit, says Samiti secretary Thomas Ambalavayal.

The plantation is adjacent to Puthumala where 18 people were killed in a landslip last year and Nellimala and Kanthanpara where three persons each lost their lives in landslips in 2009, he says.

Moreover, the proposed mining site is only 100 m away from a vested forest under the South Wayanad Forest Division and less than 100 m off a government primary health centre and an Anganwadi.

They allege that the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority had granted permit for the mining unit without consulting the District Environment Impact Assessment Authority.

Around 100 families, including tribespeople, live in the area and they fear that the quarry unit might upset their life. Many rivulets of the Chaliyar originate from the hill and hundreds of villagers in the area fear that their drinking water source will be destroyed once mining is started there, says A.

312,2020/02/26,State Youth Commission questions varsity norms,"‘Students should not be denied right to pursue more than one course’

The Kerala State Youth Commission has said that students should not be denied the right to pursue more than one graduate and postgraduate course.

Commission chairperson Chintha Jerome on Wednesday sought a report from the Registrar of the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit after Arathi Aneesh, a student, lodged a complaint against a law that barred students from doing so.

Ms. Jerome was speaking at a district-level adalat here. She observed that the university academic council’s condition that students should not pursue more than one degree or postgraduate course denied students’ rights. In what circumstances the academic council took such a decision and if other universities also had similar laws should be found out, she said.

The commission directed the Excise Commissioner to hold a seminar against substance abuse.

As many as 30 complaints, including the one on ragging incidents at Government Medical College, Kozhikode,vacancies at the Civil Supplies Department, and denial of jobs to those who registered with the Employment Exchange, were registered at the adalat.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/state-youth-commission-questions-varsity-norms/article30923244.ece

This assumes significance against the backdrop of the Kerala State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights directing the Director General of Education to submit a report on such educational institutions. This follows 29 students of a private school in Kochi not being allowed to appear for the board exams of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as their school did not have affiliation.

“We don’t have any list of such schools,” V.P. Mini, Deputy Director of Education, Kozhikode, told The Hindu on Tuesday. A couple of years ago, however, the department had planned to take action against such institutions in compliance with the Right to Education (RTE) Act that made it clear that schools offering elementary education (from Class 1 to Class 8) should be recognised by the State government or other agencies. There were reports that a list of close to 300 schools had been prepared then. There are 17 educational sub-districts in Kozhikode and there were close to 30 unrecognised schools in one of them alone.

314,2020/02/26,No toll collection at Vandiyur plaza: HC,"Court passes the order while hearing a batch of PIL pleas

MADURAI

Taking into account the fact that there is no dedicated lane for emergency services and exempted vehicles at Vandiyur toll plaza on the Ring Road here, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday restrained the State Highways Department and the concessionaire from collecting the toll there.

Hearing a batch of public interest litigation petitions, a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran restrained the State Highways Department and the concessionaire from collecting the toll at Vandiyur toll plaza, one of the three newly opened toll plazas on the road, from February 27. The court further ordered that the loss of revenue to be incurred this way should not be compensated through the other two toll plazas.

The court also took cognisance of the submission that effective steps were being taken to provide separate lanes for emergency vehicles and negotiations were under way to acquire land for widening of Vandiyur toll plaza. It adjourned the hearing till March 26.

The petitioners said that the toll plazas at Vandiyur, Chintamani and Valayankulam were located within a stretch of 27 km from Sivaganga Road-Ring Road junction to Kappalur and were close to one another. Commuters, school students and the general public were affected by this arrangement, they complained.

They pointed out that as per Rule 8 of the National Highways Fees Determination of Rates and Collection Rules, 2008, there should be a distance of 60 km between two toll plazas.

Also, the newly opened toll plazas did not have separate lanes for emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire tenders and other exempted vehicles, the petitioners said, and sought a direction to restrain the collection of toll at these plazas.

In addition to these three, toll plazas had already been set up on Thoothukudi highway at Eliyarpathi and on Dindigul-Kanniyakumari four-lane highway at Kappalur near Tirumangalam, which was under the control of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), they said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/no-toll-collection-at-vandiyur-plaza-hc-madurai/article30925150.ece

316,2020/02/26,In praise of Madurai Meenakshi,"Vocal concert, drama held on third day of music festival

The first programme of the third day’s events of Tamil Isai Vizha at Raja Muthiah Mandram witnessed a vocal concert by Madurai Pon Avanthraj, with the accompaniments of N.R.T. Jegadeesan on the violin, Pon. Abhiman Yuvaraj on the mrudangam and Surya Gopalakrishnan on the ghatam.

He began the concert with the invocation song, Ganapathiye karunanidhiye in Kharaharapriya by Papanasam Sivan. He then rendered M.M. Dandapani Desikar’s Enai nee maravade Angayarkanni in Amrutavarshinim on the presiding deity of Madurai, Meenakshi.

Gopalakrishna Bharati’s Shivakama Sundari in Jaganmogini was well sung with adequate delineation of the raga.

Innamum sandehappadalaamo by Gopalakrishna Bharati in Keeravani from Nandanar Charitram with the viruttam Kuvitha puruvamum was well sung and it was appreciated by the rasikas. His other pieces were Illai enbar yarada (Suddananda Bharathi) and Mogathil moozhgaathe (Achutha Dasan). Percussionists Jagadeesan and Yuvaraj provided unstinted support throughout the concert.

The main programme of the evening was a historical drama Kadaga Mutharayan, which was penned by Madurai Thirumaran and directed by S. Sivaprasad.

The story revolves around a valid question as to who should succeed when Parameswara Varman, a Pallava king (who ruled in south India in the latter half of the 7th century), died without leaving behind any legal heir.

There are two groups with opposing opinions. One headed by Udaya Chandran, an army captain, demands that Chitramayan should be made the king. The other group, led by Kadaga Mutharayan, opposes the move. The play goes on with the choice of a king and how the Pallava kingdom is saved by Kadaga Mutharayan.

Sivaprasad as Kadaga Mutharayan, Nadana Sabhapathy as Gunaseelan, Srinivasan as Thirumangai Azhwar, Sethu as Nandi Varman and Kannan as Udayachandran, excelled in their roles and created a nice impression on the audience. The play had the plot, characters, theme, language, music and spectacle, which form the backbone of a successful drama.

317,2020/02/26,Survey on water resources gets under way in district,"1,794 defunct borewells will be renovated: Collector

Fearing a harsh summer, the district administration has begun documenting the number of available water resources in all unions as part of a survey.

The survey, which began on Tuesday, will also chart out areas where water exploitation is the most. It will also list out a plan of action for areas where there could be acute shortage.

The unions are expected to be divided into safety, semi-critical and critical zones. Although such surveys have been completed in the past years, Madurai district is expected to sail through a potential drought, thanks to good groundwater recharge, officials say.

Assistant Director (Panchayat) A. Chelladurai says Madurai East, Madurai West and Melur have had plenty of water as they are part of the Vaigai and Periyar river beds and have received plentiful wetting when water was provided for agricultural lands. Vadipatti, too, is considered a safety zone.

The areas that are likely to be affected during the summer are Kottampatti and Kallikudi unions. Since 11 panchayats in Kottampatti union are heavily dependent on rainfall and do not have any access to water from Periyar and Vaigai dams, they may be adversely affected, he said.

Since Kallikudi area is heavily filled with clay soil, it will be difficult to draw water from this union. “The intake in each house is much higher than the supply,” he added.

Collector T. G. Vinay said that for the purpose of ensuring proper water supply to critical zones, they were renovating 1,794 defunct borewells and converting them into recharge structures. “Most borewells have become defunct only because the water has gone below aquifer level. Since the basic structure is already in place, we are finding means to ensure that water is supplied effectively to these borewells through dedicated channels.”

He added that they were also taking count of the number of water bodies that could receive treated sullage water via clean inlet channels.

“The sullage can be treated through bio filters. If the tank, pond, lake or channel is receiving sewage, we will need to stop leaks and create septic tanks. All this is being mapped on a district-level drainage map,” he said.

Despite a potential difficult summer, the Collector said the district would sail through as much water had been collected in water bodies, recharging groundwater.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/survey-on-water-resources-gets-under-way-in-district/article30924310.ece

The two swimmers - Adam A. G. Moss (UK) and Eddie Al-Ming Hu, began their expedition at 5 a.m. from Sri Lanka and crossed the Indian Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) at 12.05 p.m. Since the swimmers did not have permission to cross over the mainland in Dhanushkodi, they stopped one nautical mile from the shore and returned on their boats back to Sri Lanka at around 4.20 p.m.

The two swimmers were aided by a support team of 25 individuals from different countries. They involved photographers, guides and swimmers. A team of officials from the Indian Coast Guard, Mandapam Station, provided search and rescue covers to the two individuals when they entered the Indian border. Officials from the coast guard said that such expeditions are fairly common and a test of endurance.

322,2020/02/26,"Delay in implementation of projects irks DMK MPs, MLAs","They express dissatisfaction at monitoring committee meeting

TIRUNELVELI

The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MPs and the MLAs who participated in the District Vigilance and monitoring committee meeting held here on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction over the delay in executing development projects even after sufficient funds were allocated.

As the Vigilance and Monitoring Committee meeting reviewed the progress in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, rural livelihood programme, rural roads project, Swachch Bharat Mission, National Rural Health Mission etc being implemented in composite Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts, Tirunelveli MP S. Gnanathiraviam, Tenkasi MP Dhanush Kumar and DMK MLAs T.P.M. Mohideen Khan, Poongothai Aladi Aruna and A.L.S. Lakshmanan and Mohamed Abubucker of Indian Union Muslim League raised questions over the delay in implementing the projects for which Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, who was chairing the meeting, and other officials answered.

When the officials informed that the district received ₹ 18 crore under MNREGP in 2018 and ₹ 19.96 crore in 2019 and of this, ₹ 15.50 crore and ₹ 13 crore had been spent respectively, Dr. Poongothai expressed dissatisfaction for not having spent the entire allocated amount for creating rural employment.

Ms. Shilpa said the farmhands, who were being hired for MNREGP works, would not come for work whenever farming operations in the district moved to top gear following good rainfall during south-west and north-east monsoon.

“Only after the harvest, the farmhands would come for MNREGP works from March onwards,” the Collector said.

Project Director of Mahalir Thittam Michael Antony Fernando said the district, having 7,546 women self-help groups, had created 225 women self-help groups during the current fiscal against the target of 150 SHGs.

When the National Rural Health Mission was taken up for review, Dr. Poongothai, Mr. Abubucker and Mr. Lakshmanan pointed-out that most of the taluk hospitals did not have adequate number of doctors and nurses forcing the public to get medical assistance either in the private hospitals or travel all the way to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital. “Most of these hospitals don’t have obstetrician and gynaecologists,” they pointed-out.

The MLAs also charged that beneficiaries for the Prime Minister’s Housing Programme were not properly selected and construction of houses under this scheme was getting delayed though these works were started 2 years ago.

The MLAs came down heavily on the officials and the contractors who were implementing the drinking water projects at a snail’s pace.

“Some of the drinking water projects are under implementation even after 10 years have lapsed. The Maanur drinking water scheme, which was started 4 years ago, is yet to be completed. Consequently, the roads dug up for laying drinking water pipes are yet to be closed, leaving the public in the lurch. How can we face the people as Assembly elections are fast approaching?” Dr. Poongothai asked.

Admitting that there was delay in the completion of drinking water schemes, the Collector asked the officials to expedite the work.

Mr. Gnanathiraviam said the old age pension had not been given to those who were really in need of the assistance while Mr. Dhanush Kumar complained about the delay in giving crop loss insurance benefits to the farmers from Sankarankovil area. The Collector said insurance benefits for crop loss would be given to the farmers from 4 villages in Sankarankovil taluk shortly.

Mr. Gnanathiraviam also said the Public Works Department officials were delaying the implementation of some of the projects even after sufficient money from his constituency development fund had been allocated. The MLAs also complained about the pathetic condition of Tirunelveli – Tiruchendur and Tirunelveli – Tenkasi Highways that witness frequent fatal accidents.

The college students’ plan to start indefinite agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens was thwarted by the police as the strong deployment of the law enforcers discouraged the young protesters from commencing the protest.

Though the college students had announced that they would gather at VOC Stadium in Palayamkottai on Wednesday morning to start indefinite agitation, none of them turned up as they had informed the reporters here on Tuesday night.

Anticipating the protest, the police, after closing the gates at the eastern and western sides of the sports arena, had stationed two police buses near these entry points that in fact discouraged them from coming even closer to the stadium.

Even though the protesters did not come to the ‘venue’, the police personnel deployed there were positioned there till evening.

Around 6 p.m., 44 students from a few colleges here, who parked their bikes near Lourdhunathan Statue on South Bazaar started gathering at the small ground near Government Siddha Medical College. Sensing that the students had shifted their protest venue, the police swiftly moved to the spot with the police vehicles and held talks with the students.

Even as the students, who sat on the ground, were about to start a dharna with the placards, the police continued their talks and pacified them. Consequently, the students left the spot abruptly. While leaving the spot, some of them, who received the phone numbers of the reporters, said they would certainly start the agitation.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/lsjsov/article30923318.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA27TVL-STUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/police-thwart-students-move-to-start-indefinite-stir/article30923319.ece

On Tuesday evening, the Madurai Airport Advisory Committee held its meeting at the airport under the chairmanship of Virudhunagar MP. Mr. Venkatesan (joint chairman) and Tirupparankundram MLA P. Saravanan (vice-chairman) took part.

“Development of Madurai airport is pertinent to the socio-economic development of southern districts. Hence, we have decided to call for a meeting of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs from all parties to discuss the issue and meet the Union Minister,” Mr. Venkatesan said.

He was appreciative of the district administration for expediting the process of land acquisition for expansion of the airport.

While ₹15 crore was distributed for land acquisition till May last, ₹39 crore was paid in the last seven months. A total of 275.89 acres out of 615.92 acres had been acquired so far, with 68.73 acres handed over to Airports Authority of India.

With regard to the long-pending demand for night operations at the airport, Mr. Venkatesan said AAI would taking up runway strengthening work in June. The project could be carried out only during the night. “Once it is over, night handling of flights could be possible from January 2021.”

Efforts were also being made to run air-conditioned buses from the airport to MGR Integrated Bus Stand and Periyar Bus Stand.

You have to provide direction to the world,” he said.

The Union government, he said, was laying more emphasis on research. The National Research Foundation was giving grants ranging between ₹ 80,000 and ₹ 80 lakh for research projects. “Proceed in the field of research, which is a good resource. This time will not come back,” he added.

He asked students to make use of free online courses available on swayam.gov.in portal and also the lectures available on Swayam Prabha free DTH channel for education.

Mr. Pokhriyal said that the new education policy being framed by the Union government will bring back India its glory of being a centre for education and medicine. India has the capacity to become a world leader. The days are not far when the country will see a $ 5 trillion economy.

Mr. Rao said that 40 % of the NITK staff are from other States and they need a Kendriya Vidyalaya for their children.

Last year, Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had announced the setting up of a new KV in the southern region of Manglauru. But so far no action has been taken.

Mr. Rao urged Mr. Pokhriyal to consider the NITK school functioning on the institute’s campus as a Kendriya Vidyalaya. “This school can be developed as a national school using the resources available with the institute,” he said.

332,2020/02/26,NITK opens Central Research Facility,"The institute is the first to use funds from Higher Education Finance Agency for the purpose

National Institute of Technology-Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal, here on Tuesday started operations of a Central Research Facility that provides modern research opportunities for its students and those from about 85 educational institutions in the region. NITK is the first NIT in the country to use funds from Higher Education Finance Agency (HEFA) to set up a research facility. This research facility was among a few that were inaugurated by Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Tuesday.

The facility’s convener Uday Bhat said that the centre will provide students from the region modern equipment to help carry out research in physics, chemistry and other branches. Modern tools are necessary for quality research that meet the standards required world-over. The HEFA of the Union government has granted ₹ 80 crore for the purpose.

While some of the equipment procured are from the U.K., the U.S. and Germany, there are a few equipment that have been sourced from within the country. “We have installed three equipment. We are getting the remaining shortly,” Mr. Bhat said. Services at the centre can be availed of by paying a nominal fee, he said. The new facility will have Intellectual Property Rights Cell and Technology Transfer Cell. Besides an office for industrial consultancy and sponsored research, the facility will have space for major industrial bodies to set up laboratories with cutting-edge technologies. All these will come up in the new three-floor building being constructed at a cost of ₹ 47.99 crore, Mr. Bhat said.

NITK Director K. Umamaheshwara Rao urged Mr. Pokhriyal to sanction ₹ 700 crore to convert the new research facility into a National Research Institute.

333,2020/02/26,Local farmers ensures direct connect with consumers,"About 60 farmers, farm produce associations are on the platform

Amid efforts by many to connect farmers directly with customers, a techie from an agriculture family in Dakshina Kannada has provided one such online platform that could benefit both.

After working for a software giant for some years in Bengaluru, 36-year-old Bondala Yatheesh Shetty returned home; not to take up agriculture, but to connect agriculturists with the market, without the intervention of middlemen.

And, in about a couple of years, Mr. Shetty was able to bring together about 60 farmers, including a few farm produce associations, under the LocalFarmers network, www.localfarmers.in, with his team comprising Srihariprasad, Ranjith, Rakshitha, Ganesh Shenoy and Eshwar. Recently, another friend Rajath Shetty developed an Android-based mobile App too for LocalFarmers.

A host of products ranging from locally grown vegetables and fruits to cereals and pulses and from dairy products to coconut oil are all available on the LocalFarmers platform. Home-made delicacies, including sweets, savouries, ghee and butter too are available on this network. Mr. Shetty said that LocalFarmers provides both organic as well as chemical-free produce to customers after their detailed verification.

Mr. Shetty said that LocalFarmers markets produce and products through multiple channels. On the one hand it accepts online booking and delivers the produce and products at the customers doorsteps and on the other, it operates a mobile shop, FarmKart, that would be stationed at designated locations during specific days and time of the week facilitating customers to buy produce and products directly.

Using WhatsApp, LocalFarmers sends out regular bulletins to regular customers about the availability of produce and products and prices helping them to place orders, Mr. Shetty said. Their products are available at the office located at Brahmana Parishat building, next to Somayaji Hospital, at B.C. Road.

Almost all urban areas of Dakshina Kannada, excluding Belthangady and Moodbidri and parts of Bengaluru (Kanakapura Road surroundings), were being catered to at present, he added.

LocalFarmers offers competitive pricing and passes off the major benefit to farmers or farm produce associations. While prices of vegetables would almost be the same as in the market, the prices of value added products and home-made products would be a bit higher considering the method of production and quality. Yet, their prices are competitive compared to similar products in the market, Mr. Shetty said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/nyd98r/article30917101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MNLOCALFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/localfarmers-ensures-direct-connect-with-consumers/article30917102.ece
334,2020/02/26,Pending MSME loan revamp by March 15,"Process will ease the challenges of securing affordable credit, says FM

The restructuring of micro, small and medium enterprises’ (MSME) loans by banks will be done by March 15, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

In fact, out of the 5.53 lakh accounts identified as of January 6, 2020, 5.28 lakh have already been restructured. The rest will be cleared by March 15, Ms. Sitharaman told journalists on Wednesday, speaking after a meeting with heads of public sector banks.

Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of India had extended the one-time loan restructuring window for such MSME accounts from March 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Ms. Sitharaman added that as and when stressed assets are identified, they will be cleared. However, those already identified and pending must be completed by March 15.

This ensures that stressed assets of standard MSME accounts will not be downgraded and classified as non-performing assets, so long as the aggregate exposure to the borrower does not exceed ₹25 crore as on January 1, 2020. This would help small businesses improve their balance sheets and ease the challenges of securing affordable credit.

With regard to proposed public sector bank mergers, she said the process is going on as per schedule and “there is no uncertainty.” The Centre plans to merge 10 banks into four.

On the impact of the COVID-19, Ms. Sitharaman said the government was closely monitoring the issue. Department-level decisions are being taken on proposals to airlift raw materials for some sectors or source supplies from other countries if needed, she added.

On adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of the telecom sector, Ms. Sitharaman said she had held discussions with representatives of the telecom majors over the last few days. However, the Department of Telecom would be taking a call and when solutions are worked out, they would be announced.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbufgj/article30925173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27BUNIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/pending-msme-loan-revamp-by-march-15/article30925174.ece
335,2020/02/26,"ATMs starts dispensing more of ₹500 instead of ₹2,000","RBI in an RTI response last year had said that the central bank had stopped printing ₹2,000 denomination currency notes.

Banks have started dispensing more of ₹500 notes instead of ₹2,000 denomination notes, a move seen as gradual phasing out of the high denomination currency.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in an RTI response last year had said that the central bank had stopped printing ₹2,000 denomination currency notes.

Although there has been no dictate from the Finance Ministry, banks on their own have decided to fill their ATMs with smaller denomination notes for the convenience of customers, sources said.

Some banks have already started recaliberation of their ATMs and other banks will also follow the suit, sources said.

State-owned Indian Bank has already announced that its has decided to stop using ₹2,000 notes in their ATMs.

Getting change for a ₹2,000 note is an issue, keeping that in mind some banks have stopped using ₹2,000 notes in their ATMs.

According to the RBI’s RTI reply, 3,542.991 million notes of ₹2,000 denomination were printed during 2016-17.

However, 2017-18 saw a substantial reduction in printing and only 111.507 million notes were produced, which further reduced to 46.690 million notes in 2018-19.

This indicates that while these high denomination notes would continue to be a legal tender but will be phased out eventually.

The move is seen as an attempt to prevent hoarding of the high-value currency and thus, curb black money. The government had in November 2016 demonetised ₹1,000 and ₹500 denominations notes.

Replying to a question in Parliament, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur in December said there is no proposal to withdraw ₹2,000 denomination notes.

“This is the real worry (about demonetisation) which has surfaced now. I think that you should not worry about it,” Mr. Thakur told the Rajya Sabha while replying to a question whether the government was planning to withdraw ₹2,000 notes in future.

According to the reply, notes in circulation (NIC) as on November 4, 2016 were ₹17,74,187 crore which have now increased to ₹22,35,648 crore as on December 2, 2019.

The NIC had grown at an average growth rate of 14.51% year on year wise since October 2014 till October 2016.

At this rate, NIC would have increased to ₹25,40,253 crore as on December 2, 2019.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/2r9pw9/article28464310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/625850990,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/bank-atms-starts-dispensing-more-of-500-instead-of-2000/article30921983.ece
336,2020/02/26,Global recession likely if COVID-19 becomes pandemic: Moody’s Analytics,"COVID-19 is now on the lengthening list of concerns of global businesses which are already grappling with the trade war, the Brexit transition, and the economic policy implications of the fast-approaching U.S. presidential election

A global recession is likely if coronavirus becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in Italy and Korea, Moody’s Analytics said on Wednesday.

“The coronavirus has been a body blow to the Chinese economy, which now threatens to take out the entire global economy,” Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics Mark Zandi said.

The outbreak of the virus, officially called COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan in China in December and has since affected thousands of people across the globe.

“COVID-19 is battering the global economy in numerous ways. Chinese business travel and tourism has all but stopped; global airlines are not going to China and cruise lines are cancelling most Asia-Pacific itineraries. This is a huge problem for major travel destinations, including in the U.S., where some 3 million Chinese tourists visit each year,” Moody’s Analytics said.

Chinese tourists to the U.S. are among the biggest spenders of any foreign tourists. Travel in Europe is also sure to be severely impacted as Milan, Italy, the centre of the new infections in that country, is a major travel hub for the Continent.

Shuttered Chinese factories are also a problem for countries and companies fastened into China’s manufacturing supply chain. Apple, Nike and General Motors are some prominent American examples.

Shortages of some goods will likely result this spring, meaning higher prices for things we buy at Walmart and on Amazon, it said.

“U.S. exports to China will suffer given the slumping Chinese demand. China is supposed to ramp up its imports of U.S. products as part of the Phase One trade deal signed by the two countries late last year.

“How much the Chinese would actually purchase from the U.S. was already an open question. Given COVID-19, it is even more questionable. President Trump has suggested that the federal government will cut another check to hard-pressed U.S. farmers to make up for the losses,” it said.

Because China is the biggest buyer of many of the world’s commodities, including oil, copper, soybeans and pork, and will be buying a lot less of these and many other things, prices are slumping.

Americans will pay less at the gas pump, which is a plus, but it will be hard on the energy, mining and agricultural industries. Emerging economies, especially in Latin America and Africa, that rely on commodity production for their livelihoods will be slammed.

“Global businesses can’t seem to catch a break. They have been grappling with the trade war, the Brexit transition, and the economic policy implications of the fast-approaching U.S. presidential election,” it said.

“COVID-19 is now another on this lengthening list of concerns, making it even more likely that already-cautious business executives will continue to sit on new investment and expansion plans. Moreover, they will likely be slow to ramp up their operations, fearful of the implications if they move too quickly and their workers get sick,” it said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/jozsy1/article30921097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKNORTHKOREA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/global-recession-likely-if-coronavirus-becomes-pandemic-moodys-analytics/article30921098.ece

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the setting up of a National Technical Textiles Mission at an total outlay of ₹1,480 Crore.

The aim is to position the country as a global leader in technical textiles and increase the use of technical textiles in the domestic market.

The Mission will be implemented for four years from 2020-2021 and will have four components, a release said.

The first component will focus on research and development and innovation and will have an outlay of ₹1,000 crore. The research will be at both, fibre level and application-based in geo, agro, medical, sports and mobile textiles and development of bio-degradable technical textiles. Research activities will also focus on development of indigenous machinery and process equipment. The second component will be for promotion and development of market for technical textiles.

The release said the Indian technical textiles segment is estimated at $16 billion which is approximately 6% of the $250 billion global technical textiles market. The penetration level of technical textiles in India varies between 5% and 10% against the level of 30% to 70% in developed countries. The Mission will aim at taking domestic market size to $40 billion to $50 billion by 2024.

The third component will focus on export promotion so that technical textile exports from the country reach from the ₹14,000 crore now to ₹20,000 crore by 2021-2022 and ensure 10% average growth every year till the Mission ends.

338,2020/02/26,Centre to revamp IT Act,"New law to focus on stronger framework to deal with cybercrimes: Prasad

The government will soon kick-start the process of revamping the nearly 20-year old Information Technology Act, 2000, with an aim to bring it in tune with the technological advancements with a focus on stronger framework to deal with cybercrimes, Minister for Electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Wednesday.

An expert committee will be set up with members from the government as well as the industry for discussion on the new IT Act.

Changed ecosystem

“Discussions are on in the department to revisit the IT Act... The IT Act is now 20 years old, and during this time, the IT ecosystem has developed beyond recognition. New technology has become very pronounced, the whole ecosystem of consumers has changed vastly and so have the challenges,” Mr. Prasad said.

The Minister added that one of the major challenges was the scale of users that consume technology. “The biggest challenge is the number of consumers we have to handle. Plus, today, in India, technology has become the centre of digital payment and delivery of services such as GST and UPI. This also raises the question of misuse [of technology]. The vastness of these platforms was not even contemplated when the IT Act came into being,” he said.

Mr. Prasad said that the new Act will also factor-in larger issues, including Supreme Court’s judgment on privacy.

Noting that cyber issues have not been adequately responded to in the present IT Act, the Minister said the government may even look at including a separate chapter on cyber issues in the revamped Act.

The Minister was speaking to reporters after his meeting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was on a three-day visit to India. “We had a very good meeting, it was a courtesy meeting. I wish to thank him for his observations on Digital India, in particular digital inclusion...We also discussed a whole range of issues around IT,” he said with regards to the meeting that lasted for about 20 minutes.

The Minister added that he had suggested to Mr. Nadella that Microsoft should consider adopting some digital villages and mentor them to make them beacons.

“I am happy that he has readily responded,” he added.

The Minister also pointed out that the issue of data sovereignty was discussed at the meeting. However, he did not share further details.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bs01c0/article30925139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27BURAVISHANKARPRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/centre-to-revamp-it-act/article30925140.ece
339,2020/02/26,Chabahar Port project: Union Cabinet approves exemption of IPGL from Department of Public Enterprises guidelines,"India Ports Global Ltd was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle for development and management of Shahid Behesthi Port of Chabahar in Iran.

The government on February 26 approved the exemption of India Ports Global Ltd from the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) guidelines for smooth execution of Chabahar Port project.

The approval was given during a Union Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The Union Cabinet... has approved the exemption of the India Ports Global Ltd from the DPE Guidelines, except reservation and vigilance policies,” the Shipping Ministry said in a statement.

IPGL was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle jointly promoted by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and Deendayal Port Trust (DPT) for development and management of Shahid Behesthi Port of Chabahar in Iran.

Subsequent to the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the External Affairs Ministry advised the Shipping Ministry on October 29, 2018 to exclude JNPT and DPT from possible impact of U.S. sanctions.

“Based on this and with the approval of empowered Committee all the shares of JNPT & DPT were purchased by ‘Sagarmala Development Company Ltd’ (SDCL) on December 17, 2018,” it said.

SDCL is a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) and therefore IPGL being a subsidiary of SDCL has also become a CPSE.

As a result, guidelines of DPE are technically applicable on IPGL.

Since Chabahar Port is the country’s first overseas port project with strategic objectives, there is an urgent need to allow IPGL to continue to function as a board managed company, duly following the instructions of the shipping as well as external affairs ministries without making the guidelines of DPE applicable to it for a period of five years, the statement said.

Accordingly, the Shipping Ministry has requested exemptions to IPGL from the applicability of the DPE guidelines, for smooth execution of the project.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/6n880r/article25939808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHABAHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/chabahar-port-project-union-cabinet-approves-exemption-of-india-ports-global-ltd-from-department-of-public-enterprises-guidelines/article30924295.ece

346,2020/02/26,The politics of Kejriwalism,"Castes and religions contribute towards building a new progressive and inclusive urban citizenship

Philosopher of Science Paul Feyerabend’s book, Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge, questioned the previously established clarity on methods of science and the idea that new theory must be consistent with already well-established theories and must correspond with well-established facts. We see a similar discernment with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s victory amongst those who believe in the politics of ideology. The AAP is said to be post-ideology. This should worry those committed to the politics of radical change. Paradoxically, the AAP also promises change, but this is change of a minimal kind that is achieved in exchange of votes.

An eclectic universalism

‘Kejriwalism’ could well describe the AAP and Mr. Kejriwal’s politics. Kejriwalism mixes odd symbols and ideas to generate a kind of eclectic universalism where castes and religions can contribute towards building a new progressive and inclusive urban citizenship. Anything goes as a method for Feyerabend, and only this can allow a new theory to grow. Same is the case for Kejriwalism. One can use varied symbols that work towards change and welfare-driven, inclusive urban citizenship. The success of Kejriwalism stands out. It also discredits the BJP’s aggressive nationalism by usurping the party’s cultural nationalist symbols while emphasising a localised politics of justice.

Kejriwalism is the politics of minimum rights (water, sanitation, health, education and electricity) that focuses on achieving everyday dignified urbanism. Reforms in health and education under the AAP have significantly delivered quality health care and education for the urban poor. The seductive value of such politics cannot be undermined for those at the urban margins. Almost the entire Muslim vote has gone to the AAP. Scheduled Castes and lower OBCs too have largely voted for the AAP. The rate of voting amongst high-caste Hindus for the BJP is much higher than other communities. Mr. Kejriwal is trying a new politics of Hinduism from below. Those believing in revolution or the politics of ideology may find Kejriwalism regressive. However, the strength of Kejriwalism lies in promising a better life for the urban poor without antagonising the privileged urban and keeping the Hindu majority in good humour.

Mr. Kejriwal is also charismatic. However, unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his charisma does not lie in religion or the ‘othering’ of Muslims for Hindus. It is also not based on a family legacy like that of the Gandhis. Rather it draws from the ethics of modern-day minimalism and is consolidated by his education, non-political background, and emphasis on the politics of truth. He is playing a contemporary Gandhi (who believed in anarchy in terms of purna swaraj) who knows well the importance of Ambedkar (education and scientific temper) and Bhagat Singh.

The AAP in its eclectic form resembles many other parties but what works in Mr. Kejriwal’s favour is the fact that he cannot be reduced to his caste in Delhi. The incipient urbanism of Delhi allows him to be an Agarwal who is also a casteless Hindu for his public role.

Not for rural India

However, those who predict Mr. Kejriwal’s national future may want to pause and rethink. Kejriwalism may be new-age politics that is suited mostly for metropolitan cities where struggle for basic amenities could partly overwhelm caste and religious solidarities, but rural India may not have fertile ground for such eclecticism. In Kejriwalism we have a form of post-ideology politics that promises the best of a local hybrid-Hindu collective for urban spaces as it includes elements of (north Indian) nationalism, welfarism and politics of change in everyday life.

347,2020/02/26,Counting birds together,"The State of India’s Birds Report has two distinctive features that define a new approach

The State of India’s Birds Report 2020 represents the first collective attempt in India to understand and assess how the avifauna are doing. The results of this exercise are broadly sobering. While there are several species, including globally threatened ones, whose populations are doing reasonably, more bird species are showing declines in population than are showing population stability or increases. During the last two decades, over half the species assessed have declined. This trend is even more pronounced in recent times, with nearly 80% of the species assessed showing declines over the last five years. And these declines are particularly acute for certain groups of birds, including birds of prey, migrant shorebirds, birds of forests and grasslands, and endemic birds of the Western Ghats. The report further suggests that more bird species deserve immediate conservation attention than previously thought. To the list of 67 globally threatened Indian bird species previously identified by the IUCN (as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable), the report adds 34 more species. The number of species of high conservation concern in India is now 101.

A collaborative effort

But the news is not all bad. The report also provides strong reasons for hope that we can further strengthen the understanding and conservation of our avian heritage. In particular, the report has two distinctive features that define a new approach: first, that the information it builds on comes from citizens like us all, and second, that the report’s data and analysis are in the public domain, inviting critique and further refinement.

Assessing the status of our birds poses a variety of challenges. For a start, there are over 1,300 species of birds in India. While some are loud, colourful or diurnal, and hence relatively easier to detect, others are quiet, shy, or nocturnal. Further, finding them also means having to look in a wide variety of habitats: in forests, wetlands, farmlands, cities, mountains and even open oceans. And to complicate matters further, hundreds of species migrate into and out of our country at different times of the year. Addressing these challenges and achieving a coverage both of species and of habitats has been possible only because of an alignment in the formidable energies and efforts of a large and inspired community of birdwatchers across the country. Only through the efforts of over 15,500 birdwatchers, it became possible to assemble a dataset of over 10 million records, with data points going as far back as the 1970s. Upon this foundation, a large multi-institutional consortium of researchers drawn from both non-governmental and government institutions collaborated to analyse and put together the report.

While the report describes key patterns of change in the populations of certain bird species, answering why these changes have taken place, or developing conservation action that address these changes, are logical follow-up actions that are inconceivable without focused and sustained collective efforts. Just as we have collectively collected, curated, compiled and analysed bird data, we must remain engaged with the results, and continue to further not only an understanding of our avifauna but also actions to conserve them.

Open access to data

Besides collaboration, another key value that the report seeks to acknowledge is the importance of making, not just its outputs, but also the entire process open. The data that has gone into this report are not only collected by thousands of citizens, but are open for any researcher to use. The analyses (and the code) that form the basis of this report are in the public domain. Finally, the report and its results too are entirely open. A better public and scientific understanding of our biodiversity can grow only from wider and open access not only to data, but also from opening the entire process of scientific inquiry to wider peer and public scrutiny and challenge. And we are hoping that, as more and more people come in and examine the data, the analyses and the results, and ask questions, it only adds greater strength to our understanding of our precious birds.

Of all the forms in which humans encounter nature, birds perhaps touch our lives most closely. Birds are nearly everywhere. They are colourful, they sing and they display. They perform vital functions like predation and seed dispersal. They pervade nearly every aspect of our cultural lives. Given our shared bonds in a timeless journey, to paraphrase ornithologist Nigel Collar, we need to continue building and strengthening models by which citizens, scientists, conservationists and managers collaborate not only to understand our birds, but also to enable them to fare better on our fast-changing planet.

348,2020/02/26,Two rising powers in two different eras,"Comparisons between the rise of China and the rise of imperial Germany are not accurate

The rise of China is an epochal development that could change the international system drastically. If China was primarily an agrarian, feudal, backward country in 1949 at the time of the revolution, it is radically different today. Decades of economic reforms under the tight control of the Communist Party has transformed the country into an industrial and technological powerhouse. It is only a matter of time before China overtakes the U.S. to become the world’s largest economy.

This economic rise has had strategic consequences as well. China, the world’s second-largest military spender after the U.S., has established itself as the mightiest force in the Asia-Pacific, with the clear ambition of becoming a global superpower. This rapid rise has upset the existing equilibrium of the global order, which has been largely centred around the U.S., at least since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

These events have historical parallels. The rise of imperial Germany in the late 19th century and the rise of the Soviet Union in the 20th century shaped the global order too. While the roots of the First World War can be traced back to imperial Germany’s quest to become a superpower, the Soviet Union challenged the U.S.’s hegemony after the Second World War, pushing the world into the Cold War. With China rising as the next superpower, these comparisons are often brought in, sometimes with alarming warnings.

The German example

Imperial Germany’s rise as an industrial and military power after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the subsequent unification of Germany disrupted the power dynamic in Europe, which was dominated by Great Britain and France. Germany’s quest for new markets (colonies) for its products, backed by the national big business and the financial oligarchy, heightened tensions between colonial powers. The economic tensions spilled into the military arena, with Germany adopting Weltpolitik (world politics, its expansive foreign policy doctrine). Threatened by a resurgent Germany, Britain and France joined Russia to form the Triple Entente. This, in turn, heightened Germany’s paranoia that its natural rise was being curtailed. To break this ‘maximum moment’ (where its natural rise had come to a stall), Germany was ready to go to war. The result was the First World War.

Similar to how imperial Germany’s rise upset Great Britain, China’s rise has upset the reigning superpower, the U.S. And similar to how Britain and France joined hands with Russia to contain Germany, the U.S. is doing its best, through alliances in the Pacific, to contain China.

Then and now

Yet, there are fundamental differences between the rivalries of the 19th and 20th centuries and those of today. The tensions between imperial Germany and Britain were primarily a result of the race for new economic territories between the colonial powers, which Lenin called “inter-imperialist rivalry”. Both countries were supported by their national industrial and financial oligarchies, or monopoly capital. Today, it’s not a competition between colonial powers. Both China and the U.S. are closely integrated into the global economic system. They are each other’s biggest trading partners.

Second, imperial Germany was ready to go to war because it thought war was the only way to break its ‘maximum moment’. But in reality, Germany’s rise was halted by the First World War. The country was humiliated internationally. Anger and discontent led to the revolution in Germany, the establishment of the Weimar Republic, the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Second World War. On the contrary, China is still a growing power. In 40 years, it hasn’t fought a war. And the path to growth and development is still open for China.

Does this mean that the competition between the U.S. and China could lead to a new Cold War? It’s likely, but in a different global scenario. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were the two pillars of the global system. There was no major third pole. Most countries, including those part of the Non-Aligned Movement, were drawn closer to either of these two blocs. The Cold War was the defining phenomenon of the post-war world.

Today’s situation is different. First, China is not seeking to build an ideological bloc against the U.S. Its focus is on its own economic rise and in reshaping the international order. Second, the world is more dynamic today. There are many regional powers on the rise: Russia continues to be a geopolitical hegemon in Central Asia and Eastern Europe with global ambitions; India is a rising big power in South Asia; and Turkey seeks to be a dominant power in West Asia. In effect, the U.S. and China are competing in a multidirectional world, dissimilar to the bipolar world which saw the Soviet-American rivalry.

The U.S. would still want to contain China, like it did the Soviet Union, as China represents the biggest challenge to the western international order. During the Cold War, the U.S. aided the redevelopment of western Europe, built trans-Atlantic military alliances, forced the Soviet Union into an arms race which hurt its economy, exploited the Sino-Soviet rift, and launched an anti-communist crusade across the globe. Now, it’s trying to build a strategic alliance in the Asia-Pacific, mainly with India, Japan and Australia, to tackle China, and has taken the battle into the trade and technological realms. But there are at least three problems with this new containment strategy.

Containment 2.0

First, an anti-China strategic alliance is yet to take shape despite the U.S.’s earnest efforts. Even India is wary of joining an American defence bloc aimed at containing China. This is largely because the global system is multipolar. There’s no NATO yet in the Asia-Pacific. Second, even the trade and tech wars launched by the U.S. are not meeting their declared goals. Earlier this year, after months of a tariff war, the U.S. and China agreed to sign phase one of a trade deal. China agreed to buy more American goods and the U.S. suspended upcoming tariffs, while core issues such as technology transfer remained unresolved. The U.S.’s attempts to isolate Chinese tech giant Huawei have also failed with most major economies, including India, the EU, and the U.K. deciding not to ban Huawei from rolling out 5G.

Third, one of the key aspects of the containment during the Cold War was the U.S.’s ability to exploit the rift in the Communist bloc. George Kennan, the author of America’s containment strategy, warned in 1954 against the “association of resources” in Europe and Asia against America. He was warning against a potential Sino-Soviet alliance. During the Cold War, it didn’t materialise, and the U.S. reached out to China. But today, the Sino-Russian alliance which Kennan had warned about is already in place. Today’s Russia is not the China of the 1970s. It is much more powerful and has trans-continental ambitions. It will not be easy for the U.S. to wean the Russians away from the Chinese. In effect, the U.S. is facing a rising China, far from its maximum moment, in a multipolar world. It’s an all new challenge.

349,2020/02/26,More psychological than an empowering voter option,"The meagre share of NOTA votes, and NOTA in its current form, are pointers to it being a toothless option

The recently-concluded Delhi Assembly elections were the 45th Assembly polls since the inception of the none of the above (NOTA) option in 2013. Delhi has now provided data from five elections with the NOTA option: three Assembly (2013, 2015, 2020), and two Lok Sabha (2014, 2019); no other state has yielded this yet. And Delhi, although mostly urban, is widely regarded as the microcosm of India.

However, Delhi’s preference to NOTA is less than the national average. From 0.63% in 2013, Delhi polled 0.39% of those favouring NOTA in 2015, a statistically significant reduction indeed. It now increased to 0.46% in 2020; again statistically significant. While 96% of the constituencies had a reduced percentage of NOTA votes in 2015 than 2013, the NOTA percentage has increased in 71% constituencies this year. In the Lok Sabha elections, Delhi polled 0.47% and 0.52% of those favouring NOTA, in 2014 and 2019, respectively. Thus, roughly one in 200 voters of Delhi opted for NOTA in the last six to seven years, with relatively larger support for NOTA in reserved constituencies.

Interestingly, in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections, despite being 1.8%, NOTA got more votes than any political party other than the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (except the Independents). Again, in the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly election, NOTA became a runner-up in two constituencies — Latur (Rural) and Palus-Kadegaon. Do these cases mark any significant shift in the voter mindset?

Its essence

In 2013, India became the 14th country to institute negative voting through NOTA. However, it is not a “right to reject”. NOTA in India is a toothless option;, former Chief Election Commissioner of India S.Y. Quraishi, had observed in an article: “Even if there are 99 NOTA votes out of a total of 100, and candidate X gets just one vote, X is the winner, having obtained the only valid vote. The rest will be treated as invalid or ‘no votes’.” NOTA enfeebles the electorate as it does not empower to “select” either. Certainly NOTA provides democratic means to express resentment anonymously rather than boycotting the polls outright. In her 2017 book, The Dramatic Decade: Landmark Cases of Modern India, Indu Bhan has given examples such as a group of women activists in Kerala out on the road urging people not to elect any candidate if no woman was present in the fray, and a youth group in Tamil Nadu that campaigned for NOTA as a protest vote against corruption.

There have been pleas to extend the scope of NOTA. In 2018, a former CEC, T.S. Krishnamurthy, has recommended holding elections again in those constituencies where the victory margin is less than the total numbers of NOTA. A PIL has been filed in Madras High Court seeking the full right to reject in place of NOTA.

In June 2018, the Maharashtra State Election Commission (SEC) issued an order that said: “If it is noticed while counting that NOTA has received the highest number of valid votes, the said election for that particular seat shall be countermanded and a fresh election shall be held for such a post.” In November 2018, the SEC of Haryana went a step further and issued an order where NOTA is treated like a “fictional candidate” in municipal polls from December 2018. If NOTA gets maximum vote, none of the “real” candidates will be declared elected, and the elections will be cancelled and held afresh. What is more, the candidates securing votes less than NOTA would be barred from contesting in that re-election. Interestingly, in Makassar, Indonesia, the only candidate in the 2018 election for mayor received 35,000 less votes than NOTA, which forced a repeat election in 2020.

While introducing NOTA, the Supreme Court anticipated that “there will be a systemic change and the political parties will be forced to accept the will of the people and field candidates who are known for their integrity.” Thus, its percentage should either increase to enforce the political parties to field candidates with “integrity”, or NOTA percentage should consistently decrease if the electorates feel that the system has achieved the desired level of cleansing. In contrast, the share of NOTA votes in India remained around a meagre level of 1% on an average; 1.11% in the 2014 Lok Sabha, and 1.08% in 2019, if we consider constituency-wise averages. This perhaps represents a confused state of mind of the electorate. Has the perceived cynicism of Indian voters regarding the right to reject been exaggerated? What would happen if the ECI empowers NOTA with teeth, for example candidates securing lesser votes than NOTA (and possibly the political party concerned also) are barred from contesting in the next election from that constituency?

Another ‘option’

Is NOTA, as the last button of all EVMs in the country, a psychological issue as far as the electorates is concerned? Delbert A. Taebel, in a seminal article in the American Journal of Political Science in 1975, and Jonathan G.S. Koppell and Jennifer A. Steen, in their 2004 article in The Journal of Politics, have discussed the possible advantage of the first position in the ballot, at least in the U.S. context. Although there is no such concrete study to gauge the Indian voter’s mindset that I know, I wonder whether using NOTB (‘none of the below’) instead of NOTA — with such an option as the first on the electronic voting machine — might produce a significantly different outcome or not. An experiment, after changing the rule suitably, can be attempted, at least.

350,2020/02/26,A test of governance: On Delhi violence,"The police must clamp down on the communal violence in Delhi

Communal violence in parts of Delhi, an earshot away from the nerve centre of the government of India, has claimed 13 lives and left over 150 injured. Mobs of pro-CAA demonstrators and anti-CAA protesters wielding sticks and weapons have taken over parts of the city and the Delhi police have proved themselves woefully inadequate at best and outrageously partisan and communal at worst, in responding to the situation. There was nothing abrupt or unexpected about the violence that erupted in the city’s north-eastern parts on Monday. This has been in the making for weeks. There was arson and violence on December 16, in areas around the Jamia Milia Islamia, to which the police responded by indiscriminately unleashing violence on students inside the university. A group of masked rioters went from room to room in student hostels in JNU on January 5 and the police stood passively. Rioters clearly identified through pictures have not been arrested yet. The Delhi police did nothing when a gunman opened fire at anti-CAA protesters on January 30. This smouldering situation turned into conflagration by Sunday evening as mobs formed on communal lines prepared to take on each other. Both sides complain that calls were made to the police since Sunday but there was no effective intervention. As chaos and arson spread through Monday, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla inexplicably characterised the situation as “fully under control”.

Read: Delhi violence live updates: Shoot at sight orders issued in northeast Delhi

The inaction and inefficiency of the Delhi police is linked to varying grades of incitement and silent consent to communal mobilisation by the BJP that is in power at the Centre. Policing and law and order in Delhi are the responsibility of the Union Home Ministry. Speeches of Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the recent Assembly election campaign in Delhi were clearly meant to encourage communal polarisation. Lower rung leaders acted on cue and turned Delhi into a communal cauldron over recent months. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy’s statement that the Delhi violence is a “conspiracy to shame India globally” during U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit is beside the point. The unfailing efficiency claimed by those who control the Central and State governments in Delhi will be proven shallow if they cannot enforce elementary law and order right under their nose. Communal violence any time, anywhere happens only due to the inefficiency or collusion or both of those in power. The Prime Minister and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal must prove their efficiency and administrative skills by clamping down on violence, whatever it takes.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-test-of-governance-on-delhi-violence/article30915943.ece
351,2020/02/26,Crisis in Malaysia: On Mahathir Mohamad resignation,"A power-hungry Mahathir has pushed Malaysia toward political instability

The abrupt resignation of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Monday has triggered the first major political crisis in the country since the 2018 general election and could upturn the reform process initiated by the coalition government. Though the nonagenarian leader has not said why he submitted the resignation even after the ruling Pakatan Harapan coalition had reaffirmed its support for his premiership, his decision appears to be a calculated move to prevent handing over power to Anwar Ibrahim, his one-time colleague-turned-nemesis-turned coalition partner. Mr. Mahathir, who was in power from 1981 to 2003, and Mr. Anwar, who had once served in Mr. Mahathir’s cabinet until he was jailed for sodomy in the late 1990s, joined hands prior to the 2018 election to take on the Malay nationalist United Malays National Organization (UMNO), which had ruled the country for six decades. The Pakatan Harapan coalition consisting of nationalist, centrist and ethnic Chinese parties, represented the diversities of the Malaysian society and promised voters a pluralistic, corruption-free government. After the surprise victory, Mr. Mahathir became the Prime Minister again, but with support from both Mr. Anwar’s People’s Justice Party and the Democratic Action Party. The understanding: Mr. Mahathir would form the government and hand over power to Mr. Anwar later.

Also read: Mahathir’s challenge

The source of the crisis is this delicate power-sharing deal. Mr. Mahathir refused to give a firm commitment or timeline to hand over power to Mr. Anwar despite requests from the latter’s party. The coalition was in trouble as a rival bloc within Mr. Anwar’s party had accused him of trying to topple Mr. Mahathir. As the crisis worsened, Mr. Mahathir announced his resignation and his party, the Malaysian United Indigenous Party, quit the coalition. So in effect, the Pakatan Harapan has collapsed. It is not clear what the next moves of Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar will be; neither of them has a majority on their own. A new coalition will need 112 seats for majority in the 222-member Parliament. Mr. Mahathir’s party has only 26 lawmakers. Mr. Anwar’s party had won 50 seats in 2018, but it is not clear now whether he has the support of all his party lawmakers. This means Malaysia is expected to see some dirty political fights in the coming days. And if neither side manages to win a majority, the country will go to the polls. This crisis could have been avoided had the Pakatan Harapan leaders lived up to the promises they made to themselves and to the voters. The coalition government had a promising beginning with a wider representation of minority groups and its bid to root out corruption in a country that is yet to recover from the 1MDB scandal. Ideally, Mr. Mahathir should have honoured the understanding he reached with his partners and allowed the coalition to complete its term. But it does not seem to be his priority any more.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crisis-in-malaysia-on-mahathir-mohamad-resignation/article30915945.ece
352,2020/02/26,"Bengaluru needs a film city, Yash tells CM","Twelfth edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival gets underway

“The number of films being produced in Kannada has grown leaps and bounds; over 400 films were produced this year. There is hope that there will be improvement in its quality also,” said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, while inaugurating the 12th edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival in the city on Wednesday.

He spoke about the importance of the 1970s, which was considered the golden age of Kannada cinema. “It was then that legendary film-maker Satyajit Ray said he saw the future of Indian cinema in Kannada. I hope that the golden age returns to Kannada cinema,” Mr. Yediyurappa said. He highlighted the role of international cinema in film festivals, which he hoped would provide exposure to artistes here.

Actor Yash, a guest of honour at the event, requested the Chief Minister to get the industry a film city in Bengaluru. “We are now forced to go to other cities to work on our films. There is exceptional talent here, but it needs to be encouraged and empowered. The city, today, is known for its quality of talent in software development because parents see it as a career of good prospects and there is an ecosystem for education in the field. A film city has been in the talks for decades now. Please get us a film city and a film institute of world standard and we will assure you the golden age of Kannada cinema will be back,” he said. Senior multilingual actor Jayaprada, playback singer Sonu Nigam and producer Boney Kapoor were other guests of honour.

Sunil Puranik, chairperson, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, organiser of the festival, placed a wishlist before Mr. Yediyurappa before the upcoming State Budget. “There is a need to establish an archive for Kannada films apart from film museums at major tourist attractions in the State. Several film technicians and workers are suffering with no income to fall back on in their old age. I request the CM to institute a pension scheme for the industry,” he said. The CM said he had discussed it with stakeholders and he would do whatever is possible.

The festival will screen over 220 films from 60 countries from Thursday at Orion Mall, Rajajinagar, and three other venues in the city. The highlights include retrospectives of actor Anant Nag and Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky. Films with the theme ”Indian classical music tradition” will also be screened.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7imd6f/article30925669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGBIFFES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-needs-a-film-city-yash-tells-cm/article30925672.ece
353,2020/02/26,Scholars to visit government schools,"Post doctoral fellows and PhD scholars from Raman Research Institute will spread the message of science

The Raman Research Institute (RRI) has decided to give an impetus to their outreach programmes with the aim of improving science communication and getting more children hooked on to science. It plans to rope in post doctoral fellows and PhD scholars for this exercise.

From March onwards, they will demonstrate science experiments to students in government schools. There are also plans to conduct telescope building workshops for students.

V.G. Subramanian, scientific officer at RRI, said that they wanted to broaden the horizon of young students. “We do not want students to relate science to something they read in textbooks,” he said.

The institute, which was founded by physicist and Nobel laureate C.V. Raman, also organises campus visits. Besides meeting senior professors of the institute, visitors also get an opportunity to see laboratories and the Raman museum. They can also listen to podcasts that have been created by students of RRI and the Indian Institute of Science.

Open Day

The institute will celebrate its Open Day on February 28, which happens to be observed as National Science Day. For the occasion, prefabricated exhibition stalls will be arranged in the labs to display experiments and hold interactive sessions with school children. There will be live experiments and scientific demonstrations on astronomy, space research and astrophysics.

R. Subrahmanyan, director of Raman Research Institute, said that they want people to be motivated to look at this in a scientific manner. “We do not want students to think science is like magic. We want to demonstrate things we do in the lab in a simplified way,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/scholars-to-visit-government-schools/article30925530.ece
354,2020/02/26,"Only one dog per flat, but three if you live in a house","BBMP drafts pet dog licencing rules, provides some relaxation for rescued strays

After a failed attempt to lay down rules for pet owners, the BBMP has again come up with a draft of pet dog licensing bylaws. The draft, which has been placed before the BBMP council for approval, makes it mandatory for owners to fix a microchip and sterilise their dogs.

In 2018, the civic body tried to bring in pet dog licensing bylaws but faced opposition from animal welfare activists as the rules restricted the number of dogs and breeds that citizens could keep. They were eventually withdrawn.

This time, too, the bylaws limit the number of dogs that can be reared in a flat and individual houses. While only one dog can be reared in a flat, three can be kept in an individual house. Rules have been relaxed for those who rear abandoned, rescued and local breeds, provided that owners get necessary certification from the authorities.

Animal activists have asked for clarity on the relaxation of rules and questioned why there should be a separate set of rules for pedigreed and rescued animals.

The civic body hopes that the bylaws, if approved, will help them gather data on the number of pets in the city.

“Once the bylaws are approved by the BBMP council, pet licensing will become mandatory,” said D. Randeep, Special Commissioner (Animal Husbandry), BBMP.

Fine for abusing pets

Having learned its lessons from the past, the BBMP has consulted animal welfare organisations while framing a draft of pet dog licensing bylaws, which if approved, will make it mandatory for all owners to apply for a licence and renew it every year.

According to the draft bylaws, a copy of which is with The Hindu, pet owners have to microchip their dogs at their own cost and sterilise them. They can be fined if found guilty of abusing their pets.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said the bylaws have been proposed to manage the pet dog population. Though there were rules on licensing earlier, he admitted that they were not implemented. “With the bylaws, there will be a specific framework, under which we hope to implement it. Those who don’t comply will have to pay a penalty,” he said.

One rule that has been criticised by several animal welfare organisations is allowing for owners to apply for pet licences online. This, animal welfare activists argue, leaves scope for misuse.

The civic body has proposed to utilise the revenue generated from licence fees and fines for the animal birth control and anti-rabies vaccination programmes for stray dogs.

Priya Chetty-Rajagopal from CJ Memorial Trust, a not-for-profit trust that specialises in creating awareness and advocacy for animals, particularly dogs, believes that pet owners are likely to oppose this draft, too.

“The BBMP may have attempted to prepare pet licensing bylaws, which are data oriented, strongly meshed with Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at the back end, and driven by welfare and community perspectives. But this draft will cause more harm than good and disturb pet parents. The focus should be on keeping both human and dog communities safe and in peaceful coexistence,” she said.

This can be achieved if the civic body focuses on the pressing issues around Animal Birth Control (ABC) and Anti-Rabies Vaccinations (ARV), rather than domestic pets, she said. “I have written to the BBMP Commissioner specifically requesting that the pet licensing bylaws be put on hold until issues of problems with the ABC programmes are resolved,” she added.

D. Randeep, Special Commissioner (Animal Husbandry), BBMP, said, “The draft bylaws have been brought in to protect the interests of not just the citizens, but most importantly the dogs. They will help ensure that the pets are well taken care of and are sterilised.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/only-one-dog-per-flat-but-three-if-you-live-in-a-house/article30925370.ece

356,2020/02/26,Illegal constructions: BBMP told to submit survey plan in 10 days,"High Court had in November 2019 asked the civic body to come out with a schedule

The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday gave 10 days to the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to submit a phase-wise programme to conduct a survey of all illegal constructions in the city, as the civic body did not submit the particulars as per the November 25, 2019 order of the court.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the High Court, on illegal constructions in the city.

The court had in November 2019 asked the BBMP to come out with a time schedule by December 18, 2019 for the survey in different parts of the city to identify structures built without obtaining permission and those built with permission but contain substantial and major variation from the sanction plan.

As the BBMP did not submit the programme, the court had on January 22, 2020 given another month to submit the programme with a caution that action for contempt of court would be issued if the programme was not submitted by February 26.

When a senior counsel appearing for the BBMP pointed out that policy of regularisation of certain types of illegal constructions is pending before the apex court, the bench said that conducting a survey would help the BBMP to identify the buildings to which the government’s policy of regularisation would be applicable.

The bench also made it clear that its earlier order does not mean that structures that are eligible for regularisation should also be demolished while observing that action for demolishing any illegal structure should be as per the law, which means that BBMP can consider the illegal structures if they are eligible for regularisation as per the law.

Further hearing was adjourned till March 9.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/illegal-constructions-bbmp-told-to-submit-survey-plan-in-10-days/article30924758.ece
357,2020/02/26,Another pitch for U.S. consulate in Bengaluru,"Centre to take up State government’s request during bilateral talks

Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan on Wednesday said the Union government will take up the issue of establishing a U.S. consulate in Bengaluru during bilateral talks with the U.S. in the future.

Long-pending demand

A U.S. consulate in Bengaluru is a long-pending demand. Visa applicants from south Karnataka travel to Chennai every day while applicants from north Karnataka visit Hyderabad.

Mr. Muraleedharan said after Delhi and Mumbai, a large number of visa applications come from Bengaluru. “We will take up the issue of establishing a U.S. consulate in Bengaluru during bilateral talks,” he said while speaking at a seminar on ‘Videsh Sampark Outreach’ in the city.

Earlier, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar urged the Centre to consider the State government’s demand to set up a U.S. consulate in Bengaluru. Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy said people of the State go to Chennai virtually begging for visas by standing in a long queue every day.

30 million abroad

The Union Minister said 30 million Indian are living overseas and working in various companies. The country received NRI remittances amounting to $76.4 billion in 2018-19. On average, 40% of remittances go to Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Punjab. A total of 1.22 crore passports were issued in 2019, he said.

Mr. Vijay Bhaskar asked the Centre to scrap the system of obtaining political clearances for bureaucrats travelling abroad. He also sought the Centre’s support in holding a diplomats’ or ambassadors’ meet in Bengaluru on the eve of the Global Investors Meet in November, 2020.

Students told to register

In the background of the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan has appealed to students studying abroad to voluntarily register on the portal MADAD of the Ministry of External Affairs.

During a crisis, the government can easily evacuate students if they submit details in the portal. By registering in MADAD, students can also express their grievances related to consular services offered by Indian missions abroad.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/another-pitch-for-us-consulate-in-bengaluru/article30924023.ece
358,2020/02/26,Prominent leaders condemn remarks,"HDK questions Yatnal’s contribution to freedom struggle

Former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy were among the leaders in the State to condemn the statement of BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal on freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

Mr. Siddaramaiah asked Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to refrain BJP leaders from issuing provocative statements. Citing the violence in Delhi, in his tweets, Mr. Siddaramaiah told Mr. Yediyurappa to put breaks on his party leaders from making loose statements before the situation went out of control.

JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy questioned the contribution of Mr. Yatnal to the freedom struggle. “It is condemnable to talk lightly about a person who was associated with Mahatma Gandhi. Very few persons who have worked during the Mahatma’s times are with us now. They have all contributed much in the freedom struggle.” Later in a tweet, Mr. Kumaraswamy said Mr. Yatnal had tried to spit at the sky, but ultimately it had fallen on his eye. Further, he said: “I do not understand why the same BJP leaders who have commented on the Mahatma and have termed Muslims as Pakistanis, took U.S. President Donald Trump to Sabarmati Ashram and Taj Mahal. It is up to the people to decide.”

Theatre personality Prasanna said: “I am a Hindu and Mr. Doreswamy is a Hindu. I am ashamed of Mr. Yatnal and the ideology he propagates. The Hindutva that he is propagating is not Hindu dharma or any dharma for that matter. It is an insult to Hindu dharma. Let the Hindus of this land decide who is whose agent.”

KPCC media coordinator Nataraj Gowda asked the saffron party to seek Mr Yatnal’s resignation from the membership of the Legislative Assembly and tender an apology to Mr. Doreswamy.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/prominent-leaders-condemn-remarks/article30919440.ece
359,2020/02/26,Police hope Pujari’s extradition will help crack major cases,"The extortionist, who was operating from Senegal, had a network of people who would gather details about his targets

After getting underworld operative Ravi Pujari extradited from Senegal on Monday, a bigger challenge lies ahead of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths to probe over 47 criminal cases of murder, extortion and attempt to murder filed against him in the city.

A team, led by Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), is questioning Pujari in connection with the Shabnam Developers double murder case in Tilak Nagar and builder Subbraju murder case in Vyyalikaval.

These are the two important cases pending against Pujari which are serious in nature, and with a fair chance of conviction, Mr. Patil said.

Pujari’s arrest is also going to help the CCB to unearth his underworld connection in the State, the sleuths said. Pujari, who was operating from Senegal, had a network of people who would gather and provide information about his targets. Using this, he would make extortion calls and even carry out attacks using his local contacts to instil fear among people and coerce them to pay, officials said.

Still at large

Though some of his associates were arrested already, there are many who are still at large and efforts are on to smoke them out, he said. “We are going to investigate everything about Pujari and his connection in the State,” Mr. Patil said. Teams from central agencies and other States, including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kerala, are in touch with their Karnataka counterparts to seek his custody. We will finish with the pending cases before he is handed over to the other agencies, Amar Kumar Pandey, ADGP (L&O) said.

97 criminal cases

Pujari, 59, a native of Malpe in Udupi district, used to operate in Mumbai in the 1990s. He was on the run since 1994 and was holed up in Senegal. He was brought to Bengaluru on Monday morning and taken into custody to be questioned on his involvement in over 97 criminal cases, 47 of them in Bengaluru.

He was brought back to India after being arrested and extradited from Senegal, where he had been living for the last three years running a hotel business. He was produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on Monday and remanded to police custody till March 7.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/263i4q/article30919438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THPUJARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-hope-pujaris-extradition-will-help-crack-major-cases/article30919439.ece

DMK Member of Parliament Dayanidhi Maran has written to the Union Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri raising concerns about the increasing congestion at Chennai airport.

In a letter to Mr. Puri on Wednesday, he said, “I would like to bring to your attention the terrible passenger congestion at the Chennai airport and how many passengers are suffering because of the long periods they have to wait during security checks in both domestic and international terminals.”

He noted how, during peak hours every day, many passengers stand in long queues to get past the security checks. Officials of the Airports Authorities of India (AAI) have, in the past, said that they have been taking steps to control this congestion problem as much as possible but since they have limited space and increasing passenger traffic, the issue can only be mitigated and not resolved entirely till the new terminals are put to use after the on-going phase II modernisation work is finished.

Mr. Maran in his letter has asked Mr. Puri to direct (AAI) to speed up the phase II modernisation work of Chennai airport. “I request you to kindly look into the matter and expedite the work for the sake of passenger convenience and to ease up the congestion at both terminals,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ylbna4/article30921417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTH--AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dayanidhi-maran-writes-to-civil-aviation-minister-complains-of-long-queues-at-chennai-airport/article30921418.ece
365,2020/02/26,"Activated charcoal is not a permitted food additive, say food safety officials","The Food Safety Department has written to all food establishments in Chennai not to use activated charcoal in proprietary food

Some food trends become an instant hit, others not so much. However, the recent fad involving activated charcoal has prompted the Food Safety Department to step in. The department has now written to all food establishments in the city not to use activated charcoal in proprietary food. The reason: activated charcoal is not a permitted food additive, say officials and nutritionists.

A. Ramakrishnan, designated officer, Tamil Nadu Food Safety Department, Chennai, said the department has written to all food establishments in the city not to use activated charcoal in proprietary food. This would include all Indian recipes such as dosa, idli, sambar and pongal, and not snacks.

“Activated charcoal is not mentioned in the food additives list. It is not permitted as an additive for batter in the additive regulations,” he said.

A senior doctor of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital said activated charcoal was a “universal antidote” for poisoning such as in the case of pesticide or plant poisoning. “It is powdered charcoal that is activated with nascent oxygen to increase its absorbing capacity. After a stomach wash, we give activated charcoal to absorb the leftover poison,” he said.

Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital, said activated charcoal was being used in food in different parts of the world, and as a “detox” drink.. “I have heard about black ice cream, black burgers, black pizza, black dosa, waffles, drinks and so on. It is a fad, but it is important to talk about the science. There is no research to say how safe it is when consumed. As per the US Food and Drug Administration, activated charcoal is not considered a valid dietary ingredient, or a food additive, and is not an approved colour additive,” she said.

The medicinal use of activated charcoal was to treat drug overdoses and poisoning. It has had environmental uses too in filtering water, purifying air, and historically in cheese making, she added.

She said that there are a list of certain medications that are known to have interactions with activated charcoal, and those with existing medical conditions involving the gastrointestinal tract could worsen their symptoms if they consume activated charcoal. “Activated charcoal sometimes has add on sorbitol when consumed in food may lead to diarrhoea. Certain other side effects on consumption of activated charcoal could be dehydration, vomiting, stomach pain or swelling and black stool. In addition, there are no studies that show it is safe in paediatrics and geriatrics,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/abzo98/article30920543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTH--COFFEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/activated-charcoal-is-not-a-permitted-food-additive-say-chennai-food-safety-officials/article30920545.ece

Over the last two months, around 100 students from the Chennai Girls Higher Secondary School in Buddha Street, Korukkupet have interacted with a chef, fashion designer, a pilot, a motorwoman, women entrepreneurs, and a journalist among others.

These interactions were a part of a pilot role-modelling programme, to build a career mindset for young girls initiated by the Greater Chennai Corporation along with Engendered, an organisation working to improve labour force participation rates among women in the country.

“Focusing on the need for these young girls to be exposed to positive role models and influences, we conceived the program to look at education from the lens of employability.” said Prajakta Kuwalekar, co-founder, Engendered.

The programme has been designed to show students confidence, leadership and accomplishment in other women, which they then can envision within themselves.

“We started off with a baseline study to understand the personal background, interests and ambitions of the students. Following this, the students met with 12 women role models and interacted with them in spirited sessions which dealt with career opportunities, interests, goals and ambitions. Next year, we will extend the programme to young boys as well so that they can see working women as role models,” she explained.

Sanandha, a class 11 student of the school, the sessions with Madhulika Kapilavayi, founder of Margazhi Designs and Sruthi Vijayan, a professional photographer who also founded Meshca jewellery, were especially inspiring. “There were so many interesting career options that we now know a lot more about,” she said.

Madhulika Kapilavayi, who spoke to the students about how she started her brand and used the internet as a platform to grow, said that the students had asked her questions ranging from how they could identify a career path to parental pressure which often limited their options.

“There were a few girls who were interested in making jewellery, candles, and handicrafts and expressed a keen interest in learning how to build a platform to start home businesses in the future,” she said.

Among the other women role models the girls interacted with were Rohini Rau, an international sailing champion and doctor, R. Vandhana, Founder of WSquare, C.V. Thilakavathy, the first motorwoman on the Chennai Suburban line, Southern Railway and Sanjana Amrite, a pilot with SpiceJet Airlines.

P. Akash, Regional Deputy Corporation Commissioner (North) said that they had decided to introduce this programme in schools to expand the horizons of the students and enable them to break the glass ceiling.

“We are hoping to take this programme to five more schools over the next academic year. Through these interactions and exposure to women who are successful in varied fields, we want the girls to believe that no role or achievement is unattainable for them by virtue of their gender,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/o514di/article30920214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTH--Studentsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/women-careers-and-goals-in-focus-at-this-chennai-corporation-school/article30920215.ece
367,2020/02/26,"Soon, students to volunteer as guides at Chennai’s Egmore museum","The Museum administration is planning to provide internships to arts students and train them as student guides

Visitors to the Government Museum in Egmore might soon see student volunteers in colourful t-shirts, badges and caps, explaining about the various artefacts at the Museum, if a proposal of the Museum administration to provide internships to students of Arts courses takes concrete shape.

With school students already being brought to the Museum for educational tours and another plan to bring students from slum tenements to the Museum for such tours set to kick off on February 29, the Museum administration is now speaking to various colleges to provide internships to Arts students.

“We are planning to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with educational institutions and colleges to send students interested in the various departments at the Museum as volunteers. Science students go to IT companies for internships, for history students the museum will be their lab,” a senior official said.

According to the official, students who are interested will be given an internship for 10-15 days at the Museum. “We have different departments -- arts, history, botany biology, anthropology... Our curators will teach them practicals and then we will provide them with a cap, t-shirt, badges,” the official said.

These students who are trained by the curators will then interact with the school students who visit the Museum and explain to them about the various galleries and facets of the Museum. The official reasoned that since the age gap between the college students and the school students will be minimum, it would ease the interaction, would help them interact well and possibly make an impact on the schools students’ understanding of the museum.

A couple of colleges have already evinced interest, the official said adding that they were waiting for the examinations to be over before formalising the MoUs.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xrhxx4/article30919834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTH--MUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/soon-students-to-volunteer-as-guides-at-chennais-egmore-museum/article30919835.ece

370,2020/02/26,It is not a smooth ride for suburban commuters on Sundays,"Some areas have infrequent public transport services over the weekend, while others have none at all

Residents in the city suburbs have many public transport options — buses, small buses, suburban trains and the Metro — but when it comes to travelling on Sundays, the going is not so good.

Heading out on public transport systems over weekends has become either tiresome or costly for commuters because of the shortage of public transport facilities. On the highly populated Tambaram-Chennai Beach section, train commuters have to wait for more than 30 minutes for a train on Sundays, and when the train arrives, it is packed.

Regulars also complained about the absence of cross sectoral train services from Velachery to Avadi, Tiruvallur and Arakkonam, on Sundays.

Unlike the Metro

V. Rama Rao, an office bearer of the Traffic and Transport Forum, said while the Chennai Metro, in order to encourage patronage on Sunday, has been taking steps, including slashing the ticket price by 50% and operating more services on weekends, it hasn’t been the same with other public transport operators. Both the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) and the Southern Railway curtail their services on Sundays, leaving commuters inconvenienced. Commuters residing in the southern and western suburbs, including Vengaivasal, Mambakkam, Chitlapakkam, Nanganallur, Old Pallavaram, Thiruneermalai, Moulivakkam, Valasaravakkam, Nerkundram, and beyond Ambattur and Avadi, complain that they are forced to wait for at least 30 to 40 minutes to board a suburban train or bus to reach any destination in the city, or visit any tourist attraction. In few localities, residents find buses not being operated on Sundays at all.

Dependent on share autos

K.S. Kannan, a resident of Mugalivakkam, said that although the locality is situated only a few kilometres from Porur, the thickly-populated residential area suffers from poor services from public transport utilities. The situation is further exacerbated on Sundays when the residents find hardly any buses plying, against the few services that are operated on weekdays. With scanty public transport facilities available on Mugalivakkam Main Road, which links residents with Mount Poonamallee High Road, residents are forced to depend on ‘share autos’ that charge exorbitantly for a ride of a few kilometres, Mr. Kannan rued.

Residents complained of shortage of bus services, including M51V (Sholinganallur to T. Nagar via Vengaivasal), 51V (Kolathur to T. Nagar via Mambakkam), D51 (Ottiambakkam to Broadway via Medavakkam), B51 (Tambaram East to T. Nagar) and M18C (Keelkattalai to T. Nagar via Nanganallur), on Sundays. S. Raghunathan, a resident of Sowmya Nagar in Vengaivasal, said residents on Perumbakkam Main Road bound for the city have only one M51V bus service, which does not have adequate frequency even on weekdays. As a result, residents are forced to hire an autorickshaw to reach Medavakkam, as not even ‘share autos’ are available on Sundays, he complained.

A senior official of the MTC denied the commuters’ charge that only half of the 3,500-strong fleet of buses is operated on Sundays. He said that services of more than 2,200 buses were being operated on Sundays despite poor patronage on several routes, leading to revenue losses for the transport corporation.

The MRTS (Mass Rapid Transit System) has become a boon for several residential localities — their inhabitants can visit the Marina Beach and various temples along the route on Sundays. But commuters complained that the Southern Railway regularly halted train services for more than six hours citing maintenance work.

A senior Railway official said that, on Sundays, the number of trains operated on the Tambaram-Chennai Beach route was 200, against the weekday services of 226. On the MRTS, 96 trips were run on Sundays, as against the 140 services normally operated on weekdays.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ydwk3j/article30917480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUSCITYMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/it-is-not-a-smooth-ride-for-suburban-commuters-on-sundays/article30917481.ece
371,2020/02/26,Repatriates from Sri Lanka to get houses,"They currently live on poramboke land

As many as 70 poor and landless repatriates from Sri Lanka, living in the Panthalur-Gudalur belt of the Nilgiris district, will soon get a roof over their head. Currently, they are living on poramboke land with their families.

The State government has given its nod for the construction of houses with funding from REPCO Home Finance, which has volunteered to contribute ₹3 crore under a Corporate Social Responsibility initiative.

The houses will come up in the Karakolly habitation, the Cherankodu-2 village panchayat, the Panthalur taluk and the Gudalur panchayat union of the district. Each house will have a built-up area of 300 square feet. Each beneficiary will be given a patta (land document) for a plot of 1.5 to 2 cents.

Beneficiary-driven

An official of the Department of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non Resident Tamils said a beneficiary-driven model of construction will be adopted, even as the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj will carry out the work of building the houses .",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/repatriates-from-sri-lanka-to-get-houses/article30917475.ece
372,2020/02/26,Few options for those travelling at night,"Commuters in the city have come to depend more on taxi aggregators at night because of very limited bus services and the lack of train services on certain routes.

Except for a few services on the Tambaram-Chennai Beach route, and from the Moore Market complex suburban station to Avadi, commuters bound towards Velachery, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu don’t find much by way of train services beyond 10 p.m.

As for bus transport, the MTC operates very few buses, and then only on select routes linking important bus termini such as Koyambedu, Chennai Central and Tambaram.

P. Arunachalam, a resident of Guduvanchery, said beyond 9.30 p.m. on weekdays and particularly on Sundays, commuters have only three to four train services till midnight to Chengalpattu. And this forces commuters to depend on costly, long haul bus services to reach destinations beyond Tambaram.

On the MRTS section, commuters have been seeking extension of train services from Chennai Beach to Velachery beyond 10.30 p.m. till midnight, like that of the Chennai Beach-Tambaram section, where the services are available till 2 a.m.

But Railway officials, citing poor patronage, have not taken any steps to extend even one such train service. On Sundays, train services are stopped towards Velachery after 10 p.m.

A senior official of the Southern Railway said that on weekends, suburban trains on the Chengalpattu and Velachery section do not have good patronage, with most of the coaches running vacant. On Sundays, the occupancy rate in trains from Chennai Beach to Velachery falls drastically after 9 p.m.

A senior official of MTC said that around 150 buses are operated as Night Time Service, which cost over one-and-half times more than the normal ticket price.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/few-options-for-those-travelling-at-night/article30917449.ece
373,2020/02/26,Sahitya Akademi Award for translation goes to K.V. Jeyasri,"Award given for her translation of the Malayalam novel Nilam Poothu Malarnna Naal (The day the land bloomed and blossomed) into Tamil as Nilam Poothu Malarntha Naal.

K.V. Jeyasri, a Tamil teacher from Tiruvannamalai, has won the Sahitya Akademi Award 2019 for her translation of the Malayalam novel Nilam Poothu Malarnna Naal (The day the land bloomed and blossomed) into Tamil as Nilam Poothu Malarntha Naal.

The award includes a cash prize of ₹50,000 and a copper plaque.

The novel was written by Malayalam author Manoj Kuroor, and the translated version was published by Vamsi books. This is Ms. Jeyasri’s 12th translated work. “I deem the prize a recognition of my work, though I have never translated books with the objective of getting awards. I translate books which capture my passion,” said Ms. Jeyasri, whose parents are from Kerala and have settled in Thiruvananthapuram.

Ms. Jeyasri and her sister Shylaja learnt Malayalam from their mother, while the latter leant Tamil from them. “After my father died, she (Ms. Jeyasri’s mother) immersed herself in books, and we imbibed the habit from her,” Ms. Jeyasri said.

Nilam Poothu Malarntha Naal traces the history of Paari, one of the seven philanthropist Tamil chieftains, and also explores the socio-cultural history of the Tamil land, the wars among kings and the lives of singers, poets and those practising various other professions in the Sangam period.

Ms. Jeyasri is currently translating IAS officer K.V. Mohankumar’s novel Ushnarasi. “It is about the communist movement in Kerala and culminates in its capture of power in 1957,” she said.

Accolades pour in

Several leaders and political parties expressed their appreciation for Ms. Jeyasri.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami expressed his wishes on behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu to Ms. Jeyasri.

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam President M.K. Stalin too congratulated the writer and wished for her work in translation to continue and bring accolades. Paatali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S. Ramadoss lauded Ms. Jeyasri's achievement and wished for her literary journey to continue.

374,2020/02/26,Huge increase in cases of diabetes in rural T.N.,"One in three is affected or is in pre-diabetes stage, says diabetologist

In a span of 14 years, prevalence of diabetes in rural settings in Tamil Nadu has increased from 4.9% in 2006 to 13.5% now, a study has found. TREND, a rural diabetes project, that is covering 15,000 adults in 25 villages of Cheyyur taluk has put the prevalence at 13.5% (9.8% self-reported diabetics and 3.7% newly detected diabetics) and pre-diabetes at 18.2%.

In fact, 45% of them were overweight or obese, with a mean Body Mass Index of 25 kg/m2, according to V. Mohan, chairman and chief diabetologist, Dr. Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre and director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF).

MDRF and University of Dundee, Scotland, have taken up a joint research, of which TREND (Telemedicine Project for Screening Diabetes and its complications in rural TN) was a component. Citing the 2006 rural diabetes prevention project at Chunampet he said then the diabetes prevalence was 4.9% and pre-diabetes was 14.6%. This was followed by ICMR-India Diabetes study in 2011 that put the prevalence in rural Tamil Nadu at 7.8% and pre-diabetes at 15%.

The latest study has shown a huge increase in both diabetes and pre-diabetes, while obesity has also increased, he said. “One in three persons in rural TN has diabetes or is in the pre-diabetes stage. Why is there an increase in diabetes among the rural population? People are getting fatter and lack exercise. They are eating too much rice, with no vegetables or fruits,” he said.

“Next, we will be providing diabetic care. We are developing an application through which we can send messages on their mobile phones to keep track of their blood sugar levels,” he said.

As a part of India-Scotland Partnership for Precision Medicine in Diabetes project, the two institutions were capturing retinal images of these persons to explore the possibility of predicting the future risk of diabetic complications, heart diseases, stroke and dementia. Using a low-cost camera that was made in India, they were capturing retinal images and studying it using a special software - Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina, he said.

Colin NA Palmer, associate dean, research and chair of pharmacogenomics, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, said diabetes was quite different in the two countries. “Indians are much more susceptible to diabetes. The real problem is young persons getting type 2 diabetes whereas in Scotland, people do not get diabetes until the age of 60,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3tkivt/article30917402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th26diabetescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/huge-increase-in-cases-of-diabetes-in-rural-tn/article30917403.ece
375,2020/02/26,SpiceJet launches freighter service for shrimp farmers,"In an effort to help shrimp farmers, SpiceJet launched freighter services from Chennai and Vishakhapatnam to Surat and Kolkata.

The first flight took off from Chennai international airport carrying a consignment of produce to Vishakhapatnam and Surat. SpiceXpress, the air cargo arm of SpiceJet, will deploy its Boeing 737 freighter on these routes with an approximate carrying capacity of 21 tonnes. SpiceXpress will be the first to connect the aforesaid cities through a freighter route.

“Shrimp hatcheries face a lot of problems in transporting seeds in the absence of dedicated flights leading to a high mortality rate of shrimp seeds which in turn leads to heavy losses,” Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, said. He added, “Our freighter flights will provide the much-needed boost for shrimp farmers and go a long way in contributing to the government’s Krishi Udaan scheme.”

In India, the shrimp season starts mid-February and continues until mid-June. During this period, shrimp seeds are sent from major production centers such as Chennai, Pondicherry and Vishakhapatnam to West Bengal and Gujarat for further farming and breeding. The service will enhance logistics and connectivity of the shrimp farming industry.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/spicejet-launches-freighter-service-for-shrimp-farmers/article30917381.ece

377,2020/02/26,Tamil Nadu police to crack down on online pornography,"They will work with service providers to block sites

The Tamil Nadu police will write to internet service providers in the State, asking them to identify and block websites that provide free/paid access to adult/child pornography. Police have intensified action against at least 600 persons who were allegedly in possession of child pornography on their mobile phones and laptops for viewing and circulation.

Additional Director-General of Police (Crime against Women and Children) M. Ravi said though many service providers had blocked access to popular porn websites, it was still possible to view them on some lesser-known sites.

“The law is clear when it comes to child pornography. Section 67(B) of the Information Technology Act provides stringent punishment for publishing, browsing, transmitting child pornography in electronic form. We have observed that there is a clear link between pornography and sexual offences. In at least two rape and murder cases reported in Dindigul and Virudhunagar districts recently, the accused were habitually viewing porn sites and had downloaded scenes on their mobile phones,” he told The Hindu on Tuesday.

Habitual viewers

“If need be, we will work with the service providers in deploying algorithms to detect and delete such content. It would be easy to locate persons who are circulating child pornography. We have already identified 600 suspects, mostly in Chennai city and central zone, who have downloaded and circulated child porn material and alerted the respective city/district police. Another 80 persons who were habitually watching child porn have been identified now,” he said.

While regular information was coming in from Interpol and other central agencies on websites containing child sexual abuse material, people were providing police information about suspects who were habitually accessing or circulating such material. “We will ask the internet service providers to delete any form of obscene content, including adult porn,” Mr. Ravi said.

He said Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy reviewed the user-friendliness of Kavalan, an SOS app of the Tamil Nadu State Police Master Control Room initiative, which can be used to seek police assistance instantly in emergency situations such as physical exigencies, eve teasing, kidnapping or natural disasters such as floods, earthquake, etc. Digital awareness campaign was being organised to popularise the app, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/g2g5vo/article30917338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MRAVIADGPCRIME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-police-to-crack-down-on-online-pornography/article30917339.ece
378,2020/02/26,Expressway project revival to be expedited,"NHAI will soon call for fresh bids to resume work under revised alignment

Following identification of land for construction of houses for the Navy, the revival of the 20.2-km long Chennai Port-Maduravoyal Elevated Expressway is set to be fast-tracked.

A total of 64 houses are to be constructed in the parcel that is being provided by the Chennai Port Trust.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) requires Navy land for construction of the approach ramp for the elevated corridor that will connect the Chennai Port to Maduravoyal beyond Koyambedu on the road to Bangalore.

The ramp will come up near Napier Bridge, where Gate 10 of the port is located. Entry and exit ramps will be provided at five locations — two will be near Koyambedu, one each at Maduravoyal, Spurtank Road in Chetpet, and Sivananda Salai in Chepauk.

The ₹1,815-crore project, which began in 2010, was put on hold in 2012 following certain objections over its alignment. However, the NHAI changed the alignment and fresh bids will be called soon for resuming work. About 20% of the construction has been completed.

The State government has recently taken steps to remove 1,500 of the 1,700 encroachments that were along the alignment of the project.

Land requirement

“Our major worry was the land required for the project since that was one of the reasons why it could not be completed on time. We can take up construction of the houses along with the rest of the project,” an official source in the NHAI said.

The corridor would be wider now with six lanes in place of four lanes, as planned earlier. It would also be connected to the proposed Bangalore-Chennai Expressway by a 22-km long elevated road that will run along Poonamallee High Road from Sriperumbudur.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4j15rx/article30917328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THMADURAVOYAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/expressway-project-revival-to-be-expedited/article30917329.ece
379,2020/02/26,City wakes up to misty morning,"Dip in temperature led to the phenomenon: Met officials

Residents of several parts of Chennai woke up to a misty morning on Tuesday.

According to officials of the Meteorological Department, it is common for mist to occur in the early morning hours in winter. It is officially considered winter till end of February in Chennai.

N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai, said a layer of mist surrounded many parts of the city on Tuesday due to calm wind and high humidity level.

The dip in the temperature level in the early morning hours led to formation of mist. However, visibility was not affected as it had occurred at a lower level of atmosphere, he said.

On Tuesday morning, easterly wind started blowing only around 10 a.m. If there had been wind flow, such a misty cover would not have formed.

Dry weather is set to continue over the State for the next few days, he added.

The Meteorological Department has forecast that mist is likely to occur in some areas in the early morning hours for two days.

380,2020/02/26,How Delhi-based ‘vishing’ gang cheated hundreds in Tamil Nadu by speaking in Tamil,"They used Tamil as a trump card to lure gullible victims in the State.

Sitting in a lane in Delhi’s Vasanth Vihar, 2,200 km away from Tamil Nadu, a gang operating clandestinely swindled money from the accounts of hundreds of people by getting them to share the one-time password and bank details over phone.

Following a series of complaints received by the city police and elsewhere in the State, a special team was formed under Assistant Commissioner S. Prabakaran of the Anti-Bank Fraud Wing of the Central Crime Branch.

After scrutinising the complaints, electronic data and call records of the victims, the team zeroed in on the gang in Delhi’s R.K. Puram and adjacent Vasanth Vihar, where Tamils live predominantly.

With the help of the Delhi police, the special team mounted surveillance and nabbed three suspects in Vasanth Vihar and brought them to Chennai.

They have been identified as R. Dev Kumar, 22, of R.K. Puram; Wilson Mathew, 25; and R. Deepak Kumar, 21, of Vasanth Vihar. Dev Kumar was pursuing B. Com through correspondence, while the other two had completed SSLC. Wilson Mathew was working as a driver with the Italian Embassy, the police said.

Two others, reportedly the kingpins behind the scheme, Sivasakthi and Jayaraj, fled to neighbouring States.

Migrants from T.N.

They migrated from Krishnagiri and Salem to Delhi several years ago. The duo learnt the trick of vishing (voice phishing) in Delhi, while running a call centre. Police are on the lookout for them.

“The modus operandi is that the victim would be asked to share the one-time password (OTP) over phone by the fraudster posing as a bank official, claiming that their card had been blocked or by offering a prize on their mobile phone number or updating the Aadhaar number. They would speak in Tamil and claim to be from banks,” a senior police officer said.

The accused used Android phones for their operations. They would quickly transfer the money from the victim’s account to a mobile wallet. They would then switch off the mobile, ensuring that the victim could not trace them.

“The gang transferred the money to a particular mobile wallet and then they transferred it to a bank account. We traced them after trailing the money transaction. The gang’s prime targets were senior citizens in the State,” a senior officer said.

Every year, the Anti-Bank Fraud Wing of the city police receives 6,000 complaints of vishing or other frauds.

Now all complaints are actively pursued and consistent efforts are taken to trace the suspects in the cases, senior officers said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8o65cm/article30917301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTHFRAUDDELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/delhi-based-vishing-gang-held-for-cheating-hundreds-in-tamil-nadu/article30917302.ece
381,2020/02/26,"Rights, duties and the Constitution","It is only after a guarantee of the sum of all promised by the Constitution that citizens can be asked to do their duty

At the height of the Emergency, Indira Gandhi’s government enacted sweeping changes to the Constitution, through the 42nd Amendment. These changes were intended to entrench the supremacy of the government, permanently muzzle the courts, and weaken the constitutional system of checks and balances which was designed to avoid concentration and abuse of power. And in the Amendment’s Statement of Objects and Reasons, one line stands out: “... it is also proposed to specify the fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities.”

“Fundamental duties” and “anti-national activities” came into the world fused at the hip. And while Indira Gandhi’s Emergency regime has long been consigned to the dustbin of history, its legacies endure. “Anti-national” has become a boundlessly manipulable word, that, in the spirit of Humpty Dumpty, can mean whatever those in power want it to mean. “Fundamental duties” have been making a comeback as well: at an International Judicial Conference 2020 this weekend, the Chief Justice of India, S.A. Bobde, drew attention to the Constitution’s Fundamental Duties chapter. He then went further, and citing Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, observed that “real rights are a result of [the] performance of duty.”

There is, of course, an intuitive plausibility to the CJI’s words. They conjure up the image of the ungrateful and selfish citizen, happy to pluck the fruits of civilisation, but unwilling to do their bit to water the tree. Nonetheless, despite its plausibility, this conflation of rights and duties ought to be resisted.

Webs of duties

The first thing to note is that as citizens, there exists a wide range of duties that bind us in everyday life. These duties are owed both to the state, and to other individuals. We have a legal duty to pay our taxes, to refrain from committing violence against our fellow-citizens, and to follow other laws that Parliament has enacted. Breach of these legal duties triggers financial consequences (fines), or even time in jail. At any given time, therefore, we are already following a host of duties, which guide and constrain how we may behave. This is the price that must be paid for living in society, and it is a price that nobody, at least, in principle, objects to paying.

Our duties and the consequences we bear for failing to keep them therefore exist as a self-contained whole. They follow a simple logic: that peaceful co-existence requires a degree of self-sacrifice, and that if necessary, this must be enforced through the set of sanctions.

The logic of rights

Rights, on the other hand, follow a different logic entirely. This is a logic that is best understood through history. At the time of the framing of the Indian Constitution and its chapter on Fundamental Rights, there were two important concerns animating the Constituent Assembly. The first was that under the colonial regime, Indians had been treated as subjects. Their interests did not count, their voices were unheard, and in some cases — for example, the “Criminal Tribes” — they were treated as less than human. Apart from the long and brutal history of colonialism, the framers also had before them the recent example of the Holocaust, where the dignity of more than six million people had been stripped before their eventual genocide.

The first role of the fundamental rights chapter, therefore, was to stand as a bulwark against dehumanisation. Every human being no matter who they were or what they did had a claim to basic dignity and equality that no state could take away, no matter what the provocation. One did not have to successfully perform any duty, or meet a threshold of worthiness, to qualify as a rights bearer. It was simply what it meant to be human.

Second, the framers were also aware that they were inheriting a deeply stratified and riven society. The colonial regime had not been the only oppressor; the axes of gender, caste and religion had all served to keep masses of individuals in permanent conditions of subordination and degradation. The second role of rights, thus, was to stand against hierarchy. Through guarantees against forced labour, against “untouchability”, against discriminatory access to public spaces, and others, fundamental rights were meant to play an equalising and democratising role throughout society, and to protect individuals against the depredations visited on them by their fellow human-beings.

The twin principles of anti-dehumanisation and anti-hierarchy reveal the transformative purpose of the fundamental rights chapter: the recognition that true democracy could not exist without ensuring that at a basic level, the dignity and equality of individuals was protected, both from the state as well as from social majorities. It was only with these guarantees could an individual rise from the status of subject to that of citizen. And, as should be clear by now, it was only after that transformation had been wrought, that the question of duties could even arise.

This is not to suggest, of course, that duties are unimportant. As indicated above, duties exist in every sphere of society. Moreover, the language of duties can play an important role in a society that continues to be divided and unequal: in such a society, those who possess or benefit from entrenched structural and institutional power (starting with the state, and going downwards) certainly have a “duty” not to use that power to the detriment of those upon whom they wield it. That is precisely what the guarantees against “untouchability”, forced labour, and discriminatory access in the Constitution seek to accomplish.

Issue lies in conflation

The problem, however, lies in the conflation of rights and duties. As Samuel Moyn points out in an illuminating article in The Boston Review, “the rhetoric of duties has often been deployed euphemistically by those whose true purpose is a return to tradition won by limiting the rights of others”. Moyn’s target here are traditions that invoke the language of duty (often alongside terms such as “community” or “family”) in order to subordinate or efface the individual in the face of the collective (whether state or community). In that context, it is always critical to remember Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s words in the Constituent Assembly (which were also cited by the CJI in his speech): that the fundamental unit of the Constitution remains the individual.

If the position of the individual and the Constitution’s commitment to combating hierarchy is kept in mind, then the language of duties can be understood in its proper context. Without that, however, we risk going astray. A good example of this is a Supreme Court judgment from the early 1980s, which upheld the differential treatment of male and female flight attendants on the ground that women had a “duty” to ensure the “good upbringing of children” and to ensure the success of the “family planning program” for the country.

The judgment is a stark reminder that without the moral compass of rights and their place in the transformative Constitutional scheme the language of duties can lead to unpleasant consequences. It can end up entrenching existing power structures by placing the burden of “duties” upon those that are already vulnerable and marginalised. It is for this reason that, at the end of the day, the Constitution, a charter of liberation, is fundamentally about rights. It is only after guarantee to all the full sum of humanity, dignity, equality, and freedom promised by the Constitution, that we can ask of them to do their duty.

Perhaps, then, it is time to update Hind Swaraj for the constitutional age: “real duties are the result of the fulfillment of rights”.

383,2020/02/26,Judicial conduct,"The basic code of conduct for judges need not necessarily be extracted from judicial pronouncements (Editorial page, “The unassailable keywords for the judiciary”, February 25).

Public speaking is an art; non-controversial public speaking is a fine art. Judges must be aloof and reticent both on and off the dais since their job demands that. They must keep only their ears and eyes open. When there is a compelling need to speak, especially at gatherings, they should have a prepared mental blueprint of their speech from which they should not veer away from.

That being the case, what Justice Arun Mishra did was unpardonable as it has created an impression that the judiciary has become subservient to the executive. The absence of the the venerable Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer is felt more now.

V. Lakshmanan,

Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu

Judicial independence is central to our democracy. This cannot be over-emphasised at the time when cases involving constitutional interpretation are because the highest court of the land. Ideally, an independent judiciary must keep in check the excesses of the legislative and executive branches and safeguard our democracy. Justice Mishra’s lavish praise of the Prime Minister, and at a public forum, is unfortunate. Consequently, one cannot rule out the perception now about his judgments. In these turbulent times, an independent judiciary is the last ray of hope for the law-abiding citizen of India.

A. Venkatasubramanian,

Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu

A dangerous trend has emerged of late among political commentators — of a tendency to draw out a political scorecard of judges. This worrisome development involves judging the judges by scrutinising judgments and poring over observations of judges in public platforms to fit them into pro-establishment and anti-establishment labels. Justice Mishra’s indiscreet public praise of the Prime Minister evoked howls of protest and deep dismay, as if the entire judiciary has surrendered its independence to the government. Should a judge’s slip of the tongue that resulted in a public expression of a private thought provoke agonising hand wringing about the judiciary’s future? Are not Supreme Court judges instinctually and professionally trained to keep the political executive at an arm’s-length and assert their independence notwithstanding their occasional breaches of judicial etiquette? Why should Justice Deepak Gupta’s statement that dissenters are not anti-national evoke exhilaration as if the learned judge is implicitly castigating the government? It appears as a general defence of the right to dissent and has nothing to do with specific cases of sedition.

Let us trust our judges to act fearlessly and independently without mounting pressure on them to speak and act in particular ways to conform to preferred political visions. Nothing poses a greater danger to judicial independence and unity than the insidious exercise of judicial labelling and stereotyping.

At a time when men of clay abound as Governors and those who occupy exalted positions in the judiciary are setting their sails to the winds from the political establishment we cannot but admire Professor K.T.

384,2020/02/26,Trump in India,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India will be remembered for its extravagance. The personal chemistry between the host and the guest has been very evident; both leaders have taken care to make the other feel good. But the grand gala is conspicuous in its absence of substantial output. There has hardly been anything of significance about fighting terrorism too. The results of the mega-event have not matched its rhetoric.

Dr. D.V.G. Sankararao,

Nellimarla, Andhra Pradesh

The U.S. President Trump has said that in 70 years, India has become an economic giant and is one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world (Page 1, “Donald Trump calls Modi a ‘true friend’, lavishes praise on PM”, February 25). The foundation was laid by other leaders, especially by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, by dint of hard work. Mr. Trump found no time to mention his name even once. But praise was heaped on our current leader. Equally jarring was Mr. Trump not mentioning Mahatma Gandhi’s name even in the visitors’ book at Sabarmati ashram. It is ironic that Mr. Trump could recall the film ‘Sholay’, Shah Rukh Khan, Virat Kohli but not Nehru or Gandhiji.

V.N. Gopal,

Chennai

The Trump-Modi bonhomie is understandable but whether the much-professed friendship would help the cause of India is doubtful. There is no guarantee that the U.S. would not, in future, sell its “most feared” weapons (Inside pages, February 25) to Pakistan too, as the U.S. is known to foster only its business and strategic interests first over and above anything else. In as much the same way, the fact that most CEOs of American MNCs, are or were, Indians or of Indian origin, is of no comfort to India as they cannot afford to be India-centric in their business overreach.

Sivamani Vasudevan,

Chennai

I write to point out the issue of translation in connection with the Trump visit. North Indian bureaus of the daily seem to be extremely comfortable in harbouring the popular myth that all Indians know and speak the Hindi language. In reporting Mr. Trump’s tweet in Hindi, the tweet has been reproduced in its entirety without an English translation. One expects sensitivity towards the non-Hindi speakers in this country. Yours in extreme exasperation.

Arjun Cherian Kovoor,

Kottayam, Kerala

President Trump’s visit to India has run into a problem with names: specifically those of the two great cricket players, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, whose names he completely mispronounced. There are many names in the world that are difficult to pronounce but not these two, and surely Mr. Trump would have heard their names before and how to pronounce them. If a name is difficult then a pre-apology, ‘I’m not sure if I am going to pronounce this correctly’, would be a good option. Since it was obvious that he was reading the names syllable by syllable he should have apologised later. Had an Indian politician introduced the American leader with the gross mispronunciation of his name ‘Trump’, there would have been a diplomatic incident! I wait to hear his apology.

385,2020/02/26,Jeremy - The Grub Pub tries to be a “global kitchen”,"Familiar favourites that don’t require too much thought or effort — for the diner that is!

Nestled in a quiet building further along the glittering lights and shiny glass-fronted buildings that make up Gurugram’s Golf Course Road, is Jeremy-The Grub Pub. It replaces Biker’s Café, a long-time Gurgaon watering hole. Who is Jeremy? you may ask. It’s a bit of a conceit really, created by the owners who remain the same. Jeremy is an entirely fictitious, supposedly globe-trotting, worldly-wise savant who’s been everywhere and done everything and this glammed up, grown-up version of its previous avatar, his play-ground.

The Vibe: While the leather couches and baroque lights may be an appropriate setting for a modern-day Gatsby, the huge bas relief cowboy — complete with steed — that appears to be propping up one end of the retro art deco style bar, left me a bit confused. A large installation of a generic airport lounge complete with random travellers, dominates one end of the restaurant. The idea I guess, is to take the travel-theme forward. Instead it ends up a wee bit tacky. Also the multiple TV screens running what could pass for a hotel in-house promotion campaign in loop, proved an irritating distraction.

Do try: The menu is extensive, showcasing what the promoters call a “global kitchen”, so there’s a nod to every continent, with plenty on offer to vegetarians. Like the eponymous, peripatetic Jeremy, we too, decided to globetrot, ordering across the menu. For mains, the Norwegian Salmon Teriyaki proved to be a fairly generous plate, with a perfectly cooked, flaky, moist filet of fish accompanied with buttery mashed potatoes and greens. On the other hand, the Spanish-style Gambas Pili Pili, (piri piri prawns to you and me), while good, was more a tapas-sized serve, since the only side was some garlic toast. The Tipsy Vegetarian Delight pizza sounded intriguing, as the menu promised a flambé at the table with Old Monk rum. I’m not sure that the dash of booze was an improvement to an otherwise quite nice pizza, but it did provide some supper theatre! The standout surprisingly was the Jeremy Special Daal Makhani — an intensely smoky version; elevated by the use of dhungaar, a traditional Rajasthani method of smoking food with a live coal, aromats and ghee.

Asparagus, silken tofu and shiitake dimsum | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Skip: On the whole while nothing is objectionable, it is a menu that aims to be all things to all people. There’s the same sense of slight confusion suggested by the décor. We ordered the highly recommended Asparagus, silken tofu and shiitake dimsum. Anticipating a delicate dumpling skin barely concealing soft brown mushroom punctuated by vibrant pops of green, what arrived was a turquoise terror! Of course, this is a pet personal peeve as I find the mindless addition of colouring to food particularly annoying. Again a hint of the confusion: Gimmick or glamour? You decide.

Go with: Most tables were occupied by the after-office crowd catching a drink before heading home, or millenials living close by. The loud music prevents any meaningful conversation, so Jeremy’s is NOT where you’d go on a romantic date. Every table has a speaker close by, so there are no quiet nooks (we asked!). And lastly, be prepared to stay at least three hours—main courses arrived one at a time with an average wait of 30-35 minutes per dish—even on a night with only four or five occupied tables

Space bar: 150 covers, both inside as well as in the large outdoor seating area. Children under 12 are not allowed after 6 p.m., but are welcome all day on Sundays. Pet lovers will have to leave their pooches at home.

How much? A meal for two approximately, ₹1,800, without taxes or alcohol. Since this is essentially a bar, boasting of its own in-house craft beers and extensive gin and cocktail menu, be prepared to spend much more if you intend to tipple.

Reach: A three-minute walk from Sector 53-54 stop on the Rapid Metro. If you intend to drive, there’s sufficient parking in the premises since the building houses mostly offices that are long shut after dark.

386,2020/02/26,Stop looking through prism of religion: Sanjay,"Filmmaker urges government to stop use of ‘minorities’ as it comes with different meaning

Actor-filmmaker Sanjay Khan has urged all Indians not to look at each other through the “narrow prism of religion”, and urged the government to stop use of the word ‘minorities’.

Mr. Khan was speaking on Monday while unveiling his new book Assalamualaikum Watan, which traces the role of Muslims in shaping India’s heritage and encourages Indian Muslims to join the mainstream. The book was launched by Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Medical Education and Culture Minister Amit Deshmukh.

Through his book, Mr. Khan urged Indians to “stop looking at each other from the narrow prism of religion”. He also urged the government to “banish the word ‘minorities’, as it comes with a different meaning”.

Calling his book an honest attempt to answer some quintessential questions which have remained overlooked over the years, the author said Muslims in India today represent a population of 172 million.

“As Indian Muslims, we must feel tremendous pride, a sense of empowerment and responsibility in this fact, because we serve as a trajectory to the compass of achievement for all Muslims in the world,” said Mr. Khan, who is known for his roles in films like Dosti, Ek Phool Do Mali, and Mela.

“We are not immigrants in our motherland; we are the sons and daughters of the soil. It’s time my fellow brothers and sisters reclaimed that spirit of the soil,” the actor said. He said Muslim women should be encouraged to engage themselves shoulder to shoulder with men to keep their equality and share of education and positions.

The veteran actor, who directed and starred in the TV drama series The Sword of Tipu Sultan, said he had done considerable research and unearthed a compelling dossier on the advent of Muslims in India.

According to Mr. Khan, his book gives sufficient weightage to the role played by the community in nation-building, be it in architecture, art, science, music, technology or simply governance. “At first an Indian, then an author and last a Muslim,” Mr. Khan said, adding he implores that all Indians see minorities as ‘Indians’ and forget every other new-age tag.

Anil Deshmukh said Mr. Khan has taken the ideology of a secular India ahead. “We are all aware of the contribution of Muslims to the development and overall shaping of the country. Hindus and Muslims have been residing in peace and harmony.”

He also said, “But many attempts are being made to create a rift between the two religions, but fail to succeed each time. I hope the book encourages Muslims of the country to empower themselves.” He urged Amit Deshmukh to turn Mr. Khan’s dream of having a grand film made on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj into a reality.

Amit Deshmukh said, “I feel the country is currently going through an unfortunate phase and an Indian like me would have been happy if it were not true.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tjmall/article30919166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMSANJAYKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/stop-looking-through-prism-of-religion-sanjay/article30919167.ece

389,2020/02/26,"Consider revamp of your panel of lawyers, High Court tells SRA","Are you not interested in getting the cases represented properly, asks Bench

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday called for reconstitution of the panel of lawyers who represents the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), noting that its lawyers often can not assist the court properly.

The court was hearing a petition about a project undertaken by construction groups HDIL and RKW Developers. RKW Developers is owned by Dheeraj Wadhawan from the Wadhawan family which also owns the beleaguered HDIL.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawala and R.I. Chagla was hearing a petition filed by Cyril Mecwan claiming there were irregularities in the slum rehabilitation project undertaken by RKW Developers in Bandra.

During the hearing on Monday, the Bench had asked the SRA — a State authority for rehabilitation of slum dwellers — for some details.

The SRA lawyer and its officer present in the court could not give a satisfactory reply. The Bench then directed SRA CEO Deepak Kapoor to remain present.

On Tuesday, the court told Mr. Kapoor that in several matters the SRA’s lawyers and even its officers could not assist the court. “At the end, your organisation is suffering. Are you not interested in getting the cases represented properly? You have to consider reconstituting the panel of advocates,” Justice Kathawala said.

As per the plea, while RKW Developers were constructing resale component (the part which the developer can sell off in open market) of the project, HDIL was to construct the rehabilitation building for the original tenants (slum dwellers).

In October 2018, the SRA issued stop-work notice over alleged violation of project terms. Mecwan sought a direction to the SRA and HDIL to complete the construction of the rehabilitation building, stating that the project had started in 2006 and since then the original tenants were staying in transit homes.

Senior counsel Prasad Dhakepalkar, appearing for RKW Developers, said as HDIL was in liquidation, RKW Developers would file a proposal before the SRA, seeking permission to complete the rehabilitation building.

The Bench then directed the SRA CEO to consider RKW Developers’ proposal on merit, and adjourned the hearing for four weeks.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h8tza2/article30919110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/consider-revamp-of-your-panel-of-lawyers-high-court-tells-sra/article30919111.ece

“A summons to this effect will be issued,” he said, adding that Mr. Pawar is likely to be summoned during the last phase of the hearing.

Earlier this month, the Shiv Sena-led State government had given the “final” extension to the commission till April 8 and asked it to submit its report.

391,2020/02/26,An enduring friendship wrapped in caste,"Krishna’s book explores bond between Brahmin musician, Dalit instrument maker

Caste is an inescapable element of life and discrimination is inherent in human nature. In ‘Sebastian & Sons: A Brief History of Mrdangam Makers’, Carnatic vocalist, writer, activist and author T.M. Krishna explores the complex yet beautiful relationship between a Brahmin mrdangam player, Mani Iyer and its maker, Parlandu Fernandez, who belonged to a Christian Dalit family.

At the launch of the book in Mumbai on Monday, Mr. Krishna, in conversation with journalist Sumana Ramanan, discussed several socially sensitive issues wrapped in the making of a mrdangam. “Depending on where you are, in terms of privilege and several other things, you choose to either have the conversation on it (caste) or not,” he said.

Mr. Krishna discussed how caste played a role in the friendship between Mani Iyer and Parlandu, without whom, the mrdangam player could never have produced the sound he wanted. Though Iyer’s affection for Parlandu was vivid from the fact that he often gave away gifts that he got from concerts to Fernandez, it was still a hidden friendship.

In his book, Mr. Krishna touches upon the events that occasionally led to Fernandez’s emotional outbursts. Fernandez, he said, realised his uniqueness in a setting where rights for his community were absent but also relished his association with the upper caste, which created internal turmoil till the end of his life.

The author spoke about three-and-a-half years of research and the interviews he conducted with mrdangam makers and players. The book talks about the contribution mrdangam makers make to the art form though most credit is given to the musicians who eventually play it. “The whole aspect of solo becoming such an important aspect is inspired from the Carnatic tradition,” he said.

The ‘most grievous ordeal’ he faced while writing the book was to decide what the story was going to be about since there were so many threads involved in every aesthetic of the making of the instrument.

On the role of women in the making of the mrdangam, the author and musician said, “It’s ‘Sebastian and Sons’ which gives it away. The makers will tell you how the job is physically strenuous and women cannot do it, which according to me is rubbish. There is a stone used in the making of the mrdangam, which is procured from different places. The stone is heavy and hard and women do the breaking and crushing of it. Women are not the primary makers but when the skin of a cow, buffalo comes home they have to dry it and cut it in circles.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jke5kh/article30917664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMTMKRISHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/an-enduring-friendship-wrapped-in-caste/article30917661.ece
392,2020/02/26,"RS polls: MVA to get four seats, three expected to go BJP’s way","NCP confirms it will renominate party chief Sharad Pawar

Ahead of the election for seven Rajya Sabha seats in the State on March 26, the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is expected to bag four seats, while the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to get three.

The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the poll schedule as the term of office of 55 members of the Rajya Sabha elected from 17 States is set to expire on their retirement on April 2020. Of the 55, Maharashtra has seven, the most number of MPs.

Those who will be retiring are Hussain Dalwai from Congress; Amar Sable, Sanjay Kakde and Ramdas Athawale from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sharad Pawar and Majid Memon from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and Rajkumar Dhoot from the Shiv Sena. The quota to elect one Rajya Sabha MP is 37 MLAs.

According to existing party positions in the Assembly, the MVA government has the support of 169 MLAs, while the BJP with 105 MLAs claim to have the support of more than six Independents. “In case both sides decide not to pitch the eighth candidate, the Rajya Sabha poll will happen unopposed. But if the MVA decides to put a fifth candidate, there will be an election,” said a senior official in the Assembly. The election is held openly with issuance of a whip to prevent horse-trading.

As of now, the NCP has confirmed that it will renominate Mr. Pawar and has sought the second seat for the MVA. Neither the Congress nor the Sena has announced their respective candidates. Senior NCP leader Nawab Malik said the decision on second candidate will be made soon.

393,2020/02/26,Make public probe into land deals: Chavan,"Allegations of purchases along Samruddhi Corridor before land acquisition notification

During the budget session on Tuesday, senior Congress leader and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan demanded that the government make public the Lokayukta’s report on its probe into land deals made before the notification for land acquisition was issued for the Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Corridor project.

Raising the query during the question hour, Mr. Chavan said former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced in the Assembly that an inquiry would be launched into allegations of bureaucrats and politicians purchasing land parcels along the highway’s alignment before the notification was issued and later selling them to earn profit.

Mr. Chavan said, “Land was systematically purchased before the notification was issued by people who knew about the project and the alignment of the road. The land became extremely costly and was sold for huge profits. The ex-CM had announced an inquiry would be conducted. The report on it should be tabled.”

In his reply, Eknath Shinde, Minister in charge of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, which is executing the project, said the Lokayukta found the allegations baseless. “The additional chief secretary of the Home Department was informed about it through a letter dated March 9, 2018,” he said.

Mr. Chavan, however, sought the details of the inquiry. “We would like to know which land transactions were probed. Whether before the notification was issued or after. Probing land deals after the notification was issued holds no importance. The government must table the report,” he said.

Mr. Shinde could not answer the query owing to sloganeering by Bharatiya Janata Party members. Speaker Nana Patole then adjourned the House, putting an end to the question hour.

Later, addressing reporters, Mr. Chavan said, “Fadnavis had announced this inquiry. If there have been land dealings then it should be made public.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rkcayl/article30917642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMPRITHVIRAJCHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/make-public-probe-into-land-deals-chavan/article30917643.ece
394,2020/02/26,HC asks NIA reasons for delay in 2008 Malegaon blasts trial,"No effective progress, says Bench; next hearing on March 16

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to explain the reasons for delay in the trial in the 2008 Malegaon blasts that had killed six people and injured 101. Bharatiya Janata Party MP Pragya Singh Thakur is an accused in the case.

A Division Bench of Acting Chief Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice N.R. Borkar was hearing an appeal filed by accused Sameer Kulkarni, who complained about how the agency and some of the other accused were delaying the trial.

Mr. Kulkarni, who appeared in person, informed the court that in October 2018, the High Court had ordered the special NIA court to expedite the trial. However, in the last six months, only 14 witnesses have been examined, he said. As per a direction from another Division Bench, the NIA had to submit reports in sealed covers of who was not cooperating in the trial. After perusing the reports on Tuesday, the HC said, “Prima facie we find that there has not been any effective progress in the trial as of now.”

The Bench directed the agency to explain the adjournments and also state by when it would complete the trial. The matter will now be heard on March 16.

Mr. Kulkarni had previously told the HC that witnesses, whose names were not truncated, had not been examined which was further delaying the trial.

On October 30, 2018, the special NIA court had framed charges of murder, abetment, and conspiracy for the blasts against Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, Ms. Thakur, Mr. Kulkarni, retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Ajay Rahilkar, and Sudhakar Chaturvedi. All the accused allegedly conspired from January 2008 to plant bombs on September 29.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/zcnuxf/article30917648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMPRAGYASINGHTHAKUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-asks-nia-reasons-for-delay-in-2008-malegaon-blasts-trial/article30917639.ece

The Opposition has been criticising the Maha Vikas Aghadi government following several incidents of violence against women in the State.

The committee headed by Aswati Dorje, chairman of Maharashtra Police Academy, includes Niyati Thakker Dave, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone V); V.M.

396,2020/02/26,Bill on indirect polls to elect sarpanch passed,"Governor refused to sign ordinance scrapping rule introduced by previous govt.

Days after Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari refused to sign an ordinance scrapping direct election for the post of sarpanch, the Assembly on Tuesday passed a Bill to pave the way to hold indirect polls in 1,570 grampanchayats in 19 districts on March 29.

Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif said the State Election Commission (SEC) would be informed that the government has passed a Bill according to which the grampanchayat elections can be held.

With Mr. Koshyari declining to sign the ordinance, the polls would have seen the sarpanch being elected directly by the people and not by the elected grampanchayat members. The Bill now reverses the previous Devendra Fadnavis government’s decision on July 3, 2017, to amend clauses of the Maharashtra Gram Panchayat Act of 1958 to facilitate election of the sarpanch directly by the people.

Both Houses clear Bill

The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, which had opposed the move then, have changed the rule after coming to power. Earlier, Mr. Koshyari did not sign the ordinance and said a Bill to the effect can be passed in the budget session. Accordingly, the Bill was passed in both Houses on Tuesday.

According to sources, even though the announcement of the grampanchayat elections has been made, the notification has not been issued. Therefore, the newly passed Bill can be implemented, scrapping the system of direct election of the sarpanch in villages.

Mr. Mushrif said India is a parliamentary democracy and the sarpanch has to be chosen by the elected panchayat representatives. “There have been instances where the sarpanch and other members belong to different groups or parties, leading to conflict and stopping of developmental work in the village,” he said.

BJP leaders meet Governor

Meanwhile, members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposed the Bill and criticised the government for clearing it amid sloganeering in both Houses. A delegation of BJP leaders met Mr. Koshyari on Tuesday evening and informed him about their displeasure at the passing of the Bill.

“We will inform the SEC that the election for the post of sarpanch should be through the indirect method. This means elected members will choose a sarpanch from among themselves,” Mr. Mushrif said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bill-on-indirect-polls-to-elect-sarpanch-passed/article30917622.ece
397,2020/02/26,"No NRC-NPR in State, say women, queer collectives, demand assurance from CM","‘NPR will have serious implications for sex workers, tribals, domestic help, trans persons, orphans, slum dwellers’

More than 22 collectives of women, queer and trans persons appealed to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray not to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) in Maharashtra.

They demanded an assurance from the Chief Minister in the ongoing Assembly session. Calling the NPR the first step to NRC, the collectives said “the NPR will have serious and grave implications for women, queer and trans persons and define newer forms of disenfranchisement.”

The members of the collective, who congregated in Mumbai on Tuesday from various parts of the country, represented groups like Adivasis, sex workers, transgender communities, slum dwellers, domestic and unorganised sector workers, Muslim and Christian women, and children living on the streets.

Sujata Gothoskar of the Forum Against Oppression of Women (FAOW), Mumbai, said women will be the most affected by the NRC. “The fact that 69% of the people lacking papers for citizenship in Assam are women is not a coincidence,” said Ms. Gothoskar. She attributed the reason to early and child marriages, which lead to a relocation of women without adequate documents, lack of education, missing birth certificates in rural areas, and no mention in property documents like homes and agricultural land.

Chayanika Shah of LABIA – A Queer Feminist LBT Collective, pointed out that the NRC and NPR will affect orphans and children of single parents, especially those with single mothers. “These children will face immense difficulty in proving their lineage because the whole NPR process is patrilineal,” said Ms. Shah.

The lack of adequate documentation will affect the transgender and queer community as well, said Poushali Basak of Sappho for Equality, Kolkata, and FAOW. She said the Rights of Transgender Persons Act, 2019, has been rejected by the transgender community, which was not consulted in the process of drafting the Act.

“The NRC and NPR add to the problem, where most trans people have mismatched documents between birth certificates and their present-day self-identified name and gender. Many queer and trans people have also left their families, who do not accept them,” said Ms. Basak.

The lack of contact with families is also widely seen among sex workers, said Kiran, a sex worker from Veshya Anyay Mukti Parishad, Sangli. “Our families will never give us the documents if we go back home to ask them, and many migrate from far-off States for work without papers,” said Ms. Kiran. She said children of sex workers seldom have their fathers’ names on their documents, making them vulnerable targets.

The collectives argued that the NRC and NPR could also lead to a breach of privacy, and “with no regulatory body in charge, can create havoc in the everyday lives of citizens, exposing them to various frauds and danger to personal safety.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/efyxhc/article30917612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMFORUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-nrc-npr-in-state-say-women-queer-collectives-demand-assurance-from-cm/article30917613.ece
398,2020/02/26,Marine Drive protesters booked,"Police identify 10 people, working on finding others

The police on Tuesday registered an FIR against the protesters who had gathered at Marine Drive on Monday night in solidarity with victims of the violence in Delhi.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) Sangramsinh Nishandar said the protesters have been charged with unlawful assembly under the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Police Act. “We have identified 10 protesters and are working on identifying the others. No arrests have been made or summonses issued at this point,” he said.

At least 10 people were confirmed dead by Tuesday evening in the violence against those protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register in Delhi since Monday.

On Monday, a group of Mumbai residents had decided to hold a silent candlelight vigil at Gateway Of India from 10 p.m. to midnight. However, the Colaba police barricaded all the roads leading to the venue, after which they relocated to Marine Drive.

Around 11.30 p.m., the police started asking the protesters to disperse. “By this time, they had been conducting the protest without permission for a good 30 minutes and were attracting attention, due to which the crowd was swelling in size. When they did not move despite repeated requests, we had to disperse them physically,” an officer with the Marine Drive police said.

399,2020/02/26,Content on Demand service to begin on Mumbai local AC trains,"Passengers on 3 long-distance trains too can soon stream TV shows, films

Passengers of three premium long-distance passenger trains and an air conditioned (AC) local service will soon have high-quality buffer-free streaming of popular movies and TV shows. The four trains have been selected for the pilot of the content on demand (CoD) service on board trains of the Indian Railways. The service will be rolled out on the two Rajdhani trains, the AC local of Western Railway (WR) and the Chennai Express of Central Railway (CR).

The contract for the service was awarded by RailTel in January to M/s Margo Network, a subsidiary of Zee Entertainment, which goes by the brand name Sugarbox Networks. The project will be implemented in two years and the provision of content such as movies, TV shows, educational programmes will be made available in paid and unpaid formats in a 10-year contract, which includes the first two years of implementation.

Rohit Paranjpe, CEO and co-founder, SugarBox Networks, said commuters and passengers will be able to access apps on their phone through the SugarBox app, which will act as a window and can be downloaded for free. “Consumers at no point will be paying anything to SugarBox. The content on various platforms that is free will continue to remain free,” he said, adding that they will be integrating the existing apps for not only online content but also services such as ride-hailing apps. Mr. Paranjpe said the four trains were chosen as they had to roll out the service in three different rake types in the Railways for the pilot: suburban rake, premium outstation coaches and regular coaches. “The pilot is being conducted on 10 rakes, which have been selected for the trains. The trains will be fitted with on-board media servers, which will be preloaded with content that can only be accessed through a mobile application,” a senior railway official said.

Ravinder Bhakar, Chief Public Relations Officer, WR, said, “We are looking forward to the service to start on our premium trains and provide our passengers with the option of on-board entertainment. We are expecting the service to start next month.”

The first ever air-conditioned suburban local train parked at Kurla car shed in Mumbai. Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, has built the train at the cost of ₹54 crores. With a capacity to ferry 5,964 passengers, the AC train can can run at a speed of 110 kmph. The train is equipped with Talk Back Facility at each doorway, which will enable passengers to communicate with the locopilot in case of emergency. Unlike the regular EMU trains, these come with vestibule compartments. So a commuter can walk across the coaches. The train does not have a separate first-class compartment, but two coaches have been reserved for women. The view of mortorman cabin, which is also air-conditioned. Though the train was delivered last year, the date of roll out is yet to be announced.

Out of the 10 rakes, five belong to the two Rajdhanis departing from Mumbai Central: the Mumbai-New Delhi Rajdhani Express and the August Kranti Rajdhani Express. Four rakes belong to Chennai Express, which runs from Dadar Terminus to Chennai Egmore.

The service will cover nearly 8,731 trains, including 3,003 trains (premium, mail and express, to and fro) across India, and 2,864 pairs of suburban trains.

400,2020/02/26,Pawar to push State for land allotted to Lalit Kala Akademi,"Akademi requests 5.2 acres near Aarey colony

Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said he would urge the State government to provide the land allotted to the Lalit Kala Akademi so it can expand its reach and create more artists to keep traditions alive.

Mr. Pawar was speaking at the inauguration of the 128th edition of the All India Annual Art Exhibition where artist Kashinath Salve was felicitated with the Roopdhar Lifetime Achievement Samman. Mr. Salve was conferred with the 15th edition of the Roopdhar Lifetime Achievement Award. The Governor of Maharashtra Award and gold medal was conferred on Dhruti Mahajan from Akola for her acrylic painting on canvas.

Uttam Pacharne, chairman, Lalit Kala Akademi, said western India needs a regional centre of the Akadami. “A tribal art camp in Dahanu last week had to be organised by the Chennai centre due to the lack of a centre in western India. Artists of Maharashtra can benefit more if the government allots land for the regional centre of Lalit Kala Akademi,” he said.

Mr. Pacharne also requested Mr. Pawar to help the Akademi in availing of 5.2 acres near Aarey colony. Land in the area was allotted by Pawar’s government in the early 1990s. However, as it remained unused, a subsequent government allotted it to another party, which has since constructed a building as well as other facilities on it.

Lalit Kala Akademi, however, went to the Supreme Court, which ordered the land to be returned to the Akademi. Mr. Pacharne said the Akademi would be content with land available in the vicinity.

At least 250 art works are on display at the exhibition at the Jehangir Art Gallery, which is on till March 2. The organisers shortlisted them from over 2,000 entries received from across the country. Forty artists were awarded in the categories of paintings, sculptures, graphics and photography.

Rajendra Patil, President, Bombay Art Society, an artists’ group, said the Governor of Maharashtra Award was raised to ₹50,000 this year from ₹25,000.

“Earlier, we had to write to the governor to increase the award amount as time goes by. But this year, the governor has doubled the amount himself. This shows the government’s interest in the field of art, which encourages artists,” Mr. Patil said.

“We have witnessed the Bombay Art Society growing from strength to strength. It is heartening to see an organisation working diligently and making sure that artists and their talent are recognised and due credit is given to them. I have been fortunate to help Bombay Art Society when I was the chief minister of the State. I am proud of the artists and sculptors who are striving to keep these art forms alive,” Mr. Pawar said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/enw4xi/article30917630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMSHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pawar-to-push-state-for-land-allotted-to-lalit-kala-akademi/article30917549.ece
401,2020/02/26,Taloja family deaths: police to now check medical history,"With no leads on the deaths of the family of four whose decomposed bodies were found in their flat in Taloja on February 22, the police plan to look into their medical history.

According to the police, Nitesh Upadhyay (35), had killed his wife, Babli (30), and their daughter and son, eight and seven years old respectively, before committing suicide sometime in the first week of January. The bodies were found when their landlord, Rajesh Bharadwaj, opened the flat as the rent was unpaid for two months.

“There were two suicide notes, but neither mentioned the reason for the step. We called on a phone number found on some papers in the flat, which turned out to belong to Upadhyay’s brother.

Babli’s sister’s husband also turned up at Taloja police station, and had the same story to tell.

The police have now decided to look into the medical history of the deceased. “To test them for ailments, blood is required, and the bodies are completely decomposed. We have not found any medical files in the house either. We will have to rely on forensic tests. The post-mortem reports are also awaited,” Mr. Dudhe said.

402,2020/02/26,Three arrested for gang rape of 19-year-old woman,"Victim got separated from family while boarding train, was seeking help to get back home

The Rabale MIDC police have arrested three youths for allegedly gang-raping a 19-year-old woman who asked them for help to find the nearest railway station.

The woman, who lives in Mumbra, got separated from her family members while boarding a crowded train at Kurla station on February 18. The family reported her missing to the Kurla railway police. The woman and the family sold ghee and utensils door to door. She got married just two months ago and is new to Mumbai, and so is not well-versed with train routes.

She managed to reach Mumbra station, but unable to find her family members, spent the night there. The next day, she reached Diva station. Since she had no money, she approached an elderly woman beggar and said she wanted to sell her nose pin for some cash. The woman took her near her hutment in Mahape, but she found no customer for the nose pin.

The victim left the place and approached an autorickshaw driver near Sai Sagar hotel chowk around 8.30 p.m. and requested him to drop her to the nearest railway station. “She narrated her ordeal and said she wanted to go to Nashik to her family. The man drove around for close to an hour,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I, Pankaj Dahane said.

According to the police, the accused was probably searching for an isolated location. He took her to a dilapidated building in Mahape Bus Depot and raped her in the bathroom. The 21-year-old stole her gold earrings, nose pin and silver anklets and abandoned her near Ram Mandir.

“The woman walked around in search of help and noticed two youths on a two-wheeler. “She told them what had happened and asked them to take her to the nearest railway station. The youths, 19 and 20 years old, made her sit between them on the two-wheeler and stopped 300 metres away from Ghansoli station, near a pipeline. They took turns to rape her and then fled,” senior police inspector Nitin Gite from Rabale MIDC police station said.

The victim managed to reach Ghansoli station and travelled to Thane, from where she took a train to Nashik. She reached her uncle’s house and told him what had happened. Her uncle knew of the missing person complaint, and so took her to the Kurla railway police to file a case of gang rape. The case was transferred to the Rabale MIDC police station on Saturday.

“The victim was able to give us a description of the accused and the vehicles they used. We suspected they lived around Mahape, and traced the vehicles first and then the accused, and arrested them on Sunday. The vehicles were seized and the stolen jewellery recovered,” Assistant Commissioner of Police, Vashi division, Vinayak Vast said.

The youths have been arrested under sections of gang rape and robbery and have been remanded in police custody till February 29. Since the identification parade of the accused is yet to be completed, the police did not disclose their identities.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sbirot/article30917515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26bmRabale,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/three-arrested-for-gang-rape-of-19-year-old-woman/article30917516.ece

Mumbai has recorded eight confirmed cases of H1N1 this month. While an increasing number of cases of the disease has been reported from other cities, officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) say that there is no cause for concern in the city.

“We have recorded eight cases and no death has been reported so far,” BMC’s executive health officer, Dr. Padmaja Keskar, said.

H1N1 is a respiratory disease caused by type-A influenza virus. It is an airborne infection. Doctors in the private sector too have noticed a slight spurt. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Om Shrivastav said that he has seen about 12 to 15 positive H1N1 cases this month. “All these patients are from out of Mumbai,” Dr. Shrivastav said, adding that none of his patients have required hospitalisation. According to Dr. Shrivastav, due to the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) scare, more number of people are coming forward for testing as well.

404,2020/02/26,"BJP stages protests inside, outside Assembly","‘Government not keeping promise to farmers or curbing violence against women’

Accusing the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of not fulfilling the promises made to farmers and curbing incidents of violence against women, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday protested inside and outside the Assembly.

As soon as the proceedings began, Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said he had given an adjournment notice for a discussion on farmers’ issues and rising crimes against women in the State.

Mr. Fadnavis criticised the crop loan waiver announced by the government, saying in two months only 15,000 farmers were its beneficiaries. “If this is the speed of implementation, it will take 470 months to clear the debt of 35 lakh farmers,” he said.

The ruling parties, before coming to power, demanded ₹25,000 per hectare for crop losses and current Finance Minister Ajit Pawar even assured ₹1 lakh per hectare, Mr. Fadnavis said.

Speaker Nana Patole said while the issue is of importance, the House has other important business lined up as well. Mr. Patole said the issue of crimes against women is listed in the Calling Attention notice in the day’s business and a special discussion on women’s safety is scheduled for March 5.

Dissatisfied with the response, BJP members entered the well of the House and shouted slogans against the government. Women MLAs of the BJP wore black aprons emblazoned with slogans against the MVA government. Amid the sloganeering, Mr. Patole continued with the question hour.

Meanwhile, Sports Minister and Congress leader Sunil Kedar hit out at the BJP saying not a single member of the party joined him when he held a Sadbhavna Fast at Wardha after a woman lecturer was burnt by a stalker in Hinganghat. “It is easy to just shout slogans,” he said.

Repeated adjournments

As the sloganeering continued, Mr. Patole adjourned the House for 15 minutes and after it resumed, the presiding officer adjourned it again for another 15 minutes. The House was then adjourned for the day after clearing an important Bill on holding sarpanch elections.

The BJP also protested outside the Assembly. Mr Fadnavis said the protests will continue outside tehsil offices till farmers get justice.

Over a year after a major fire killed 13 people at the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital in Andheri, the building is expected to be repaired by June. State Public Health and Family Welfare Minister Rajesh Tope revealed this in an answer given to queries in the Legislative Council.

On December 17, 2018, a major fire broke out inside ESIC Hospital, killing 13 people. Since the blaze, the hospital building has been shut and its patients moved to other ESIC hospitals. MLC Manisha Kayande had asked whether the hospital was still shut, if patients have to opt for costly private treatment, why it was still shut and what action has been taken to reopen it.

In a written reply tabled in the Council, Mr. Tope said patients were being treated in the hospital in Kandivali and those requiring super-speciality treatment were being reimbursed for treatment in private hospitals.

Quoting a letter from the additional commissioner, regional office, ESIC, received on February 6, Mr. Tope said, “According to this letter, the repair and restoration work of ESIC Hospital, Andheri, has been given to NBCC India and is expected to be completed by June 2020.” The Hindu had recently reported that employees were unhappy with the slow pace of work and were demanding the hospital restart immediately.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uyjs96/article30917487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26bmAssembly-BackbenchersRevisedcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/esic-hospital-to-be-repaired-by-june-says-health-minister/article30917488.ece
406,2020/02/26,47-year-old held for sexually abusing minor girl for a year,"Man had threatened to kill victim if she told anyone

The Agripada police have arrested a 47-year-old man for allegedly sexually assaulting his neighbour’s nine-year-old daughter repeatedly over the last one year.

According to the police, the accused and girl live in the same building in Mumbai Central and are well known to each other. The police said the matter came to light when the girl broke down and told her mother about the harassment.

Mother approaches cops

Her alarmed mother rushed to the Agripada police station with her on Monday evening. The police took the girl for a medical check-up at Nagpada police hospital and then recorded a statement.

“The victim has said the accused would take her to his residence whenever he found her alone on the building premises and sexually assault her. To the best of her recollection, the first assault was perpetrated in March 2019, after which the accused threatened to kill her if she told anyone about it,” a police officer said.

The officer said the accused started assaulting her every time he found an opportunity, reiterating his threat each time. The girl ultimately confided in her mother on Monday. The police picked up the accused for questioning on Monday night, and arrested him after preliminary inquiries.

Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said the man has been charged with outraging a woman’s modesty and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code, and sexual assault on a minor under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

Police custody till Friday

“We produced him in court on Tuesday and he has been remanded in police custody till Friday. We are interrogating him further and also trying to find out if he has similarly targeted other minors. We will speak to residents of his locality to encourage children to come forward if they have faced similar abuse, and will also appeal to their parents to be supportive,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/47-year-old-held-for-sexually-abusing-minor-girl-for-a-year/article30917467.ece
407,2020/02/26,Four held for robbing telecom engineer at Rabale MIDC,"The Rabale MIDC police have arrested four people for robbing a telecommunication engineer on the pretext of giving him a lift from Ghansoli railway station last week.

Jignesh Shah (30), a resident of Dombivali, was assaulted and robbed of valuables worth ₹52,000 at Rabale MIDC around 9 p.m. on February 18 after he got into a car. There were four men, including the driver, in the car, and it was going towards Mahaoe-Shilphata road. But after reaching petrol pump, the driver took a U-turn and started heading towards Khairane MIDC.

The man sitting to Mr. Shah’s right snatched his cell phone and the one on the left pointed a pistol at his stomach and asked him to hand over his wallet, gold chain, and finger ring. When he resisted, the accused threatened to kill him following which Mr. Shah gave ₹1,000 from his bag, other than the valuables.

The accused then snatched his three ATM cards and assaulted him for the PIN. The four stopped at an ICICI Bank ATM at Khairane MIDC and withdrew ₹36,000. While entering the ATM booth, the accused covered their faces with handkerchiefs to avoid being captured by CCTV cameras. Later, they abandoned Mr. Shah near L&T office at Mahape.

Mr. Shah filed a police complaint the next day. A team under the guidance of senior police inspector Nitin Gite and police inspector Anil Patil scanned footage of around 40 CCTV cameras and identified the car. On Monday, the police nabbed the accused along with the car near the service road at Ghansoli railway station.

“Of the four accused, two have dacoity and autorickshaw theft cases against them. We recovered the stolen cash and valuables, and seized the weapon. Their modus operandi was to rob passengers at gunpoint, and we are investigating how many others have fallen prey,” Pankaj Dahane, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I, said.

The four have been remanded in police custody till February 29. Since the identification parade of the accused is yet to be done, the names have not been revealed by the police.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/four-held-for-robbing-telecom-engineer-at-rabale-midc/article30917454.ece
408,2020/02/26,70-year-old paan seller found murdered in Mulund residence,"No headway in Andheri senior citizen’s murder

A 70-year-old man was found to have been murdered in his Mulund residence on Monday evening.

According to the Navghar police, the incident came to light when residents of Gavhanpada became aware of a foul stench and traced it to the one-room residence of Kailashnath Chaurasia.

The police were informed and Chaurasia was rushed to Rajawadi Hospital, where he was declared dead before admission. Based on preliminary medical examination, which revealed stab wounds to his stomach, the police registered a case of murder against unknown persons. Doctors estimate that the murder was committed at least 12 hours before the body was discovered, officers said.

“Chaurasia lived alone and ran a paan-beedi store. He was in the habit of keeping the front door open at night during summer for ventilation. Anyone could have easily entered and left the house without making a commotion,” an officer said.

Motive a mystery

The officer said a challenge in the investigation is the complete lack of CCTV cameras in the area. “There are no signs of anything having been robbed, and given Chaurasia’s profile, a financial dispute seems to be unlikely as a motive for murder. We are currently focusing on a possible personal enmity,” the officer said.

Meanwhile, the DN Nagar police are still working on pinpointing the motive for the murder of 75-year-old Gulabi Shetty, who was found dead in her Andheri apartment on Sunday afternoon. Shetty used to live alone in a flat above a restaurant, and the entire building belonged to her.

“Inquiries have revealed that she also had two other flats in the city, with a collective value of around ₹30 crore. We are investigating whether there were any disputes relating to her property, which could have led to her murder,” a police officer said. The officer said that since there are no signs of forced entry into the house, the possibility of someone known to her having committed the crime is the strongest at this point.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/70-year-old-paan-seller-found-murdered-in-mulund-residence/article30917435.ece
409,2020/02/26,Two Sena leaders’ appointments with ministerial rank cancelled,"Waikar, Sawant not willing to take up posts: General Administration Department

The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has cancelled the appointment of Shiv Sena Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant and MLA Ravindra Waikar to key posts with Cabinet rank.

The government had appointed Mr. Waikar as the chief coordinator in the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) and Mr. Sawant as the head of the State parliamentary coordination committee. The General Administration Department issued government resolutions (GRs) dated February 20 saying that both leaders were unwilling to take up the posts.

As per the GR on Mr. Sawant, he told the State government on February 14 that he did not wish to take up the post. Mr. Waikar, meanwhile, conveyed the same on February 11. No reasons were cited by the either of them.

According to sources, the appointments of both the leaders with ministerial rank could have landed them in trouble as these were offices of profit. As reported by The Hindu last week, the Bharatiya Janata Party was likely to raise the issue during the budget session as the posts awarded to the leaders were neither given the ministerial rank through an Act of the Assembly, nor did either of them take an oath of office.

In a meeting of all MPs from the State on January 27, which was chaired by Mr. Thackeray, it was decided that Mr. Sawant would be appointed as the chairman of the three-member State-level parliamentary committee. The panel was set up to follow up on pending proposals with the Centre.

Mr. Waikar, meanwhile, was appointed chief coordinator in CMO and assigned the responsibility to coordinate with public representatives and the Chief Minister on fast-tracking of projects and fund allocations.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4r3hnc/article30917433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMWAIKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-sena-leaders-appointments-with-ministerial-rank-cancelled/article30917434.ece
410,2020/02/26,Two mowed down by speeding truck,"Pedestrians knocked down as driver swerved to avoid hitting motorcycle in front of him

Two men died after being run over by a speeding dumper truck near Lower Parel Monorail station late on Monday. The police have arrested the driver of the truck.

According to the police, the incident occurred under the Monorail station near Bawla Masjid on NM Joshi Marg around 11 p.m. on Monday. The police said the truck which was travelling towards Worli, was at a high speed and swerved to avoid hitting a motorcycle in front of it, which braked suddenly.

“The speed of the truck caused it to veer hard to the left and it ran over two pedestrians before it could come to a stop against the pavement,” an officer with the NM Joshi Marg police said.

Within seconds, a huge crowd of passers-by and local residents crowded around the dumper truck. Meanwhile, word reached the police station, which is minutes away, and a team rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control.

“We rushed the victims to a nearby hospital, where they were declared dead before admission. The driver of the dumper truck, who was taken into custody from the spot, was also subjected to a medical test. His blood samples were also taken to check for inebriation before he was taken to the police station for inquiries,” the officer said.

Based on papers found on the two men, the police have identified them as Sanjay Pawar (59) and Pratap More (50), both residents of Kalyan. The police suspect they worked nearby and were on their way home when the accident occurred. They are in the process of contacting the victims’ families.

The driver, Sachinkumar Chauhan (24), was placed under arrest in the early hours of Tuesday. Officers said he was not found to be drunk at the time of the incident and has been charged with causing death due to rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code, along with sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. He was granted bail after being produced in court on Tuesday morning.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/btdtab/article30917366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMACCIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-mowed-down-by-speeding-truck/article30917367.ece
411,2020/02/26,MVA govt. discontinues Fadnavis’s pet project Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan,"‘There is no question of shutting the scheme, its tenure was up to Dec. 31 last year’

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s pet project, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan, has been discontinued by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The development came to light in an answer to an unstarred question in the Legislative Council on Tuesday.

The State government has already spent ₹9,707 crore on the water conservation scheme, which was launched in 2015 in view of the recurring drought in several districts. The previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena government aimed to make Maharashtra drought-free through the scheme. The project involved deepening and widening of streams, construction of cement and earthen check dams, and digging farms ponds to make villages free of water scarcity. The previous government termed it a success and Mr. Fadnavis played it up during his election speeches.

‘No extension’

In a written reply tabled in the Council, Water Conservation Minister Shankarrao Gadakh said the MVA government would not be giving an extension to the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan. Mr. Gadakh said, “The year 2018-19 was the last year of the scheme, it was given an extension up to December 31, 2019. There is no question of shutting the scheme. Its tenure is already over.”

Mr. Gadakh was responding to a question raised by Peasants and Workers Party leader Jayant Patil in the Upper House on whether the scheme has been wound up and if there have been allegations of corruption in the scheme. Mr. Patil also wanted to know if the MVA government has taken any initiatives to address drought in the State.

Asked about the incomplete works, Mr. Gadakh said, “Permission is given to complete the incomplete works under the scheme till March 31. No fresh work will be undertaken.” After March-end, there will be a detailed review of the scheme, the Minister said.

‘₹9,707 crore spent’

Mr. Gadakh further told the House that from 2015 to 2019, a total of 22,586 villages had been selected for the implementation of the scheme. “So far, 6,32,708 works have been completed with total expenditure of ₹9,707 crore,” he said.

BJP MLA Narayan Kuche had on Monday appealed to the State government not to wind up the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan and the water grid project of the previous government. “If you want, you can rechristen the Jalyukt and water grid schemes after Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar or Congress president Sonia Gandhi, but don’t wind them up as they are crucial in resolving the water woes,” the legislator from Badnapur in Marathwada region said.

Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil had recently called several works done under the scheme as ‘poor and substandard’. “The Chief Minister has now told to stop payments to such works and go ahead with their execution only after a review,” he had said in Pune.

Suggestions submitted

On the recommendations of an expert committee on the quality of works, Mr. Gadakh said the committee headed by former chief secretary Johnny Joseph was formed to inspect allegations of corruption. The recommendations of the committee have already been submitted to the Bombay High Court as a writ petition was filed in 2018. Mr. Gadakh said the State government also filed an affidavit on June 17, 2019, informing the court about the action plan and the status of the implementation of these recommendations.

Mr. Gadakh said there are 151 talukas, 268 revenue circles and 5,449 villages in the State that are drought-prone and his department is already undertaking works for soil and water conservation.

413,2020/02/26,How shipping containers are redefining living spaces,"Hospitality brands are upcycling discarded shipping container boxes by turning them into wineries, boutiques and hostels. Cargotecture could redefine your next hotel stay

The ubiquitous shipping container — a steel box that reshaped transportation and globalisation — is often undermined; usually discarded or left to rot, its role in the bustling world of commerce half forgotten.

However, these large boxes have found their way into everyday life, with societies adopting and upcycling them to form living spaces, which has made having to sleep in one a distinct part of the “ideal travel experience”.

Shipping container architecture, or cargotecture, has witnessed a steep growth curve in the last few years, especially since these boxes were made the symbols of green living. Flexibility, portability and reduced construction periods make such units versatile.

While the process entails modification by adding electrical outlets, insulation and plumbing, owners also choose to go one step further by incorporating glass ceilings and roof gardens. Present as cafés, restaurants and studios around the globe, this latest trend in the sustainability wave has engulfed the realm of hospitality. While some hotels are shifting to motion sensor technology and water-saving devices, other brands are changing the game entirely by using shipping containers as a structural element.

Cascading down the natural landscape, the Quadrum Ski and Yoga Resort in Gudauri, Georgia, provides stunning views of the Caucasus mountains. Large windows, generous balconies and warm wooden interiors characterise the resort, which was designed by architects Sandro Ramishvili and Irakli Eristavi in 2017. Erene Jerenashvilli, the resort’s manager, says the decision to use containers was a result of wanting the hotel to look different, with the architecture serving as a signature element.

Going local

“The commitment to local material meant that we sourced wood, stone and metal from the nearby region, sculpting them into a Nordic style structure. Even the furniture was customised using wood from Georgia,” she adds.

Throw in yoga, fitness, swimming, and over four suites to choose from, and it makes the boutique hotel an ideal holiday destination. There is an added bonus. The slopes are just a five-minute walk away, and the resort is located less than two kilometres from the Gudauri ski lift.

In contrast, Hotel WineBox at Valparaiso, Chile, is an urban winery that resonates the coastal town’s edginess through funky graffiti that wraps around its walls. A colourful structure resembling stacked Lego blocks, one can catch stunning views of the Pacific Ocean while sipping on Chilean wine and leaning back on furniture crafted from bathtubs and sinks.

The rooms are priced upwards of $111 but are lavishly furnished — modular kitchenettes, recycled pallets and private balconies beg for a party or two, and blur the spatial constraints of the storage unit. Located near the late Chilean poet Pablo Neruda’s house, you can step out to find where he penned down his thoughts, or just go down to the hotel garage where you can crush grapes and inspect the ageing barrels of wine.

Testing waters

Closer home, container resorts are still a fairly new concept. There are only a few and they are located in areas where permanent construction is restricted. At Panchgani in Maharashtra, Zostel welcomes you with an art display that reads #BeContained, ushering you into a medley of volumes outlined with rustic colours. Combining dormitories with private rooms, the backpacker hostel is located above the scenic Krishna valley and was designed by architect Madhav Joshi and associates.

Discussing the containers, Dharamveer Singh Chouhan, CEO and co-founder, Zostel, says, “We wanted travellers to feel they were floating above the clouds. The cantilever usage of the containers is one of the main reasons for using them in Panchgani.” Vishal Sudhakar, managing director, Building in a Box, adds that “People are now looking for alternative travel experiences. They are experimenting with jungle stays, tree houses and container resorts.”

Sudhakar’s firm has built beachside container properties at Sayalgudi in Ramanathapuram, and is also behind the quirky Bell Tiffin Box restaurant concept in Madurai.

What is the experience inside a 20-feet container like? Most of the rooms can accommodate only two or three adults, but through innovations in furnishing, flooring and lighting, one hardly notices the difference in spatial volume.

“The experience of staying in a container has been designed so space is optimised in the best possible way. We had to do some modifications to our standard dorm bed designs so as to optimise space usage while not having to compromise on comfort,” says Dharamveer.

Vishal pitches in: “Height is the major restricting factor as it is not advisable to open up the top of the container. In terms of cost, container architecture can result in a 25-30 % reduction, especially if you choose to compete with mainstream hotels.”

With travel itineraries getting influenced by Instagram hashtags, and the desire to show off unique experiences, it is interesting to see where container resorts are headed. Maybe, in this case, thinking inside the box provides the best perspective!",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/8z9yfq/article30923289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPPanchganiZostel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/how-shipping-containers-are-redefining-living-spaces/article30923294.ece
414,2020/02/26,The island of Malta is the hero of many films,"The Mediterranean island of Malta has been cast in many movies. Here, its history over the centuries and the warriors of St John who defined its character

In August 2018, Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was in Malta with his mother Salma for the shooting of Bharat. Describing the Mediterranean island as a “lovely country”, Salman had posted photos and videos, each of which went viral within minutes. The video of him exploring the country with his mother received over a million likes within five hours of posting.

“That has been a big catalyst to draw visitors from India,” says Jeff Powell from the Malta Tourism Authority. Currently, over two million visitors arrive in Malta annually, mostly from European countries.

Films have long been a trigger to boost tourism in Malta. The destination has appeared in several blockbusters, popular television dramas, and documentaries. The journey began in 1925 with the silent film Sons of the Sea. Since then, the list has grown longer with titles such as Casino Royale, Eyewitness, Midnight Express, Gladiator, The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy, Game of Thrones, Byron, Aamir Khan’s Thugs of Hindostan and Gautham Vasudev Menon’s Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa.

“Our landscape is like an open-air studio,” states Powell, highlighting the key reason for filmmakers’ long love affair with Malta.

By virtue of its natural harbours and diverse cityscapes, adorned with many tints from the dawn of civilisation to modern times, Malta’s landscape can easily take the guise of ancient Rome, Greece, 19th-Century Marseilles and 1960s West Asia.

Malta is located in the middle of the Mediterranean and is an archipelago that comprises three main inhabited islands — Malta, Gozo and Comino. Malta is the largest with an area of 246 square kilometres.

On it stand the capital Valletta, and other settlements thronged by tourists, such as ancient Mdina, Rabat and the Three Cities — Vittoriosa, Senglea and Cospicua. The international airport is also located on Malta island.

Spanning across several millennia, the archipelago has a boisterous history. After a golden Neolithic period, the land has been ruled in succession by the Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs and Normans, who were replaced in the 16th Century by the Knights of St John who made the biggest imprint with their 268-year rule. They were followed by the French and British from whom Malta became independent in 1964.

The Maltese people are very proud of their history, and so, when visitors ask where to start a Malta itinerary, they generally direct them to an audio-visual show in Valletta, called ‘Malta Experience’. “This 45-minute presentation is the best choice to intimately understand our past,” they say. “It will bring alive the glories of the knights.”

The most spoken contribution of the knights is their keeping away the invading Ottomans in a battle in 1565, known as the Great Siege. After victory, they shifted their capital from Mdina to Valletta and studded the landscape with architectural feats — forts, gates, cathedrals and mansions — some of which are the best examples of Baroque. A good example is St John’s Co-Cathedral, the nation’s most iconic monument.

The Maltese are among the oldest Christians in the world; St Paul introduced Christianity in 60 AD. Today, there are over 365 richly decorated churches and chapels scattered throughout the islands. “By visiting one church a day, you can become a saint in a year,” jokingly comments my tourist guide, Ilona.

It is not possible to visit all, but visitors should not miss St Paul’s Cathedral in Mdina, Cathedral of the Assumption in Gozo and the Santa Marija Assunta in Mosta which is crowned by a large dome said to be the world’s fourth largest.

With soaring fortifications and domes bulging above the glittering sea, UNESCO World Heritage-listed Valletta boasts ‘one of the planet’s most-concentrated historic areas’.

“The camera loves this silhouette,” says Ilona. “Most favoured movie locations here are the medieval Fort St Elmo and Fort Ricasoli just across the harbour.”

While Fort St Elmo doubled for Marseilles in The Count of Monte Cristo, as a Turkish prison in Midnight Express and a Beirut street market in espionage drama A Different Loyalty, Fort Ricasoli served as historic Rome for Russell Crowe’s beefy centurion Gladiator, as ancient Greece in Troy and as Egyptian city, Alexandria in Agora.

Fort Ricasoli was also the location for the popular Game of Thrones.

Antique Mdina is characterised by a labyrinth of honey-coloured cobbled streets and piazzas lined with golden stone mansions of Maltese nobility. The area near the entry into the walled quarter was the stage for one of the drama’s most moving sequences, the farewell between nobleman Ned Stark and wife Catelyn, when she sets off from King’s Landing after the death of King Robert.

“I still remember watching the shoot here,” recollects David, who takes tourists on Mdina city tours in his horse-drawn carriage. Mesquita Square in the city centre is another site where some other scenes were shot.

While St Dominic’s Convent, in Rabat, featured as the Red Keep’s garden, Fort St Angelo in Vittoriosa, was the location for their prison. One key site which cannot be seen any more is the Azure Window — a unique rock formation in the sea in Gozo. In 2017, the structure collapsed after heavy storms. The picturesque Gozo Island, a short ferry ride from the shores of Malta, has also featured in many films.

A Russian adventure-romance blockbuster The Divers brought alive the colourful fishing village of Marsaxlokk, where the bay is crowded with decorative ‘eye’ painted boats called ‘Luzzu’, bearing Phoenician influences. “It’s only possible for Malta to act in so many different roles,” comments a tourist from the UK.

“However, we prefer to see Malta as Malta,” says Powell.

Indirectly referring to the recent violence that has erupted in the capital with regard to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said disregard for the rule of law will lead the country down the path to destruction.

“One has the right to speak and achieve whatever (one wants) in a peaceful democratic manner. By causing destruction you are destroying your future and that of the country. What the country needs is a positive attitude and not a negative mindset,” Mr Naidu said, while giving the 28th convocation address of Pondicherry University.

He urged the student community to involve themselves in nation building by taking up various national causes such as cleanliness, water harvesting and developing ethical and moral values.

Calling for an attitudinal change among the people, the Vice-President said educational institutions should consider discarding colonial era convocation dress code. “I am not suggesting any colour or dress code. You can either promote Khadhi or products of rural artisans,” he said.

Mr Naidu also gave a clarion call to the students to learn as many language as possible. “You should love your mother tongue but learn as many languages as possible. I don’t agree with the concept of hatred towards one language,” he added.

He went on to cite the example of Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy. “He excelled in the party because he could communicate well in Hindi,” the Vice-President said.

Appealing to graduating students, he said: “It is merely a stepping stone, a mere enabler for you to pursue your academic, professional and personal dreams. You have a whole exciting world to explore, to understand and contribute.”

Mr Naidu gave away gold medals to toppers in various subjects. As many as 335 Ph.D, 26 M.Phil, 3,498 postgraduation, 11,048 undergraduate, 113 diploma and 4,269 distance education degrees were awarded at the convocation.

418,2020/02/26,Pondicherry University signs MoU for exchange programme,"Koblenz University is ranked among the top 10 applied sciences universities in Germany

Pondicherry University signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Koblenz University of Applied Sciences (RheinAhrCampus), Remagen, Germany, for academic collaboration through student and faculty exchange between the two universities.

Pondicherry University is Koblenz University’s second Indian partner university after IIT-Madras and it is a promising prospect since Koblenz is ranked among the top 10 applied sciences universities in Germany, a press note said.

The MoU comes close on the heels of a seminar, ‘Study and Research in Germany’, organised by the Office of the Dean, International Relations, Pondicherry University, along with German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) on February 14.

Speaking on the occasion, Pondicherry University Vice- Chancellor Gurmeet Singh highlighted that global partnerships are imperative to reach global standards in higher education. He mentioned how this partnership will provide students opportunities to experience the German work ethic and value system, besides a rich cross-cultural exposure.

Chandrasekara Rao, Dean, School of Management, pointed out the mutually beneficial aspects of the MoU in terms of exposure to global benchmarks and best practices in academia.

Elmar-Laurent Borgmann, Head-International Affairs, Koblenz University of Applied Sciences, said it was noteworthy that Indian students considered a semester in Germany within their MBA studies. He pointed out the importance of good inter-cultural preparedness.

“Their semester abroad is a journey with an impact on the students’ careers and families. Faculty of both universities will do all to help these young adventurers turn their educational journey into an academic experience.”

During his visit earlier, Dr. Borgmann had addressed students and faculty members in the Department of Management Studies in the Puducherry and Karaikal campuses.

Uma Chandrasekaran, Dean-International Relations, pointed to the growing bilateral cooperation in the field of higher education between India and Germany. As Germany is ranked among the world’s top destinations for international students, this MoU makes it more accessible to the students of Pondicherry University, she said.

The Education Ministries of India and Germany will invest €3.5 million each over a period of four years from 2020-24 to encourage and support cooperation between higher education institutions in each country, she added.

Speaking on the sidelines of the ceremony, Victor Anandkumar, Department of Management Studies and Coordinator-MoU, expressed confidence that the collaboration would be made operational from the academic year 2020-21 with the Erasmus (EuRopean Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) scholarships, which would cover air travel and living expenses of Pondicherry University students selected to the programme.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/a0jrju/article30917506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUDUCHERRYUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/pondicherry-university-signs-mou-for-exchange-programme/article30917507.ece
419,2020/02/26,"81.80% of Puducherry’s budget allocation utilised, say officials","Government depts. recorded an expenditure of ₹6,974 crore till mid-February

With around a month to go for the current financial year to end, the government has utilised 81.80% of the total budgeted amount, according to officials in the Union Territory. Of the total budget outlay of ₹8,425 crore for the fiscal 2019-20, the government departments recorded an expenditure of ₹6,974 crore till mid-Feburary.

Going by the current pace, the government expected to utilise more than 94% of the budgeted amount.

In the last fiscal, the government could utilise only 71% of the total outlay till mid-February. And by the year-end, the government could spend 94% of the total amount, an official source told The Hindu.

While most of the departments could achieve 70% of the expenditure utilisation, the Local Administration Department fared very poorly. So far, the department could utilise only 32% of its funds mainly due to under utilisation of ₹50 crore set aside for MLA Local Area Development Fund.

The LAD was awaiting expenditure sanction from the Lieutenant Governor for allocation of works, the source said.

In a meeting on Tuesday to review the progress made by various departments in utilising funds, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy requested the Secretaries and heads of departments to speed up spending in the remaining days. Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam, Minister for Revenue M.O.H.F Shahjahan, Minister for Social Welfare M. Kandasamy, Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao and Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan also attended.

Vote on account

The government, according to the source, could present a vote on account next month for the next financial year. Like in the previous years, the government would present a full budget in June/July, the source said.

The Union Budget had set aside ₹1,703 crore under the Ministry of Home Affairs head as Central assistance for 2020-21.

Not satisfied with the meagre allocation, the Chief Minister had represented to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking enhanced assistance, the source added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/9vsa77/article30917063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26PONDYCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/8180-of-puducherrys-budget-allocation-utilised-say-officials/article30917064.ece

A multi-party meeting convened by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Tuesday has decided to intensify the agitation against the Lieutenant Governor’s decision to disburse cash to ration cardholders instead of supplying them free rice as decided by the Cabinet.

The meeting attended by representatives of the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Communist Party of India, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the Dravidar Kazhagam decided to organise signature campaign in favour of distribution of rice in the Union Territory on March 2 and 3.

Ideas have a way of coming out of nowhere. This book is about the first ideas. It traces the origins of human ingenuity, and let’s just say it all began with fire.

Early humans played with clay. They found it would get hard once dried. If left out in the sun it got harder still. They shaped this clay into tiny figurines and toys for children to play with.

The invention of the wheel sparked off a revolution. Every single mechanical invention used the wheel. From watches to cars, the wheel was essential.

The invention of paper, glass, writing, mail and countless other discoveries, ingenious inventions and lucky accidents have gone into shaping the world as we know it today.

This book delves into science, history and every subject in between, revealing stories behind the most significant breakthroughs down the ages – from clothing, cartography and chemistry to music, maths and metallurgy.

423,2020/02/26,Broadening my ‘horizons’,"It can’t just be my family that’s always getting me to try things that they think would make me a better kid, right?

Why are grownups ALWAYS trying to ‘improve’ kids?

Read classics!’ ‘Watch black and white movie with morals and values’. ‘Eat food from different cultures. Mac ’n’ Cheese doesn’t count.’ ‘World Music will broaden horizons’. That last one resulted in a two-hour car ride during which we had to listen to Tibetan monks chanting. I fell asleep, so not sure if my horizons became broader or not.

Anyway, this weekend I was dragged to the theatre. I wanted to watch Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey, but according to the Internet, I was too young for it. The Internet sucks sometimes. Anyway, while the parents were looking at movie listings they saw an ad for a play at a nearby theatre. And before we could even form an opinion about it, tickets for The Tempest by William Shakespeare had been booked.

An ode to someone?

Have you heard of Shakespeare? The only thing I knew about him was that he wrote a play called Romeo and Juliet where everyone dies at the end. When I asked Amma about the dude, she went on and on and ON about how he was this amazing playwright and poet, and this was a perfect chance to get to know his work better since I would learn two of his plays in high school. Why am I being introduced to Grade 9 English Lit now when I can barely understand my English syllabus for Grade 6? Also, making me spend precious weekend time doing learning activities disguised as fun? Not FAIR!

Once we got to the theatre and sat down, Amma decided to tell us that some of the play might be a little hard to understand since it was written in Elizabethan English. English? It sounded more like Latin! Or Swahili! Or Klingon! How was this stuff English? Thy? Thee? Thine? Though? Dost! Havest! Also, all the words in the sentence sounded jumbled up and not like how normal people speak. When I said that the characters sounded like Yoda, everyone in our row went Shhhhhhhhh!

In the intermission, when I asked my parents what on earth had happened in the first 45 minutes, they had to Google the storyline. Busted! Even they didn’t understand.

I won’t lie, there were parts of it that were funny — like when one character did the floss, and another sang ‘We Will Rock You’. I asked if there was the floss back in Elizabethan English times and was told that these were new additions to make the play fun for young people. I think that if they made one of the characters look like Yoda, it would be a hit.

Anyway, since it wasn’t a totally awful experience, I may have said that I had fun. Big mistake. They’re now looking for tickets to the Opera.

424,2020/02/26,Grandma goes to school: Eminent visitor,"Grandma was excited to have a wedding in the house. However, she was not prepared for what was coming.

The story so far: The missionary-mem taught the girls everything, from crochet classes to Bible stories. But now, there was a weddding to get ready for.

Grandma’s school-going group became even smaller when another cousin had to drop out by her irate mother. Phuli had also dropped out because there were two babies at home who needed to be minded. But other girls from the locality joined in. By now, grandma was an adept swimmer and could even swim under water. So, the riverside group flourished.

School inspection

There was fresh excitement in school when the teacher announced that a missionary from Calcutta was coming to see their school. The best needlework and crochet were collected for display. Sketches made by some girls were mounted. Those with good handwriting printed words of wisdom (such as “God is Good”) on coloured paper. Grandma was asked to embroider VR on a piece of silk.

“But what does it mean?” asked grandma.

“It stands for Victoria Regina,” said her teacher. “It means Queen Victoria reigns.”

There was a portrait of Queen Victoria in the school and everyone knew about her. The missionary was duly impressed by the work done by the girls and distributed glass dolls and red ribbons as prizes. Grandma received a vase for her work. Everyone went home happy. But grandma’s grandma was wary. Was this yet another method of converting them?

“Don’t be ridiculous,” said grandma’s grandpa, “it is meant to encourage them to study.”

Grandma loved reading but was sad because there were no story books. Her boy cousins showed off their books. But they were too difficult to read, and had no pictures. Grandma decided to ask her teacher.

“You tell us such nice stories,” she said, “aren’t there any books with these stories?”

“Yes, there are but I am afraid I cannot give them to you,” said the teacher. “Your parents will not like it.”

Grandma failed to understand why. There were so many things that didn’t seem to make sense.

426,2020/02/26,CM expresses concern for Keralites in New Delhi,"Chennithala blames Centre for violence in capital

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday painted a grim picture of the situation in New Delhi.

He said members of the sizeable Keralite community in New Delhi appeared fearful for their lives and property. Their sense of dread reflected the anarchy that reigned in the national capital, which had witnessed communal riots and bloodshed for days and without any respite. The Centre had failed to curb the violence.

He said The body count was increasing by the hour. Private armies run by religious zealots had besieged working class neighbourhoods with fire and sword. The marauders targetted journalists and law enforcers. The police remained a mute witness. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader who incited the sectarian violence was still at large and spewing hate speech, Mr. Vijayan said.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, rooted in a Hindu nationalist world view, had reopened ancient communal fault lines in New Delhi by attempting to stamp out the anti-citizenship law protests with violence targetted against a particular minority. Secular forces should step in to prevent society from polarising on dangerous communal lines. The Centre should quell the riots at the earliest and restore peace. The rioters should not get a sense of impunity.

‘Abetting riots’

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala squarely blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for fanning the communal conflagration that threatened Delhites, including lakhs of Keralites. Leaders were repeating what they had perfected in abetting the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002. He slammed Mr. Shah for stating that the Centre saw no conspiracy behind the riots and it appeared to be a spontaneous act. Mr Chennithala urged the Centre to lock-up Kapil Mishra and other BJP leaders who had incited the violence and fanned it with hate speech.

The New Delhi police and paramilitary forces were holding an umbrella to armed militias that unleashed focussed violence against neighbourhoods, places of worship, and business of a particular minority community. He echoed Mr. Vijayan’s sentiments and said secular forces should come together to resist attempts to divide India in the line of religion.

CPI(M) demand

The CPI(M) State secretariat called for putting up a united front comprising democratic and secular forces against the attempts of communal elements to spread hatred and violence in the country. The secretariat, in a statement, demanded that the Central government and the police restore peace and harmony in Delhi. All secular and democratic forces should take the lead to prevent the spread of communal hatred beyond narrow political considerations. Action should be taken against those guilty of the incident, including the BJP leader who allegedly made provocative statements, the secretariat said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kl2are/article30926417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVTVCPMMARCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/cm-expresses-concern-for-keralites-in-new-delhi/article30923967.ece

428,2020/02/26,Row over KAS exam unfounded: PSC,"Cong. MLA’s allegation on KAS prelims questions

The Public Service Commission (PSC) was caught in a row on Tuesday with Congress legislator P.T. Thomas alleging that six questions that figured in the general studies paper I of the Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) preliminary examinations were copied from an examination conducted for the Pakistan Civil Service.

Commission chairman M.K. Sakeer later told reporters that the questions were on the basic tenets of general administration and there was nothing unusual about it. Mr. Thomas levelled the allegations on the KAS preliminary examinations held on February 22 through a video uploaded on the Facebook.

Probe sought

He alleged that the questions were a true reflection of those figured in the Pakistan Civil Service examination and demanded a probe into the incident.

Mr. Sakeer described the charges as unfounded.

Complaints about the questions would be examined by a panel of academicians. The commission held that the KAS preliminary examinations were conducted without diluting the high standards desired to be maintained for such tests. The selection was to be made from about 3.50 lakh candidates who sat for the examination and hence questions were selected in a unique manner. This was a system for picking the best. The final examination too would be conducted without compromising on the standards, he said.

Valuation of answer books will be expedited and candidates for the final exams would be selected soon. The final examination would be held within five months, he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/row-over-kas-exam-unfounded-psc/article30917066.ece
429,2020/02/26,Broadening growth horizons,"Proposals under CRDP could position the capital as one of the fastest growing cities in the country

The State capital is set for a giant leap with plans to expand its boundaries and tap the potential of the ever-burgeoning city.

Largely known as the Information Technology hub of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram could have a more diversified portfolio during the next few years through the implementation of the second phase of the Capital Region Development Programme (CRDP).

Vizhinjam port

A growth corridor, proposed as a key component of the project, is touted to position the capital city among the fastest growing cities in the country. Aimed at optimising the benefits of the Vizhinjam international seaport, the corridor will be developed on both sides of the proposed 79-km-long six-lane outer ring road from Vizhinjam to Navaikulam.

Envisaged as a special investment region, the corridor will be driven by a separate legislation that will serve to circumvent legal and bureaucratic hurdles and transform the region into an attractive destination for investments. For this, the government is considering the viability of investment modes implemented in industrial and special economic zones such as the proposed Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and Shenzhen in China.

Earmarked for business activities, the region will have demarcated zones for IT, manufacturing, marketing and other industrial units.

To make the area habitable, the government also plans to dedicate separate zones for hospitals, educational institutions and residential complexes.

Official sources point out that the benefits of the seaport can be realised only by developing the city’s hinterlands. The absence of a dedicated industrial zone will render the installation a standalone infrastructure.

The completion of the seaport project along with its allied infrastructure, including the rail connectivity to the facility, will make it possible to import raw materials for the industrial units from across the world.

Besides, the convergence of various modes of transport offers the government an opportunity to establish a logistics park close to Vizhinjam.

The proposed facility will serve the purpose of lowering freight and warehousing costs.

The government also hopes to establish the Knowledge City, proposed to link the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and various space research centres, in the region. Besides, the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University will come up at Vilappilsala.

The government expects to attract investments worth ₹25,000 crore in the proposed investment region and provide jobs for 20,000 people directly and 1.2 lakh indirectly.

With most bases covered in terms of planning, the government now faces the herculean task of acquiring land required for the outer ring road and the growth corridor, which will extend to 2.5 km on either side of the road.

Rough estimates

Going by rough estimates, the road will require around 1,500 acres of land and the investment zone much more. The options of issuing land bonds and creating a land pool scheme are being considered in view of the financial hurdles. A draft report has been prepared for implementing the land bond scheme.

In addition, a consultant has been selected through a global tender process to create a master plan for the project and evolving the land use policy for the region.

The aerial survey of the land required for the road development was done by adopting the LiDAR (light detection and ranging) remote sensing technology for the first time in the State.

Efforts were under way to commence the survey for demarcating the zones for the growth corridor.

Essentially, the CRDP will focus on creating a satellite city and integrating the region with the ‘mainland’ at a later stage, possibly drawing parallels with Old Delhi and New Delhi.

The project also aims at plugging any existing infrastructural inadequacies in the city.

Various schemes for developing a comprehensive drinking water and sewerage network, sanitation, underground cabling, parking, cleaning water bodies, and heritage circuits have also been proposed under the programme.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/vnv1cf/article30917051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tv-city-mattersREV02col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/broadening-growth-horizons/article30917054.ece

431,2020/02/26,Device developed for ASD closure,"The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) has developed an indigenous occlusion device for the non-surgical closure of Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), a congenital heart condition.

The device has been developed by the Technical Research Centre for Biomedical Devices functioning under the Bio Medical Technology (BMT) wing of the SCTIMST, an official release said on Monday. ASD is a common congenital condition wherein there is a hole on the septum separating the upper chambers (right and left atria) of the heart. ASD is a developmental defect and in most cases the cause is unknown. In a child with ASD, the amount of blood that flows through the lungs increases and over time it may cause damage to the blood vessels in the lungs. This can cause problems in adulthood.

Occlusion device

Though in some cases the defect may resolve itself as the child grows, in many cases, an open heart surgery might be required. Non-surgically, the hole can be closed by cardiac catheterisation and using an occlusion device to plug the hole.

At present, this non-surgical closure is done using an imported occlusion device costing ₹60,000. The device, indigenously developed by the SCTIMST, is Nitinol-based (an alloy of nickel and titanium). It does away with the two common problems with ASD closure devices -- device migration and atrial roof erosion. Application has been submitted for getting the Indian patent for it.

The device was developed by a project team with Sujesh Sreedharan, an engineer with the BMT wing, as the technical project investigator and Bijulal S., Professor, Cardiology, as the clinical project investigator.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/device-developed-for-asd-closure/article30917036.ece
432,2020/02/26,Raj Bhavan turns into centre of CAA protest,"90-year-old Shaheen Bagh stir leader inaugurates ‘Occupy Raj Bhavan’

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is aimed to tear apart the country’s cherished secular fabric and divide society, Asma Khatun, a nonagenarian who defied old age to lead the Shaheen Bagh protests, has said.

The agitator, who has come to be hailed as one of the three ‘dadis’ (grandmothers) of Shaheen Bagh, inaugurated the ‘Occupy Raj Bhavan’ protest organised by the Welfare Party of India in front of Raj Bhavan on Tuesday.

The 30-hour-long demonstration has demanded the annulment of the CAA, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the National Population Register (NPR).

Ms. Khatun said the ongoing struggle was a battle for all citizens and not just one community.

While the law was a ploy to deny citizenship to the Muslim community, she claimed that it was bound to affect the tribespeople and other marginalised sections who would struggle to produce documents to prove their citizenship.

Modi blamed

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of singling out the Muslim community for hatred, she said many of the Centre’s decisions, including the demonetisation, were aimed at weakening the section.

“He misled the people to gain votes, but revealed his true colours after emerging victorious. No one can deny the fact that we too are the inheritors of the Red Fort, Jama Masjid and the India Gate. They wanted the current of the Delhi elections to be felt at Shaheen Bagh, but we ensured they repented their mistake. Ours is a protest to live with dignity and not to die with fear. We will never bend before them, come what may. The agitation will continue until the law is withdrawn,” Ms. Khatun declared.

Delivering the keynote address, Jamia Millia Islamia student Aysha Renna, who has been at the forefront of the anti-CAA protests, accused the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of undertaking a systematic genocide by introducing an anti-Muslim law.

Fighting against the law

“Despite their evil designs, people cutting across religious and cultural differences joined hands for fight against the law,” she added.

Welfare Party State president Hameed Vaniyambalam presided over the function. Adoor Prakash, MP, former Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president M.M. Hassan, Indian Union Muslim League State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed, and Kerala Congress (M) leader P.J.

433,2020/02/26,Chalai market all set to get a new face,"First phase of the redevelopment project of the age-old market inaugurated

The historic Chalai market in the city will no longer be known for its crowded alleys, congestion and squalor.

The signs of change for the bustling hub of commercial activity emerged on Tuesday with the inauguration of the first phase of the redevelopment project focussing on the heritage street.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran inaugurated the renovated vegetable market comprising 233 shops as part of the heritage street project taken up by the Tourism Department. The Minister said the project was designed to give a fresh lease of life to the market that had lost its appeal with the emergence of glitzy shopping malls.

He added that the construction of a big warehouse at Attakulangara and an underground market with a subway from the KSRTC bus stand had begun.

V.S. Sivakumar, MLA, Tourism Director Balakiran, and representatives of traders and trade unions were present.

The proposed heritage street will run from East Fort to Killippalam. The Aryasala junction too will have a new face. The street will have graffiti walls showcasing the history of the commercial area. The walkway will have a roof and benches will be provided for shoppers to relax. Flower pots will add to the aesthetics of the avenue.

The entry to the market from the Gandhi Park side will feature a gateway modelled on the lines of the East Fort gate. Such a gate will be constructed at the Killippalam side too. Similar colour schemes will be followed on the advertising boards. A statue of former Travancore Diwan Raja Kesavadas will be installed at the Aryasala junction.

Other arrangements

A Mohun Bagan goal that came after 23 passes during its win over Churchill has been showcased by the AIFF to drive home the competitiveness of the I-League and the “significant progression” it has made.

Bagan’s third goal in its 3-0 away win on Saturday featured 23 successive passes across the length and breadth of the pitch before Komron Tursonov slammed the ball home to end the exquisite move on the perfect note.

The AIFF said the Mariners have been the chief proponents of “beautiful football” this season under head coach Kibu Vicuna.

438,2020/02/26,Guardiola’s style here to stay: Shearer,"Says other teams now copying the Catalan’s model

Alan Shearer, famous goalscorer for Newcastle United and England, believes Pep Guardiola’s attacking approach is here to stay. The Spanish coach set off a football revolution in the Premier League via Manchester City’s passing game, thrilling moves and classy goals. Other clubs are forced to change in a bid to follow down the same path. “Pep came in and did a magnificent job, he changed the way a lot of teams play football. Now we see teams playing from the back, the goalkeeper at City is as good as any forward on the pitch.”

The ex-international feels that the Guardiola impact will continue even after he moves on to another country. “When you look (at English football), a lot of clubs want to play that way, build from the goalkeeper. Teams are not kicking long as many did years ago. I am referring to clubs not just in the Premier League but also outside.”

Shearer praised City’s success last season, in terms of matchplay, points on the board and goals scored. He was speaking on the sidelines of the PL-ISL Next Generation Mumbai Cup, featuring U-14 squads from England (Southampton, Manchester United and Chelsea) pitted against Indian teams from ISL (Bengaluru FC, FC Goa) and the Mumbai-based Reliance Foundation Young Foundation Champs.

Shearer, who also turned out for Southampton and Blackburn Rovers, pointed out Southampton’s matches against Indian sides (drew with Bengaluru FC U-14 and lost to FC Goa U-14) as the benefits of exposure to both camps.

“There might be a difference in ability, it is only natural. Give them time and the differences will get lesser, more opportunities to play against the likes of ManU, Chelsea and Southampton can only benefit everyone. It will help the English clubs who have come over here, it can benefit the youngsters in the ISL sides by playing against different systems, different styles. The benefits extends to the coaches and referees as well,” said England’s captain in World Cup 1998.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/m17t0t/article30923833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27SHEARER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/guardiolas-style-here-to-stay-shearer/article30923834.ece
439,2020/02/26,UCL 2020: Flying Bayern Munich thump Chelsea 3-0 with two from Serge Gnabry,"The German champions, clearly a class apart from their hosts, piled on the pressure from the start of the match and bossed Stamford Bridge with flair.

Two second-half goals in less than three minutes from Serge Gnabry and another from prolific Pole Robert Lewandowski earned Bayern Munich a thumping 3-0 victory at Chelsea in their Champions League last 16, first leg on Tuesday.

The German champions, clearly a class apart from their hosts, piled on the pressure from the start of the match and bossed Stamford Bridge with flair and 63% possession.

“It was a really good result for us,” Bayern coach Hansi Flick said. “The team performed exactly how we planned and we were very focused how we played.”

It was a bad night for Chelsea, whose home form under Frank Lampard has been suspect all season, and their misery was complete in the 83rd minute when wing back Marcos Alonso was sent off for violent conduct after he caught Lewandowski in the face with his arm.

For former Arsenal forward Gnabry they were the fifth and sixth goals in London in the Champions League this season after he scored four in Bayern's 7-2 demolition of Tottenham Hotspur in the group stages.

The first against Chelsea in the 51st minute involved a one-two between Gnabry and Lewandowski, who cut back from the edge of the area when Chelsea's retreating defence expected him to shoot, leaving Gnabry with an easy finish from less than 10 metres.

Chelsea, run ragged most of the evening, had barely got their breath back when Lewandowski and Gnabry exchanged passes halfway down the pitch before Gnabry raced away to score.

A smiling Flick said he was very happy Gnabry was now plying his trade in Germany rather than England.

“I saw how he played at Arsenal and I followed his career intently,” Flick said. “You could tell what he could do for the first Champions League match I saw him... he really impressed me and with Bayern Munich he's really developing well. So I'm very happy that he's playing with us.”

Lewandowski, clearly also enjoying himself, got among the scorers in the 76th minute after a stirring run from Canadian full back Alphonso Davies.

Host of chances

The Germans had also wasted a series of chances in the first half.

Thomas Mueller, one of three players who figured in Chelsea's 2012 Champions League final victory over Bayern in Munich, went closest in the 35th minute when he thumped the bar with a header from another Lewandowski cross.

Tuesday's win proved a measure of revenge for that unlikely Chelsea victory when Lampard captained the team in Munich and the English coach singled out Mueller as one of the players who had made the difference with his experience of the Champions League.

Mueller also had chances in the first minute and just before the half hour when his shot from 20 metres flew just wide.

Kingsley Coman looked dangerous down the right wing in a Bayern side that appeared to be always a metre ahead of Chelsea in speed and anticipation.

The home team had 38-year-old Argentine goalkeeper Willy Caballero to thank in the first half for keeping out Lewandowski, who has scored 11 goals in the competition so far this season, saving first with his face, then with his foot.

Lampard, who throughout his career relished Champions League football and played in two finals, said the result was sobering for his young team.

“Thats football at this level — the level of Bayern Munich. Unless we were getting everything bang on and right we were not going to get a result and we didnt get everything bang on,” Lampard said. “It was a harsh lesson in the realities of Champions League football.”

Lampard, clearly disappointed in the performance of some of his side, said each member of the team had to look at how he could improve in the second leg in Munich on March 18.

“We have to go and play with pride and not consider the scoreline,” he said. “We have to show character.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/yi0xyk/article30919124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-CHAMPIONS-CHE-BAYREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ucl-2020-flying-bayern-munich-thump-chelsea-3-0-with-two-from-serge-gnabry/article30919125.ece
440,2020/02/26,"‘They didn't hurt us, it barely tickled’: Napoli coach reacts after first leg draw with Barcelona at Champions League game","The two sides, who were facing each other for the first time, will meet again at the Camp Nou for the second leg on March 18.

Antoine Griezmann's second-half equaliser handed Barcelona a vital away goal and earned them a 1-1 draw at Napoli in their Champions League last-16 first leg meeting on Tuesday.

A superb curling strike from Dries Mertens put the home side in front after half an hour and saw the Belgian draw level with Marek Hamsik as Napoli's all-time top scorer with 121 goals.

But Barca breached a well-drilled Napoli defence in the 57th minute when Griezmann fired in a Nelson Semedo cross.

The visitors ended the game with 10 men after Arturo Vidal was sent off late on for picking up two yellow cards in quick succession.

The two sides, who were facing each other for the first time, will meet again at the Camp Nou for the second leg on March 18 with Barca now firm favourites to progress despite having Vidal and Sergio Busquets suspended for the return.

Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso was left frustrated at the result after his well-drilled defence largely stifled a quiet Lionel Messi and co.

“I think they barely grazed us tonight, they hardly had a single shot on goal,” he told Sky Sport Italia. “They could've been there all night and not scored, but we conceded after one single error. They didn't hurt us, it barely tickled.”

Barcelona dominated possession from the first whistle but struggled to find their way through the well-organised Italians, who then struck with their first meaningful attack of the game.

Junior Firpo lost the ball to Piotr Zielinski and the midfielder pulled a pass across to the waiting Mertens, who took a touch just outside the box before curling in a landmark goal, his sixth in seven Champions League games this season.

But the Belgian limped off through injury early in the second half after a hefty tackle from Busquets, which earned the midfielder the yellow card that will rule him out of the second leg.

Barca soon equalised when Griezmann fired home from close range after a neat passing move from the visitors but Napoli responded with Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon both being denied by excellent saves from Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

In the 89th minute, Vidal was booked for a foul on Mario Rui and was immediately shown a second yellow for butting heads with the defender in the aftermath.

With Sunday's La Liga Clasico against Real Madrid looming, Barca were also left with concerns over defender Gerard Pique, who limped off with an injury after falling heavily on his ankle.

“We'll see what problem he has, then we can confirm if he'll be available,” said Barcelona coach Quique Setien.

On Vidal's sending off, he added: “I didn't see precisely what happened, but perhaps the referee was a bit harsh. A yellow card for the foul is one thing, but the second is too much. There are moments of tension that players who experience the game with his temperament can have.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/efqgtr/article30919120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKITALYSOCCERCHAMPIONSLEAGUE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/they-didnt-hurt-us-it-barely-tickled-napoli-coach-reacts-after-first-leg-draw-with-barcelona-at-champions-league-game/article30919121.ece
441,2020/02/26,Electric trains in Villupuram -Mayiladuthurai BG section from March 1,"TIRUCHI: Southern Railway has planned to operate few passenger trains hauled by electric locomotive on the Villupuram – Mayiladuthurai – Villupuram electrified section from March 1.

The decision to run electric trains up to Mayiladuthurai Junction comes days after the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Southern Circle Bengaluru gave his authorisation for operation of passenger and freight trains after carrying out detailed inspection in the newly electrified portion of the main line section from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai.

The CRS who had also inspected another electrified stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur early this month had also given his statutory clearance for operation of electric loco hauled passenger and freight trains.

The plan was to initially operate three set of passenger trains hauled by electric locomotive from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai and back, senior divisional railway officials here told ‘The Hindu’ on Wednesday. Ahead of operation of passenger trains, the railway authorities had run freight train in that stretch a few days ago.

The move to operate electric loco hauled trains in the nearly 120-km stretch from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai has been communicated to officials of different railway departments in Tiruchi Railway Division. Presently, express trains on the main line section are being hauled by diesel locomotive.

The 228-km long main line section from Villupuram Junction to Thanjavur Junction via Cuddalore Port, Chidambaram, Sirkazhi, Mayiladuthurai, Kumbakonam and Thanjavur Junction, falling under the limits of Tiruchi Railway Division, is being electrified in stages. The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railways, which is executing the overhead electrifying project had at first energised the portion from Villupuram to Cuddalore.

Subsequently, it took up the second stretch from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai for electrification. As part of the project, the RVNL had constructed a traction sub station at Cuddalore Port which was commissioned by the CRS while conducting the mandatory inspection on February 7 and 8. The RVNL is currently carrying out overhead electrification works in the final portion from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur .

A senior railway official said passenger trains hauled by electric locomotive were planned to be operated in the electrified stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur via Peralam and Nannilam in the next stage as the statutory clearance from the CRS had come.

Once overhead electrification works up to Thanjavur Junction was completed, it would pave the way for operation of electric loco hauled express trains such as the Cholan and Uzhavan expresses on the main line section. Electric locomotive have a better pick up and acceleration and were environmental friendly, the official added.

State general secretary of Tamil Nadu Fishermen Federation A.Thajudheen said the Fisheries Department officials were initiating legal action against the fishermen returning from sea with sizeable catch alleging use of banned fishnets.

But, in reality, fishermen sometimes get good catch by using permitted fish nets. There was an apprehension among fishermen that the officials were indirectly forcing them to use banned nets to harvest ‘mathi’ variety fish at the behest of Cuddalore-based traders, he said.

“Officials know fully well that good catches are possible with permitted nets. Further, the practice of officials to intercept fishermen returning from sea and subjecting them to harassment even without bothering to take a look at nets in their possession strengthens the suspicion,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fishermen-stay-away-from-sea/article30924942.ece

450,2020/02/26,Bapu Museum work comes to a standstill,"‘₹1.6 crore released by State govt., its share, yet to materialise’

An “inordinate delay” in the release of funds by the State government has apparently impacted works on Bapu Museum in the city. The Archaeology Department is unable to complete works, including the audiovisual room, and opening the museum to the public poses a challenge for it.

“The State government has to release mere ₹ 1.60 crore. We are hoping that the funds will be released before the end of this financial year,” says a senior official who did not want to be quoted.

According to information, the Archaeology Department has taken up the project under the Museum Grants Scheme. The total cost is pegged at ₹ 8 crore. Of this, the Centre has released ₹3.20 crore and ₹1.6 crore in two spells till date. The Centre will release another tranche only if the State government releases its share of 20% which comes to ₹1.6 crore. As a result, funds to the tune of ₹3.20 crore are pending, sources say.

“The State government, on paper, had released its share of 20% a month ago, but the funds are yet to flow into the department kitty. We have managed to complete nearly 95% of the work till date. The museum can be opened before summer only if the funds are released now, ” the official says.

The Bapu Museum houses more than 1,100 antique objects and artefacts, some of them dating back to prehistoric times. The museum will showcase antiquities, arms and weapons, coins, paintings, sculptures and others of the Victoria Museum and those collected recently.

451,2020/02/26,Decentralisation is need of the hour: YSRCP MLAs,"Ruling party leaders address meetings at various places in State

YSR Congress Party MLAs reiterated that decentralisation was the need of the hour, while speaking at various meetings on Tuesday.

According to a release by the party, MLA Dharmana Prasada Rao, in Srikakulam, said that Amaravati was made into a business model by former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and development was concentrated in just one region.

“Mr. Naidu’s business model was to build eight cities around the capital city so that his associates who purchased land in the region could get richer by selling off them for huge profits,” he said.

Mr. Rao said, “Our patience is running out and we cannot continue to be in the lurch while development takes place only in one region. Our district does not even have a good parade ground for ceremonial functions. Should we be silent if money is pumped into one region and roads are laid at exorbitant rates?”

He alleged that the land in the capital region had gone into the hands of real estate dealers.

“Why should capital be built with ₹1 lakh crore of public money while small works elsewhere were ignored. The Vamsadhara and Nagavali water could not be used and the project has been pending since long,” Mr. Rao said.

MLA Kakani Govardhan Reddy, in Nellore, said that Mr. Naidu was trying to create unrest in the State.

“The concept of self-financing is nothing but real estate business. It is not farmers who are going to benefit out of Amaravati, but the TDP leaders who purchased lands around the capital. None of them is a farmer. Even those who attacked our MLAs and MP are not farmers but TDP workers and hired hands,” he said. .",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/decentralisation-is-need-of-the-hour-ysrcp-mlas/article30919354.ece

460,2020/02/26,Data | Which districts registered the most C-section deliveries?,"While medically justified caesarean section births help prevent maternal mortality, the World Health Organization (WHO) insists that the rate of C-sections in a region should not exceed 15%. An analysis of C-section rates as of 2016 reveals that most districts in southern States exceed the WHO recommendation by a huge margin. In the north, northeast and central States, the WHO rate is not exceeded by much in public hospitals but a high rate in private hospitals has pushed up the overall figure.

Prevalent in the south

The graph plots the % of births delivered by C-section in districts across all States. All the districts in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala recorded a C-section % above both the WHO’s recommended rate of 15% and the Indian average of 17.2%. Such districts are marked by a red circle.

461,2020/02/26,Check out these gourmet treats and meals for pets,"The rise of gourmet pet food brands proves that owners are increasingly becoming particular about what goes into their pets’ meals

Two-year-old Kub, a playful Labrador, ‘monches’ carob nibs in his vegan Poca Poca. Containing peanut butter, apple, oat flour and flax seed powder, it is a significant upgrade from brittle dog biscuits and chewy rawhide bones off a supermarket shelf.

With the humanisation of pets (they are called ‘fur babies and ‘furends’ now), dogs now attend doga (dog yoga), participate in pool parties and have expensive spa days. So, not surprisingly, gourmet pet food is finding more takers, as the market looks for nutritious, tasty and imaginative alternatives to bowls of dry pellets.

“People now don’t like being called pet owners. They call themselves pet parents. And just as they are conscious about eating healthy, they also make sure to check what goes into their fur babies’ food,” says Chef Samir Singla, who in December 2019, started Chennai-based Tail Tale, which he describes as “an all natural and humanised pet food retail brand”.

A former chef with the ITC group, Samir says his ingredients are from free-range, farmer-friendly sources. This comprises whole and ancient grains such as karanguruvai rice, barnyard millet, amaranth, quinoa and barley from farms in Chengelpettu area. Butter nut squash, sweet potato, moringa leaves, pulses too feature prominently in his ingredient list.

The menu at Tail Tale has 12 treats (Apple Pretz, Chucky Cheese, Yummy Gummy, TM Ladoo , Baked Fries, Bon Bons...) and six balanced meals consisting of chicken, mutton, pork, beef and a vegetarian Kerala meal, all priced between ₹175 and ₹950 per meal.

“It took me two years of research to come up with this,” says Samir, adding, “I got in touch with Dr G Dhinakar Raj, Director, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University. He suggested a few tests that we could do in his lab, like myotoxins and micro biology tests, and we found the food safe for human consumption too,” explains Samir.

During his research he also found that kibble, frequently fed to pets, may not be the best option. “Most of the animals used in the preparation of it are injected with chemicals. Chemicals are also added to kill pathogens, and to bring up the nutritional level,” he says.

Across the country

Abhishek Agarwal, 32, who started DawgieBowl, a subscription-based meal plan for dogs and cats, in Noida, grew up in a family with more pets than humans. “I was used to fur on my clothes and face licks,” he laughs. His dogs were on a semi-balanced home-cooked diet. But later, as an adult living away from home, working crazy hours in corporate jobs, he found it a challenge to keep a pet.

“The day I decided to finally adopt a dog, one of the important questions that popped up was, what is he/she going to eat?” he says, adding “I always knew that packaged pet foods were bad. So I started looking for a worthy pet food brand, or a way to process food in bulk and store it to feed my pet over time.”

He started research on what an ideal diet should be: it involved understanding the needs of a pet, the fundamentals of nutrition, food processing methods, regulations and policies, nutrition labels...

Abhishek used eveything he learnt to prepare food for the dogs on his street and friends’ pets. Eventually, requests started coming in. “People saw value in what I was making. Better yet, they were ready to pay a fair price for it, starting at ₹1,399 for dogs and ₹1,099 for cats.

Thus, came about DawgieBowl, launched on International Dog Day, August 26, 2016. “Today we have an industrial facility with a production capacity of over 500 kilograms per day. We serve over 160 pets on subscription and about three dozen on an ad-hoc basis every month, with orders also pouring in from Lucknow, Jaipur and Bhopal. Additionally, we offer vacuum-dried pet food, that is 100% natural, species-appropriate, balanced and complete, ready-to-serve, with no by-products, gluten, corn or soy-based fillers, preservatives, colours, flavours or taste enhancers like MSG,” he says.

At DawgieBowl, food is portioned into daily packs based on the dog’s nutritional needs. This also removes the risk of overfeeding or starving the pet due to unregulated feeding. There is no menu. When customers sign up, they provide details about their pets. Meals are customised to suit their life stage and lifestyle, explains Abhishek.

Gourmet pet food makers also address allergies and health concerns. While R&D is underway at Tail Tale for Prescription Diets, DawgieBowl is already at it, customising meals to address medical concerns.

City-based Uthra Ravikanth, who became one of the pioneers of the home-cooked pet food retail model in the city when she launched Pawtastic in April 2016, swears by the wonders of a home-cooked meal. “My older dog had a lot of allergies. But after I shifted her to home made meals, it made a world of difference to her health.”

Now, Uthra creates meals for other pets too. “Pet parents reach out to us for consultation regarding allergies and other health issues. I have catered to pets who had obesity and helped them lose weight. Then there were puppies that needed to put on weight and pets with hip dysplasia. We have to be careful about what we feed them.”

Uthra is currently pursuing an online course on Canine Nutrition and Holistic Wellbeing. At her unit in Pallikarnai, fresh food (priced at ₹220 for 500 grams) is prepared every day. “The recipe in most of my client’s cases is what has been suggested by the vet, in terms of the meat and vegetables to include. We source fresh meat in the morning and cook the food which is then delivered in the afternoon to the respective houses.” Her recipes use brown rice, vegetables, fish and meat. In addition to meals, Pawtastic also has preservative-free treats like sardine, chicken feet, beef and tuna jerky. And as you would add seasoning to your food, here, pets have the option of adding sardine flakes to up the taste.

While, for long, generic packaged food was the only option for busy ‘hoomans’, the recent spate of new companies offering healthy alternatives is making pet parenting easier.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/v7lewp/article30922092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MPDogs,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/check-out-these-gourmet-treats-and-meals-for-pets/article30922103.ece
462,2020/02/26,"Early humans lived in northern India 80,000 years ago","This finding is important in the face of competing theories on the first presence of human populations in different regions of the world and on human dispersal from Africa.

An archaeological excavation carried out in the trenches at Dhaba in the upper Son river valley in central India has found evidence of human occupation in this area almost 80,000 years ago. The international team of researchers found evidence of the continuous presence of humans in this region between 80,000 years ago and 65,000 years ago.

“The lithic industry from Dhaba strongly resembles stone tool assemblages from the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Arabia, and the earliest artefacts from Australia, suggesting that it is likely the product of Homo sapiens as they dispersed eastward out of Africa,” wrote the authors of the study published in Nature Communications on February 25.

This finding is important in the face of competing theories on the first presence of human populations in different regions of the world and on human dispersal from Africa.

About 74,000 years ago, the Toba volcanic super-eruption, centred around Sumatra, is believed to have caused an almost decade-long spell of cold weather — a volcanic winter — across many parts of the Earth. There is an argument that this induced winter not only led to the cooling of the Earth’s surface for almost a thousand years since the eruption, but also destroyed huge populations of hominins.

“The explosion was the largest in the last 2 million years,” Michael Petraglia from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany, who is a corresponding author of the paper, wrote in an e-mail to The Hindu. “It was assumed that it led to dramatic climate change and it would have decimated populations across Asia. However, the archaeological evidence from India do not support these theories,” he added.

The hypothesis is that the ‘volcanic winter’ caused a bottleneck in the gene pool of humans, because only a few survived who were in Africa at the time. Later, this population is believed to have emerged from Africa and colonised different parts of the world. However, the present study rules out this hypothesis as it implies that a population of early humans inhabited northern India even before the date of the eruption (74,000 years ago) and continued through the period of the devastation and until much later.

“We know from fossil evidence that modern humans were already out of Africa by 200,000 years ago in Greece, in Arabia and China by 80-100,000 years ago, Sumatra by soon after the Toba eruption and Australia by 65,000 years ago,” Chris Clarkson of the University of Queensland, Australia, the lead author of the study, wrote in an e-mail. “This [study] contradicts the common view that modern humans spread out of Africa only in the last 50,000 years,” he added.

The excavation unearthed a large tool industry spanning the period of the Toba super-eruption. The large Megalithic tools were dated between approximately 80,000 years and 65,000 years and the small tools were dated at approximately 50,000 years suggesting a continuous inhabiting of this region by humans undisturbed by the super-eruption. Further the similarity of the tools to ones found earlier in Africa and Arabia led the researchers to infer that they were made by Homo sapiens.

“Our finds of stone tools that are very similar to those in Arabia, Israel and Africa and even Australia associated with earlier modern humans suggests these were likely the products of modern humans,” Prof. Clarkson wrote. “The fact that we find these before and after the Toba eruption with no apparent change in technology indicates that major eruptions like Toba appear not to have had a catastrophic effect on small hunter-gatherer bands living in India at the time,” he added.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/vjrpa5/article30924040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Son-RIVER-TRENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/early-humans-lived-in-northern-india-80000-years-ago/article30924041.ece

The talk will be held on March 1, 3.30 pm, at Katte - The Creative Community, Indiranagar. The Science Café is organised by the Communications Office at the Bangalore Life Science Cluster (BLiSC). It is free and open to all.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ood7qu/article30922955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGMIISC2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/all-things-scientific/article30922960.ece
464,2020/02/26,"Singapore develops antibody test to detect novel coronavirus infection, disease","Antibodies produced by the immune system in response to infection will be present in the blood for a long time

Using an antibody test developed by the Duke-NUS Medical School that relies on blood samples, the Singapore Ministry of Health has been successful in identifying two people who were infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and have since recovered. The antibody test can be used for detecting people infected with novel coronavirus but are asymptomatic or exhibit only mild symptoms. The Singapore Ministry of Health announced this during a press conference on Tuesday.

In an email to The Hindu, Danielle Anderson, Scientific Director of the Duke-NUS ABSL3 facility, said the “sensitivity and specificity should be 100% since we have two parallel tests to ensure that we do not capture false negatives/positives.”

Unlike the currently used molecular test that detects the presence of viral genetic material in oral swab samples, the diagnostic test developed by Duke-NUS Medical School detects antibodies developed by the immune system when infected with the novel coronavirus.

“Antibodies will start appearing in the body starting a few days after infection and will peak in about two-three weeks after infection. [So] The test may not be able to detect antibodies if the person is tested too soon after infection,” Dr. Anderson explained.

While the currently used molecular test has low sensitivity and cannot identify people who have recovered from COVID-19 illness as they will no longer harbour the virus, antibodies produced by the immune system in response to infection will be present in the blood for a long time. This makes the antibody test particularly important to trace even people who have recovered from illness.

“We developed assays which are not new assays but using them in this context we could look for antibodies in patients. We could trace back patients who have been infected previously,” Dr. Anderson said during the press conference.

Explaining how the antibody test is carried out, Dr. Anderson said in the email: “The live coronavirus is tested against the antibodies present in the patients’ samples. If there are antibodies against the coronavirus, the antibodies will prevent the coronavirus from replicating. This is a definitive readout of the patient being previously infected by the virus because you will not have antibodies against the virus if you have never been infected by it before.”

On January 30, the Duke-NUS Medical School announced that in collaboration with other institutions/hospital it had successfully cultured the novel coronavirus from an infected person, thus becoming the third country outside China to do so.

According to the Ministry of Health release, the researchers had used the virus and genetic material derived from the virus to “develop several specific laboratory tests to detect the virus-specific antibodies for contact tracing and other applications”.

The antibody test was put to use to confirm past infection (late January) with novel coronavirus in two people who have since recovered. Two different antibody testing platforms (virus neutralisation assay and ELISA assay) were used to confirm past infection. This became possible as these people, despite having recovered from COVID-19 illness, still had “very high levels of the virus-specific antibodies in their blood”.

The positive test result in the two people helped the Health Ministry to establish the links between two church clusters and the source of infection.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k7k9hf/article30821777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/singapore-develops-antibody-test-to-detect-novel-coronavirus-infection-disease/article30920499.ece
