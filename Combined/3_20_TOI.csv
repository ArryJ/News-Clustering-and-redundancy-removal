Independent artistes Chandan Shetty All.OK and ViRaj Kannadiga are all set to make their silver screen debuts as composers with the upcoming Kannada films Pogaru Bengalur Boys and Omelette , respectively.Amid enjoying life as a newly-wed, Chandan Shetty has also been busy composing music for the Dhruva Sarja-starrer Pogaru. “In the Indie scene, you release a single every now and then, which is a song, that you compose, sing and feature in the video. But when you are working on a film, there are multiple factors that come into play — the hero, heroine, story, situations or a context a song fits into and so on and so forth. You brainstorm with lyricists, the director and the rest of the team to ensure the best output and rope in the most suited singers for the same. That has been a great learning,” says Chandan.Foregoing his characteristic EDM, hip-hop style, he has experimented with new genres for Pogaru. “The protagonist, played by Dhruva, is far from the conventional hero character, and is more rugged than romantic. So, we needed songs that enhanced the massy, local flavour of the narrative. I have used traditional percussion instruments to create that ambience. There are some dance numbers to watch out for,” he explains.Kempirve-fame director Venkat Bharadwaj’s Omelette will not only mark musician ViRaj Kannadiga’s filmi debut as composer, but it will also be his first onscreen outing. “I am composing the title track — a youthful rap number that provides a quirky, fun take on life by drawing parallels to an omelette,” says ViRaj.He shares that his biggest takeaway from the experience has been learning how to cater a song to the requirements put forth by the filmmakers. “While the title track does not directly relate to the story, the experience has taught me to make music for specific requirements. As an independent artiste, you tend to pursue only the ideas that interest you. But in movies, the compositions have to be in sync with what the filmmakers are trying to convey,” he explains.Musician All.OK is no stranger to film music, he has, after all, sung playback earlier. But with the upcoming film Bengalur Boys, he turns composer and is excited about showcasing his prowess with diverse musical genres. “While there will be a rap song, we will also showcase nouveau genres like Chill-hop, Techno, and House, which haven’t been explored that often in Sandalwood . The film’s story is youthful and we want the tracks to reflect the same. I am also looking at featuring new artistes on the album and using it as a platform to introduce talent,” says All.OK.Independent artistes coming into film is a good sign, he adds. “Artistes like Anirudh and Hiphop Tamizha are the perfect examples. They were successful artistes and then went on to make a name as composers too. Even rapper Eminem composed for a mainstream Hollywood project, which he won accolades for.

But with the Covid-19 pandemic shutting all film and TV production in most parts of the country, her plans were derailed. The actress, who was cooped up in the house as part of the show for a month without access to her phone or other tech gadgets, tells us, “None of the participants knew the extent of the pandemic until Paras (Chhabra) updated us about what was happening outside. Honestly, it was scary to hear about the partial shutdown. Then, earlier this week, policemen come to the set and told us to stop production. In the next few hours, the finale of the show was conducted and then all of us packed up and got ready to return home. I took an 11 pm flight the same night, reached Bengaluru and headed home. Ever since, I have been practising social distancing and catching up on all the episodes of the show. ”While her stint on the show was short-lived,says that she got what she set out to achieve. “Those 32 days (her duration in the house) were a really good, learning experience. When I joined the show, no one really knew me in Mumbai. But when I was heading home this week, a lot of people outside the set and at the airport were calling out to me.

4,['20/03/2020'],"Director Fazil: After the first climax was shot, I felt the film won’t run, so re-did it with a new script","I have often had bold, independent women in my films, be it Girly of Nokketha Doorathu Kannum Nattu or Maya Vinodini of Ente Sooryaputhrikku. The period between 1985 and 95 was a time of change in Malayalam cinema, and the atmosphere, I remember, urged me to think of brave themes for films too. Even 10 years earlier, I might not have make many of my films that I did during this time. The 90s was also a time when women were slowly showing a boldness in real-life too and so, the timing of Ente Sooryaputhrikku was just right.As everyone knows, this is the first Malayalam film of Amala Akkineni. I knew her even before she joined movies, as a talented dance student of Kalakshetra. She had an interest in acting too and so, I had her in mind for a role. When I developed the script of Ente Sooryaputhrikku, I felt she is the right fit for the character of Maya Vinodhini and roped her in. As she isn’t a Malayali, as an incentive for her, I made the film in Malayalam and Tamil.I remember we could pick exactly the right actors for each of the roles in the film. As K S Vasundhara Devi, the Carnatic singer who is the mother of Amala’s character, I could think of nobody else by Srividya . She is the daughter of singer M L Vasanthakumari and had an aura about her that was just right for the character. Suresh Gopi , who played Maya’s love interest Dr Srinivasan, wasn’t the superstar that he later became. Ente Sooryaputhrikku is a women-oriented film and what I wanted was a male protagonist who wasn’t a full-blown hero. Suresh wasn’t too busy at that time. He used to do all kinds of roles and it was a period of growth for him. I felt he is the perfect fit for Dr Srinivasan and he proved it with the performance. Same goes for all the other characters.An episode from the shoot that remains etched to my mind is the climax shoot of Ente Sooryaputhrikku. In the first version of my script, the final scene, in which she murders the villains, wasn’t there. My script had Maya declaring the truth about her parents in a speech and we had shot it too. But when I saw the film with that particular climax after the shoot, I felt it won’t have a good run in theatres… this version doesn’t give the film a strong pre-climax or climax. That got me worked up. I spoke to Amala and asked her for an extra 20 days of shoot. I wrote an altogether new climax scene and as one would say, she gave a thattupolippan prakadanam as well. And that’s what the film had in theatres. The new climax was well worth it.- As told to",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74709992,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-402793/74709992.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/director-fazil-after-the-first-climax-was-shot-i-felt-the-film-wont-run-so-re-did-it-with-a-new-script/articleshow/74709934.cms

6,['20/03/2020'],Meet the sparrow warriors of Tamil Nadu,"The humble tiny bird, house sparrow, whose chirping was hitherto an integral part of our lives has been missing from our homes and neighbourhood. The bird, which co-existed with human beings for so long, is now unable to cope with the decline in nesting spaces, felling of trees, and mindless construction activities, and their population has been dwindling at an alarming rate.But what’s heartening is that people are gradually realising the fact and are working on war footing to save these tiny birds from extinction. Here are a few sparrow warriors from namma Tamil Nadu who have been tirelessly working to bring back the sparrows…I was always interested in birds and animals. As I grew up, I realised that some animals and birds that I used to see often as a child, were missing now, and especially, the sparrows. So, I started the Sparrow Conservation Movement – Refuge for Feathered Guests in 2012. I began experimenting with boxes as sparrow nests. I first made a box with used cardboard boxes. This was followed by boxes made of clay and plywood. We finally picked the right bird box, which was 9 inches tall, 4 inches wide, with a 32mm opening. I make these boxes whenever I find the time. I have given away more than 1,000 boxes free till now. Sparrows spend a lot of time in the nest while laying eggs and hatching them. The young ones stay inside until they take their first flight, which is usually in 21 days. One you put up the sparrow box, stop taking pictures and checking if there are eggs. If you do that, the sparrows will fly away. — B Pandiarajan, Sparrow Conservation Foundation, CoimbatoreOur living room in Perambur had a small enclosure that was left open for the sparrows. It’s my mother who pointed it out to me that their numbers have been dwindling. When I made a few nests and put them up there they were occupied by sparrows the very next day. For me, every day is a sparrow day. At my mother’s place in Besant Nagar, we put up a nest in 2016. We have already had at least three generations of sparrows there. Lack of food, water, and shelter has been a major setback for the sparrows. Sparrows help in keeping the mosquito population in check. Sparrows can avoid a lot of vector-borne diseases as well. My mission this year is to make 10,000 feeders. I have been creating awareness about sparrows among school kids and teaching them to make feeders using discarded plastic bottles. At homes, the least we can do is to keep bird feeders and water bowls—Sadhana Rajkumar, Sparrow Conservationist, ChennaiOn every World Sparrow Day, we reach out to the public to spread awareness about the bird. We started this as a practice in 2012 and for the last eight years, we have been distributing around 500 boxes every year. But only 10 per cent of the boxes are in good condition as people tend to buy these boxes out of excitement, but fail to provide a conducive environment for the birds to live. We provide three types of artificial nests — mud pots, shoe boxes, and wooden boxes. People still don’t know the importance of the bird in the ecosystem. The change in the building structures is one of the primary reasons for the dwindling of sparrows. People are increasingly putting up nets to escape from mosquitoes. This prevents the entry of sparrows into the houses.- M Rajesh, professor, sparrow lover, MaduraiAlong with Dr Priyatharshini Rajendran from Lady Doak College and K Renuka Devi, I have been doing research on house sparrows. We have visited 13 blocks in Madurai and had found 2,571 sparrows in the preliminary survey. We chose 168 villages out of the 420 villages in Madurai last year for our research and were shocked to find that only 109 villages had sparrows. The primary reasons behind the decline are the decrease in the nesting space and change in the building structure. Today, most of the buildings are air-conditioned and do have not have ledges or vents for sparrows to come and sit. Food availability, too, has become a major concern as the pesticide used in the farms, kills the worms and insects, which are the primary food for sparrows. Sparrows are omnivores but feed the young ones with different kinds of food based on their age.- P Merlynna Ester, sparrow researcher, Madurai1.Nest to be fixed inside the verandah, balcony or in a sheltered car park.2. See that squirrels, cats and crows do not have easy access to the nest.3. The nest has to be fixed at a height of 10 feet.4. The opening of the nest should preferably be facing the south or west.

12,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus Shutdown: Revellers defy advisories for 'lockdown parties',"The novel coronavirus has forced many cities around the world to go under lockdown. However, not everyone is practicing social distancing. Even though 'stay home' is probably the most oft repeated and important advisory to stop the spread of coronavirus, from American spring breakers in Miami to 'lockdown parties' in countries across Europe, many are defying rules, with no regard for safety.In stark contrast to these revellers are the Italians, who have been living under a strict lockdown and warning others to not make the same mistakes they did. In one video, the quarantined residents are giving their past selves and other countries messages to not take the situation lightly.For many in Europe, it’s time for ""lockdown parties"", ""end of the world drinking sessions"" and ""corona speakeasies"". This has been seen mainly in Berlin, known for its non-stop partying culture, apart from other parts of Germany. There have been reports of closed bars taping up windows and locking doors, only allowing guests who have registered, or who deliver a specific knock on the door. The Berlin police have warned that if this continues it will ""trigger a police operation"".Last week, in pubs across Belgium, thousands of people gathered for one last drink before the pubs were shut down because of coronavirus. Similar lockdown parties were reported in France as well.The government has banned mass gatherings in New Zealand, but that hasn’t stopped the party crowd. Students from University of Otago held a large St Patrick's Day party and to make matters worse, the venue was just metres from a school which was forced to close due to a confirmed case of coronavirus. Students posted pictures on social media, with one even reportedly captioning a picture as, ""on our way to catch corona"".The Dunedin university students are pushing ahead with plans for the annual Hyde Street party on April 4 , which is traditionally attended by thousands of students.Despite advice to follow social distancing, hundreds of spring breakers were seen flocking to Florida. Pictures and videos showed that the beaches were packed with college students. While some said that ""they should have more to do than sit at home"", many Americans agreed that it was a dangerous and ""dumb"" thing to do. In a widely shared CBS video, spring breakers were giving their reasons to come out and party. ""If I get corona, I get corona... at the end of the day, I’m not going to let it stop me from partying,"" said one, while another added, ""We’re just trying to roll with it. We’re just living for the moment."" Another video by a travel company shows more than 200 spring breakers having fun on a cruise ship near Nassau, Bahamas.A restaurant chain in Washington, DC has said that it will defy the mayor's orders to limit gatherings and said that its outlets will remain open. While it promised that it will take ""stricter safety precautions to protect our guests"", the management said that it will not bow down to pressure from any group trying to shut them down. Their statement also read, ""It is not our burden to bear, nor is it our staffs’ burden to bear.""For a group of British tourists in Spain nothing, not even corona, comes in the way of getting some sun at the beach. In a video from the seaside resort town of Benidorm, Spain, the group was seen defying lockdown and taunting police officers who were trying to get them back inside. Some were filmed chanting ""we've all got the flu, na na na na!""",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74715089,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-887121/74715089.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/coronavirus-shutdown-revellers-defy-advisories-for-lockdown-parties/articleshow/74714766.cms

""I received a call from my dad two hours later saying they were at the mall, shopping,"" reveals Anubhav, adding, ""I was aghast. When people are supposed to be practising social distancing, my very educated and aware parents were out in a public place. When I tried to admonish them for it, they said I was fear-mongering."" The Kumars' case isn’t isolated. Millennials say that they are having a hard time convincing their parents to stay at home and take the virus threat seriously. With the number of COVID-19 cases in India crossing 170, most cities have shut educational institutions, cinema halls, and even monuments, while offices are encouraging people to work from home. Since the virus spreads through contact, isolation and social distancing are among the best methods to prevent its spread. But many people are finding it hard to explain the gravity of the situation to their parents.Zeeshan Khan, an IT consultant working in Gurgaon, tells us, ""My father was going for his morning walks and my mother – a lawyer – was refusing to work from home. Till Tuesday, she was going to office. For them, stay at home advisories are a result of hype and ‘we should not panic about an illness that has affected just a few people’. Trying to explain to them that cases could rise anytime was futile.""There have also been arguments at many homes because of the travel plans. ""I fought with my parents on Tuesday morning. They had a flight to Rajkot that night. My mother had a work engagement and my dad was accompanying her for some sightseeing. They were just not getting why I was reacting the way I was, and were more fixated on: 'Agar cancel karaaya toh we will lose Rs 20,000'. I said I would pay for it and convinced them to stay back,"" says 26-year-old Aakriti, who works in Noida.People say that their parents think they are overreacting by staying at home and practising social distancing.

So why should we worry?'"" Kaushik Sharma, whose septuagenarian parents are vacationing in Himachal, says, ""Their generation believes they are tough, and while I don’t argue with it, they were tough when they were young.

Funnily enough, when my uncle told them the same thing the next day, they relented. I guess they still think I’m their kid so they know more than me.""And this dynamic means that arguments and advices aren’t well received. ""The worst thing is that you can’t argue. People have died. I have friends living overseas who tell me how bad things there are. We have to avoid reaching that state and hence, we need to stay at home.

I write this while in productively happy and complete self-quarantine. I’m back to a regular routine of yoga, walking, reading, painting, sculpting, cooking, meditating, listening to music, praying and writing. Today, I review this Vashi restaurant. I lunched there with my well-travelled #foodieblinddate couple — businessman Hari Ramnath and lifestyle writer Gita Hari, who curates Sattvik Tambrahm recipes for food promotions at five star hotels. Committed vegetarians, their ‘favourites’ list has Gujarati-Rajasthani thali right at the top. Our review follows.Simply done up, spacious room. A few dolls depicting folklore. Dhoti and turban-wearing waiters bustle around.In our thali meal, it was the traditional Gujarati winter specialty, Surti undhiyu, bursting with plump purple yam, raw banana and steamed chickpea muthia that was authentic and came up tops. The Gujarati daal and kadhi passed the acid test of the perfect kiss of sweetness. Mellow with ghee Kathiyawadi khichdi, delicious with sweet churma, the Rajasthani dal baati delighted. As did the mildly spiced rajma udad masala.Inattentive service! We had to keep requesting for repeats. Also, (Gita Hari took meticulous notes) we were not served all the farsans in the menu. Salad of papaya marcha dahi papdi chaat was left out. It was the same with the desserts. Insipid Mewari paneer and greasy aloo chips. Cold phulka, puris, rotla and chilla.We had great expectations. Over the years, Rajdhani has built up a reputation for excellent food and service (see the box to know how my #foodieblinddate Jyoti Kasliwal guided me to the most superlative thali meal in Rajdhani Lohar Chawl area in the early 90s). Though some of the dishes on the winter thali menu delighted, many were lacklustre, some not served at all and others served cold. Service left a lot to be desired. We are all fans of the thali and, in Gita Hari’s words, request Rajdhani to “buckle up and reboot!”Satara Plaza, Ground Floor, 7, Palm Beach Road, Vashi, Navi MumbaiContact: 022 27843333Timings: 12 pm - 3.30 pm;7 pm - 11 pmAverage meal for two: Rs.1000 (delivery available)With several businesses temporarily shutting because of the novel coronavirus , either voluntarily or in accordance with local regulations, we suggest that you call the restaurant and confirm if it is open before visiting.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74710571,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-102125/74710571.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/restaurant-review-rajdhani/articleshow/74710485.cms

However, the Coronavirus outbreak has left the family rattled, especially due to their proximity to Italy, one of the countries that’s heavily hit by COVID-19.Celina tells BT, “Due to proximity to Italian borders, everyone here is taking extreme measures to follow the government’s directions. Even as I am worried about the way the virus is spreading, I am relieved that our estate is located high on the Alps.”Celina says that she’s thankful for her husband’s foresight. “We were prepared well in advance — even prior to Austria’s chancellor announcing major restrictions on movement in public places on Sunday, banning gatherings of more than five persons, urging Austrians to self-isolate and putting further limits on who can enter the country. As of now, we can only leave the house for urgent work, to buy necessary food supplies or to help others. Austrians are taking care of themselves and the roads and malls are all deserted. It is fascinating to see how cooperative people are,” she shares.While city-dwellers have no option other than self-isolation, Celina feels fortunate that she gets to enjoy the greens around her estate. She says, “Life on the Alpine mountains is blessed. Though we are under curfew, we have beautiful mountains, brooks, orchards, gardens and a winter garden within our property. I am enjoying my solo time in the alpine woods.”The former Miss India, who has been a part of films like No Entry, Golmaal Returns and Thank You among others, is also using this forced break to teach her children about India. She elaborates, “I am taking great pleasure in homeschooling the boys and teaching them Sanskrit and Hindi, besides their school curriculum. My sons are fascinated by Indian culture and I am also educating them about ancient and modern Indian history. As far as their school is concerned, study material and assignments are being sent via email. Children have access to their teachers online, too.”She signs off saying, “This time alone and with the family has truly helped me get over from my parents’ untimely demise last year.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74712724,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-97277/74712724.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/due-to-proximity-to-italian-borders-we-are-taking-extreme-measures-celina-jaitley/articleshow/74712724.cms

Gurmeet Singh, a Rohini-based MBA student, explains, ""I kept trying to explain to my parents why taking a vacation right now was a bad idea, but they wouldn't listen. Funnily enough, when my uncle told them the same thing the next day, they relented. I guess they still think I’m their kid so they know more than me.""And this dynamic means that arguments and advices aren’t well received. ""The worst thing is that you can’t argue. People have died. I have friends living overseas who tell me how bad things there are. We have to avoid reaching that state and hence, we need to stay at home. So I do get annoyed when they take it lightly and sometimes I lose my temper. The moment that happens, the conversation shifts to how I am being disrespectful.

25,['20/03/2020'],"Happiness is infectious. Let us spread this infection, say Tolly celebs","As we go through one of our biggest crises in decades as a race, the occasion of International Day of Happiness today becomes all the more significant. This year the theme is — happier together. The message of solidarity, inclusiveness and sensitivity is not lost upon some of the creative souls of Kolkata, who shared their happiness mantra with CT. Read, share and be inspired.You can find happiness anytime, anywhere. It’s all in the mind. There’s too much hatred and disturbances all around, so one must try to embrace happiness with open arms. I try to be happy with whatever I have and not think about what I don’t. It is also important to forgive yourself at times. Being with positive-minded people, pets, my family and friends makes me happy. But then, it’s a collective endeavour. Like, a project can be successful only if all the actors work towards it. Whenever I hear the word “action” on the set, there’s a smile on my face. Likewise, I try to entertain as many people as possible with my acting skills.I believe happiness is a sign of an enlightened mind. And dance is the reflection of a happy soul. I have learnt to nurture happiness in me. That is the main source of energy, which I put into my art. Today, it is difficult to have a peaceful, content life. But we must still try. Mother nature is the greatest dancer. I’ve observed her closely and realised that nature’s happiness comes from unconditional love for her creation. My life, too, revolves around creative art forms, like dance, music, painting and more. We must remember that happiness is infectious. Let us spread this infection and bring down the darkness around us.I believe the secret to happiness is freedom, and the secret to freedom is courage. You need courage to let go of unpleasant memories. Try not to compare your success or failure with others. Be appreciative, love with grace and gratitude. True happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. We, as filmmakers, are blessed that we can tell stories and can make millions experience a sense of happiness through our narratives. I have grown up watching such films. So, I ensure that my stories give my audience a sense of happiness and encouragement to explore life — and seek happiness within.Happiness is a relative term and perhaps cannot be explained at times — one can become ecstatic or also even shed ""tears of joy"". I think happiness is a state of mind that gives an individual a sense of fulfilment and positivity. I believe music has the ability to bring people from diverse backgrounds under one roof — irrespective of religion, ethnicity, age or financial status, and elevate them to a mental state devoid of any stress. Hence for that duration, the only vibes that prevail among them are togetherness and love for each other. It has been proven that music can help people overcome loneliness, jealousy, hatred, criminal activities and in some cases, even physical pain. The only feeling that prevails is — unadulterated happiness.Be it on stage or behind the camera, when I am painting or while preparing for a new project — I am the happiest when I’m working. I’ve been brought up in a beautiful environment, where there was a community feeling, love and respect. These values have shaped me as a person. For me, happiness is to make sure that everyone around me is happy. I try and find the good in people, as I believe our purpose here is to be happy — not individually, but as a community.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74725517,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-95367/74725517.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/happiness-is-infectious-let-us-spread-this-infection/articleshow/74711378.cms
26,['20/03/2020'],"Ministry ignores NCBC dissent, insists on adding ‘salary’ in creamy layer calculation","NEW DELHI: In what signals a deepening confrontation between the government and the top OBC oversight panel, Union social justice ministry has reiterated its proposal to redefine “creamy layer” by including “salary” in its calculation, ignoring the demand of the National Commission for Backward Classes that it be reconsidered.

Sources said social justice ministry sent back to the NCBC its Cabinet note which states that “salary” should be part of “gross income” of an OBC family which determines whether it falls in the “creamy layer”. It is a big departure from the 1993 Office Memorandum which lays down that “agricultural income” and “salary” will not form part of the “wealth test” which defines “creamy layer”.

“Creamy layer” is the affluent category among OBCs which is ineligible for 27% Mandal reservations and inclusion of “salary” would more easily put an OBC household in that segment. This implication has rendered the proposed change controversial and politically sensitive.

The ministry’s note raised the hackles of the NCBC, which is the oversight body on policies for OBC welfare. As reported by TOI online on March 9, the commission asked the ministry to redraft its note by dropping the proposal for inclusion of “salary” in “gross income”. It argued that such a move would work against the interests of the OBCs who are so categorised on the basis of social and educational backwardness, and not economic backwardness.

But what conveys a clash between the two arms of OBC welfare on the issue, the ministry is learnt to have ignored the dissent conveyed by the NCBC and has underscored that “salary” should be made part of “gross income”.

The OBC panel had also recommended that income ceiling for “creamy layer” should be increased to Rs 16 lakh “net income” annually as against the ministry’s proposal to peg it at Rs 12 lakh gross income from the present Rs 8 lakh. “Net income” means income after the deduction of income tax. The income ceiling is revised every three years and was last done in 2017.

Sources said social justice ministry had asked the NCBC to give its views by Monday but the deadline has not been heeded.

The contentious revision is rooted in the recommendations of an expert committee which was constituted in March 2019 to revisit and simplify the 1993 OM. As reported by TOI, the expert committee suggested that Income Tax Act be made the benchmark to calculate the creamy layer for all OBCs. The I-T Act includes “salary” and “other sources” but leaves out “agri income”.

The government argues that its proposed initiative would simplify the 1993 OM which has been a source of controversies. Confusion over the 1993 OM arose after the Centre over last six years started including “salary” in the gross income of OBCs from PSU background while continuing to exclude it in case of OBCs working in state and central governments.

Different zones have temporarily cancelled over 200 trains and railways also announced suspending concessional booking of all tickets including that of senior citizens to discourage non-essential travel.Railway ministry officials said the concessions have been suspended to avoid overcrowding of trains. The railways have appealed to people to avoid non-essential travel. “Out of the 53 category of concessions now only 15 categories can avail it. This is for a temporary period due to Covid-19,” said a railway ministry official.An official statement said in order to contain the spread of Covid-19 virus and to minimise the travel related risks to elderly citizens, Indian Railways has withdrawn concessional booking of tickets to senior citizens for unreserved and reserved segment form Friday morning till further notice. “For railway tickets already purchased before 00:00 hrs March 20, 2020, in case of travel, no difference in fare shall be collected,” it said.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, both the Central Railway and Western Railway announced suspension of the services of air-conditioned local trains from Friday in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Ordinary train services would replace them.The IRCTC also cancelled all the three “private trains” it runs amidst the virus scare. Lucknow – Delhi Tejas Express, Ahmedabad-Mumbai Tejas Express and the newly launched Kashi Mahakal Express have been cancelled till March 31. The Kashi Mahakal Express was flagged off last month by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.These trains were introduced as a first step towards allowing private operators to run trains on the Indian Railways network. As per the proposal, nearly 150 trains by private operators would be allowed on 100 identified routes.Sources said they are staring at increasing revenue fall from passenger segment in the next couple of weeks as cancellation of tickets is on the rise and there are few fresh bookings.Parl panel chief issues clarification over reports railways was pulled up about Covid-19 repliesA day after media reports claimed that members of a parliamentary panel pulled up the railways and its chairman for not giving satisfactory replies on measures taken to contain the spread of Covid-19, its chairman issued a press release saying the committee appreciated the preparedness of the railways and other ministries.“The railway committee felt that though the representative of ministry of railways were called at a short notice, they came prepared with information about various measures taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus at railway stations and trains.

28,['20/03/2020'],Central Vista revamp: Govt proposes Shram Shakti Bhwana site for creating new office block for MPs,"NEW DELHI: The government has proposed to create office space for MPs where the Shram Shakti Bhawan is now located and it would be linked to the proposed new Parliament through a tunnel, according to some of the MPs who went through the latest presentation on the revamp of Central Vista on Thursday.

Sources said a detailed presentation about the project with particular focus on new Parliament was made before General Purposes Committee of the Lok Sabha. “We were told that there will be adequate office space for MPs in the new scheme of things. The planners said that the current Parliament has developed several problems and hence there is a need for a new Parliament. While MPs had no objection to the facilities that have been proposed for them in the new Parliament, some did not like the architecture, which seems to be “similar to that of Gujarat High Court”, said an MP, who did not wish to be named.

TOI has learnt that the government has prepared the roadmap to first vacate the plot occupied by the Indira Gandhi National Art Centre (IGNCA) where three new office blocks will come up. “In the first phase, offices in Udyog Bhawan , Nirman Bhawan and another building will be shifted so that redevelopment on these plots can start,” said a source,

Officials also said a decision is yet to be taken whether the Jawahar Bhawan, which houses external affairs ministry would be demolished as well for building a taller structure. There are also discussions whether Nirman Bhawan should be razed or the existing building should be revamped from inside.

Italy, with a population of 60 million, recorded at least 3,405 deaths, or roughly 150 more than in China — a country with a population over 20 times larger.Italy tallied 902 deaths in the last two days alone: 475 on Wednesday and 427 on Thursday. The total number of cases rose to 41,035 from a previous 35,713, up nearly 15%, a faster rate of growth than seen over the last three days, the Civil Protection Agency said.Italy reached the bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged, recorded no new infections. The worldwide toll crept towards 10,000 as the total number of infections topped 220,000, including nearly 85,000 people who have recovered.A visiting Chinese Red Cross team criticised Italians’ failure to properly quarantine themselves and take the national lockdown seriously. The head of the delegation, Sun Shuopeng, said he was shocked to see so many people walking around, using public transportation and eating out. “Right now we need to stop all economic activity and we need to stop the mobility of people,” he said. “All people should be staying at home in quarantine.”Health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy’s high toll, key among them its large population of elderly people. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population, and the vast majority of its dead — 87% — were over 70.Spain has been the hardest-hit European country after Italy, and in Madrid a four-star hotel began operating as a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients. The Madrid Hotel Business Association said it has placed 40 hotels with room for 9,000 people at the service of the Madrid region. Spain on Thursday announced that virus deaths had jumped by nearly 30% over the past 24 hours to 803. The number of people who have contracted the disease has meanwhile grown by around 25% to 17,395.The British government, which was slow to react to the virus, has shifted gears and is now drawing up legislation giving itself new powers to detain people and restrict gatherings. The bill is expected to be approved by parliament next week.Meanwhile, the WHO warned that the virus is spreading quickly in Africa. “About 10 days ago we had about five countries” with the virus, said WHO’s Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti . Now 35 of Africa’s 54 countries have cases, with the total close to 650. It is an “extremely rapid evolution”, she said. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei planned to pardon 10,000 more prisoners to combat the virus. The country’s toll from coronavirus jumped to 1,284 on Thursday, with the total number of infections rising to 18,407. “Based on our information, every 10 minutes one person dies from the coronavirus and some 50 people become infected with the virus every hour in Iran,” Iran health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur tweeted.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74720863,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-181188,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/italy-reports-3405-deaths-150-more-than-chinas-despite-fewer-infections/articleshow/74720821.cms

33,['20/03/2020'],"Covid-19: 14-hr ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday, no need to hoard, don’t cut wages, PM Modi says","More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday rallied the nation for the fight against coronavirus , calling on citizens to observe a “janata curfew” by staying indoors on Sunday between 7am and 9pm as an expression of resolve to emphasise the need to reduce public interaction to the very minimum.In his much-awaited televised address, the PM minced no words in underlining the gravity of the threat and said there was no room for complacency as the seeming normalcy could be deceptive. “We have been tracking the trend of Covid-19 and have seen how the number of cases in other affected countries exploded after the initial trickle,” he said, making it clear that India should brace for the long haul.Modi was also forthright in stressing that the world was yet to find a cure for the pandemic and no medicine or vaccine was available. However, he said, the risk could be averted if people showed “resolve” and exercised “restraint”, emphasising on the cruciality of “social distancing” for citizens to protect themselves and others from being infected.“There is only one mantra — if we are healthy, then so will the world. Keeping away from crowds, staying at home, social distancing, is very necessary and effective,” he said before he buttressed his pitch for “social distancing” with the call for “janata curfew”.“If you feel nothing will happen and go to markets and walk around the streets, then you are endangering yourself and those close to you. I appeal that for a few weeks, step out only if it is very necessary. Work from home,” he said.The PM warned that optimism over low incidence so far might be misplaced and cautioned against the risk of smugness. “The whole of humankind is in danger and even during World War I and II, so many nations were not affected. In the last few days, there has been an atmosphere (mahaul) that we are safe, but complacency is not right. It is very necessary for every citizen to be alert,” he said.The warning against complacency and that the seeming normalcy could be deceptive comes at a time when the country is anxiously waiting to see whether it has been able to dodge “community transmission” of the disease when it spreads to people who have not been abroad or in contact with such people.The PM also asked citizens to record their appreciation for frontline workers like doctors and nurses, those at hospitals and airlines, railway and bus staff, media and home delivery riders by clapping, ringing bells or banging steel plates at doors and windows of their houses at 5pm on Sunday. “They are the last sentinel between Covid-19 and India... thank them by clapping, ringing bells or thalis, salute them,” he said.In his televised address, Modi warned there was no sure-fire cure, medicine or vaccine that offered protection against Covid-19 even as he urged people to put off non-essential visits to the doctor and reschedule surgeries that could be postponed.He appealed to employers not to remove people off the rolls and to maintain salaries as he said the disease and its economic impact would be hard on the middle, lower middle and poor classes. He said the government was trying to prevent the pattern experienced by some countries where Covid-19 cases spiked, posing a serious challenge to healthcare systems.“Some nations took necessary decisions and isolated their people. But the role of citizens is central. For a country like India, which is still in the developing stage, the danger posed by coronavirus is not ordinary. When big and developed nations have been hurt, it will be wrong to say it will have no effect on India,” he said.Describing Covid-19 as a “vaishwik mahamari (global pandemic)”, the PM said the restrictions announced by the Centre and states should be followed. He made a special appeal that senior citizens remain at home for the next few weeks and recalled the blackouts imposed by authorities during wartime and the drills during peace time. A “janata curfew”, he said, will be a test of self-restraint and will prepare people for forthcoming challenges.Modi asked the NCC NSS , youth organisations, civil society, sports and religious organisations to spread the word about the janata curfew. “This is a ‘kasauti’ (challenge) for India, to see our preparedness,” he said.Taking note of reports of hoarding, the PM said there was no need for panic buying. “Do not hoard.

Banking & financials , along with Reliance, weighed on the benchmark index as, globally, the coronavirus case count rose and more economists saw a bigger chance of an economic recession over the next few quarters.The day’s session was also impacted down by the weakness of the rupee that breached the psychologically important 75-to-the-dollar mark as foreign funds continued to sell.The sensex opened deep in the red and slipped below the 27k mark to a 40-month low in early trade. But then, it rallied nearly 10%, or 2,657 points, to an intra-day high at 29,371. But in late selling, the sensex gave up all gains to close 581 points, or 2%, lower at 28,288 — a 39-month closing low.On the NSE, the Nifty closed 205 points or 2.4% off at 8,263. India VIX, the volatility index that is also considered to be a measure of fear among market players, jumped 12.5% to 72 — its highest level in over a decade.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, Indian markets continued to slide southward as the number of coronavirus cases in India as well as globally rose. Although several governments, central banks and regulators have announced steps to support the economy and the businesses, these have not been too successful.“With rising cases of coronavirus, volatility is likely to continue in coming days and any bounce could be sold into. In such times, traders should refrain taking long positions as all the global markets are in a strong bear grip,” he said.End of the session data on the BSE showed that foreign investors were net sellers at Rs 4,623 crore on Thursday, taking the total outflow for the month from stocks alone to over Rs 55,000 crore, or about $7.5 billion. So far in the month, over 1,200 of the BSE stocks have hit the 52-week low level, including sensex heavyweights like RIL, TCS, ITC, HDFC Bank and HDFC.Market players said that for D-Street investors, Friday could bring some respite since, in early trades on Wall Street, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 indices were holding on to their previous closing levels and showing a steady trend.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74720996,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35716,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coronavirus-outbreak-sensex-loses-581-pts-ends-at-39-mth-low/articleshow/74720999.cms

36,['20/03/2020'],Rupee breaches 75 against dollar first time ever,"MUMBAI: The rupee hit a new low on Thursday — losing below 75 against the US dollar for the first time — as foreign institutional investors stampeded out of emerging markets.The rupee opened weak at 74.96, in line with the gap opening in equity markets and crashed to 75.30 against the dollar, losing more than a rupee against its previous close of 74.23 before firming up to close at 75.12.“The FIIs have sold nearly $10 billion. The speed of the sales does not look like they are taking a view on companies; the sales appear to be triggered by trading algorithms or exchange-traded funds,” said Harihar Krishnamoorthy , treasurer, First Rand Bank .According to Krishnamoorthy, while the rupee cannot defy the trend in FII sales, several factors could favour it once these sales stabilise. If low oil prices are sustained, there could savings of as much as $50 billion on imports. Gold imports, which have been a drag on the currency, have also come down, and, thirdly, spending on foreign travel under the liberalised remittance scheme will also drop.“Nearing close of the session the rupee hit a new low of 75.30, but because there was heavy intervention (by Reserve Bank of India ) it recovered to 75.12,” said K N Dey, managing partner, United Financial Consultants . “This will continue for some days and the rupee will hit new lows. Whatever measures the RBI takes—dollar-rupee swaps or intervention—these are financial medicines. But until the disease is addressed, global markets will continue to be volatile,” said Dey.He added that RBI also may not want to exhaust its dollar reserves to defend the rupee as it would amount to subsidizing the FIIs’ exit from Indian markets. “Also, the Chinese yuan has weakened by 2.5% to 7.14 against the dollar. They are managing the currency to cover up for lost exports,” said Dey.Given that all emerging market currencies are weakening, there is no advantage in keeping the rupee artificially strong. “Exports are already getting hit. Many of the companies we advise are seeing order cancellations. The crisis will end only when the disease comes under control,” said Dey. “In the last 40 years of my career, I have not seen such a disaster in the economic markets,” said Dey.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74721054,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36136,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-breaches-75-against-dollar-first-time-ever/articleshow/74721035.cms

TIRUPATI/BHUBANESWAR: For the first time in living memory, the Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirumala will be shut to devotees for a week starting Friday while the Shri Jagannath temple in Puri will remain closed till April 1 as part of a countrywide coronavirus-induced lockdown in public places.Daily rituals will be conducted inside the sanctum sanctorum of two of India’s holiest and most-visited shrines behind closed doors, officials said. In Gujarat, the Sommath, Dwarka and Ambaji shrines will be indefinitely shut from Friday.The Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam, which administers the Venkateswara temple, said 50 other sub-shrines across the country will also be closed for a week. This is the first time in 128 years that public worship has been suspended at the 2,000-year-old Tirumala temple. According to temple records, the last such shutdown was in 1892 for unspecified reasons.“Unless some tough decisions are taken, the (Covid-19) pandemic will impact the lives of more citizens. Based on a collective decision taken in consultation with the Andhra Pradesh government, the devasthanam has decided to close the temple from Friday,” Anil Kumar Singhal , executive officer of the managing trust, said.The temple administration on Thursday closed entry to the ghat road at Alipiri in Tirupati. The two pedestrian routes leading to Tirumala, along the Alipiri and Srivari Mettu routes, were sealed, too.In Puri, the decision to shut the 12th century Shri Jagannath shrine was taken after the Odisha government ordered the temporary closure of all religious places in the state — temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras — till April 1.Servitors will be allowed to perform their daily rituals and pay obeisance to the sibling deities of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra, subject to the temple authorities ensuring that all health precautions are taken.“We have adopted strong measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Daily rituals will remain unaffected,” Krishan Kumar, chief administrator of the Shri Jagannath Temple Administration, said.Sources said nearly 70 servitors perform around 20 daily rituals at the shrine from early in the morning till evening. Till April 1, bhog (food) will be prepared in the temple kitchen only for rituals.On a normal day, thousands of devotees partake of bhog after it is offered to the deities.Kumar said the temple administration would look into ways to compensate the servitors for the financial loss they would suffer because of the shrine being closed to devotees.On March 15, the authorities had announced that devotees would need to fill in and submit self-declaration forms before entering the premises for darshan.

BHAGALPUR: A 20-year old youth strangled his sister to death after he found her talking on a cell phone. The incident occurred at Jagdishpur village under the Jagdishpur police station area on Wednesday afternoon.

The incident came to light when the accused himself informed the police control room by calling on 100. On getting information, Jagdishpur police station SHO Sanjay Kumar Satyarthi rushed to the spot and arrested the youth and initiated a probe.

Police sources said that Suraj is an intermediate dropout, while his deceased sister Nitu Kumari, was a student of Class XI at Project Girls School, Jagdishpur. The body of the deceased has been sent for postmortem.

Police sources said the incident occurred when both were alone at home. Suraj’s father Ratan Lal Jha, who works as a typist at Bhagalpur civil court, was in Bhagalpur and his mother Soni Devi had also gone out for some work. Ratan and Soni rushed home on being informed about the incident.

Jagdishpur police station SHO Satyarthi said, “According to Ratan, his son Suraj is mentally disturbed and used to stay at home most of the time. He strangled his sister in a fit of rage.”

“We are investigating the case from all angles. We are all also cross-examining the family members and local residents about the incident,” the SHO said.

Several churches have also suspended Sunday mass.Father Prem Prakash, head of St Joseph Pro-Cathedral at Bankipore , confirmed that all mass gatherings have been postponed. “Mass outside the church has also been cancelled for the time being. Only small events with not more than 10-15 people will be conducted till the pandemic exists,” he said.Amar Aaron, secretary of Baptist Church said, “Keeping in mind the current situation, we have started a two-time church service for offering prayers and conducting mass. We have also instructed people not to make a gathering of more than 30-35 people at one time in the Church premises.”Pastor Pramod K Sebastian of India Pentecostal Church of God at Rajendranagar, said all events, including services, mass and prayers have been partially cancelled. “We have instructed people to restrict themselves from offering prayers at the church if they are sick. Besides, we are not conducting any special gatherings. In order to reduce the number of people, we have cancelled all services except on Sunday,” he said.Authorities at small churches, on the other hand, are not taking any special measures. “Since the crowd is already very limited, we are not limiting entry. However, programmes and events are not being conducted,” said Anand Kumar, defence committee member at Khagaul ’s Union Church.Parish priests and other church authorities pointed at dwindling number of devotees offering prayers in the past two weeks owing to the state government’s instructions to avoid public gathering. “Around 250-300 people attend Sunday morning prayers every week, but due to the outbreak, only 50-60 devotees visited the church last Sunday.

44,['20/03/2020'],Bihar: Many posts lying vacant at special vigilance unit,"The SVU was set up soon after Nitish Kumar came to power.

PATNA: The very purpose of setting up the special vigilance unit ( SVU ), an ambitious project of CM Nitish Kumar to nail the senior corrupt government officials, seems to have been defeated with probe into most of the cases virtually stalled due to important posts, including those of SPs, lying vacant for long.

At present only two SPs — Kumar Amar Singh and Arun Kumar Sharma — are posted at the SVU, whose contract of service is also likely to end in the next couple of months. Altogether six SP posts are still lying vacant. However, the process of appointment on the vacant posts has not been initiated.

Notably, only retired CBI officials are eligible for the posts of SPs in the SVU, which works under the vigilance department of the state government. In addition, there is no full-fledged IG to monitor the investigation and ensure timely disposal of the cases.

Amit Raj is currently holding additional charge of IG, SVU. He is, in fact, posted as IG, prohibition, which functions under Crime Investigation Department (CID). Repeated attempts to contact Raj for his comments, however, proved futile.

Earlier, Ratn Sanjay Katihar was holding additional charge of IG, SVU, before his transfer to weaker section in the CID in the same capacity.

The SVU was set up soon after Nitish came to power and one of the most sincere and upright IPS officers of the state — A K Upadhyay — was appointed as its first IG. Soon after its inception, a disproportionate assets case was lodged against former DGP Narain Misra , who was accused of accumulating huge wealth through illegal means and by abusing his official position.

The SVU proved its worth when a case of disproportion assets (DA) was lodged against a senior IAS officer S S Verma. In both the cases, the SVU got approval from the special vigilance court to confiscate the property of the accused under Bihar Special Courts Act, 2009. Schools were opened for children belonging to the most backward community in the confiscated buildings.

The novel initiative of Nitish-led NDA government in the state received wide acclamation and drew the attention of national media. Thereafter, five more cases were registered against senior public servants, including former state drug controller, Y K Jaiswal, MVI Raghuvansh Kuer, revenue officer Y P Singh, joint director (agronomy) Baidyanath Rajak and former SSP of Muzaffarpur Vivek Kumar (IPS).

According to authoritative sources, altogether 19 DA cases have been lodged at the SVU police station in Patna . “In most of the cases, the investigation is either stalled or is proceedings at snail’s pace due to staff crunch mainly in the rank of SPs, who happen to be the investigating officer as per rule,” a senior officer said.

On the contrary, the Sikkim police have initiated the process of setting up an anti-corruption cell on the pattern of the SVU in Bihar. The posts in different ranks were advertised there about two months back. A K Singh, who was earlier the joint director, CBI, Patna, has been assigned to accomplish the task.

Highly placed sources at the state police headquarters said no vacancies have been advertised in Bihar since 2018. A senior home department officer said the files were sent to the CM’s secretariat twice but nothing happened.

He further said, “Now efforts are on to fill the vacant posts with the state police officers. If this happens, it will meet the same fate as other state probe agencies.”

PATNA: An FIR was lodged against eight people, including the owner of a roadside dhaba, with the Sarai police station in Vaishali district on Thursday following the seizure of liquor during a raid conducted by the officials of the Prohibition department from Patna.

Altogether seven people were arrested from the dhaba located on NH-77 under the Sarai police station area during the operation late on Wednesday evening. The raid was carried out on the directive of DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who had earlier received a complaint about liquor being served at the dhaba.

Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla said on Thursday that the Sarai police started investigation into the matter after the complaint was formally transferred to the district police by the prohibition department officials. “Whosoever is found involved in the case will not be spared,” he said.

The SP said the owner of the dhaba was absconding after the raid. “The owner is among the eight people named as an accused in the FIR registered with the Sarai police station in the district,” he said adding that the DGP visited the Sarai police station on Wednesday evening.

“Those found in sale, manufacture and smuggling of liquor will face harsh legal action,” he said adding that nobody including a politician, bureaucrat or police official is above law.

Sarai police station Dharmaveer Mahto was put under suspension and departmental proceedings were initiated against him for dereliction of duty. Confirming action against the SHO, Vaishali SP Mangla said, “Two other sub-inspectors found on unauthorized leave are also facing departmental proceedings.”

Authoritative sources said the SP and the SDPO (Sadar) Raghav Dayal rushed to the Sarai police station soon after being informed about surprise inspection by the state police chief. “I visit only those police stations against which complaints of serious nature are received from people,” DGP Pandey said.

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday said committees comprising trained doctors would be set up at all government medical college and hospitals in the state to formally declare a person who succumbs to accident injuries as “brain dead” so that his or her organs could be donated with the consent of family members.

Modi said the need to set up the committee was felt to prevent the delay in the start of the process for organ donation of the accident victim, who suffers brain death during treatment at the hospital.

Modi said the decision was taken as a follow-up to the case of a boy, Rohit Kumar (17) from Muzaffarpur, whose family members donated five of his vital organs to help people needing organ transplant at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here. Modi also announced Rs 1 lakh cash reward from the funds of Dadhichi Dehdaan Samiti for the family of Rohit for their response to the campaign for organ donation.

Rohit, who had met an accident at Muzaffarpur on March 6, was rushed to IGIMS the next day. The accident had also caused brain haemorrhage. After he died on March 17, a committee of doctors gave the family a certificate of Rohit as being the case of brain death the next day. In between, the process for the donation of the vital organs of the deceased was also started.

Modi said it was the second case of brain death in the state. The first case was reported in September 2018.

Modi said 7,155 persons died due to severe accidents last year in the state, but if there had been proper awareness about organ donation, it would have helped hundreds of people. “Organs have been donated in 153 brain death cases in Maharashtra, 117 in Telangana and 93 in Tamil Nadu since September 2018,” he said.

Modi also asked the health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar to make operational the eye banks established at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Muzaffarpur and Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya . He also asked Kumar to take steps for the opening of eye banks in all the other medical college hospitals.

51,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare drives up interest in rental cars,"CHENNAI: With the Covid-19 scare keeping people away from public transport, self drive and rental car companies are seeing a sharp jump in subscriptions and enquiries. Car rental companies like Eco-Rent-a-Car and Revv have seen a sudden spurt in demand, others like Zoom has quadrupled rentals while Drivezy are launching new services to ride the wave. Work from home, fear of virus spreading while using public transport and schools being shut are all factors that are pushing greater demand for car rental companies.B2B car rental company Eco-Rent-a-Car, for example, has seen its individual cab segment attract fresh enquiries even as the tourist segment dwindles. “Since Monday a lot of our corporate clients are providing individual cabs to their employees rather than have them travel by public transport. So the private cab segment has suddenly seen a surge in demand. Some of these corporates are asking for 25 cabs a day or 35 cabs a day,” said Aditya Loomba, joint MD, of the company.Currently the individual cab business for Eco-Rent-a-Car is up to 350 cars a day while travel and tourism which used to be 200 cars a day is now down to almost zero. “But we have not increased our rates and offer discounts too in some cases,” he added.Others like Revv have seen a 30%-40% increase in subscriptions said co-founder Anupam Agarwal . Drivezy on the other hand has actually reduced the price of the monthly bike subscription to Rs 6,000-Rs 7,000 per month for a period of 3-months. “Keeping in mind the concerns of customers who may hesitate to travel by public transport, we are rolling out the monthly car subscription service in all our operational cities,” said Ashwarya Singh, CEO and co-founder Drivezy India “Customers can now rent a car for themselves and their family members for a month or more and these cars will be sanitised and sent after a full maintenance check-up.”The demand spurt is also leading to a mark up in tariff. Self-drive rental Zoom Car has nearly quadrupled its tariffs on self drive cars in select cities. For example, a self drive KUV in Madurai earlier this month for 150 km drive was just Rs 1,249 with fuel.The same for the upcoming weekend is Rs 4,375. While the company did not wish to reply to TOI queries, a call to the customer service showed that the company followed dynamic pricing, like airlines: the greater the demand the higher the prices.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74726893,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-69777,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coronavirus-scare-drives-up-interest-in-rental-cars/articleshow/74719731.cms

Also, the quarantine facilities should have a room for accommodating 5 to 10 beds at 1 to 2 metre apart with separate washroom.

The facility should have a clinical examination room, medical station, catering facilities, laundry services and waste management. Also, ensure that the facilities should have landline and internet services so that people who are kept in quarantine at the place should remain connected with their near and dear ones.

Also, psychiatrics and psychologists will also be deployed along with public health specialists, nurses, catering staff and sanitary staff. CCTVs should be installed for surveillance. For smooth administrative functioning and an administrator, not below the rank of sub divisional magistrate should be identified as the nodal officer for each quarantine centre, who will directly report to the higher authorities.

Speaking to TOI, Kirloskar said, “There are some estimates that the savings could be as much as $50 billion. The fund transfer can be a small amount that can help them get on with life and also generate demand.”

According to Kirloskar, small businesses are the most vulnerable and CII has requested the government to address the small-scale sector as soon as possible. “We are also talking to our members, asking them not to lay off people and spread the pain to everyone. We are asking them to help small businesses they deal with as it is hard to tell what will happen because of the virus ,” said Kirloskar.

According to the industry body chief, there is a need to restart a business with full safety measures in place. “People still have to live and go on with their lives. Businesses will be able to sustain only as long as money runs out,” he said.

He said that the airline and transportation sector needs to be protected as they are vital to the economy for recovery after the crisis. “We are talking to the RBI. Other central banks have reduced rates and increased liquidity. There could also be a moratorium on loans so that people do not get into NPAs. We have to find a way of using the liquidity with banks to support the small and medium sector,” he said.

Kirloskar called for a collaborative approach with the government supporting small businesses by releasing payments quickly and lowering taxes to help them tide over the current situation.

Experts said that many home networks had unsecured endpoints, including unsecured Wi-Fi and poorly-configured modems which could make corporate networks vulnerable to cyber-attacks.

""With many people now working from home, many organisations lack the capabilities to provide secured virtual private network (VPN) access or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. On the network security front, it means the firm’s network perimeter now has expanded further to homes and other unsecured locations. This makes it easier for malicious persons to hack user endpoint-devices by exploiting possible vulnerabilities in home network infrastructure like unsecured home Wi-Fi and poorly-configured modems,"" said Vinod T, who heads cyber security at UL Technology Solutions.

Also cyber security experts said that cyber criminals have already started exploiting Covid-19 concerns among people through phishing campaigns in the form of e-mails offering Covid-19 information to trick recipients to click on the link which inserts a malware into the user device. The attacker then can control the user’s device remotely and gain access to office network or create a ransomware attack.

""Simple precautions that can be taken by employees and IT team is to ensure the use of a strong password policy, keeping modem, routers and other devices up-to-date with the latest firmware patches and turning off WPA & UPnP, instead use WPA2 which uses a stronger form of cryptography. Network security administrators should conduct quick vulnerability assessment to identify loopholes,"" said Vinod, adding that employees should be trained on how to detect and handle phishing and other forms of social engineering attacks.

Experts say that VPNs ensure that the internet traffic is encrypted and safe between office network and the remote machine. Hence if the employee is working on sensitive data, he or she should use VPN provided by the organization.

Banking & financials, along with Reliance, weighed on the benchmark index as, globally, the coronavirus case count rose and more economists saw a bigger chance of an economic recession over the next few quarters.The day’s session was also impacted negatively by the weakness of the rupee that breached the psychologically important 75-to-the-dollar mark as foreign funds continued to sell.The sensex opened deep in the red and slipped below the 27k mark to a 40-month low in early trade. But then, it rallied nearly 10%, or 2,657 points, to an intra-day high at 29,371. However, in late selling, the sensex gave up all gains to close 581 points, or 2%, lower at 28,288 — a 39-month closing low. Investors were left poorer by Rs 3.8 lakh crore with the BSE ’s market capitalisation now at Rs 109.2 lakh crore.On the NSE , the Nifty closed 205 points or 2.4% off at 8,263. India VIX, the volatility index that is also considered to be a measure of fear among market players, jumped 12.5% to 72 — its highest level in over a decade.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, Indian markets continued to slide southward as the number of coronavirus cases in India as well as globally rose. Although several governments, central banks and regulators have announced steps to support the economy and businesses, these have not been too successful.“With rising cases of coronavirus, volatility is likely to continue in coming days and any bounce could be sold into.

68,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus pushes city’s textile processing sector into doldrums,"Surat: Textile dyeing and printing mills in the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) hub in the city seem to have become casualty of Covid-19 in the country.

Faced with weak demand for polyester fabrics in the domestic market and also dwindling exports, processing of finished fabrics has come to a grinding halt. Consequently, textile dyeing and printing mills are now operating at less than 50% of their capacity and most have chosen to implement closure for three days a week. Most of the migrant workers have no option, but to leave for their hometown. Textile processing sector in the city employs over two lakh workers.

There are about 315 textile mills in Pandesara, Sachin, Palsana and Kadodara where about 2.5 crore metres of polyester fabrics are processed every day. Following outbreak of coronavirus in the country, textile mills now get less than one crore metres of fabrics for processing due to weak demand in domestic market and sharp decline in export orders from Europe, the United States and UAE.

Industry sources said majority of textile mills are doing job work for textile traders. About 2.5 crore metres of fabrics are processed on job work to the tune of Rs80 crore per day. In the last one week, orders have reduced by almost 50% in textile mills thereby causing them a loss of Rs40 crore.

South Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association (SGTPA) president Jitu Vakharia said, “If coronavirus epidemic worsens, we will have to shutdown our mills. Textile mills are processing one crore metres of fabrics per day against 2.5 crore metres. Demand for polyester fabrics in the country has declined sharply due to coronavirus.”

Kamal Vijay Tulsiyan, a textile mill owner in Pandesara, said, “The situation has turned from bad to worse in the last few days. Domestic demand for fabrics has gone down and exports are also declining. Textile mills have become casualty. It is getting difficult for us to sustain jobs of workers.”

Vinod Agarwal, another textile mill owner in Sachin, said, “We may be forced to shutdown the mills in the coming days if coronavirus situation worsens. In just few days, the job orders have decreased by almost 50%”

PHOTO QUOTES

Binay Agarwal, chairman of Swastik Polyprints: When the country is grappling with coronavirus, fabric purchase will become last priority for people. We are in an unprecedented situation. Domestic and export demand has decreased and we are forced to keep our mills shut for three days a week.

Pramod Chaudhary, chairman of Pratibha Group: We will have to shutdown the mills if coronavirus situation worsens in the country. Traders have almost stopped giving job orders to textile mills as domestic and export demand has decreased. We are operating at less than 50% of our capacity.

A Chennai-based medical devices firm Neuberg Diagnostics, part of the Trivitron group, has indigenously developed a testing kit for testing Corona infections. The company has been working for a month to get the testing equipment ready. Even as the kit is available and the company is ready to offer tests for Rs 500 (as against $1,100 in the US) in a private lab, there are a couple of factors that are delaying the process. To use the kit, Neuberg has to wait for clearances from the National Institute of Virology. “It has been mandated that one has to test 1,000 positive samples (while India has less than 200 positive cases). We have synthetic samples to test and get the clearances in the next two weeks,” said GSK Velu, CMD, Trivitron

Second, India doesn’t allow private labs to test for COVID infections. “The government is still in talks with the ICMR on this. We have written to the ICMR asking them to approve tests in private labs. With Neuberg Labs, we can test up to 3,000 – 4,000 per day in our National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) – approved labs.

Velu further said their team developed the kit with the learnings from Shandong Yingsheng Biotechnology Co. Ltd, a Chinese company which developed a testing kit for testing COVID infections.

“We had signed a JV with the company in November 2019. Soon after, Wuhan got infected with the Coronavirus and Shandong Yingsheng developed a testing kit on an emergency basis. We began developing this for testing in India at Trivitron in partnership with Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,” he added. ENDS

BENGALURU: The impact of coronavirus is being felt across India’s startup ecosystem and small businesses as 71% have seen a fall in demand over the last weeks. As a consequence, 63% plan to cut jobs, according to results of a survey of over 8,500 such companies conducted by LocalCircles.

About 48% of the companies surveyed said that they expect to see supply chain disruptions and an increase in costs. While 41% expect to see a double whammy of both supply chain issues with cost increase and slowing demand, 11% of the respondents said they don’t expect an impact.

Up to 52% of the companies surveyed said that they plan to reduce marketing/advertising, while 41% will bring down real estate costs and 48% will cut infrastructure & technology costs. About 48% of the companies polled said they will take at least two of these measures, while 37% said there won’t be an impact on their business.

The survey results come on the back of increasing pain among segments of India’s consumption economy, with travel, hospitality and restaurants among the biggest hit.

VARANASI: At a time when markets are running short of sanitisers due to an upsurge in its demand following Covid-19 scare, a research group at Nano-Cellular Medicine and Biophysics Laboratory , School of Biochemical Engineering , IIT-BHU has decided to impart training of preparing sanitizer using products easily available at home.

“We decided to prepare sanitizer in our laboratory and distribute among students and staff. Also, we have planned to conduct an outreach programme to train people on preparing sanitiser at home,” said associate professor Dr Marshal, who leads the research group.

Explaining the formula, he said that to prepare sanitizer mix 7 parts of Ethanol (99% pure) with 3 parts of Aloe Vera gel and then add 1% Sodium Hydroxide (1mm). To overcome the smell of alcohol, add rose water or kewra water to it. The cost of 100ml sanitizer prepared is estimated to be Rs 40.

“We are ready to cooperate with the district administration to fight against the virus,” said Dr Marshal adding that any individual can contact them to learn the process of preparing sanitizer free of cost.

He said they can continue operations as their functioning doesn’t involve crowds and, therefore, probability of contracting the virus was less. “The delivery boys deliver food directly at home and in entire operation no other person is involved,” he told TOI.This means restaurants can keep their kitchens open but cannot allow walk-in customers.While some restaurants are sending their own employees for delivery, a bulk of these establishment owners are relying on online food delivery apps.TOI spoke to several restaurant employees, and most of them blamed the coronavirus outbreak for business going down. However, some of them claimed that their delivery orders have not been affected due to recent order by the collector.An employee from a Wardha Road-based restaurant claimed they have closed the front door of the restaurant, but is allowing customers who want to have food inside the restaurant in from a small rear door. “We are also giving home deliveries and people are also using online applications to order food from our restaurants. However, orders have decreased. We have also announced a holiday for some of our staff, but are serving them food since they have nowhere else to go.”Owner of an online kitchen restaurant told TOI that since the outbreak of coronavirus orders for food have decreased. “Customers have reduced orders in the recent past. They are also avoiding junk food, due to which business is slack,” he said.Employee at a restaurant franchise located in Sadar claimed, though, business has not been affected after the establishment closed for walk-ins. “Several orders are coming through online food delivery applications. The closure of restaurants has not affected us as now a days people anyway prefer to eat at home rather than at a restaurant,” he said.The owner of a restaurant on Manewada Road revealed that they are also allowing customers to pick up food from the restaurant along with online applications. “The business is slow due to the recent incidents, and we are also buying materials in smaller quantity so food does not go waste. Business is down almost 50%. I hope in the coming days business will be back on track.”TOI also spoke to some of the food delivery boys, who claimed that their work has not been affected due to the recent closure of restaurants. “My work has not reduced a bit, even though restaurants are closed. I started working at around 10am and till 3.30pm I have delivered around 10 orders from different restaurants to houses in different areas,” said a delivery boy.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74729797,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-600320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/food-delivery-apps-ensure-restaurant-kitchens-keep-working/articleshow/74719506.cms
80,['20/03/2020'],SBI asked to defer recovery for 40 days,"Ahmedabad: The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic is being felt in court orders too. A Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) on Thursday directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to defer its recovery proceedings for at least 40 days.

The SBI has to recover Rs 70 crore from Sysco Industries Ltd, which defaulted and the bank initiated recovery proceedings against the company by taking possession of its property. The bank had already issued notice to take possession under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest (SARFEISI) Act.

Sysco’s advocate Aditya Gupta cited two orders passed by the Gujarat high court and by the Allahabad high court requesting the lower courts to defer judicial works, unless it is unavoidable in wake of novel coronavirus scare. The Allahabad HC has ordered public authorities not to take coercive action against private parties so far as taking possession of property is concerned as part of recovery proceedings.

After hearing advocate Gupta, DRT’s presiding officer Vinay Goel said, “In the light of above orders of two courts and having considered fact that although bank is to recover public money but for that life and security of public at large cannot be put to risk. So applying the ratio of orders and spirit of orders passed by the high courts, I feel fair to restrain bank from taking possession for 40 days from today and the bank would be able to proceed further after issuing fresh 14-day notice to take possession…”

The DRT further said, “It will be the duty of the counsel for the bank to inform the concerned authorities about this order and its effects.

In February, assets under management (AUM) in Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the state hit Rs 223.68 crore – a record high, according to data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). Analysts said that rise in gold prices last month led to an increase in the net asset value.“In February, the spread of coronavirus in China got investors across the globe concerned over its fallout in other countries. As the situation worsened, with cases and deaths being reported not just in China but other countries as well, big investors began making safe-haven investments in gold, as a result of which international price of gold rose,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).AUM in Gold ETFs in Gujarat rose from Rs 216.7 crore in January by 3.1% in February. “As prices showed a sharp rise, the net asset value of investments in gold ETFs rose significantly. The rising trend brought investors to gold, which also led to an increase in AUM,” said Acharya.Gold prices touched a record high on March 7 in the Ahmedabad market at Rs 46,100 per 10g. Owing to profit-booking and increased selling of gold by investors, prices dropped to Rs 42,800 on Thursday.Mumukshu Desai, director of a city-based financial advisory firm, said, “Gold prices are extremely volatile at this point and so are other asset classes as well. As a result, investors are maintaining status quo and not moving their funds because no asset class is delivering clear returns due to coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered severe uncertainty in global trade.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-etf-investments-hit-record-high/articleshow/74719538.cms

NAGPUR: Transport committee chairman of Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) Narendra Borkar on Thursday presented a Rs304 crore budget of the department for 2020-21 before standing committee chairman Vijay aka Pintu Zalke.

Borkar revised the transport manager Rajesh Mohite’s projected income of Rs273.84 crore by over Rs30 crore. However, his budget did not reveal any concrete measures to increase the revenue.

In current financial year, Mohite had already revised the budget of ex-transport committee chairman of Rs277.84 crore to 206.19 crore. Borkar has projected a revenue of Rs86 crore from the sale of tickets while Rs184 crore funding from standing committee. The panel chief said the department will earn Rs90 lakh from bus shelters advertisements.

However, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari ’s dream to convert all diesel-run Aapli Bus into CNG to check air pollution has hit a roadblock. Of the announced conversion of all 237 standard buses, the NMC has dropped plans to convert over 100 of them, saying these had outlived.

Borkar also announced to give cash prizes to those who give information about the nexus between Aapli Bus drivers and conductors who pocket the fare money. Though he did not disclose the reward money, Borkar has earmarked Rs10 lakh for the purpose in the next financial year.

To a query, Borkar said so far the civic body has converted 70 diesel-run standard buses into CNG and we can convert another 30 to 50. Borkar also admitted that from March 2017 to March 2020, the department has defaulted child nutrition cess to the regional transport department. He has kept Rs2 crore to clear the dues. “I have also suggested the standing committee chairman for book adjustment the due with the outstanding property tax of RTO,” he said.

BHOPAL: About 750 plus beds have been identified for the isolation of coronavirus-infected patients by the MP health department. Besides that, there are just about 2.5 intensive care unit ( ICU ) beds for every one lakh population in Madhya Pradesh , going by a 2017 assessment.

As witnessed in Italy and before that in China, where the COVID-19 outbreak has been severe, there is a requirement of minimally manual ICU care to avoid the spread of the contagion. For those with acute respiratory distress and other complications, level 2 or above ICU units are needed, explained a public health expert with the Union government.

Of the total number of ICU beds, 250 are in level 1, 1,141 are in level 2, and 425 are in level 3 facilities. This amounts to 0.34, 1.57, and 0.59 ICU beds per 1,00,000 population for levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively, according a study released in 2017 in the Indian journal of critical care medicine. The study was conducted by Dr Saurabh Saigal, JP Sharma, A Pakhare, S Bhaskar, S Dhanuka, S Kumar, S Sabde, Dr Pradip Bhattacharya and Dr Rajnish Joshi.

The health department estimates that there are 751 dedicated beds for COVID-19 treatment with 104 ventilators. All tertiary care hospitals will be treatment centres. District hospitals and others will act as screening centres.

With little over 4,000 doctors in the MP government-run hospitals, the infection risk and rate of COVID-19 infection in medical staff is very high. MP has 1,867 healthcare centres/hospitals under the health department. There are 1,420 PHCs, 324 CHCs, 72 SDH and 51 DH, according to a 2018 assessment.

There are 38,140 beds in the health department-run hospitals. Most of these, almost one-third, are for maternity/child care. Of these, 10,020 beds are in rural areas. AYUSH has 690 beds while seven defence hospitals have a total 1,402 beds. WCR railways has about 456 beds, of which 250 are in MP.

VIJAYAWADA: The government is preparing to take action following a ‘fake’ letter addressed to the Union home ministry from the state election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar surfaced on social media platforms. In the letter, which carries the official letterhead of the SEC, Kumar has made serious allegations against the YSRC-led governement.

Although Kumar has denied having written the letter, it has created ripples across the state with the media and social media being quick to quote the contents of it.

The letter criticises the government, chief minister, other ministers and ruling party leaders. It condemns the state police for failing to maintain law and order in the first phase of the local body elections leading to violence.

The letter also seeks central forces to conduct the remaining phases of the local body elections, which were suspended due to the coronavirus scare. The letter states that SEC has no faith in the state police and administration to ensure peaceful elections. It also refers to the comments of the chief minister against Kumar and his alleged loyalties to Opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu .

In the letter Kumar has requested the home ministry for central security forces for his and his family’s protection.

Although the commissioner has denied having written the letter, leaders of the Opposition parties, including TDP state chief K Kalavenkata Rao and CPI secretary K Ramakrishna, met Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and sought central protection for the commissioner and Raj Bhavan’s intervention in the elections.

Meanwhile, chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy held a meeting with DGP Gautam Sawang and intelligence chief Manish Kumar Sinha and reviewed the issue. The chief minister has reportedly directed the police to find out the source and the persons responsible for it. He has reportedly expressed his displeasure over the language used in the letter which, he said, lowered the image of the government, the chief minister, cabinet and the state police, besides the entire administration.

94,['20/03/2020'],Puri temple administration withdraws Rs 397 crore from crisis-hit Yes Bank,"BHUBANESWAR: The Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) in Puri heaved a sigh of relief after withdrawing Rs 397 crore from the crisis-hit Yes Bank on Thursday. The money included Rs 389 crore principal term deposit and Rs 8 crore interest.

Uncertainty had loomed over the fate of the Rs 545 crore temple money deposited in the Yes Bank following the recent moratorium imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on heavy withdrawals from the private bank. The moratorium was lifted by the apex bank on Wednesday.

“We have been informed by the Yes Bank about the remittance of the Rs 397 crore (Rs 389 principal deposit and Rs 8 crore interest) from their bank to a designated account of the Jagannath Temple corpus fund with the State Bank of India’s (SBI) main branch in Puri. The maturity period of the Rs 389 crore deposit ended on Wednesday. The temple has another term deposit of Rs 156 crore in the Yes Bank. It will credit the remaining Rs 156 crore and interest upon maturity on March 30 to the temple’s SBI account,” the SJTA’s chief administrator Krishan Kumar said.

Hours after Rs 397 crore was credited from Yes Bank to the temple’s account in SBI, the ruling BJD and opposition BJP tried to hijack credit for the safe return of the temple deposit. Putting all speculations to rest, Yes Bank has transferred Rs 397 crore to the SBI account of the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration. The Odisha government has ensured the safe return of Lord Jagannath’s wealth considering the worsening condition of the private bank, said BJD’s official twitter handle (@bjd_odisha).

Significantly, state finance minister Niranjan Pujari had earlier written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and sought her intervention in the matter. Later, a team of BJD MPs had met Nirmala Sitharaman in Delhi and urged her to facilitate the smooth withdrawal of the temple funds from the Yes Bank.

BJP thanked the Centre. “We express our gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who had earlier assured all depositors, including the Jagannath Temple administration, of the safety of their deposits. The PM and FM took immediate steps to bail out Yes Bank after which the temple administration managed to withdraw the money,” BJP state general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan said.

BJP demanded action against those who had deposited the temple money in Yes Bank.

VIJAYAWADA: Police suspect the letter, said to be written by state election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar, to be a fabricated one and a deliberate attempt to create unrest in the state. The cops have launched an informal probe into the issue to dig out the facts behind the issue which has created controversy in the state.

Meanwhile, security has been beefed up and CRPF personnel have deployed at the election commission’s office in Vijayawada . DGP D Gautam Sawang is also learnt to have spoken to his Telangana counterpart and requested him to provide additional security to Ramesh Kumar in Hyderabad. As the said letter made scathing allegations against the police — its authenticity, though, is questionable as Ramesh Kumar has denied writing any such letter — Sawang asked the CRPF’s southern region IG to deploy some personnel at the SEC office to not give any room for further allegations.

Ramesh Kumar’s personal security has also been doubled from 1+1 to 2+2. The contents of the letter appear to be political statements and the language used is definitely not by a senior bureaucrat, police sources said, adding that it appears to be a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the government and police. A case would be registered and a formal investigation launched if a complaint is filed as it amounts to forgery of a senior official holding a constitutional position.

VIJAYAWADA: Urban Mass Transit Company Limited (UMTC) will prepare the detailed project report for the 79.91 kilometre first phase Vizag metro rail project. UMTC emerged as the successful bidder by quoting a price of Rs 5.33 crore.

A new DPR will be prepared for nearly 33.5km of the project, including the alternative analysis report. UMTC will also offer transaction advisory consultancy services for the bidding process management for the project, which will be taken up in a public-private partnership model and selection of a developer on a success fee basis. The state government on Thursday authorised the Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation to enter into an agreement with the UMTC for availing their services.

Speaking to TOI, AMRC managing director NP Ramakrishna Reddy said UMTC would prepare the DPR in six months. “We will initiate simultaneous bidding process for the metro rail project in the fourth month after the start of the preparation of the DPR. The bidder for the second phase project (60-km) will be finalised by the end of this month. We have received two bids for the preparation of the DPR for the first phase project,” said Reddy.

The length of the first phase project was increased to nearly 80 km from the initially planned 42.5-km project following the state government’s decision of extending the highway corridor to Bhogapuram International Airport.

BHUBANESWAR: The special task force (STF) of the state Crime Branch on Thursday arrested two students from Balasore district and seized brown sugar worth over Rs 2.7 crore from their possession. The seized brown sugar, weighing 2.73 kilogram, is the highest-ever haul of narcotics in a day in the state.

The STF personnel said the two accused, in their 20s, are 3rd-year Btech students of separate private engineering colleges in Balasore district. “We have found that the two were active members of a big drugs smuggling racket in Odisha. The drug smuggler is on our radar. Efforts are being made to arrest him,” STF’s deputy inspector general J N Pankaj said.

The accused students were supplying the brown sugar to other drugs dealers in Khurda, Bhubaneswar and Balasore. The STF sources said each of them was earning at least Rs 50,000 every month from illicit drug dealing. Their criminal antecedents, if any, are being examined.

“We strongly suspect that the accused procured the narcotics substance from Murshidabad, Kolkata and Khargarpur in West Bengal . Investigation is under way,” Crime Branch’s additional director general of police Soumendra Priyadarshi said.

On March 12, the STF personnel had seized 1.75 kilogram brown sugar worth over Rs 1.7 crore and arrested three persons, including a Btech graduate. They have already seized 6.76kg of brown sugar worth over Rs 6.7 crore so far in the last three months. “The magnitude of the 6.76kg seizure of brown sugar in the last three-and-a-half months by STF alone is highly significant as different agencies of Odisha Police together had seized nearly 2.5 kg brown sugar last year,” Priyadarshi said.

They also urged the court not to allow the state to make any belated claims over the land.Rangareddy principal district judge Yara Renuka said: “The state is very much within its rights to lay claim over the land and the court will decide as to who could possess the title over this Rs 10,000 crore worth land after hearing both sides.”The state was earlier told by the high court to fight for its title before a civil court and hence it filed a plea before the PDJ court of Rangareddy seeking declaration of title and also recovery of possession.The peculiarity of the land parcel is it did not possess any survey number at all. Advocate-general BS Prasad, who argued before the district court laying the state’s claim, said, “It is known as Bilaa Dhakhala land, meaning a parcel of land that was left unsurveyed with an express purpose to accommodate the expansion of Osmansagar, which is adjacent to the land in question. This area falls under full tank level (FTL) area of Osmansagar and the state never accorded any pattas to any private parties over this land. State has an exclusive right over this land.”Showing adjacent survey number 65, some private parties were claiming over 150 acres of the 540 acres and some fraudulent documents too were created for the purpose, the AG alleged.There was one pattadar with title over five acres of land lying adjacent to the land and his rights were recognised in a 1954 survey. The survey number pertaining to his land speaks about only five acres, but fraudulent papers were created showing the survey number as the basis for claims over 150 acres, the AG said.Several private parties who were in possession of over 150 acres have argued that the state should not be allowed to raise its claims at a belated stage. The AG argued that the state noticed illegal entries made in the revenue records in 2001 under two survey numbers and they were shocked to see that the illegal claimants had been claiming more than 1,850 acres of land with the support of fictitious documents even though the land available on the ground was not more than 950 acres. “We have not allowed any Bilaa Dakhala land to be converted into private patta land till now,” he said raising doubts about the veracity of the documents being shown by private parties.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74723458,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-232530,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bilaa-dhakhala-of-gandipet-court-nod-to-ts-fight-for-title/articleshow/74719605.cms

The flat owners alleged that a garbage pile outside their apartment is a health hazard and its removal is all the more crucial in view of the Covid-19 threat.

Talking to TOI, Colonel P Goyal, a resident, said, “The space outside the apartments was left for provision of road widening as per the MDDA guidelines. We didn’t expect that people from the vicinity would start dumping garbage here. We had recently requested the mayor, Sunil Uniyal Gama , to resolve our problem, after which the area was partially cleaned.”

In the past, the flat owners had also installed barbed wires to deter people from dumping garbage but soon the wires and the pillars were stolen. VV Bhatt, a resident, said, “The garbage pile has been there unattended for long. With no choice, we have decided to keep ourselves inside our homes to avoid any possible infection. We just hope the DMC removes this dump in the wake of Covid-19 spread.”

To add to the woes of the residents, the site of the garbage dump has been encroached by illegally parked vehicles. Kishan Pal , sanitation inspector in the area, said, “We had recently cleaned the dump outside the apartment. Since the higher officials at the DMC are monitoring the cleaning drive, the site will be cleaned again.”

In such cases 50% refund is granted. However, no refund is given for tickets booked between 61 to 120 days. These tickets cost between Rs4,000-8,000.Coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by World Health Organisation (WHO) and as a precautionary measure, the India government suspended all visas issued till April 15, 2020. All Indian nationals have also been strongly advised to avoid all non-essential travel.IATO president Pronab Sarkar told TOI from Delhi, “Government has cancelled visas on its own and entry of foreign tourists has been banned. The ministry of tourism too has issued directives to encourage process of refunds of foreign nationals and hence the forest department of tiger-bearing states should consider releasing refunds so that we refund money to the legitimate clients.”However, the forest departments have not yet considered refunding, barring those cancellations which will be done by default during March 18 to 31 when closure of parks was officially announced by various states.The IATO delegation, consisting of wildlife tourism consultant Himanshu Bagde and member Capt Vijay Golchha, which met Kakodkar, said, “Owing to preventive measures at global level, it is virtually impossible for tourists now to plan their travel — be it Indians or foreigners.”As per prevailing rules, tickets purchased for safari are non-refundable. However, Kakodkar has agreed to refund money towards bookings during March 18 to 31. IATO has urged Maharashtra to refund all money towards tickets which are cancelled for safari period between April 1 and June 30, 2020.“We don’t know if the situation in foreign countries will be better by April 15, or it will take more time for things to settle down. There is no indication from the government if visa requests after April 15 will be considered,” says Bagde.“As per directives from Meenakshi Sharma, director general (DG) ministry of tourism, Delhi, we have been encouraged to process refunds of foreign nationals and waive off the cancellation charges as well by rising beyond economic concerns and to set a good example of our country as a whole,” said Sarkar.“The case with domestic tourists too is the same. With schools shut now and no indication of the summer holidays, families will find it difficult to plan safaris. All planned holidays may be cancelled,” said IATO secretary Rajesh Mudgil.Meenal Dorlikar, manager of Royal Tiger Resort, says, “Maharashtra should consider refund request on priority and keeping the larger interest in mind.

Further schedule should be decided following a review of the situation.” Citing the COVID-19 threat, the professors’ association had demanded postponing of othe ngoing exams. Association president, Kailash Tyagi , said that exams should be deferred immediately. “For exams, students gather in large numbers. This makes them vulnerable,” said Tyagi. He added that even proper precautions were not being taken.

Tyagi had claimed that students are not segregated in examination halls. “Was there any screening facility at the exam centres? As per my knowledge, there was nothing like that.” The association has welcomed the decision. The MP government had ordered closure of schools and colleges last week across the state.

Meanwhile, all hotels in Nainital plan to ask their guests to leave. Uttarakhand hoteliers also collectively urged tourists to not visit the state for the next few weeks.Sandeep Sahni, president of Hotels and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand , said, “In view of the current scenario, we request tourists to not visit our state for the next few weeks. While all our member hotels are observing various directives regarding hygiene, awareness and guest comfort, we feel that keeping in mind the government directives against travel and social distancing, it may be best to postpone peoples’ visits for a few days.”Speaking to TOI, Sanjay Aggarwal , a hotelier in Mussoorie, said that keeping the safety of hotel staff, guests and members of the local community in mind, he has decided to close his property till the month-end. “We are catering to the guests currently staying at our property. However, we have decided to close down temporarily,” Aggarwal said.At least two more hotels in Mussoorie have or will be shutting down temporarily. However, the owners of these properties refused to comment.Anil Sharma, the general manager of a five star resort in Mussoorie, said that business had been dismal anyway, with guests cancelling prior reservations. “We were sold out, but due to large-scale cancellations, we barely have a handful of guests with us today. We have shut down an entire block of our hotel and also closed one restaurant and sent more than 30% of our staff on leave,” Sharma said.Residents of Mussoorie said that given the current situation, all hotels should consider shutting down and the owners could utilise this time to refurbish their properties.“It is important to prevent the entry of tourists in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus, even as we may be staring at huge losses,”said Shalabh Garg, a resident.“While it is important for hotels to not accept guests from outside from the standpoint of preventing the spread of the virus, hotels that have staying power must utilise this time to take up maintenance of the property, looking after well-being of employees and if possible, look at means to digitally equip their properties,” said Mussoorie-based travel writer Hugh Gantzer Meanwhile in Nainital, hotels have decided to stop giving rooms to tourists from Friday and go on a complete shutdown on Saturday, when they plan to stop operations and ask all guests to leave.Speaking to TOI, Dinesh Sah, president of Nainital Hotel Association, said that the decision has been taken keeping in mind safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus in Nainital.“Earlier, we had asked all our member hotels to arrange for sanitisers and disinfectants. However, as the number of positive cases continue to rise across the country, we have decided to put a temporary stay on giving rooms to tourists,” Sah said.“We are also planning to go on a complete shutdown from Saturday,” he added.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74724487,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-161567,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nainital-properties-to-go-on-complete-shutdown-tomorrow-some-musoorie-hotels-close-doors/articleshow/74718609.cms
109,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus: Homes turn into offices as companies scramble to keep work flowing,"BHUBANESWAR: Following the state government’s recommendation to citizens to remain in home isolation and practise social distancing to keep the novel coronavirus at bay, many corporate houses and private companies have asked their employees to start working from home.To enforce this, some companies have started entire moving computer systems to the houses of employees. Others are arranging for laptops for their workers. Companies that have not yet implemented work from home are trying to ensure that employees sit at some distance from each other and have access to hand sanitisers, water and soap and a clean office environment.“The data stored in our systems/desktops can’t be moved to workers’ laptops. There is a risk to the security of our clients. So the company has started moving the desktops of the employees to their homes. This is taking some time but should be complete in a day or two,” said an employee of a multinational IT firm with an office here.Employees who have been asked to work from home said there were both advantages and disadvantages to it, but added that they were ready to do it to follow guidelines. “There is no problem in working from home. I think internet service providers — both cable or mobile — should consider upgrading net speed for free during this phase. Similarly, DTH satellite TV providers should consider providing all channels for free,” said Piyush Ranjan Rout, an urban planner with Local Governance Network, who is now working from home.Online departmental store, Grozip, has also asked all its staff, except delivery boys, to work from home. “Everyone is happy to do so and their productivity has also gone up,” said Anand Mishra, founder of the startup.Dairy manufacturer, Milk Mantra, said it had taken several initiatives to keep their employees safe from coronavirus. Around 40 per cent of its employees in the corporate office are working from home. “We are using Zoom to ensure that the work flow is smooth. We have shared a schedule to help people manage their personal and work life while working from home,” said Rashima Misra , co-founder and executive director (organisation development and brand communication).In its office, Milk Mantra is wiping all doors, work desks and laptops with sanitisers thrice a day. “At both our plants in Gop and Sambalpur , we have put up awareness posters in English and Odia.

111,['20/03/2020'],Nagpur: Colourful classrooms with happy education experience,"THE BATCH OF CHANGE: After the school is revamped, the group takes regular follow-ups about how the transforma... Read More

NAGPUR: What is the most that a group of youngsters can do with a paintbrush, colour palette and an empty unplastered wall? Well, in this case, they can double the strength of a government school, increase the attendance rate and improve the quality of teaching and learning.

Bringing colours not just to the empty walls but also lives of over 25,000 children across the country is city-based Zero Gravity Foundation. A non-profit organization operating under the umbrella of Dr Shrikant Jichkar Foundation, Zero Gravity was founded by Maitreyi Jichkar in 2008.

The young group has been working in the field of education, health care and rural development since a decade. While working in the education sector , its members came to realize that for mending impressionable minds, a lot of mending is needed in the infrastructure .

That is how their star venture the ‘Happy School Project’ started in 2011. Under this, they transform government schools through holistic infrastructural makeovers using UNICEF’s concept of ‘Building As A Learning Aid’ (BALA).

In UNICEF’s words, the concept aims at maximizing the educational utility of school buildings and the overall education experience by innovatively integrating curriculum-linked materials into the existing environment of schools. “We researched on the impact of living conditions on psychology of kids and found that poor infrastructural conditions have a damaging impact on child’s learning and can also contribute to the emergence of problem behaviour,” says Maitreyi.

Till now, the organization has transformed over a 100 schools in the country. The NGO is currently working on another 500 schools including 150 Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) schools, 50 government in Osmanabad district and some coming under Bombay Municipal Corporation.

The concepts are taken from the curriculum and incorporated in the theme of classrooms. “Whenever we approach a school, we largely focus on repair work, fixing toilets, electrical work and then painting and implementing concepts,” says Maitreyi.

What makes the initiative unique is that the concepts are not mindlessly painted on the walls. “People mostly don’t understand the logic behind how spaces and infrastructural changes impact the human psychology and learning capabilities. We take in consideration the colour psychology and then we use the right colours for the right age group. There is a lot of study that goes behind it. People often have this perception that what we are doing is picking up paints and painting,” says head architect Tanishka Acharya.

Adding that every part of the infrastructure should end up teaching something, Acharya says, “Our team of architects and designers are constantly ideating — be it converting window grills into abacus or floors into writing surfaces. If a theme of a classroom is forest, students will not just learn about types of animals but also prepositions like a monkey is ‘on’ the tree. When learning about birds, kids do it through Origami.”

After preparing the designs, the group presents it to the teachers who help them innovate more and develop teaching aids through infrastructure. “We largely focus on makeover of government schools because they are in need of this. The total strength of our government schools is going down, even when the income backgrounds are not increasing,” says co-founder of the organization Yajnavalkya Jichkar.

The young group uses different avenues to gather financial aid for the cause. “Our main funding comes from CSR of corporates. Also, we keep hosting a lot of fund-raising events by bringing people to the place we are working at,” says Maitreyi.

Once the school is revamped, the group remains consistent with the follow-ups. “After every project we have an impact measurement tool to see how things changed for teachers and students; how the concepts are helping their learning process and how are they using the renovated school infrastructure in the teaching process,” says Yajnavalkya .

In May 2019, Zero Gravity renovated a NMC school in Telangkhedi. The strength then was 57. “Today, when we recently did the survey we found that within one session, the strength of the school is 152. When we do an intervention in the school building, we encourage community to be with us in the renovation process,” says Maitreyi.

Apart from schools, Zero Gravity is also focusing on renovating government shelters. In June 2018, the group completely transformed the girls’ shelter home run by the district women and child development department at Katol Square.

The aim with which the young lot got into this project seems to have been fulfilled. “We wanted to provide basic dignity of living and learning for people coming from low income backgrounds,” says Yajnavalkya.

113,['20/03/2020'],Patients suffering from minor illnesses asked not to visit Jipmer,"Puducherry: Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) has discouraged patients with minor ailments from visiting Jipmer in view of “disproportionately high risk of exposure” to infections including Covid-19 on the crowded hospital premises.

In an advisory issued on Wednesday, the institute said only patients with critical ailments needing tertiary care facilities must visit the institute. The Union government has instructed all citizens to avoid crowded places in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Large hospitals are one such type of places. For instance, Jipmer is visited by 8,000 to 10,000 patients every day, in addition to their attendants. Also, the crowd in the hospital is more likely to include patients with Covid-19. Thus, there is a real risk of those visiting Jipmer catching Covid-19 infection. Further, the visitors to hospitals are often elderly, infirm and more vulnerable in whom the infection is more likely to be severe or fatal,"" said the advisory.

The institute advised patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer and heart disease on regular continuous medications not to visit the institute to receive drugs. ""They can get their regular medications from a nearby government hospital or from Jan Aushadhi Pharmacies at subsidised cost using a previous prescription from Jipmer,"" the advisory said.

The institute advised all patients needing an elective (non-urgent) surgical procedure to delay their visit to Jipmer until the Union government lifts the restrictions.

""Each patient needs to understand the risk of exposure to a large hospital such as Jipmer and balance this against the genuine benefit of such a visit. Jipmer regrets the inconvenience caused to its dear patients. However, it is purely the health interest of our patients that have forced us to make this decision,"" said the advisory.

PRAYAGRAJ: After serial changes in names of Allahabad Junction and its satellite stations, Cheoki and Rambagh, the ball has been set rolling to rename Allahabad University too. Nomenclature change of the 133-year-old Central university tops the agenda of the ensuing executive council meeting of AU . A month ago, Allahabad Junction was renamed as Prayagraj Junction, Allahabad City as Prayagraj Rambag and Allahabad Cheoki as Prayagraj Cheoki.

After passage in EC, the proposal would be sent to Union HRD ministry from where it would be tabled in Parliament before approval of the President. The agenda (No. 08/60) of EC mentions a February 10 letter by Raju Saraswat, under-secretary, HRD ministry. The then UP chief secretary had requested name change of the varsity to Prayagraj University in a letter to the Centre on December 4, 2018. The HRD official in his communique also mentioned a letter by former commissioner Allahabad division, Ashish Goyal, with a similar request. The name of Allahabad district was changed to Prayagraj on October 18, 2018.

“In my opinion, names of institutions with a rich legacy should remain unchanged. Madras University and Madras High Court have retained their original names despite the city being renamed Chennai. Why should one change the name of AU”, asked Prof Ashim Mukerjee, member of EC.

Earlier, the executive council meeting was scheduled on Monday (March 16), but because of the coronavirus threat, the meeting was postponed. The next date has not been notified by varsity authorities.

Former president of the AU students’ union, Richa Singh, has requested the Kaushambi MP, Vinod Sonkar, to stop the name change of AU. “I have requested the MP to kindly spare AU and not advocate for changing its name. The institution has a proud past and a bright future,” she said.

125,['20/03/2020'],Teen’s family stands up against social media trial and vilification,"Kolkata: The teenager who tested positive for Covid-19 — Bengal’s first — and his parents are traumatized and scared after their photographs were circulated on social media and a call for “action” against them went viral.

Family sources claimed that the teenager, now in Beliaghata Infectious Diseases (ID) hospital, had stepped out of his home only once on Monday to get himself examined at MR Bangur Hospital. He was advised to undergo a Covid-19 test at ID Hospital as he did not have any ‘outward symptom’.

“The teenager had completed his ISC examination in 2018-19 and secured admission in Oxford University for masters in maths — a four-year integrated course. On March 6, he attended a university valediction programme. They later learnt that another student had tested positive for Covid-19,” a person close to the family said. “Since he had a flight ticket back home, he sought the university’s directions. The university allowed him to leave. He returned to Kolkata on Sunday,” the person said.

“The family could not get him checked that evening as it was late and no symptom was noticed at the airport. He was advised home quarantine,” he added. According to the family member, the teenager’s father, a child specialist posted in a south Bengal district, had come to meet his son on Sunday for half an hour before leaving Kolkata.

“On Monday morning, he was taken to MR Bangur hospital for a check-up. The doctor was told the reasons and he had adopted all precautions. The hospital diagnosis did not reveal anything serious and his ‘outward symptoms’ were normal. But as a precaution, he was advised to undergo the Covid-19 tests,” the family member said. It was 1pm, and they were informed that the blood and swab samples collection deadline had passed for the day. So, they returned home and went to ID Hospital the next morning.

“The only error in judgement was that the mother had gone briefly to Nabanna to attend some meetings on Monday,” he said.

“WhatsApp messages, social media posts and some news websites suggesting they had been negligent are completely wrong. After the teen tested Covid-19 positive, his mother and the driver were admitted to the hospital. His father, too, was asked to report to the hospital, which he did. The family is now extremely worried about the allegations that they had deliberately withheld information,” the family member said.

“The carcass had no head and only two flippers were seen. Blood smears were spotted on the top of its body,” said Davidson Sargunam, an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) member, who spotted the carcass.

“It is suspected that the marine animal would have been a victim of a fishing boat or net,” he said and added that the cause of death could be ascertained only after an autopsy is conducted by the forest department.

Olive Ridley is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN red list and Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (amended 1991). Sea turtles are also protected under the Migratory Species Convention and Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna (CITES).

Forest department personnel engaged in protecting Olive Ridley turtles and their hatchery in Rajakkamangalam said the turtles visit beaches in Kanyakumari from mid-December to mid-March for nesting.

This year only around 2,950 eggs were spotted in 29 nests with around 100 or more eggs in each nest. The first turtle nest was spotted on December 19 and the last one was spotted last week. “Around 500 have been released in the sea so far, including the 104 hatchlings released on Thursday,” a forest department personnel said.

The numbers are fast dwindling from more than 15,200 eggs collected from 154 nests from the December 2016 to March 2017 nesting season.

However, the bank officials said the rush wasn’t as much as expected probably because of the ongoing threat of novel coronavirus. Those who had queued up at the bank’s several branches were seen wearing face masks or taking other precautionary measures for Covid-19.

Sources said most customers who visited the bank in several parts of the city had to settle their accounts. “I don’t trust this bank any more. I risked my life and came here to close my account,” said a customer at Bapuji Nagar branch.

Meanwhile, bank officials were seen pacifying the customers. “We are trying to make them understand that the situation is under control now and there money will not go anywhere,” an official of the bank’s Bapuji Nagar branch said.

Many customers were also seen making a beeline at the ATM counters, of whom some had come to withdraw all their money. “I don’t want my hard-earned money to go to waste as I have decided to clear my account,” said Partha Jena, a customer at the bank’s Saheed Nagar branch.

Several customers also opted for online banking to commission their transactions. “I have saved Rs 35,000 in my account and I just transferred all of it to my other accounts. I don’t want to use this account any more,” said Sudhanshu Mishra, another customer.

It must be noted that soon after the news spread that Yes Bank had become cash starved and the Union ministry of finance imposed restrictions on banking services earlier this month, there was a mad rush of customers in the Yes Bank branches in the city.

On March 5, the Reserve Bank of India imposed a cap on the withdrawal limit of the bank to Rs 50,000 a month. The banking services, including ATMs and POSs, mainly for Yes Bank customers were also not working owing to the crisis situation.

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday stayed the order of Udham Singh Nagar district magistrate (DM) Neeraj Khairwal, seeking to merge 398 government-run primary and junior schools in the district.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe had been hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by US Nagar resident Ganesh Upadhyay, who contended that the DM’s order violated the Right To Education (RTE) Act, which stipulates that the government provide primary schools within the walking distance of one kilometer junior schools within that of three kilometers.

“The RTE Act of 2009 says that it is the responsibility of the government to provide a primary school within the walking distance of one kilometer. The order was clearly against provisions of the Act and therefore, the court has ordered the DM and the government to maintain the status quo on the issue of merging the schools in the district,” Upadhyay told TOI.

According to the order issued by the DM, 398 out of 1,100 schools in the district were to be merged. The order had stated that these schools will be developed as model schools.

“The government said that these schools will be developed into model schools and that they are being merged because the number of students studying in them is very few. However, there are schools which have more than 100 students and therefore, the decision was completely wrong,” Upadhyay added.

However, after health officials and police held talks with them, they were shifted to the quarantine facilities.

The passengers arrived at the airport where they were mandatorily screened by health officials for Covid-19. All of them were to be quarantined for 14 days. However, a section of them started to argue that only those with symptoms need to be quarantined while the others should get to go home. They refused to board the bus kept ready to take them to the quarantine facilities. The passengers were also reportedly not happy with the arrangements made at the facilities.

Finally, after the intervention of health and police officials, all 144 passengers were taken to the quarantine facilities at Chinna Udaipu and Austinpatti on the outskirts of Madurai, where 120 beds and 60 beds each have been set up. “Only a few among the 144 were resisting. We later ensured all of them are in quarantine,” said a health official.

Earlier in the day, residents in and around Chinna Udaipu protested near the facility stating that they fear the possible spread of Covid-19 from those quarantined. Officials held talks with the residents and allayed their fears.

“People’s irrational fear of Covid-19 is the reason for such protests. We urge the public to be aware of the facts and not believe in rumours. As for quarantine, we are already only letting those without symptoms stay in the facility. If anyone is showing symptoms, we have ambulances ready and will immediately shift them to a hospital,” said a health official.

Meanwhile, as many as 10 people were booked for triggering a panic about Covid-19 spread and staging a road roko against setting up a temporary medical camp at a private women’s college hostel at Sainathapuram in Vellore city on Wednesday night .

Residents living close to the college registered their opposition to the move fearing they would be easy prey to the Covid-19. Officials from the district administration have decided to set up the facility elsewhere.

Police detained 10 people for staging the road roko, triggering panic among other residents , police said.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe, had in its last hearing, ordered Dehradun DM Ashish Kumar Srivastava to inspect all sites in the Doon valley where animals are slaughtered and file a response within two weeks. However while hearing the case today, the court termed the affidavit by Dehradun’s DM “evasive” and ordered him to be physically present in the court. “Dehradun DM has been asked to appear before the court on March 23 and explain as to why truckloads of animals are entering Dehradun when there is no legally-run slaughterhouse in Dehradun,"" said Kartikey Hari Gupta , lawyer appearing for the petitioner.

Dehradun DM, in his affidavit to the court, had said that he had directed the regional office of the State Pollution Control Board to submit a report stating the number of slaughterhouses running in the state. To this, the SPCB had replied saying that there is just one slaughterhouse in Dehradun. The affidavit added that even that particular slaughterhouse has also been closed by the Dehradun Municipal Corporation. Later, Dehradun DM paid a visit to the slaughterhouse on March 11. “That on 11.3.2020, the District Magistrate himself visited the slaughterhouse at Bhandari Bagh and found that a notice has been pasted on the main gate stating that the slaughterhouse has been closed till further orders of the Dehradun Municipal Corporation ,"" the affidavit read.

Gupta told TOI that any place where ten (or more) animals are slaughtered is termed as a slaughterhouse. “The DM cannot absolve himself from the compliance of the HC orders merely by closing government slaughterhouses. All private shops where more than ten animals are being slaughtered have to be shut as well,” Gupta said.

AGRA: A probe has been ordered by additional municipal commissioner into complaints that illegal user charges are being levied for collecting garbage door to door in the city in the name of Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC).

Since mid-January, AMC workers have been collecting garbage every day. They were entrusted with the task after the contracts of private companies assigned the job were cancelled. The AMC officials had directed that no user charges be collected till the door-to-door garbage collection work is regularized in all the 100 wards of the city. However, it is learnt that illegal charges are being collected from houses and business establishments. Fake receipts are also being were issued.

The matter came to the fore when people from Sultanganj, Balkeshwar and Water Works area gathered at the AMC office on Wednesday to point out that proper sanitation and hygiene was not being maintained in the city.

The people brought the “fake receipts” of the door-to-door garbage collection charges as proof. The receipts did not bear the name of the AMC or any official stamp or signature of any official. These receipts ranged between Rs 300 and 880 for one month of garbage collection.

The residents also informed the additional municipal commissioner that the men who came to recover user charges were not the ones who came to collect the garbage. The men who collected user charges claimed to be associated with the cleanliness work of the civic body.

Talking with TOI, additional municipal commissioner KB Singh said, “Presently the door-to-door garbage collection work is being done by the AMC. Our priority is to ensure standard maintenance of sanitation and hygiene in the city and not to generate revenue through user charges. For now, no charges are being collected for the service. We have taken cognizance of the complaints of illegal recovery taking place in the name of door-to-door garbage collection. An investigation has been initiated in the entire matter.”

Talking with TOI, mayor Naveen Jain said, “I have also received complaints of illegal recovery on the name of door-to-door garbage collection. AMC officials are conducting a probe in the entire matter. I have asked them to identify people involved in the illegal activity. I will ensure that an FIR is registered against such people.”

HYDERABAD: Meticulous planning and a bit of luck helped a culprit flee with Rs 92 lakh cash and a vehicle of an ATM cash replenishment firm. However, his luck ran out with police’s equally meticulous job — scanning footage of 500 CCTVs in 36 hours — and arresting him from his house at Nagole on Tuesday.

Task Force police arrested D Prakash, the driver of the vehicle, and recovered Rs 90 lakh stolen cash from his possession.

Prakash joined as a driver with Five Star Facility Solutions (India) Pvt Ltd in Kavadiguda in August 2019. On behalf of Five Star Facility Solutions, he worked for SIPL Company located at Diamond Point, Bowenpally, and, through them, he also worked as van driver for CMS Info Systems Limited.

“Prakash planned to steal cash transported from the bank while working as a driver. He waited for an opportunity and on March 16, he went to CMS Company’s vehicle parking place at Kavadiguda wearing a cap and covering his face with a handkerchief. Introducing himself as Rakesh, an employee of Five Star Security Service, the accused took the keys of a Bolero vehicle from the security guard. He then went to CMS office at Lower Tank Bund and contacted coordinator Anil Kumar Yadav.

The coordinator assigned gunman Ravi Kumar along with two custodians — T Ravi and V Jagannath Rao — to transport cash from SBI’s Koti branch to SBI ATMs. The crew picked up Rs 1.6 crore cash from SBI Koti and stopped at Shiva Tea point in Chilkalguda to load Rs 68 lakh cash in an ATM. “Gunman and two custodians got out of the vehicle and went to load the cash. During this time, Prakash fled with the vehicle containing Rs 92 lakh cash after informing them that he would take a U-turn,” city police commissioner Anjani Kumar said. The CMS staff alerted their colleagues and they tracked the abandoned Bolero to Lalaguda flyover.

Based on the complaint lodged by a CMS representative, Chilkalguda police registered a cheating case and 28 members of Task Force team scanned nearly 500 CCTVs in 36 hours. They saw the accused boarding an auto near Lalaguda flyover and conducted house-to-house check at Sai Nagar Colony in Nagole, where the accused disembarked with two bags.

The city police chief presented mementos to auto driver Sk Hameed and seven residents of Sai Nagar Colony in Nagole, including two persons working for police for helping Task Force team in cracking the case.

Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also slammed the Yogi government for not addressing issues affecting people.

“The BJP government presents fake numbers to pat its back. But when you ask questions regarding farmers, youth, businessmen and women, they cut corners. The people of UP have suffered a lot at the hands of this government,” Priyanka tweeted.

Releasing a booklet to list the failures of the Yogi government, Lallu said: “Three years of Yogi government have been all about brazen abuse of power, shameless communalisation of police force and weakening India’s secular fabric by spreading hatred.”

LUCKNOW: A four-member CBI team on Wednesday night visited Jhansi jail, where it questioned the staff and four prisoners who were with Munna Bajrangi before the don was shot dead on July 9, 2018.

The investigators also seized the prison register to identify people who met Bajrangi in Jhansi a day before he was shifted to Baghpat jail and killed by gangster Sunil Rathi.

The CBI, following an Allahabad High Court directive, lodged an FIR against Rathi on March 7.

A senior CBI officer said Bajrangi, alias Prem Prakash, was shot within hours of being shifted out of Jhansi jail.

At least eight members of prison staff, including guards and deputy jailers, were quizzed for several hours as were four inmates who were in touch with the don for over two years during his stay in Jhansi jail.

The questioning began at 9pm on Wednesday and continued till Thursday evening. “They were categorically asked about the circumstances under which the don was shifted,” a CBI officer said.

CBI officers said the entire episode of the don being shifted from Jhansi to Baghpat and the early morning murder would be reconstructed. On the seized entry register of 2018, sources said the CBI had zeroed in on nine persons who had come to visit the don in Jhansi from July 1 to July 6 that year.

The agency had earlier quizzed staff at Baghpat jail. It has now sought permission to quiz Rathi who is currently lodged in Tihar jail.

Bajrangi was jailed in 2009 for the murder of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai at Mohamadabad in Ghazipur district on November 29, 2005.

HYDERABAD: Employees of the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited ( TSSPDCL ) started the process of vacating the stone building at Mint Compound on Thursday following state government orders in view of the proposal to construct a new secretariat building at the existing complex.

Official sources said that the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited metro zone office will now be shifted to Rangareddy zone office at the Mint Compound and the Hyderabad Banjara Hills circle office will be shifted to Erragadda. Two more offices — Transco and CIG — are being shifted to Vidyut Soudha , they added.

The stone building was constructed about 100 years ago and the place was once used as Nizam’s Mint Compound and later the finance ministry set up the government mint and security printing press in 1980.

The government had earlier planned to use the building for security personnel guarding the secretariat. But the idea was dropped as Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited authorities said that they do not have space to shift their offices. Now, the government has reportedly instructed the discom to vacate the building as the land is required for the new secretariat as per Vaastu.

This has come as a relief to the parents who were worried about their wards being vulnerable to the epidemic. In the meeting, it was decided to postpone the board exams of classes V, VIII, X and XII of Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE).

School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said, “To prevent the spread of coronavirus, it was necessary to postpone the exams. Students are vulnerable to the disease. Now, people are being requested to spread the right information and to not panic.”

Similar orders were issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday. In RBSE, for Class X, only two exams were remaining and class XII exams were supposed to go on till April 3.

CBSE and other state boards in the country have already issued orders to promote students to the next class on the basis of average marks obtained in other exams. The decision was taken due to the sudden closure of schools and interruption in exams.

Last week, private school organization in Rajasthan declared to promote students in primary sections to next class on average marking.

However, RBSE has just postponed board exams for class V and VIII but no decision has been made to promote these students to further classes. Teachers in government schools have objected to it, stating unnecessary wastage of time. “Anyway in primary sections, students are promoted without fail. Instead of postponing exams in classes V and VIII, government must promote these students to further sections to do away with the headache,” said one government teacher anonymously. Ongoing exam of all the colleges have been postponed as well where more than 6 lakh students were appearing for exams everyday. Taking precautionary measures, most universities in the state have postponed their exams.

MUMBAI: In a matter of 14 days, Maharashtra has witnessed a sudden and unexpected fall in liquor consumption, resulting in an excise duty loss of nearly Rs 600 crore.

“There is no correlation between liquor consumption and health during the Coronavirus outbreak. It appears that people have stopped liquor consumption on their own and several shops have shut following the district administration orders,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI.

The bureaucrat said district collectors of Nagpur, Parbhani, Palghar, Pune, Buldhana, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have ordered closure of liquor shops while there is a complete ban on its consumption in the Chandrapur, Wardha and Gadchiroli districts.

“District collectors have imposed stringent restrictions to ensure that people do not gather in large numbers at one place. Social distancing is the key factor so that the virus does not spread any further. These orders had an adverse impact on people who visit restaurants and bars and consequently liquor consumption. We estimate liquor consumption has reduced by at least 20%,” he said.

He said the state government had set the target of Rs 17,977 crore for the current financial year and as on March 15, mobilization of excise duty was Rs 14,700 crore. Average monthly collection of excise duty on country liquor and Indian Made Foreign Liquor and foreign liquor ranges from Rs 1,200 crore to Rs 1,400 crore. “By and large, by March, we achieve the target. Now, following Coronavirus, it will not be possible to reach the target,” he said.

The bureaucrat further said ever since Covid-19, there has been adverse impact on the overall economy with people staying put indoors. Most outings as well as public events have been cancelled.

“There are no more celebrations and all events have been cancelled in view of the appeal made by the chief minister,’’ he said.

A senior excise official said reduction in consumption has resulted in a huge revenue loss, following liquor ban in Chandrapur district, hometown of former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. There was a proposal to lift it but no decision was taken following public pressure.

The varsity’s decision comes in after the state health department’s request to expedite the evaluation of the answer scripts as it wants to increase the department’s skilled health manpower as soon as possible.

“Although the department has not specified why it wants the university to speed up the evaluation process, we are of the view that more trained health personnel in the state would be required as the number of Covid-19 cases in on the rise. There are also apprehensions about community transmission of the infection,” said an MUHS functionary.

Varsity’s controller of examination Ajit Pathak told TOI t hat the MUHS will declare the results within a month instead of the customary 45-50 days needed to evaluate the papers after completion of the exam.

The state government has been recruiting these mid-level healthcare providers since March 2019 under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. In the state, the MUHS conducts the examination before the state government appoints the healthcare providers.

Altogether, 3,366 ayurved and nursing graduates are appearing for the exam after finishing a six-month training programme in modern medicine at different district health hospitals. Pathak said the theory exam was completed on February 29 and the practicals would get over by March 22.

“By the end of this month, we shall declare the results and hand over the list of successful candidates to the state health department,” he added.

“The pass percentage of such examination is over 80%. This means that at least 2,600 skilled health personnel would be available to the state health department in the near future,” the university sources said.

These examinees are trained to administer medicines, vaccinations, monitor the health of critically ill patients etc. They are appointed for a three-year term, but the contract gets extended if their performances are good. “The appointments of such mid-level healthcare personnel are meant for the health wellness clinics like primary health centres. But in case of need, they can also be deployed in government hospitals,” said Pathak.

HYDERABAD: The forest department has imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on realtors responsible of uprooting saplings along the stretch from Inorbit Mall to IKEA.

The remitters have also been asked to replace the uprooted saplings with 180 more as the plants were removed without permission.

“About 60 saplings were removed to ensure smooth flow of traffic near Salarpuria Sattva complex,” said Srikanth, a forest section officer. The amount was paid by Amit Bagla , who claimed to be a representative of the complex management.

However, city-based activist Harish Daga, who first reported the issue, said the fine was miniscule. “The number of saplings bulldozed was definitely over 100. The fine will not deter others from committing similar acts in the name of development.” He further said that a road had already been laid over the said site.

All four returned home late in the evening on Thursday.

They included a 44-year-old footwear exporter who had returned from Italy in the last week of February, his 16-year-old son, the 48-year-old manager of his factory and his 45-year-old wife.

Earlier on Sunday, four members of the shoe exporter family, including the 65-year-old mother of the factory owner who had heavy viral load but did not test Covid-19 positive, were also discharged from Safdarjung Hospital.

Talking to TOI, the shoe exporter said, “Along with five family members, I had been quarantined on March 3. Barring me and my son, four family membersincluding my wife, parents and younger brother were discharged on March 15. Mentally, it was a tough time. Doctors in both Agra and Delhi made their best efforts to help us recover. The arrangements made by the state and central government to control spread of the disease are commendable. It is a great feeling to return home, after staying away from family and friends for 17 days.”

“Doctors have asked us to avoid social gatherings for a few days and maintain a high level of hygiene and sanitation. We will follow their directions,” he added.

The manager of the shoe factory said, “Doctors at Agra district hospital and Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital took good care of us. We were kept in separate rooms. There was no TV, but mobile phone was allowed. Isolation was a little depressing for all of us. People need not panic and strictly follow government advisory.”

Elsewhere, samples of all suspected patients sent to King George Medical University (KGMU) on Wednesday tested negative.

Satish Verma, superintendent in-charge of district hospital, told TOI, “Ten local residents who had recently returned from Europe, the Middle East and Sri Lanka, were admitted in isolation. Eleven other suspected cases were identified by the surveillance team. Blood, nose and throat swab samples of the 21 people have been sent to KGMU for lab tests. Reports are likely to be received on Friday afternoon.”

District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Out of the eight Covid-19 positive cases, seven people have been cured of disease. One female Covid-19 positive patient is being treated at SN Medical College. In total, 1,222 people have been advised home quarantine. Health department teams are closely monitoring health of all these people. We have also constituted a traveler’s list tracking team. It will be conducting checkup of all the people arriving from other countries.”

166,['20/03/2020'],Jaipur Coronavirus News: School stripped of affiliation for flouting norms on coronavirus,"Photo of Shakti Shiksha Academy Sr Sec School tweeted by school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra

JAIPUR: The recognition of Shakti Shiksha Academy Sr Sec School, Jaipur, was cancelled on Thursday by the orders of directorate of education, Bikaner, for keeping the school open in violation of guidelines issued to check spread of Covid-19.

In a surprise inspection on Thursday, Shakti Shiksha Academy School was found conducting examination as per schedule. School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra later tweeted that no school was allowed to function, so its recognition will be cancelled.

Due to the threat of coronavirus, the government has directed all educational institutions in the state to declare holidays but many prominent schools in the city were found to be functioning or calling the teachers to duty. A video went viral on social media in which students were seen going to Divine Public School, Jaipur. Education department officials reached the school and shut it down.

Not only were students being forced to go to schools, many private and government schools in the city were calling teachers, who were made to sit in the staff rooms though the classes were not on. When the school authorities were asked the reason for this, they said that the teachers were still getting salaries.

A private school teacher who did not wish to be identified said, “There is no work and most of our teachers sit in the staff room. We asked the administration to allow us to work from home but they said that teachers are being paid. But this is dangerous for our safety.”

In government schools too, teachers are made to come to work everyday though holidays have been declared. Many government schools have a teaching staff of more than 50 persons. The education authorities’ decision to call them to work violates government order about disallowing gatherings of above 50 persons.

School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said that private schools were not under the government’s jurisdiction. “We cannot force private schools but they should understand the safety of teachers.” The minister added, “In government schools, the teachers may be given responsibility to spread awareness during the time of epidemic. We are thinking to divide teachers in different batches to be available in schools and avoid crowd gatherings. We cannot shut down the entire system as other departments are functioning as well.”

The situation was similar in city’s colleges. One private college, Bhawani Niketan College, Jaipur, has been calling teachers everyday for some work. When asked, the administration said that exams were going on and teachers were called for administering.

Meena Rathore, principal of the college said, “All the teachers were called due to the ongoing exams. Now, the university has declared postponement of exams, and we have followed the guidelines. The notification issued by education department was just to close down classes, but nothing was specified for the working of teachers. It is wrong and teachers must also be given relaxation for their security.”

167,['20/03/2020'],Anil Ambani quizzed by ED for 9 hrs in Yes Bank case,"MUMBAI: Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani was questioned for over nine hours by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday in connection with a Rs 12,500-crore loan extended by Yes Bank to the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) companies, which went bad. Sources said he may be called for further questioning by March-end.

It is alleged that at the same time it received the loan, ADAG had given Rs 1,100 crore as loans to firms owned by Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor’s family members, a move that is suspected to be a quid pro quo arrangement.

A Reliance Group statement said Ambani met ED officials to clarify on the group’s exposure to Yes Bank. He reiterated that the Reliance Group’s entire exposure to Yes Bank is fully secured, and in compliance with laws and financial regulations.

“Ambani also clarified to the agency that Reliance Group has no direct or indirect exposure to Rana Kapoor or his wife or daughters, or any entities controlled by Rana Kapoor or his family. Reliance Group is committed to honour repayments of all its borrowings from Yes Bank through its various asset monetisation programmes,” the press note added.

The ED investigation is focusing on financial transactions and loans between Reliance Group companies, Yes Bank and companies associated with the Kapoor family. Sources said Yes Bank—then managed by Kapoor—sanctioned loans to ADAG companies till 2018 through it was in a financial crisis and some of its other loans had turned into non-performing assets (NPAs).

After that, ADAG companies were found to have given loans to Kapoor’s family companies in the form of debentures. ED alleged that Kapoor had formed 78 companies in the names of his wife Bindu and three daughters—Roshini Kapoor, Radha Kapoor Khanna and Raakhee Kapoor Tandon. Kapoor was managing all of them and allegedly received Rs 5,000 crore as bribe from companies that had borrowed nearly Rs 20,000 crore from Yes Bank that later turned into NPAs. ED has arrested Kapoor and he is now in its custody.

NAGPUR: The family members of cops deployed at various places are concerned that the breadwinners of their home might be exposed to coronavirus infection if adequate preventive measures are not taken.

Cops are deployed among the unscreened masses on the streets, swarming litigants and others at courts, premises meant for the quarantined (MLA hostel), passengers arriving from international and national destinations and also at the government hospitals including Mayo Hospital where suspected and positive patients are present.

Cops are often spotted without masks or with only handkerchief wrapped around faces at public places. Though city police top brass has started distributing sanitizers and masks, TOI found many cops are yet to receive them.

Jyotsna Bhandarkar, wife of Tehsil police station’s senior inspector Jayesh in whose jurisdiction the Mayo hospital is located, says she can’t stop worrying. “He (Jayesh) cleans his hands and legs with disinfectants before entering the house and also takes other precautions. He is an officer but that does not make him any less human than others,” she said.

Mamta Deshmukh, wife of head constable Rajesh posted at Pachpaoli police station, says her husband has to take accused persons to Mayo hospital for medical examination on a regular basis. “We keep reminding him to follow personal hygiene and ensure his uniform and dresses are washed regularly,” she said.

Sunita Tiwari, wife of traffic constable Anil, who many times works close to the Government Medical College and Hospital , says the virus outbreak has posed a new challenge. “I try to keep my husband motivated. Many times, we remind him to carry sanitizer and mask. My husband has to speak to hundreds of strangers on the road. It’s not easy to use a mask while on the field,” she said.

DCP, headquarters, Vikram Sali said Rs1 lakh has been arranged from the welfare fund to purchase sanitizers and masks. “We have sent two reminders to the divisional commissioner’s office for a grant of Rs 20 lakh out of the Rs five crore government has sanctioned. The fund is for emergency needs of the constabulary like marriages, education and medical requirements. It would have been better had the government fund was available,” said the DCP.

NEW DELHI: A day before their scheduled execution, the four Nirbhaya convicts were anxious. They were eager to know about the plea filed for stay on hanging.

Jail officers had planned to keep an extra vigil on all four of them on Thursday night to ensure they don’t hurt themselves. All the staff, including the hangman, were counselled earlier in the day and their phones confiscated.

Sources said that the four convicts were also counselled. An excerpt from the Gita was read out to them and they were told about the karma.

“Pawan broke down after this and asked for forgiveness, while Mukesh kept on claiming that he was suffering for something he had not done. He blamed his past lives for this. Akshay said he had reformed himself and wanted to do something good for the society. Vinay was hopeful that the hanging would be stalled at the last moment,” a jail officer said.

On Thursday, the hangman conducted a dummy test using the actual hanging ropes.

As per schedule, all four convicts were handed at 5.30am on Friday inside Tihar jail.

Since Section 144 has been implemented, those organising weddings in the months of April, May and June will have to take permissions from the district collectors concerned and police commissioners in Jaipur and Jodhpur.

The state government has already appealed to the public to refrain from mass gatherings and even weddings. Due to this, food caterers, wedding planners, lights and sound organisers and others related to the wedding industry are already getting postponement notices for upcoming weddings.

If Section 144 is in place, those whose wedding dates are finalised in advance would need some permissions. “They will have to ensure that there would be minimal and restricted entry to these weddings, also the area must be properly sanitized. Guests coming to the wedding should not be having health issues like cough, cold or fever.

“When they come seeking permission, we will fix some parameters. Also, our men will videograph the wedding venue,” said Anand Srivastav, commissioner of police, Jaipur.

In this changed scenario, those associated with wedding card printing, music, sound and light, food catering have already started getting calls for postponement.

“I have at least 20 marriage bookings in April. My client had given me some advance, but has now said that he is going to limit the wedding function that was meant for a gathering of 2,000 people to 24,” said Nekiram Agarwal, a food caterer.

Likewise, in other districts, the district administration has already appealed to locals to make weddings a very small affair. “We are spreading mass awareness on this amid the Covid-19 scare. We won’t disallow the wedding, but will urge people to make it a very small affair,” said Dinesh Chand Jain, district collector, Pali.

However, some district collectors said the Section 144 is upto March 31, only and if things improve there won’t be many restrictions on weddings.

178,['20/03/2020'],Nirbhaya Case News: Seal of finality on Nirbhaya case,"Nirbhaya case convicts (File photo)

NEW DELHI: By the time you read this report, the four Nirbhaya case convicts may have been hanged with Delhi high court dismissing a last-minute plea filed by three of them to stall the execution scheduled early on Friday.

“There has to be some sanctity and finality attached to a death warrant. It has already been postponed three times,” a bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula observed, refusing to delay the punishment. The counsel for the convicts, AP Singh, said he would go to Supreme Court in the early hours to get a stay.

During the nearly two-hour hearing that began at 10pm, the bench repeatedly underlined that not just the trial court, but even high court, Supreme Court and even the President had on several occasions rejected each petition filed by Mukesh, Akshay, Pawan and Vinay.

The parents of Nirbhaya and their legal team had rushed to high court after Chief Justice DN Patel allowed the listing of the case before a division bench on urgent mentioning of the same by Singh.

“We operate in a hierarchical system of courts. Your judgment has attained finality, we can’t sit over an Supreme Court verdict. Death warrants have to be executed,” the bench told advocate Singh who made a last-ditch effort to again defer the hangings.

“This matter actually shows how much delay is inbuilt into our system. When was the crime? Look where we are today. Appeals were dismissed in 2017. Why didn’t you file mercy plea for two and half years? There has been an attempt to play the system by way of staggered mercy petitions. Don’t blame courts,” the bench said.

Singh had sought a stay on the execution citing various petitions he had filed before several legal fora, including Supreme Court. Akshay’s wife has sought divorce in a Bihar court where the next hearing is in April.

Arguing before the bench, Singh claimed that a former jail official in his book had claimed that the Test Identification Parade of the convicts was done in an illegal manner. He also cast aspersions on the integrity of Nirbhaya’s friend who escaped after being beaten and attacked on the cold December night in 2012.

Later, one of the counsels argued that President Ram Nath Kovind was prejudiced against them since he made a public statement that rapists don’t deserve any mercy and this legal option must not be provided to them.

After keenly listening to all the arguments by the convicts counsel and standing counsel Rahul Mehra who opposed the petitions, the bench dismissed them, saying it found no merit in the arguments.

Earlier in the day, a Delhi court, while rejecting the plea of the convicts had said that a condemned convict cannot be permitted to frustrate the course of law by simply opting to remain indolent.

A family court in Aurangabad while hearing the divorce petition of Punita Devi, wife of Akshay Thakur, on Thursday ordered her to appear on March 24 to record her statement but refused her counsel’s request of issuing a summon to Thakur. Punita had filed a divorce petition on March 12 stating that she does not want to live the rest of her life as the widow of a rapist. Accordingly, she has pleaded for divorce from Thakur. A hearing on the divorce petition was held on Thursday. However, Punita was not present in the court during the hearing. Her family said she had gone to Delhi to meet Thakur.

A man, who had recently been to Dubai along with his wife, tested positive for the virus. The couple had concealed their travel history and their names were not on the list given to the district administration by the state government.

District collector Rahul Dwivedi said that the swab samples of the man, who is in isolation, were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, on March 17 along with the samples of his wife. The results came on Thursday. While the wife tested negative for the virus, the man tested positive.

“The couple had concealed their overseas travel history from the administration. On March 17, the district officials came to know about them and immediately quarantined them. Their swab samples were sent to the NIV,” Dwivedi said.

The patient has been admitted to the isolation ward of the Booth Hospital. His condition is stable and he does not currently have fever, cold or cough.

District health department sources said the couple had gone to Dubai and had returned on March 3. The couple, along with three other couples who do not belong to Ahmednagar, had gone on a sponsored trip. Since their return to Ahmednagar on March 3, and till March 17, this couple was in close contact with at least nine people. “We are now tracing these nine people so that similar tests can be carried out on them,” said the district health officials.

182,['20/03/2020'],Delhi: Little has changed on nightmare stretch,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The measures taken to ensure the safety of women in the capital since the rape of 23-year-old Nirbhaya look as dark as the route taken by the bus that day seven years ago. In all these years, little has been done to ensure that a woman feels safe walking alone on these roads. TOI retraced the course of the private bus that horrific December night in 2012 from Munirka to Ravidas Camp in RK Puram and found the stretch poorly lit and unmanned by police control room teams.

What has, however, increased at some places is the traffic. This helps because the vehicles light up the area with their headlights. But that’s still not enough to compensate for the missing and dysfunctional street lights on the 12-km stretch. Munirka resident Kajal said, “I have been living here for two decades and haven’t ventured out after 9pm ever. Why? Because I don’t feel safe. I don’t want to be the next Nirbhaya.”

Between Munirka bus stand and Rao Tula Ram Marg flyover leading to IGI Airport and back via Ravidas Camp there’s a conspicuous lack of road illumination and police security — two critical requirements for any woman on the road to feel safe at night. TOI traversed the route on Wednesday night and found dangers still lurk on the infamous stretch.

At 9.40pm on Outer Ring road where the Munirka bus stand is located, a board flashed the Women Helpline number. It seemed a good change from the numbing night when Nirbhaya and her friend got on the bus around a kilometre down the road. The new flyover was well illuminated by street lights and the bus stand too had lights. However, the road below the new and old RTR flyovers was isolated, with no police patrolling vans to be seen around. The market alongside was pitch dark too and could easily be a safe haven for criminals.

Around 6 km down towards NH8, nothing appeared to have changed in seven years. Half the street lamps skirting Shankar Vihar on the left were not functioning. The saving grace was the continuously moving traffic, the headlights of which comprised the ‘light generators’ on this stretch.

Further ahead, the first and the only police barricade had three cops loitering around in a dark corner. It was from here that the bus bearing Nirbhaya and her ravagers had turned towards Mahipalpur, opposite the airport approach road. The area is filled with hotels with neon boards and, therefore, was comparatively bright.

The bus had then taken a U-turn to get onto the other side of NH8. Not surprisingly, this road too was unlit because the street lamps again were not working. TOI followed the route taken by the bus and reached the Dwarka road, which was again devoid of police presence and proper illumination. This road didn’t have as much traffic as the Mahipalpur road did.

The bus then drove on NH-8 and soon after, the six convicts had dumped the brutalised Nirbhaya and her friend bleeding and almost naked. The vehicle then went towards Dwarka, took a U-turn and headed towards Outer Ring Road from where the men finally drove to their houses in Ravidas Camp. The approach to RK Puram Sector 3 was isolated and very dimly lit.

Seven years since the crime, Wednesday’s drive showed that street illumination and police presence continued to be problem areas on the route.

KANPUR: Advisory on coronavirus issued by the district administration and appeals of ‘self-quarantine’ are paying dividends in Kanpur city an no cases of the virus have been reported. The effect of compliance could be seen at the railway station and bus stand, where only a few people were seen on Thursday. Several of them commented that they have come out of their houses only for some urgent work.

Traffic on roads was less than routine days and there was no crowd at market places. Like other cities, in Kanpur there was no panic-like situation for storing food. People are purchasing according to their monthly requirement, said grocery shop owners.

However, availability of mask and hand sanitizers is not satisfactory and there is a shortage.

The district administration convened a meeting with drug merchants and asked them not to sell masks and hand sanitizers on high prices and warned of strict action as both the items have been declared as essential commodity.

District magistrate Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari asked the shopkeepers to display the rates and stock of masks in their shops. He also fixed the rates of mask. The two-ply layer surgical mask would be sold for Rs 22 per piece. Three-ply surgical mask for Rs 25 per piece, black/pollution mask for Rs 30 and N 95 mask for Rs.180 and hand sanitizers on MRP.

The district magistrate later said he had constituted several teams of drug department to conduct raids at medical stores on complaint of black marketing of the two essential commodities.

Adhivakta Kalyan Sangharsh Samiti in Kanpur court on Thursday handed over a memorandum to Kanpur judiciary and urged that the measures at Kanpur court to counter the virus were not adequate. The district administration and health department should send teams to Kanpur court to sanitize the area and conduct thermal screening of litigants.

Meanwhile, Green Park authorities closed sports activities till April 2. According to Ajay Sethi, regional sports officer, only a few morning walkers come Green Park otherwise all activities have been halted.

MUMBAI: While several states across the country have asked schools to not conduct second-term examinations for classes I to VIII, the Maharashtra government is yet to make an announcement in the matter. City schools, though, have taken the initiative and informed parents that students would be promoted to the next class on the basis of past exams.

Nikhat Azam, principal, Billabong High International School, Santacruz, said, “The management had taken this call when we decided to shut the school and impart learning through online portals. All the students will be promoted to the next grade and an average will be taken based on their past performance in this academic year for report card purpose. The results are always published on the school's online portal and the same will be done for year-end exams too.”

Similarly, at Vibgyor group of schools, all students of classes I to IV will be promoted and students of classes V to VIII will be exempt from second-term exams. “The cumulative/aggregate marks obtained by the students in the current academic year 2019-20 shall be considered for promotion to the next grade,” said a notification sent by the school. Additionally, the school has suspended all activities, including the summer camps scheduled for April, till further notice. Other schools that have taken similar steps include Children's Academy Group of Schools, St Mary's School (ICSE) Mazgaon.

Teachers said the state should make an announcement. “Teachers usually prepare for exams during this period and it would be extremely difficult to have exams once students are back from the break due to the uncertainty. Schools anyway promote students till Class VIII and must hence be exempted from taking final exams. While private schools take a call on their own, government and aided schools have to wait for instructions,” said Rajesh Pandya, Teachers’ Democratic Front, a teachers’ group.

A senior education department official said the decision on Class I to VIII exams will be taken by March-end. “Whether to schedule an exam or to grade students on the basis of performance of the last three exams will be decided soon. However, Class IX and XI will be held but dates will be announced only after taking review in March-end,” said the official.

The Indian authorities who had initially asked the Indian crew to take the same path home like their onward journey – via Dubai – finally allowed the Indians to cross the Wagah border just after midnight on Thursday. They were initially quarantined at a hospital in Amritsar, some 20 kms away from the border. But while most believed the quarantine would be for 24 or a maximum of 48 hours, they are now left to grope in the dark.

“This quarantine is a joke. We were initially told that we fall into the C category which is self-quarantine, but we cannot understand why we are lodged here, with six to eight people in a room. They did all the tests, found that we are fine. But we are being held captive,” a crew member told TOI on Thursday.

The Indian crew working for a Delhi-based sports production company at the Pakistan Super League (PSL) had to return home early after the league was cancelled as a foreign player developed symptoms of coronavirus.

“We are all kept here in this quarantine place, but still no information if they will let us go or keep us here. No one here has any clue. There was a press release which said all incoming citizens would be screened and then sent home for self-quarantine, but that does not seem to be the practice here.

“They have checked us for our temperature and blood pressure, four times since morning. No other tests have been done so far. If there is a lockdown, it will be difficult for us to get back home. We can only appeal to the authorities and pray,” said the crew member.

The PSL was cancelled just before the semifinals after a foreign player developed symptoms of coronavirus. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has not as yet revealed the identify of the cricketer, who, according to reports, has flown out of Pakistan. All players and broadcasters were later tested for the virus.

There are 274 ICUs with ventilators earmarked in government hospitals, but health experts termed them inadequate.In another positive development, the Indian Council of Medical Research on Thursday gave permission to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital to carry out the Covid-19 test. As of now tests are only being done at Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences.“While 60 beds will be added in PMCH, 40 beds will be added in Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), which comes under the administration of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH),” said additional secretary of state health department Kaushal Kishor.He added, “40 beds in IDH are ready, while 60 beds are being set up in a building of PMCH, where skin department was earlier functional, but is now a part of Patna University. Cleaning of the building is underway and it will be ready by Saturday.”Sources said isolation ward of PMCH, which has 20 beds as of now, was full to its capacity on Thursday night and two suspects, who had returned from Nigeria, had to be sent to NMCH.Apart from the isolation wards , quarantine facilities have been set up in three government hotels as well. One such hotel is Pataliputra Ashoka with 200 bed facility. Two other hotels are in Bodh Gaya with 72 and 30 beds facility each. Gaya district magistrate Abhishek Singh said people who have returned from seven Coviud-19 affected countries will be quarantined in the two hotels.As per data shared by the state health society, nine medical college and hospitals have sample collection centres. Officials said samples are being tested at four centres —Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna Medical College and Hospitals, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences and AIIMS-Patna.Till Friday, 23,8369 people had been screened at 49 transit points on Indo-Nepal border and 20120 had been screened at Patna and Gaya airport. As per the information shared by health department, no positive case had been reported in Bihar till Friday evening.Medical college and hospitals have 10 to 20 beds in isolation wards and district hospitals have five beds. “We have total 356 beds in isolation wards and it is in the process of being increased,” said Dr Ragini Mishra, who has been made state nodal officer for Covid-19. She added that 100 additional ventilators have also been procured lately.Health experts on the other hand, claimed that such measures were far from the resources required to tackle any major outbreak. “In a government system, they will take at least a month to procure ventilators. If any outbreak happens, then Bihar will not be able to cope with it,” said a doctor associated with Indian Medical Association.Senior paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah who has worked extensively on AES in Muzaffarpur, said, “Number of ventilators in government hospitals in Bihar are not enough to face any major outbreak. We are still in stage- two with regard to Covid-19 spread, but situation will turn grave, if we enter stage 3 and 4 and as we all know that elderly people are more vulnerable and they will need ventilators.”Explaining different stages, he said stage 1 is when positive case comes from outside the country. “When these positive cases come in contact with a person and transmit the virus, it leads to stage 2. Stage 3 occurs when there is community transmission and stage 4 when there is outbreak.”Suspect escapes: A Covid-19 suspect, who was admitted to the isolation ward of Biharsharif sadar hospital on Wednesday, escaped on Thursday but was later found at his home by the police and brought to the hospital.

BENGALURU: A 26-year-old woman entrepreneur who stole bitcoins worth Rs 3.7 crore from a company she co-founded was arrested on Thursday by Criminal Investigation Department (CID) sleuths. This is the first case to be registered for stealing bitcoins after the Supreme Court lifted the ban on trading of cryptocurrencies earlier this month.

Ayushi Jain, a resident of Bellandur, allegedly stole 63.5 bitcoins worth Rs 3.7 crore from BitCipher Labs LLP located on Outer Ring Road, Mahadevapura. Police said she jointly founded the firm in 2017 along with Ashish Singhal, the complainant. Ayushi quit the company on December 16, last year.

Singhal filed a complaint with CID’s cybercrime wing saying the bitcoins were stolen between January and March this year. Singhal said, “Me, Vimal Sagar Tiwari and Govind Kumar Soni hold a hard wallet on behalf of BitCipher Labs. The private keys were held among the three of us. Recently, we found that 63.5 bitcoins (Rs 36,662,259) were stolen and transferred through the exchange of SwapLab between January 11 and March 11.” SwapLab is a cryptocurrency exchange.

A team led by CID SP MD Sharath recovered Rs 3.7 crore from Ayushi on Thursday. She had transferred the money into the accounts of a couple of close friends.

Additional director general of police (economics wing), CID, B Dayananda, said they suspected it to be an insider job from the day the complaint was registered. “We found the suspect had used a passphrase, a sequence of words or text used in a computer system, to gain access into the hard wallet. We asked the complainant to furnish details of the staff, including those who left the job recently,” he said. Sharath scanned the activities of the staff and former employees, including Ayushi.

“On Wednesday, we took Ayushi into custody and searched her house. We seized a laptop which contained the history, showing how Ayushi used the passphrase and stole money in instalments between January and March. She confessed to the crime. By Thursday afternoon, we recovered the entire amount,” an investigating officer said.

192,['20/03/2020'],Ranjan Gogoi takes Rajya Sabha oath amid ‘shame on you’ chant from opposition,"NEW DELHI: Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday took oath as member of the Rajya Sabha amid sloganeering and jeers as well as a walkout by the Opposition parties, led by Congress.

As Gogoi’s name was called by chairman Venkaiah Naidu for the oath, MPs in the opposition benches started chanting slogans like “shame on you” with some trooping into the well or crowding the aisles. Even when Naidu called the booing unfair and unbecoming of Parliament, the MPs — from Congress, CPM , DMK, MDMK, Muslim League and BSP — remained undeterred. As Gogoi started taking the oath, the protesting MPs staged a walkout.

All this while Gogoi’s family — his wife, daughter and son-in-law — were in the RS viewing gallery, watching the unruly scenes.

After Gogoi finished his oath, Naidu said: “We know the constitutional position. We know the precedents. We know the powers of the President of India. We should not do anything in the House. Whatever views you have you can say outside... you are at liberty.”

Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: “This House has a great tradition of many eminent persons coming from diverse fields including former Chief Justices being nominated by those who — I regretfully say — have shouted.”

“Hon’ble member Gogoi who has taken oath today (Thursday) will surely contribute his best to Parliament and it was grossly unfair to do like that,” the minister added in reference to the jeers and walkout by opposition MPs.

Anand Sharma, deputy leader of opposition in the RS, told reporters, “We have strong objections and reservations because he is a recently retired Chief Justice of India, who has given many controversial judgments. He, I have no hesitation to say, was a controversial chief justice and his acceptance and the government’s appointment has raised bona fide questions about quid pro quo.”

The veteran community in Hyderabad have greatly welcomed and supported the efforts of the military authorities for putting in place all measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” according to an official release issued by the Defence (PRO) wing on Thursday.

As the virus affects the elderly more, it has been advised that all veterans stay at home for a temporary period. “Adequate measures have been instituted at the military hospital level for treatment of serving personnel. Initial assessment at the Military Hospital and treatment at empanelled hospitals of Telangana for veterans has also been put in place,” said the release.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai suburban collector has passed an executive order to take over hostels and guest houses across the city to convert them into quarantine centres. A request for more hotel rooms has also been sent to various hospitality groups for use as quarantine facilities. The takeover includes hostels in RCF, BARC, MSEB, Hindustan Petroleum in BKC, IIT-Bombay campus and the MTNL guest house in Hiranandani, Powai.

An executive order to the effect was passed and quarantine facilities will be available for all flyers coming into the city from various international destinations. It is believed these facilities will largely be used to accommodate C-category patients who do not show symptoms of Covid-19.

“We need to quarantine people for 14 days and for that we need a huge number of rooms. These patients are those under C-category with minimum chances of getting others infected. They have come from those countries and hence they need to be under quarantine,” said collector Milind Borikar. A letter to that effect was shared by IIT-Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri with the IIT family. The 15,000-plus residents currently on campus are a worried lot as students, faculty, staff and their families are objecting to the state government’s decision of putting so many other lives at risk.

The order was passed “despite our strong objections and efforts. The campus is still alive with many students, staff, faculty members, their families and casual workforce. The collector’s officer has verbally assured that the quarantine area will be properly secured through police,” read the director’s letter. Students who informed their parents about such a decision called the faculty and deans of the Powai institute and expressed their anxiety.

“The designated buildings are Vanvihar Guest House, H-18, well-maintained part of H-8 (B-wing), and the MTNL guest rooms (in Hiranandani). While we understand the difficulties that the state is facing, administrators of IIT-B were ordered under the provisions of the relevant Act. Kindly ensure maximum protection to your family and yourself,” read the director’s note. Some 180 rooms in Powai will be available for quarantine.

“In order to contain the spread of coronavirus, the railways has taken the initiative of ensuring that passengers having higher body temperatures are quickly directed towards hospitals for diagnosis of Covid-19 and if required further treatment as well,” divisional railway manager VK Gupta said.

The Bhusawal division has decided to raise health booths at all stations, including Nashik Road, Jalgaon, Manmad, Bhusawal, Shegaon and Khandwa, to identify passengers with respiratory problems and flu-like symptoms. A booth at Jalgaon junction has been made operative and others will also follow suit.

At the booths, a contact-less thermometer will be used to check the body temperature of the passengers and at the same time the travel history of the patient or passenger will be noted and the health authorities will be informed about the same.

“We have also raised a 32-bed hospital isolation ward at Bhusawal railway hospital at divisional headquarters,” the divisional railway manager said.

There is a separate 100-bed facility enacted which will be for the quarantine purpose strictly. “We are in touch with the district disaster management authority and we shall convey all information related to coronavirus to them and take their help in taking swab samples and sending it to the respective virology labs for diagnosis,” the official said.

“As per protocol only those found positive will be detained and admitted in isolation ward, those who test negative will be released from quarantine facilities at the earliest,” another senior official said.

The railways has also started sanitizing coaches. “The rigorous cleaning includes use of soap, cleansers and sanitizers as required across each and every coach that comes for inspection after it has completed a trip,” the official said.

“All measures are being taken to ensure cleanliness at the railway stations as well. We are cleaning the floors with mechanized cleaning facility. We are also cleaning the benches and window panes every hour with the help of sanitizers to ensure the virus, if any, is not transmitted,” he added.

While people in some countries are facing hefty fines for not complying with Covid-19 restrictions, medical experts say citizens are not following public health orders in Hyderabad.Speaking to TOI, Dr Altaf Naseem, senior consultant paediatrician of Neocandy Children’s Hospital, said, “Despite so many awareness programmes being conducted by medical professionals and the government, people are not understanding the severity of the situation. Even on enquiry, many are not revealing their travel history. Some patients that we have come across with visible symptoms are also reluctant to get themselves tested for the virus.”“We are also seeing how many are visiting hospitals in groups for a simple check-up. At least five or six people accompany a patient which should be avoided in the present circumstances. People should act responsibly and start taking this seriously before things go out of hand,” Dr Naseem added.Dr Ramana Prasad, consultant pulmonologist, KIMS Hospitals, agrees. “People not understanding the gravity of the situation is the biggest problem that we have to deal with. It is time everybody should be on their toes and act responsibly so that we do not become another Italy or Spain. People should practice social distancing if they are working and those who are symptomatic should self-quarantine themselves and so that the virus doesn’t spread,” he addedWith the number of cases steadily increasing, the Telangana government has put nearly 1,700 persons on home quarantine this week as a preventive measure against the possible spread of the disease.

At the same time, government doctors have urged health minister K K Shailaja to create a pool of reserve doctors instead of deploying everyone in hospitals.“We have developed an employee protection scheme and have decided to keep one-third of our employees out of the hospital till April 15 so that they will always be available if need arises. The rest will be working at the hospital,” said KIMS Healthcare Group CMD Dr MI Sahadulla. This arrangement started on Monday. Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences has made similar arrangements. “In departments like critical care, anaesthesia and emergency, one-third of the staff has been asked to go on paid leave for 10 days,” said AIMS deputy superintendent Rajesh Pai.They are not alone. There are several other hospitals across the state in the process of making similar arrangements to ensure that they have enough reserve pool of healthy staff, if a situation like the one at Sree Chitra Institute arises. This will ensure that there is no shutdown of hospital services due to staff falling sick. “We are advising the elderly consultants in our hospital to avoid the hospital for few days,” said chairman of Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode Dr KG Alexander.Meanwhile, government doctors have sought a two-week leave for a pool of doctors (at least one-third) so that they can be deployed if there is a community spread of Covid-19. They said healthcare professionals are under high-risk category now, with four doctors already kept under observation for treating suspect cases.“There is high risk for health professionals and it might end with doctors going on quarantine. This will lead to a medical crisis where health professionals will not be available to tackle the situation. We have asked the health minister to ensure that one-third of us professionals including doctors, nurses, and other paramedical staff be given paid leave for two weeks. They will serve as reserve pool,” said state president, academy of pulmonary and critical care medicine Dr T P Rajagopal.It might seem strange, but there is a need to create a team of second-line doctors. At least 30% of the doctors should be reserved to meet the emergency. If there is more spread, this will mean that more doctors will go under isolation, said IMA vice-president Dr N Sulphi. “More patients are coming to medical colleges and general hospitals and the doctors here are at risk. A reserve pool becomes necessary. We have apprised the health minister of this need,” said state secretary of Kerala Government Medical Officers Association Dr G S Vijayakrishnan.“We are analysing the situation and collecting the details of doctors from each medical college.

Expert View: Nilofar Parveen

History and political science are not as difficult subjects as they might seem, if students devote optimum time for their preparation.

Students are advised to prepare their own notes after reading the coursebook. They should understand the concepts and write the answers in their own words, instead of mugging up printed answers.

Smart notes can be prepared, if the students keep in mind all the illustrations in the textbook. While writing the exam, the sentences should be framed properly, based on passages. Underlining the keywords might prove helpful in gaining marks.

For question number 2A and 8B, prepare the concept maps, timelines and tables. It would help the students to draw them correctly and save time.

Write full statements while solving the objective questions. In question numbers 1A and 6, one needs to underline the correct option.

Proper presentation of the answers is important. If the answer sheet is neat, it creates a good impression and facilitates the teacher in reading and understanding the answers better.

Students should avoid solving extra questions, and focus on solving the main questions properly. Students are expected to start each answer from a fresh page.

Solving sample question papers and question papers from previous years’ papers is necessary to get much-needed practice and a feel of the exam.

Mindful of the threats posed to them, Ranjan directed the CISF personnel to maintain the recommended gap when frisking passengers without compromising security procedures and to regularly sanitise all equipment used in the process.CISF has been equipped with infrared thermometers to check passengers as well as its own staff. Full-body protective suits have also been provided, which the CISF personnel will mandatorily use if they have to manage infected people. An adequate number of officers and personnel have been posted in the arrival section and at the specially created “Triage Area”, where Airport Health Organisation (APHO) medical teams check passengers arriving from coronavirus-affected countries.This deployment is beyond the mandated duty of CISF to extend help to the arriving passengers and officials for the smooth implementation of compulsory medical tests. CISF personnel are also assisting in helping ease the tension of those flying in from Covid-19-affected countries.The CISF personnel deployed at 63 Indian airports have been sensitised to use minimum touch while wearing masks and surgical gloves during the pre-embarkation screening. They have also been advised to maintain minimum proximity to passenger while ensuring security procedures are not neglected.Personnel of the CISF Intelligence wing posted at the airports for behaviour detection have also been instructed to look out for potentially infected/sick passengers and alert the security personnel and health officials.Apart from this, the scheduled International arrival section at Terminal 3 also requires special handling for streamlined triage and quarantine determination. This is being handled from the isolation bay created in a makeshift, but operationally comprehensive, manner.The airport sector of CISF has procured infrared thermometers and they are being used at the airports for two purposes: to check CISF personnel for fever when they report for shift duty and to use at the security hold area for checking the body temperature of any departing passenger showing symptoms of fever, cough, etc, and directing him to the APHO authorities at the airport for further necessary action.These arrangements have been made not only in Delhi but also at the international airports in Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Lucknow and other places.

It will be applicable for all self-financed BE/B Tech, ME/M Tech, B Pharm, M Pharm, diploma engineering, MBA, MCA, B Arch, M Arch, courses and colleges among others.

In order to evaluate the fee proposals, the FRC has listed salary, rent, fixed assets and depreciation, interest and other finance cost and hostel and transportation expenses, among others under the SOP for determination of fee structure for FY 2020-21 for treatment of major expenses, said sources in FRC.

Since the major cost of imparting quality education is towards manpower, the FRC has decided to give weightage to salary costs. This means that if the employee cost is lower than other costs, FRC may discount other costs appropriately, sources said.

In the case of rent for a building, it will be considered only if it is paid to outsiders subject to approval of the rent order issued by the Charity Commissioner. Any rent paid or payable to the Trust/Society running the institution or any other institution run by the trust will be excluded from the cost being a notional cost.

Payments for purchase of fixed assets like land, building, furniture, etc are considered as capital expense and hence should not be included in recurring expenses.

211,['20/03/2020'],"Entrance tests may take a hit, PG med aspirants fear travel","Mumbai: With CBSE and CISCE postponing their Class X and XII board exams, several entrance tests at the state and national level in the country scheduled in April are likely to take a hit. While the ministry of human resource development has already announced postponement of JEE (Mains), it may have an impact on JEE (Advanced) for admission to IITs too. In the state, MHT-CET is one of the major entrance exams scheduled in April. Post-graduate medical aspirants in the state have sought postponement of admissions across the country in a letter to the state as well as the Centre.

While so far only one state-level entrance test (for MCA) has been postponed officially after the Covid-19 outbreak, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said they will reschedule MHT-CET, if needed, after taking stock of the situation by month-end.

MHT-CET is taken by over four lakh students for admissions to engineering, pharmacy and agriculture and allied courses in the state. Entrance test for the five-year LLB is scheduled in April too. The minister had a meeting with officials from the department and the state’s CET cell to take stock of the current situation. With CBSE and ICSE exams postponed, the new dates may clash with MHT-CET, said an official. It is scheduled from April 13-17 and April 20-23. MCA entrance test, scheduled on March 28, will now be held on April 30. Samant said students will not suffer for any delay in entrance schedule or admissions.

Meanwhile, PG medical aspirants, whose all-India admissions have commenced, have written to Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) Directorate General of Health Services, to postpone the process. In multiple appeal letters addressed to the MCC, the students have claimed they are finding it difficult to procure documents as many government offices are shut.

""It has also become very difficult to travel around cities and states after the disease outbreak. Many trains are cancelled, and students are afraid of boarding flights. With all the travelling there is a grave danger of contracting the infection,"" said parent representative Sudha Shenoy. Samant said the CET cell too will write to the centre.

While JEE (Advanced) is scheduled in May, only 2.2 lakh students who clear the first-level—JEE (Mains)— are qualified to take it. With JEE (Mains) postponed, the second level of exams could be affected too, said another parent.

DEHRADUN: A day after passing orders for ending promotion in reservation which had antagonised the SC/ST community , the Uttarakhand cabinet took a major step of going back to the previous roster for direct recruitment on government jobs.

As part of this, the first vacancy in a post will be for SC candidates and the sixth for general candidate.

On the recommendation of a committee headed by transport minister Yashpal Arya , the state in September 2019 had announced a new roster for direct recruitment according to which, the first position was given to general candidate, whereas sixth went to SC category. This led to a protest by the SC category, who termed it an attempt to sideline them in government jobs. After much hue and cry, the state government had formed a sub-committee headed by urban development minister Madan Kaushik . On the recommendation of the sub-committee, the state has reverted back to the previous order by overruling the change made last year.

“The cabinet has given its approval to the change made by the sub-committee, from now on SC will be the first vacancy and general goes to sixth slot,” urban development minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said on Thursday. He added that the authorities have been asked to fill the backlog in government jobs at the earliest.

Officials said once the team learns all the spots the tigress frequents within the factory, they will tranquilize it. The task will be undertaken in two days’ time.

Chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma, said, “We are tracking the movement of the tigress and when we will know about all the locations it prefers to stay in, we will tranquilize the big cat. We also found the pugmarks of the tigress at the spot where a sub-adult tiger was tranquilized nearly two years ago.”

Officials said RK Singh, a veterinarian from Kanpur zoo, will tranquilizing the tigress. Besides, the forest department has placed three cages with bait in the factory to lure the big cat.

Apart from images of the tigress, the camera trap installed in the factory has captured the photos of many species showing the rich wildlife in the factory premises. The photos of nilgai, porcupine, jungle cat, hare, peacock and monkeys have been caught in the camera traps.

The Synthetic and Chemical Limited Company, commonly known as rubber factory here, spanning nearly 1,200 acres, was closed in 1999. Over the years, it has turned into a mini-forest providing a perfect habitat for big cats due to easy availability of prey, plenty of water in big tanks, dense tree cover, soft grass and suitable places to hide.

Apart from a tiger and a tigress, a leopard too lived in the rubber factory for almost two years. Forest officials suspect that it was same that leopard which was run over by a heavy vehicle on February 24 on the road outside the factory.

The state-run university with students from across Marathwada saw cancellation of classes and postponement of exams after the state government’s directive to shut down all educational institutes till March 31.

In order to stop further spread of coronavirus, the Bamu administration asked the hostel inmates to go home for the next two weeks.

Subsequently, the students have started to vacate their rooms. Speaking during a press conference organised on Tuesday, Bamu vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole said that 90% of the hostels have been vacated.

“The remaining students are either awaiting reservations on trains or are not able to go home due to some or the other reasons. There are 12 hostels on Bamu premises of which 7 are for women and 5 for men,” he said.

Owing to the movement of students, heavy rush was witnessed at the state transport bus stands on Tuesday. In addition, the Bamu administration has also shut down its libraries and reading rooms until March 31.

The VC said the university has restricted entry of visitors to the administrative building and thermal screening will soon be initiated.

It seems that the city magistrate had some misunderstanding. I will approach the official and clear his misconception,” said Kohali.However, the city magistrate said the administration is probing the matter and a final action would be taken soon.Reacting to the raids, the association’s district president, Mishra said, “We could have announced a strike across the district in protest against the action of the city magistrate and his misconception about the overpricing. But we decided not to hit the streets in view of the public interest. However, we will be forced to take a harsh decision in case the two medical store owners are not given clean chit soon.”Notably, the Centre had on March 13 declared face masks and hand sanitizers as essential commodities for the next 100 days to boost supply and prevent hoarding of these items.The Centre also invoked the Disaster Management Act to ensure the price regulation and availability of surgical and protective masks, hand sanitizer and gloves.",bareilly,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/will-sell-masks-hand-sanitisers-at-lower-prices-say-pilibhit-chemist-association/articleshow/74718887.cms

The action was taken by divisional offices of the NMC on the very first day after civic chief Radhakrishna Game issued a circular for slapping fines on erring citizens found spitting in public places in view of the outbreak of Covid-19.

The municipal commissioner has given powers to divisional officers (Dos), divisional sanitation inspectors (DSIs) and sanitation inspectors (SIs) to impose fine on those who are found spitting at public places.

Accordingly, an NMC squad caught two people in Nashik Road area and one person in Nashik East division for spitting in public places. “We recovered a fine of Rs 3,000 from them,” a civic official said.

“We have decided to intensify the drive against spitting. We have made a team of our officials and employees who will be deployed in civil clothes at crowded places like bus stands, markets etc. They will impose fine of Rs 1,000 on those found spitting in public places,” he added.

227,['20/03/2020'],Overflowing sewage in Kanak Chowk poses threat to two-wheelers,"Representative image

DEHRADUN: The rains have gone but overflowing sewage at Kanak Chowk, near Parade Ground, continues to pose a deadly threat to motor vehicles, especially two-wheelers. The sewage has given rise to craters not only on main roads but also in the interior ones, which witness a heavy traffic flow throughout the day.

Speaking to TOI, Sunil Verma , a commuter , said, “The water overflowing from the sewerage is dangerous for car owners and pedestrians but especially lethal for two-wheelers. Moreover, the overflowing sewage is forcing people to drive on the wrong side in one-way roads, which may lead to accidents . I hope authorities get it fixed soon.”

KL Dhyani, another commuter who owns a shop on EC road, said, “The roads are in extremely poor condition and show utter lack of maintenance. It will possibly remain like this for years unless a serious accident takes place.”

As a temporary fix, the civic body has filled the craters with bricks and cement tiles. According to sources, this has only made the situation worse as the tiles and bricks make the vehicles more prone to accidents.

Darshanlal Chowk has a similar situation, where water becomes stagnant after rains. Local residents say that standing water in the place is an indictment of the civic body’s preparedness for the rainy season.

Keval Mandhani, a commuter, said “The corners of the road are no different from mini pools. Though the rains had lashed the city four days ago, the water is still here. The stagnant rain water is not only a source of infections, but can also result in road accidents.”

A PWD official meanwhile told TOI, “The maintenance of the road will be carried out soon. As of now, development works under the smart city project are underway. As soon as the area is cleared, the roads will be in good condition.”

229,['20/03/2020'],Civic body betters last year’s property tax collection by 32%,"Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) property tax collection figure till March 19 has reached Rs 140 crore, 32% more than the collection figure during the same period last year.

In the last fiscal, the civic body had collected Rs 106 crore till March 19. An NMC official said the civic body had planned to touch the Rs 150 crore-mark by this time, but collection was affected owing to the Yes Bank crisis and the Covid-19 outbreak.

“The NMC had tied up with Yes Bank for online collection of property and water taxes. Taxes were also being collected at 22 civic facilitations centres across six divisions of municipal corporation by the private bank,” the official said.

“Owing to the coronavirus spread, the number of people coming to pay their taxes in the NMC’s divisional offices has also dropped,” he added.

In the last financial year (2018-19), the NMC had collected property tax amounting to Rs 113 crore. That was the first time the NMC’s property tax collection target had breached the Rs 100 crore-mark.

The current property tax collection figure of Rs 140 crore is the highest ever.

Initially, the NMC had set a property tax collection target of Rs 218 crore for the current financial year (2019-20), but later revised it to Rs 150 crore.

The NMC had also launched amnesty schemes on two occasions during the current financial year for property tax defaulters. As per the scheme, the penalty and other charges were waived up to 75% for defaulters who cleared their total tax dues.

Through these amnesty schemes the civic body managed to collect over Rs 50 crore. Moreover, it had also issued warrants to major tax defaulters and had also the properties of some defaulters for auction. This overall led to rise in property tax collection for the NMC.

The civic body has also decided to give a 5% rebate to prompt tax payers if they pay their annual property tax during the first quarter of the new financial year.

Accordingly, 5% rebate is to be given to tax payers who pay their bills in April, 3% if they make the payment in May and 2% if payment is cleared in June.

The AMC has roped in private agency, which collects waste generated at households and commercial establishments and transports it to the waste sites at Padegaon and Chikalthana. The agency has vehicles which go from lane to lane.

In addition, the AMC has engaged another private agency, which carries out processing of waste at Chikalthana and Padegaon sites through its ground staff. These workers are also in direct contact with waste.

According to zone 2 sanitation inspector Sachin Misal, the household waste includes dry waste, wet waste and medical waste which comes in the category of hazardous waste. “In order to ensure that sanitation workers do not contract any infection from hazardous waste, it is important that they are equipped with safety gear,” he said.

According to head of solid waste management cell of AMC Nandkishore Bhombe, it is to use safety gear for sanitation workers. “We had found that sanitation staff working for doorstep waste collection, transportation and processing were working without safety gear. Subsequently, last week we issued directives to the two agencies to see to it that the sanitation staff who come in direct contact of hazardous waste are providing masks, gloves, gumboots, safety cap and other safety equipment,” Bhombe said. He added that if the directive is violated the agencies will be penalised Rs 100 for each worker working without safety gear.

In addition, the AMC has allowed ward offices of all nine zones in the city to use Rs 1 lakh each for making purchase of personal protective equipment for sanitation workers under AMC with the approval of zone’s guardian officer.

Bhombe said that in wake of government guidelines against large assembly of people, the civic body has asked sanitation inspectors to hold trainings at their level in each zone to advice workers to take necessary precautions while handling waste.

On Wednesday night, the NH-9 was blocked at Delhi Band due to landslide, cutting off Pithoragarh from Tanakpur and Haldwani.

Supply of essential commodities like fruits and vegetables to Pithorgarh was also affected. The officials had taken 19 hours to remove the boulders.

“Incessant rainfall may have led to the massive landslide. Large chunks of boulders have blocked the road again. We will try to open the stretch by Friday evening,” Vijay Kumar Jogdande , district magistrate (DM), Pithoragarh, said.

“We have informed the district administrations of Champawat and Nainital. The vehicle movement towards Pithoragarh will be stopped. We request the commuters to take an alternative route, i.e. theHaldwani-Seraghat route to reach Pithorgarh,” the DM added.

The road cutting work is being undertaken on the Pithoragarh-Tanakpur road, under the All-Weather Char Dham project. Officials say the road cutting work may have been causing frequent landslides at the Delhi Band route. “The rocks at Delhi Band are loose. Hence due to rock cutting, landslides have been occurring. JCB machines have been deployed, hope the boulder gets cleared by Friday evening,” said PL Chaudhari, assistant engineer, National Highway-9.

Since Saturday morning, a number of trucks were seen transporting residual matter from the decades-old legacy garbage dump at Sonsoddo and is being dumped in an area behind the indoor badminton auditorium at Fatorda, while an excavator was deployed to level the ground.

A newly-printed flex board was also displayed at the location, identifying it as the ‘proposed site for hockey ground on land allotted to Goans Hockey - By directorate of sports and youth affairs.’

Former Margao municipality chairperson and member of Shadow Council, Savio Coutinho said the contractor undertaking the work is not following proper methods for land filling, and expressed concern that this could lead to pollution of groundwater resources.

When contacted, Margao Muncipal Council (MMC) chief officer Ajit Panchwadkar said the municipality had received a proposal and had written to Goa Pollution Control Board in this regard. However, they were yet to receive authorisation to carry out the work, and added that he was unaware when the land-filling activity had started.

However, sources in the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) said that permission has been granted to MMC. On whether the disposal of waste residue is being undertaken in a scientific manner at the location, the official said tests were conducted and reports have been presented to the HC.

Such white wristbands or bracelets were used in Hong Kong to track international passengers who entered the city and were advised to be in quarantine. These bracelets are linked to a mobile application on the quarantined person’s phone and not a GPS and will alert authorities if the person moves 65 or 100 metres beyond the phone device. “There are issues of privacy with the trackable bracelets, but on the other hand the bracelet can be pulled and removed. The trackable bracelet option is being examined right now,” said a senior health official under conditions of anonymity. Also another effective method is mobile phone number location tracking of those quarantined.

Sources in the police said that the incident was captured on a CCTV camera installed in a nearby locality.

Taking help of the CCTV footage, teams from the crime branch launched a manhunt for the suspects and arrested one of them from his residence within eight hours of the alleged crime around 4am on Tuesday. .

The arrested suspect has been identified as Imran Amir Baig (25), a resident of Kabranagar. He is a scrap trader by profession. Police is still looking for the second suspect.

The deceased has been identified as Akshay Pradhan, a junior college student who was pursuing his studies in Aurangabad.

Police said that Akshay, along with his friend Amey Bhosle, also a 17-year-old student, was sitting at a ground in the Mhada colony around 8.30pm on Monday. The suspects, who were on a motorcycle, approached them. They tried to rob the teenagers by threatening them.

While Amey readily gave his wallet, which contained Rs 400 in cash to the suspects, Akshay resisted them. A scuffle broke out between them and the suspects stabbed Akshay with a sharp-edged weapon before fleeing.

Akshay was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Amey lodged a complaint at the Jawaharnagar police station. An offence has been registered against the suspects on the charges of murder, armed robbery and voluntarily causing hurt.

PANAJI: December last year and January 2020 saw over 50 more road accidents than November 2019. Statistics shared by the directorate of transport revealed that a total of 351 road accidents were reported in the peak tourist month of December 2019, and 342 in January 2020. November saw 285 road accidents.

“There is an increasing number of vehicles in the state,” said head of the Goa road safety forum, Dilip Naik . “This, coupled with the lack of stringent checks by traffic police and untrained young drivers that are liberally given licenses after a basic driving test, makes road safety a serious concern.”

Figures revealed that most deaths, yet again, were those of two-wheeler riders. A total of 20 riders each lost their lives in road fatalities in December and January. Pedestrians and pillion riders also came in the line of fire with an average of six people from this category losing their lives in these months.

However, slightly fewer people lost their lives due to road accidents in the two months. Compared to November, which witnessed 29 deaths, there were 26 deaths in December and 27 deaths in January.

VIJAYAWADA: After a ‘fake’ letter addressed to the Union home ministry, allegedly written by Andhra Pradesh election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar surfaced online, the state government is preparing to find out the source responsible for it.

The letter, which carries the official letterhead of the SEC , makes allegations against the YSRC governement. Although Kumar has denied having written the letter, it has created ripples across the state with the social media being quick to circulate its contents.

The letter criticises the government, chief minister, other ministers and ruling party leaders. It condemns state police for failing to maintain law and order in first phase of the local body elections, leading to violence.

The letter also seeks central forces to conduct remaining phases of the local body elections, which were suspended due to coronavirus scare. The letter states that SEC has no faith in the state police and administration to ensure peaceful elections. It also refers to the comments of the chief minister against Kumar and his alleged loyalties to Opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu .

In also requests home ministry to deploy central security forces for Kumar and his family’s protection.

Although the commissioner has denied having written the letter, leaders of the Opposition parties, including TDP state chief K Kalavenkata Rao and CPI secretary K Ramakrishna, met governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and sought central protection for the commissioner and Raj Bhavan’s intervention in the elections. The SEC was provided with 10 CRPF personnel on Thursday.

Meanwhile, chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy held a meeting with DGP Gautam Sawang and intelligence chief Manish Kumar Sinha and reviewed the issue. The CM has expressed displeasure over the language used in the letter which, he said, lowered the image of the government.

Of these, five were asked to stay back at the isolation wards as their sample reports are awaited.

However, the district administration has taken additional precautionary measures to prevent the community outbreak.The first patient, a 43-year-old IT professional, had tested positive on March 11 after he returned from the US. That time, he was suffering from throat infection and fever. The second test was performed on him after he came out of his fever on Tuesday, while third one was performed on Wednesday.“The reports of both second and third tests of his swab samples are found to be negative with no presence of virus.

Vadodara: In big fat Indian weddings, guests shower bride and groom with flowers when they take the seven sacred ‘pheras’. But on Thursday at a wedding in Vadodara, guests were not given flowers. Instead, they and family members of the bride and groom were given face masks.

Nidhi Sonune and Shashank Jadhav took their wedding vows outside the former’s house on Waghodiya Road. As guests started pouring in, wedding organizers asked everyone to clean their hands with sanitizers and wear face mask to protect themselves in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.

“There were about 300 guests who had come to attend the wedding from Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and our native place. So, we had decided to give face mask to everyone for protection,” said Nidhi’s uncle Shyam Sonune. He added that the family did not want to change the wedding date as they had already postponed the wedding once in the past. Earlier Nidhi’s sister, who lives in the USA, had some visa issues so the wedding date was changed to March 19.

“It is true that the government has closed down multiplexes and other places where gathering of people takes place in large numbers. But the wedding was organized right outside our house and we had taken all the preventive measures,” Shyam added.

During the wedding ceremonies, all guests, including children and the priest who chanted the mantras, obediently wore the masks. Nidhi and Shashank too, without worrying how their wedding photographs will turn out to be, did not remove the masks till the end.

The NMC has clamped down on all shops and establishments except those vending essential commodities like groceries, vegetables, medicines and petrol pumps.As TOI went around the city, barring small outlets like tea stalls or pan kiosks all others continued to run their businesses. Officials accepted that this was also due to confusion on account of two different orders issued by different agencies.On Wednesday, cops were seen asking street vendors and eateries, and wine shops to shut down till March 31. Some retailers said even other shops were asked to shut down. As retailers remained open, a small number street vendors also ventured out.District collector Ravindra Thakare told TOI that his orders specifically covered bars, wine shops, restaurants, malls theatres and was not for all commercial establishments. “Other outlets do not come under the definition of crowded areas and need not be closed,” he said.State home minister Anil Deshmukh, who personally carried out raids on eateries including one belonging to food giant Haldirams, also confirmed the collector’s stance. Deshmukh further said the private establishments have been ordered to work with half manpower.On the other hand, NMC additional commissioner Ram Joshi said that while the collector’s order covers the entire district, the civic body’s decisions are applicable in city limits.Joshi said the NMC began with issuing orders to shut down educational institutions from March 14. This was followed by an appeal to banquets and wedding halls to avoid holding functions or at least limit the number of persons to 50. On Thursday, orders were issued for a lock down to all shops and establishment except those vending essential goods like grocery medicines vegetables or petrol pumps.Joshi said the collector’s orders were issued under the disaster relief laws and that by the NMC under the British-era Epidemic Act of 1897 and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “It must also be known that apart from other orders even the Section 144 of IPC is under force which bars assembly of more than four persons,” he said.The additional commissioner said all the orders are simultaneously in force and the civic body is also going to take a call on making lock down mandatory to banquets and halls “for which an appeal has been issued now”. “The NMC will also begin ensuring compliance of the order,” said Joshi.City police commissioner BK Upadhyay said, “We’re only asking street vendors, wine shop and bar owners to shut. We’re not asking all the commercial establishments to shut. If they are being forced shut, I will look into it.”Deshmukh, who was accompanied by Thakre, also conducted a raid on an eatery at Bajaj Nagar and stopped at a medical shop to inquire about availability of sanitisers and masks. The minister also checked if other eateries were open.TOI saw that the highest compliance was from street vendors who were intimated a day before. However, inside market areas like Jaripatka, Mominpura and Central Avenue some of the eateries had opened shutters.Even as the NMC had issued an order to close down non-essential commodity vending shops, all such outlets were seen open throughout the city.

Till now, four parents have agreed to pay the full amount for the month and I hope others will also consider similarly,” said Ambulkar.Another enterprising driver Shyam Sontakke purchased two extra vans, to take his fleet to three, but is now worried about the fixed expenses. “I drive one vehicle myself and pay around Rs15,000 each to drivers of the other vehicles. Now, there is no way I can pay them that amount if income stops. Apart from this, banks won’t be lenient with me regarding EMIs,” said Sontakke.Driver Prakash Deotale said a negligible number of parents would understand their situation. “There are parents who don’t pay if their child is sick and does not go to school, so why will they pay when school itself is shut down. I am wondering how we will cope with this because this is the only source of income for all of us,” said Deotale.Even for big players, the going is tough. Samar Jog, owner of a large school bus fleet, said, “Though schools have shut down, our fixed expenses like salaries of drivers, cleaners and back office staff continue. Many of us have spent heavily, and rightfully so, on deep sanitization of buses to ensure safety of students. We have not discussed this issue with parents, but I feel that they must consider this special situation and not think of deducting transport charges.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74729243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-589234,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-school-shutdown-to-hit-drivers-ferrying-kids-hard/articleshow/74718938.cms
253,['20/03/2020'],HC quashes order condoning delay in prosecuting 4 booked for harassment,"Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has quashed and set aside a Beed sessions court order condoning the delay of over 15 months and eight days to prosecute and to file an appeal against a lower court judgment acquitting four people.

The petitioners — Sayyad Azim, his father Sayyad Manzur, his mother and sister — were booked in 2014 after his wife filed a complaint of dowry harassment, causing hurt, criminal intimidation and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. On July 3, 2017, Azim and his relatives were acquitted by the Judicial Magistrate First Class.

However, the prosecution approached the Beed sessions court by filing a miscellaneous criminal application in 2019. The sessions judge, Beed condoned the delay in March 2019.

The four then approached the high court through lawyer P D Suryavanshi challenging the sessions court decision stating that the date of pronouncement of the judgment has not been mentioned in the application (for condonation) intentionally.

“No reasonable ground has been shown for condoning the delay,” they claimed. The government told the HC that the police prosecutor, Beed filed appeal proposal to the district magistrate, Beed in August 2017. However, the letter informing about the sanction came only in October 2017.

While allowing the criminal writ petition, justice Vibha Kankanwadi observed “the delay appears to have been mechanically condoned by the learned sessions judge.”

The judge also observed that the “the remedy open, to the prosecution had become time barred, and no proper explanation was given by the prosecution to file an appeal even after the appeal period was over.”

BICHOLIM: Around 1,700 villagers from Maulinguem in Bicholim taluka have decided to boycott the zilla panchayat elections to protest against the government’s apathy in resolving their problems.

The residents said that neither the local MLA nor the chief minister has paid heed to their grievances.

The village falls under the jurisdiction of the Karapur-Sarvan zilla panchayat. Four candidates are in the fray for the polls.

“No development work has been undertaken in the village during the past few years. There are no roads, no panchayat building and no jobs. We have forwarded all the files, but no work is being sanctioned,” local panch Jyoti Maulingkar said. “We want to know why our village is being ignored. The CM should answer our questions.” Maulingkar said.

Another panch member Shiva Gaonkar said, “There are problems viz power cuts, irregular water supply, land disputes, approvals for repairs and construction of houses, etc. However, getting official approval is an impossible task. ”

A resident Saju Mayekar said that local MLA Pravin Zantye has never visited the village and gives false assurances.

“We are living like tribals in this village. No one is bothered about us, or listens to the panchas,” a villager Deepak Sarnaik said.

258,['20/03/2020'],"Goa ZP polls: BJP’s former MLAs prop up kin in Mayem, Colvale","Image used for representational purpose only

PANAJI: BJP will face a tough battle in Mayem and Colvale after two of its former MLAs have gone against the party and fielded their kin as independent candidates for the zilla panchayat elections.

Even though the zilla elections could be perceived as ‘inconsequential’, it has become a matter of prestige for both the ex-legislators in their bid to enter the portals of the legislative assembly once again.

Former BJP Tivim MLA Kiran Kandolkar has fielded his wife Kavita against BJP candidate Govind Kubal who is the sitting Colvale ZP member, whereas in Mayem, ex-BJP legislator Anant Shet has pitted his brother Premendra against the party’s incumbent ZP member Shankar Chodankar .

Other candidates who are contesting in Colvale are Satish Chodankar of Congress and Umesh Kauthankar as an independent.

Mayem will witness a five-cornered battle, with Narayan Tari contesting on the MGP ticket, Prasad Chodankar as the Congress candidate, Deepkumar Mapari of the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, and independents Krishna Volvoikar and Rajesh Kalangutkar.

Despite several attempts, BJP senior leaders have unsuccessfully tried to convince Kandolkar and Shet against fielding their family members.

“If are they able to win the zilla polls, they will be in the reckoning to contest the assembly elections on the BJP ticket,” a political observer said. Both Kandolkar and Shet are leaving no stone unturned to win the seats. Mayem is a BJP stronghold, while in Colvale, the party has been bolstered after former Congress MLA Nilkant Halarnkar switched over last year.

In the 2017 assembly polls, BJP denied Shet a ticket and fielded Pravin Zantye who won the seat. However, BJP had retained Kandolkar as their candidate for Colvale.

While BJP is confident of bagging both the ZP seats, BJP karyakartas appear to be divided, with loyalists siding with the party and some shifting their allegiance altogether. Another political analyst said that with Halarnkar in the party fold, it would be difficult for BJP to replace him as the candidate for the assembly polls unless Kandolkar proves his might in Sunday’s elections. Similarly in Mayem, Shet has to win the seat to be a claimant for the party ticket.

In case the number of cases increases exponentially, the administration is ready to increase capacity to over 10,000 beds in the city, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI. “Apart from government hospitals and temporary facility at MLA Hostel, we have identified places like hostels of government-run institutions for setting up such temporary facilities, including the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) and Vanamati,” he said.

According to Kumar, the condition is not that critical currently, and is under control, but nothing can be said till March 31. “Next few weeks are critical. In case of emergency, we have decided that all routine OPD and other surgeries would be postponed and only Covid-19 patients would be treated across all government and private hospitals. Of course, the critical cases like accidents and delivery would be allowed during this time,” he clarified.

On the number of ventilators, which is most critical component in treating the coronavirus patients in case they develop complications, the divisional commissioner said that the city is having 1,450 of those machines if private hospitals were included. “Of them, the government hospitals have about 100,” he said.

Across the state, 700 ventilators are available at government hospitals. Of these, 450 are under Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation while 250 in rest of Maharashtra.

Stressing that those coming from abroad should strictly follow self-quarantine, the commissioner warned them of police action if they move out. “People who have opted for self-quarantine should behave very responsibly and follow the protocol. We have monitoring systems to keep a close tab on such flyers. We are also providing our own vehicles to drop the suspects to their respective homes for self-quarantine so that they don’t use public transport,” he said.

On Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court asking authorities from his office and other ones like PWD to resolve differences between them, Kumar said there were no clashes and he had only directed the officials concerned to provide the best possible facilities to the visitors, who will be quarantined. “As per the HC directives, we have provided Wi-Fi kits to all those housed in the MLA Hostel. They have also been provided with best food. Their feedback is positive.”

On HC’s directives of setting up more Viral Research Diagnostics Laboratory (VRDL) facilities in Vidarbha, the commissioner said there were no directives from the government as of now in this regard. “It’s a complex procedure as the laboratory needs to be established as per the protocol. It takes time,” he said.

AHMEDABAD: Jagruti Choudhari, 30, can’t see but her hands deftly move on the cloth in front of her as she sews an elastic band on both sides of the rectangle.

She’s one of the 40-odd volunteers at work on 12 sewing machines on Thursday at the premises of the Blind People’s Association (BPA). The organization has a target target of producing 5 lakh protective masks. The masks are made entirely of fine cotton cloth, sanitized, which can be distributed for free among citizens.

Bhushan Punani, executive secretary, BPA, said community members had come up with the idea to do their part to battle the Covid-19 pandemic. “While awareness campaign on health and hand sanitization has already been conducted, we decided to make the protective masks. While it’s not medical grade or can’t be compared with N95 masks, we are hopeful that this gesture will make the citizens more aware about precautions to be taken,” he said.

Makers of the masks include persons with blindness, movement disabilities, multiple disabilities and volunteers from the staff. BPA officials said that making masks is not very complicated and if citizens volunteer, they can teach those interested. Officials added that they have already received cloth in donations and will send the masks to far-flung places in Gujarat.

“Covid-19 is the top worry for citizens. As there is no cure available, prevention is the only way we can ensure it doesn’t come to our door. We are doing our bit and also appeal to the society at large to create awareness about the viral infection and on ways to prevent it,” said Meghna Patel, a volunteer at BPA who was making masks on Thursday.

“The letter on the forged letterhead had been circulated widely. I received several calls regarding it. However, I would like to assure that the letter is fake and all students of the university are safe,” said president of the university, Dr Devanshu Patel. “We have given an application to Waghodia police station to register a complaint because this is a serious issue,” Patel added.

269,['20/03/2020'],"Automatic mutation of flats, plots in city survey stopped","Nagpur: Citizens are being forced to run pillar to post and face red-tapism to get mutations done of their flats and plots in the records of city survey department. Despite being a great success for 31 months, the system of automatic mutations in city survey records has been stopped about six months ago.

Now, to get mutation done for flats or plots, one has to submit an application with a long list of documents and charges with the city survey. The applicants are also forced to fall in the trap of touts or face red-tapism and run pillar to post.

On January 16, 2017, the then collector Sachin Kurwe had launched a new system. Citing section 154 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Act 1966, Kurwe had directed the stamps and registration department to send a copy of the sale deeds once in three days to the city survey department. He had directed the city survey to issue notice, complete necessary formalities, complete mutation and send ‘akhiv partrika’ to the concerned party by post, and also given an alert on the respective party’s mobile.

Kurwe used to follow up on the system once a fortnight, and resolved any issues. He was transferred in April 2018 and replaced with Ashwin Mudgal, who continued the system but failed to keep it going since pre-assembly election period.

Sources from stamps and registration department and city survey told TOI the system stopped from August 2019. “Again, people are forced to submit application and follow the entire process.”

Mudgal had been replaced with Ravindra Thakre in September 2019. Thakre has not even held any meeting about the system in last five months.

The officials of stamps and registration department and city survey are passing the buck on each other for abandoning the system. The city records around 52,000 sale deeds every year. The system was followed for other transactions too at registry office.

Superintendent of land records GB Daberao, who heads three city survey offices, said, “Nine offices of stamps and registration department stopped sending copies of sale deeds to the city survey offices, so the system came to a halt. There are no problems from our side.”

An official from stamps and registration department said, “City survey department stopped taking copies citing update of their system, which is not updated till date.”

Daberao denied the claim. “Registry offices used to send copies via posts, and even paid postage for this,” he said.

Thakre did not respond to TOI’s call and message.

Activist Suraj Lolage alleged city survey offices are again giving all types of problems to people. “Kurwe’s system was a big relief for all. Now, nothing happens on time or without touts. If Kurwe could get it done, it means all these departments are now violating norms and cheating people. State government should take action against all officials,” he said.

272,['20/03/2020'],Learning apps help beat school lockdown amid Covid-19 fears in Nagpur,"NAGPUR: As schools shut down till March 31 as a preventive measure for coronavirus learning apps seem to be getting a shot in the arm with some claiming spike in usage as they offer free sneak-peak offers.Akhand Swaroop Pandit, CEO and founder of online learning platform Catalyst Group, said, “Overall we have witnessed 30-40% in admissions in the last two to three days and also the number of students regularly attending the online classes has increased due to college and school shutdown.” He added that screentime too is increasing. “Daily screentime has almost doubled in the past two to three days as students are at home,” said Pandit.Vamsi Krishna, CEO and co-founder of Vedantu, said, shift towards learning apps during the current situation seems only natural. “We believe, online learning is a safe option in these risky and uncertain times. Students can study from the safety of their home and avoid travel and public places,” said Krishna.According to Shobhit Bhatnagar, CEO and co-founder of Gradeup, this could be a turning point for online education. “As schools and universities continue to go into lockdown mode around the world, the EdTech industry is gearing up for its biggest test — and an opportunity. The likes of Harvard have already begun the transition from offline to online, and I can see Indian universities and schools following suit. The biggest benefit that the EdTech industry can offer, especially in times like these, is live online classes, which provide a safe, convenient study-from-home option,” said Bhatnagar.For parents , online learning apps help keep kids engaged in a manner that provides productive screentime.Parent Komal Domkundwar said the learning apps have an advantage as they help parents track the child’s progress. “These apps help me a lot in keeping track of my kid’s past and present knowledge and I can see the score graph rising high through online studies,” she said.Another parent Ragini Sharma feels the way online learning resources are presented is very student-friendly. “I believe they enjoy it more because of the pictorial information that gets stored directly into their minds,” said Sharma.All parents agreed that a balance needs to be maintained between online and offline learning resources. Maria Rangoonwala, a parent, said, “These apps are definitely a good way to keep them occupied for a certain duration, but I would not want to depend on them too much. These apps and videos also increase the screentime for my child, which can be much longer than the desired limit.”Parent Suvarna Ghosh says a balance of both online and offline study will lead to best results. “Of course, the apps are fun and innovative. When traditional studying becomes mundane, the online resources come to the rescue. But, as parents, we know that relying on learning apps completely is not a good idea. And most important, reducing screentime has to be a priority as well,” said Ghosh.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74729554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185229,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/learning-apps-help-beat-school-lockdown-amid-covid-19-fears/articleshow/74718980.cms
273,['20/03/2020'],Early start at New Town quarantine centre as flyers from Gulf check in,"KOLKATA: There was a flurry of activities at the quarantine centre in New Town on Thursday morning as the first lot of flyers from Gulf countries checked into the facility. Passengers on buses from Kolkata airport started arriving at the centre a little after 3am. A source said 345 passengers of four aircraft were taken inside the centre during the day.Hours before their arrival, healthcare workers had stayed put at the gate in protective gear. After offloading their luggage from bus, the flyers were first made to queue up in two lines. Those who would take a connecting flight, were assessed first on their health condition and travel history. After analysing the threat perception, passengers found with no symptom were sent back to airport.Flyers, whose destination was Kolkata, were then examined. Those found even with the slightest of symptoms like normal cold were marked to be kept under observation before sending all of them inside the building. Sources said those with the slightest of symptom will be under intense monitoring and if required, there swab samples will be tested.The brand new building of the second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in New Town came as a blessing for the state that requisitioned the eight-storey structure as its quarantine centre for flyers coming from abroad.The hospital with a capacity of 450 beds was supposed to start operations in April with OPD services and then admit patients from July. Accordingly, 250 beds were made ready for the first phase, now the government has added more beds so that 500 passengers can be quarantined.“So far, the facility is spick and span and the entire building is being cleaned thoroughly — four times a day. I hope they continue this kind of maintenance,” said a passenger quarantined at the facility.Visitors are barred from entering the building. While all health workers posted at the facility are wearing personal protective equipment, rest of the staff are wearing masks and gloves. The centre is also guarded by security personnel. “Since the hospital is yet to become functional it does not have much facility of treatment and medical equipment. But these are not required for quarantined flyers. The idea is to keep them away from moving into a crowd, observe them for symptoms and send them to a hospital with isolation facility in case they develop symptoms,” said a health department official.All those quarantined have been given masks and told to maintain distance from each other. Health department officials said apart from essentials like food, drinking water, soap, the centre does not have any mode of entertainment. “Since they have to stay for 14 days, we are planning to install television sets,” said a source.Situated just about 13 kilometres from the airport, the state had earmarked this hospital building last week as the first quarantine centre. The health department has also requisitioned another property in New Town as its second quarantine facility.

RAJKOT: A father-son duo was robbed of Rs 13.60 lakh by eight fraudsters who promised the victims of getting them gold at cheaper rate in Limbdi of Surendranagar district on Wednesday.

Police said the accused, identified as Kuldeep Gadhvi, Sohilkhan Naseemkhan, Naseemkhan Hajikhan, Abbas Ayub, Qarim Bhatti, Babu and their two unidentified aides, had allegedly looted Vasant Limbani (52) and his son Mitul Limbani (28), both residents of Gokul Palace at Guru Prasad Chowk on Gondal Road in Rajkot.

According to the police, Gadhvi, who was a friend of Vasant, told latter that he had contacts who wished to sell gold at 30 percent cheaper rate from the prevailing market rates. When Vasant expressed his desire to purchase the gold, he along with Mitul and Gadhvi went to Surendranagar and met the accused.

The accused showed the gold samples to the victims and told them that if they wanted to buy the gold, they would have to buy one kg and for that they would have to travel to Surendranagar to take the delivery.

On their return to Rajkot, the victims found that they were able to mobilize only Rs 13.60 lakh. When they told the accused about the amount, the accused informed they would be able to buy only 500 gram of gold with that amount. The accused asked the victims to come to Limbdi to take the delivery.

“At a hotel in Limbdi, the accused asked Mitul to go to a temple to take the delivery from their associate. When Mitul along with his two friends — Nitin Rabari and Nikunj Satani — left the spot, the accused asked Vasant to sit in their car and drove him to an interior road leading to Lakhtar. The accused then showed Vasant a knife and robbed him of the cash before dropping him on the road,” said S S Varu, sub-inspector with Limbdi police station.

286,['20/03/2020'],"Nagpur: Rahate Colony, Bansi Nagar Metro stations ready","NAGPUR: MahaMetro will open two more Metro stations by the end of this month. The Rahate Colony and Bansi Nagar stations are ready and Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety ( CMRS ) has been invited to inspect them. The inspection is likely to take place between March 27 and 29.

A Metro spokesperson said that the stations would be immediately opened after CMRS gave the green signal. “Rahate Colony is on the Sitabuldi to Khapri stretch (Reach I) while Bansi Nagar is on Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch (Reach III). We expect our ridership to increase on both reaches after these stations open. This had happened after we opened the Jaiprakash Nagar station on Reach I,” he added.

Rahate Colony station should have started functioning in October of November 2019. It is four to five months behind schedule. When Reach I had become operational in March 2019, MahaMetro had promised to open the remaining stations of the stretch — Jaiprakash Nagar, Rahate Colony, Ajni Square, Ujjwal Nagar, Congress Nagar and Chhatrapati Nagar — by December 2019. Now, Metro is unable to say when all these stations will open.

According to the spokesperson, Ajni Square station was almost ready and was likely to open in April subject to CMRS inspection.

Commenting on the delay in opening stations, the spokesperson said that the contractor ILFS had gone bankrupt and left the work halfway. “We had to retender the work and award it to other companies. Two to three months were wasted in the process,” he added.

He further said that Ujjwal Nagar station was facing land acquisition problems as the land owner had moved the court. “It will be the last to open,” he said.

On completion of entire Nagpur Metro project, he said that the deadline was March 2021. “We will complete Sitabuldi to Prajapati Nagar (Reach IV) and Sitabuldi to Automotive Square (Reach II) by then,” he further said.

287,['20/03/2020'],"Alleging Rs 145cr misappropriation, oppn seeks probe into laptop scheme","Bengaluru: Opposition parties on Thursday took the government to task over alleged misappropriation of Rs 145 crore in the procurement of laptops for 2019-20 as part of the Laptop Bhagya scheme, demanding an investigation into the issue. Meanwhile, the government said it will discontinue the programme from the upcoming academic year.

Opposition leader Siddaramaiah, while speaking on the budget, claimed that a Right to Information (RTI) query filed by former Congress higher education minister Basavaraj Rayareddi said the government has procured over 1 lakh laptops at a cost of Rs 28,320 per gadget.

“However, the same laptops were procured at a cost of Rs 14,920 per piece when my government launched the scheme. Notwithstanding inflation, no laptop can cost Rs 13,380 extra within three to four years,” claimed Siddaramaiah.

While BJP legislators claimed the laptops offered were of high quality, Congress alleged there’s not much difference in the configuration.

Intervening in the matter, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the decision to procure the laptops at a higher price was, in fact, approved by the previous coalition government. “The decision was taken on June 14, 2019, when the coalition government was still in power,” said the CM.

Former JD(S) minister Bandeppa Kashempur said the issue was deferred twice and cleared during the final cabinet meeting. “However, not all cabinet decisions have to be implemented. The BJP government could have stalled the proposal and had a relook,” he said.

Both JD(S) and Congress have demanded an investigation by an impartial agency, but CM Yediyurappa is yet to respond.

Meanwhile, deputy chief minister CN Aswath Narayan, who holds the higher education portfolio, said the government would not continue with the scheme from the upcoming academic year owing to financial constraints.

“The government has spent Rs 311 crore on the scheme in the current financial year and it’s seen as a huge burden on the exchequer. We have decided to discontinue the scheme. Instead, we will focus on enhancing the quality of college infrastructure and improving standards of teaching staff, so that they can be eligible for National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) accreditation,” Narayan told the house during Question Hour.

The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2016-17 had launched the free laptop scheme to distribute the gadgets among first-year Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students in government colleges. It was extended to students from all castes whose family annual income was less than Rs 2.5 lakh. The scheme was put on hold in 2017-18 and 2018-19 and was resumed in 2018-19 during the JD(S)-Congress coalition regime.

Narayan said about one lakh students were given laptops in the current academic year and funds have not been allocated for the scheme in the budget for 2020-21.

288,['20/03/2020'],Govt amendment relaxes land norms for ailing industries,"Bengaluru: Amid a walkout by the opposition, the ruling BJP passed an amendment to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act by allowing private industries on the verge of collapse to sell land to another buyer or company.

Opposition parties claimed the amendment was anti-farmer, saying the land purchased from ryots will now be used for making profits with nefarious intentions.

Introducing the bill, revenue minister R Ashoka and law minister J C Madhuswamy said the amendment was being introduced to allow industries, under Section 109 of the Act, to sell the land only after a period of seven years. It can be sold only for the purpose for which permission was initially obtained.

“We have seen industrialists who have made huge investments but have committed suicide and some who have fled the country after being unable to repay loans. They have even left their employees high and dry,” said Ashoka, while justifying the amendment.

Interestingly, the bill comes around the same time when the family of Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) founder VG Siddhartha has decided to sell 10,000 acres of plantations and other assets to repay lenders. Under the original Act, industrialists are allowed to sell 40 units or 216 acres of land if the company is under distress.

Opposition leaders, including former industries minister RV Deshpande, contended that blanket authorisation to sell land would result in the real estate mafia entering the business and fake industrialists trying to make huge gains. “While a company would have purchased 100 acres of land for setting up an industry, it may use only 20 acres for the purpose. However, when the industrialist cites distress, he/she will seek permission to sell all 100 acres. This way, he/she will also make a considerable windfall from the sale,” said Deshpande, suggesting the government consider restricting the sale of land.

However, the government defended the bill, saying checks and balances would be in place. Not convinced by the response, opposition parties walked out of the assembly and the bill was passed amid the din.

Box: DKS differs from party line

KPCC president DK Shivakumar ruffled some feathers in the Congress legislature party after he moved a member’s amendment to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act. As the debate was raging, Shivakumar arrived in the house and was seen telling opposition leader Siddaramaiah to move an amendment. However, Siddaramaiah differed with his party colleague and asked him to withdraw it.

Later, when speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri called upon Shivakumar to explain his proposed amendment to the bill, the Kanakapura MLA said: “I understand the problem of sections 109 and 79 (a) and (b) that make way for underhand dealings to deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, tahsildars and revenue inspectors. As an educationist myself, I have faced a lot of problems in getting land converted. However, considering my party line, I would not like to speak any more about the issue,” he said.

289,['20/03/2020'],Covid-19 outbreak in Chennai: 'Going door-to-door to make sure all is well',"<p>Corporation staff disinfect a locality in Arumbakkam.<br></p>

CHENNAI: Armed with just a mask on his face, a green vest over his shirt and a register in his hands, 30-year-old M Venkatesan set off through the narrow alleys of Arumbakkam in Central Chennai, ringing doorbells and watching out for dogs before opening gates to apartment complexes and gather data on residents suffering from fever or any other communicable diseases.

A domestic breeding checker (DBC) with Greater Chennai Corporation, Anna Nagar zone, he has been doing it for eight years. But on Thursday morning, his job assumed greater significance. Venkatesan is visiting residents living around a 100m radius of the house in which Tamil Nadu’s second Covid-19 positive case stayed.

The 20-year-old patient, a hairdresser, was working in a local salon which has now been shut. TOI visited the spot on Thursday morning and found that the man hails from Rampur district of Uttar Pradesh and had come to Chennai on March 12 from Delhi on a train. Seven of his roommates have been quarantined at a facility in Poonamalee.

Another resident living in the same complex is likely to be sent to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and swab-tested for the virus. So far, the others have not shown any symptoms, the official said.

From Wednesday evening, the entire area has been fogged and disinfected extensively. Health officials left the area at midnight and returned at 8am to take stock.

Keenly observed by his superior, senior entomologist Thenmozhi, Venkatesan entered an apartment complex in ward 105. As he rung the door bell and announced that he had come from the corporation, a man in a vest and lungi rushed out.

“How many families live here? Does anyone have fever? Has anyone visited a foreign country recently?” These were the standard questions posed to the house owner. An additional question was about whether anyone had a haircut in the nearby salon or its branch on the neighbouring street.

“We have started collecting details of travel to Delhi,” said Thenmozhi. Every ward in each of the 15 zones has 80 DBCs who have to visit 80 homes from 7am to 2pm, rush back to the ward office and submit the compiled data to the sanitary inspector. “This is then sent to the zonal health officer and the headquarters,” Thenmozhi said. Every DBC has to file data regarding the number of houses visited, members, the travel list, how many doors were locked and how many rejected.

Meanwhile, the man in the vest, 52-year-old Sivakumar, took Venkatesan to a house on the first floor. A youngster had returned from Germany last week. Although he did not show any symptoms of Covid-19, Venkatesan and Rajendran Prasad, a field assistant, took down his travel details.

“He will be called up every day and asked about his health status. He has our contact details and has to inform if he catches a cold or has fever,” said Dr Priyadarshini, zonal health officer.

While sincerity and tenacity are important skills for a DBC, the effectiveness of data collection also depends on how residents respond, Thenmozhi said. “Some people don’t share particulars. Some tell us to leave and that they would get themselves treated at a private hospital,” she said.

Next stops were a general store and a grocery shop. Shopkeepers got the same advice and a pamphlet was stuck on a wall.

Venkatesan spotted a small room beside the shop and found that some migrants lived on the first floor. He asked a boy from Rajasthan about his recent visits. “Nobody has returned from foreign. Nobody has fever,” the boy said.

The zonal level officials held a health camp in the area on Thursday, but found that there wasn’t any alarming number of fever cases. People living in and around the area have been asked to quarantine themselves and maintain social distancing, avoid going out and maintain high levels of personal hygiene. The zonal level officials have also stepped up surveillance of fever cases in the area, the official added.

Whenever I am meeting my relatives or friends in the society I am greeting them with namaskar, and avoiding shaking hands. I am making sure to wash vegetables, fruits neatly and also washing the milk packets that the vendor delivers,” she said.Sarita Samatkar, an engineer, believes that social distancing must be practised consciously by citizens, and people are still seen wandering around in markets and shops. “I am staying at home and avoiding going out anywhere. Sometimes it feels frustrating that I cannot meet my friends but spending time with family helps. I am eating only home cooked food. I am not leaving home if there is no emergency,” she said.Adding to this, Varsha Kulkarni, a writer, is using some tips to avoid going out to the gym or vegetable market or cinema hall. “I have stopped going to my relatives’ place, hence they have also stopped visiting. I am not hitting the gym but exercising daily. I am not going to the market but buying vegetables from vendors,” she said.Manank Panchmatia has a positive approach towards social distancing. “Although we have our entire life ahead of us to meet strangers, currently it is important to take a step back in such a crisis. I am making good use of technology to make video calls, conference calls and Skype with friends,” he said.Advocate Vriddhi Bhagat is avoiding visits to the courts unless it’s some very important case as per notification of the bar association on social distancing. “It’s very difficult for a full-time professional lawyer to stay at home, and avoid public places, as that is our job. I am practising social distancing by cleaning at home and spending time with family, also making sure my parents and family members clean and sanitize their hands,” she said.Mrunal Naik, project head at SGR Foundation, is strictly avoiding any kind of public gathering and enjoying some time at home. “I am taking care cleanliness of self and area around me. At home, I am talking on the phone with the people who are isolating themselves to save others, so that they will not feel bad or depressed,” she said.For Dr Neha Rahate, who loves to socialize and try different food items, there is no going out now. “I have stopped going out to meet friends or to restaurants. From the hospital, I go to jog every evening and go directly back home. But I am enjoying the comfort of cooking food at home,” she said.It’s getting a bit difficult for students as they constantly need to go for tuitions and stationery shops for supplies. “I am not even visiting the library, but reading and studying only at home. Xerox shops and net cafés are also shut, but mobile phones and technology make it easy to study,” said Srujal Randive, a student.People working at airports and corporate sector are finding it a bit difficult as shops operate there day and night. “I am not able to completely isolate myself at home.

With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) postponing the exams, schoolteachers demanded that the Class X board exam, which is scheduled to begin on March 27, be postponed.

State auditor of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teacher Association (TNHHSSGTA) T Arulanandam said in view of the pandemic and health advisory seeking people to maintain social distancing, it would be wise to postpone the exams to April 20. “As the country is in a crucial phase, such measures are very important. We shouldn’t risk the safety of students,” he said. “The preparations for Class X exams are almost over and teachers have been assigned duty. We have represented the issue to the state.”

Tamil Nadu Teacher Association president P K Ilamaran demanded that Class X board exams be held in June. “The virus can spread easily among groups. Despite the precautions such as sanitising facilities, the best precautionary measure is social distancing,” he said.

The associations also demanded that exams for Classes I to IX students be cancelled. Representatives of other teachers’ associations from the state also echoed this.

Tamil Nadu Government Employees Teachers Association president S Arunan said the Uttar Pradesh government had announced that all government school students from Classes I to VIII would be promoted without exams in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. “Similarly, Tamil Nadu should also promote all students from Classes I to VIII. The state should also consider the situation and cancel Class IX exams and promote all students,” he said.

If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls — family, health, friends and spirit — are made of glass. If you drop these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for it”. Speaking to TOI, Jeet said, “This speech is always in my mind. When we decided to return to Kolkata, it was this concern that played on our mind. Besides, there was a travel advisory from the government regarding the UK. Of course, there will be a financial loss. But it is everyone’s safety that is more important.”Jeet has decided to stay at home. “I had all the protections when I touched down at the airport. I wore a mask and gloves as well.

Now, with business hitting a rock bottom in view of coronavirus scare, his assets have turned into liability. Thanks to unsubstantiated social media shares linking non-vegetarian food to the spread of infection, the poultry business across the state has taken a severe hit, forcing the UP government to come out with an advisory allaying fears of panic-stricken chicken and egg-eaters in the state.“The coronavirus is transmitted human to human and as per World Animal Health Organization (OIE); poultry has not been found to be involved in transmission of coronavirus to humans so far,"" the advisory said, adding ""consumption of Indian poultry and poultry products including eggs is safe. A general hygiene, however, may be followed.”The Centre in its letter dated March 5 and addressed to all the states had said that because of this misleading information, sale of eggs and chicken meat has drastically suffered and millions of poultry farmers dependent on poultry farming are under threat of losing their livelihood.Despite the advisory, the industry has suffered a jolt already.Deshwal himself was forced not only to destroy eggs but also new-born chicks as he was not even able to support their maintenance. He has already buried 36,000 chicks in the past two weeks. Now, bigger challenge is what to do with 20,000 alive birds at the moment. Two days day ago, a Bulandshahr-based poultry farm buried 6,000 birds alive to reduce losses.Owing to the fall in demand, wholesale price of chicken has come down drastically and is available at Rs 40 per kg in the market as compared to Rs 90 a kg earlier.Ali Akbar, president, UP Poultry Association , said: “To say in terms of financial loss is difficult right now but poultry industry in the state has collapsed. Hatcheries and farms are closing down. While government advisory has yet not reached all, social media messages creating scare have reached all and sundry.”Hatcheries are destroying fertilised eggs and poultry farms are culling chicks as there are no buyers. “Some are selling chicken for free,” said the association’s president.Moolchand, who runs a poultry farm at Dhampur-Nahtaur road in Bijnor, said, “I had set up a poultry farm two years ago with 30,000 birds. The earning was good. Things went wrong after the spread of coronavirus and the rumour on social media. Even the egg’s prices have come down from Rs 4.95 to Rs 2.15 per piece. On Wednesday, egg was sold at Rs 1.65 per piece.”“The government should come forward and extend helping hand,” he added.But, the government’s efforts didn’t calm the frayed nerves.As per state government’s poultry cell, UP has 650 poultry farms that are subsidised by government but there are thousands of private farms as well.Poultry industry involves lakhs of people considering that it’s a long chain of breeding farms, hatcheries, poultry farms and market. Beyond poultry farmers, others involved are labourers, transporters, maize and Soya farmers, vaccine and medicine manufacturers and suppliers.Dr Todarmal, joint director, poultry cell, animal husbandry department, UP, said, “We are telling people through various forums that eating eggs and chicken is safe. We are also studying the market.”The same chicken may be stored by meat processing units at minus 40 degrees for days and they would make money by selling it once the demand increases, he said. The demand might shoot up after Navratras.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74722050,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-19-hatches-up-poultry-industrys-doom/articleshow/74720851.cms

VADODARA: Javara Parmar, a 70-year-old resident of Goraj village, waded into the Dev River in Waghodia taluka at about 3 pm on Wednesday to wash her clothes, like every other day. However, that day the waters had turned hostile for the unsuspecting septuagenarian who came face to face with an adult crocodile .

Before she could act, the crocodile, which had sneaked into the river just few minutes earlier, caught hold of the woman’s legs. Then followed a terrifying struggle to save herself from the jaws with the help of some locals. The woman , however, succumbed to her injuries late on Wednesday night.

According to the locals, the crocodile caught hold of Parmar when she got into knee-deep water. While she raised an alarm, the shock made her stand still in the river while the crocodile locked its jaws and tried to drag her away, they said. But luckily two locals spotted her and immediately called others for help. But by then, the crocodile had already dragged Parmar under the water.

A video shot by a local of the entire incident went viral on Thursday showing three men jumping into the river and starting a battle to free the woman from the jaws of death.

Two men swam close to the reptile and tried to scare it away by hitting the water with sticks and then took on the crocodile directly which finally let go off its hold of Parmar. They quickly brought the woman to the riverbank. Parmar was rushed to a private hospital with severe injuries on her back and legs, but she died during the treatment.

Wildlife activists said that the river is home to many crocodiles and the locals have been warned not to wash clothes on its banks. However, locals often don’t pay heed to the warning and venture into the river.

Concurrently, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has held Mafsu responsible and will be issuing notices to the concerned officials.

Officials of Ambazari police station informed TOI that an offence has been registered under 379 (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code. Under this section, the accused can be face imprisonment up to three years or fined, or both.

Cops said that they are trying to trace the contractor who felled the trees without permission. “We are also trying to find the matching timber in the local markets. Right now, the FIR has been registered against unidentified persons,” they added.

Mafsu officials have maintained their earlier stand of “not having any knowledge about tree felling” on its land near Telangkhedi temple.

However, the civic body has held the university responsible for not ensuring protection of age-old trees in its property. As per officials of NMC’s garden department, show cause notices will be issued to associate dean of the university, two professors and in-charge of the land. “Whoever cuts the trees, ultimately Mafsu is responsible for protection of the green cover on its land,” officials said.

They further pointed out that the land is over 35-40 acres. “Had Mafsu appointed few security personnel, they would have been known about the tree-felling,” an official added.

Environment activists said its nothing but “blame game and skipping of responsibility”. “Mafsu is primarily responsible but if it's neglecting its responsibility, the NMC too is at fault by not keeping a tab on illegal tree felling as the land comes in its jurisdiction. This needs diligent follow-up by the civic agencies. Unlike other large-scale tree felling cases, the matter should not be conveniently put to rest,” said environment activist Amit Heda .

TOI was the first to report on Tuesday about illegal felling of more than 200 trees at Mafsu land. Interestingly, the land is adjacent to Bharat-Van where thousands of trees have mysterious disappearance of thousands of trees in the last few trees had recently came to the fore.

As per the residents of Bharat Nagar who had complained about the felling, the activity has been going out since a long time. They also suspect a nexus between the university officials and tree contractor.

The entire screening and sanitation in railway station and bus stands seemed more for photo ops and official inspections, rather than detecting patients with Covid-19 symptoms. This despite increase in cases in other states and local transmission.

There is a Covid-19 medical check-up desk and help desk on the platforms of Coimbatore Junction.

The medical check-up desk has a paramedical staff with a forehead scanner.

The paramedical staff neither ask passengers whether they have any symptoms of Covid-19 nor inquire about their travel history.

When asked how many people come forward to get screened and of them how many were from affected states like Maharashtra or Kerala, the staff refused to comment. “Please ask the station director for any details,” was the reply.

However, the railways on its part has taken efforts to increase the number of times the station’s surfaces are disinfected, from the usual once in six hours to nearly once in two hours. It has also employed additional staff.

“The men just keep coming and spraying some liquid on all the seats. All it did was make the seat wet and we can’t sit on them now,” said a man waiting to board the Ernakulam-Bangalore train. As per disinfecting protocol, lyzol should not only be sprayed, but properly wiped and spread across every inch of the surface.

In Ukkadam bus stand, which receives many Kerala buses, women employed for disinfecting were seen chatting in a corner. Over an hour on Wednesday, at least three buses that arrived from Kerala and left were not wiped down. “But in the border, tyres and bodies were sprayed on and people ask us if there is any one with fever inside,” a bus driver said. Thus, if some does not volunteer due to fear of being quarantined, they pass through easily.

NAINITAL: A fortnight after the Uttarakhand high court (HC) ordered removal of all religious structures built on government land, the HC on Thursday ordered removal of a Saibaba temple built on government land in Rishikesh.

The temple had been given a removal notice by the district administration after the HC order, but its management committee — the Sai Sewa Samiti — had approached court against the notice. A bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe which heard the matter refused to issue a stay on the notice and ordered the removal of the temple within two months.

Speaking to TOI, one of the officials of Sai Sewa Samiti said that the temple has existed at the spot for decades and hundreds of devotees visit it daily, and therefore, the administration should have taken a considered view before sending a notice. “The court has given the administration two months to remove the temple. However, we will go through the order and decide the future course of action accordingly,” the official said.

To recall, the HC had on March 4 ordered the removal of all temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras built on public land. This came after the HC took suo motu cognisance of the fact that several religious structures were encroaching on public parks, streets, and other public spaces.

The abundance of illegal religious structures across Uttarakhand has been a serious public issue. In fact, the Himalayan state was the only state to not file an affidavit in the Supreme Court despite it giving clear directions in January 2018 that directed the state chief secretaries to frame policies in consultation with the government in this regard.

KMRC is implementing the East-West Metro project that is currently in its last leg of underground tunnelling between Esplanade and Sealdah. A fresh PIL has been filed by a resident of BB Ganguli Street, seeking protection for the structures, below which the tunnels are being built. The division bench of Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee heard the PIL on Tuesday.

The petitioners told the court that 36 buildings had been damaged ever since tunnelling resumed on February 18. The twin Metro tunnels pass through the serpentine lanes off Bowbazar where more than 20 buildings fell and several others developed cracks during an accident last August. The HC turned down the plea.

Since September, last year, the court has been hearing a PIL filed by some residents who have objected to the tunnelling operations, especially after one of the two tunnel boring machines (TBMs) hit an aquifer on August 31, leading to subsidence and collapse of buildings. Around 700 residents had to be evacuated after the tunnelling fiasco and tunnelling work was suspended. Following a court order, the work resumed on February 18. An expert committee set up by KMRC recommended resumption of tunnelling, assuring the division bench that there was no fear of further accidents.

But now, Rajlakshmi Dhar, a resident of 122, BB Ganguli Street, has filed another PIL seeking the court’s intervention in protecting the newly damaged houses in the area. Dipankar Dhar, the counsel appearing for the petitioner, alleged that KMRC has failed to keep its promise that the tunnelling would cause no further damage to property.

Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, the counsel appearing for KMRC, refuted the allegation, saying all kinds of protective measures are being taken for safety of the buildings. The court then directed KMRC to file an affidavit on March 26, stating what these steps are.

The Hudco police said the incident took place when the truck was heading to Hosur with a load of a 450kg biogas cylinder from Alasanatham. “While trying to negotiate a speed breaker, the cylinder jolted suddenly and gas started to leak. The vehicle soon went up in flames,” a police officer said.

The truck driver, whose identity is yet to be ascertained, immediately got down from the truck, which he parked on the roadside. “Within no time, the cylinder exploded and fire engulfed the five shops, one of them a hotel. Vehicles that were parked in front of the shops also caught fire,” the officer said.

Panicked, people in front of the shops started running for life. However, four of them - S Manjula, 25, of Alasanatham, Smasruth, 32, of Bihar, Aswa, 13 and Ravikiran, 9 - sustained burn injuries and they were rushed to the government hospital in Hosur. “Samsruth received 50% burns, while the rest received only minor injuries,” a doctor said.

It took nearly two hours for the fire and rescue services personnel to bring the flames under control by pressing two fire tenders into service.

Preliminary investigation revealed that a private company in the same locality had taken the cylinder for refilling to a gas agency. “The incident took place while the refilled cylinder was being transported back to the firm,” the officer said.

The Hudco police have registered a case and initiated inquiry with the private firm.

According to an investigation officer, the incident took place when the students were on their way to Ooty from Salem. “To make the best use of the holidays that the state government had declared till March 31 to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the students decided to visit Ooty. They hired an SUV and started from Salem in the early hours of Thursday. When they neared Avinashi, the driver lost control over the vehicle, which rammed the truck from behind.”

CHENNAI: With two more people testing positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu in the last two days, temples across the state have cancelled their annual festivals to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.

The Tamil months of Panguni and Chitharai (March-April) are famous for festivals across the state, when temple chariots are taken around temples with hundreds of devotees in attendance. “The Panguni Uthiram festival, on April 6, is being cancelled based on the health department’s advisory. Palani and other five other Murugan temples will also cancel the festival,” a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) department official said. It is traditionally celebrated as a marriage festival at Murugan temples.

In Chennai, the Panguni fest at Mylapore’s Kapaleeswarar has been cancelled.

Undeterred by the government’s call for social distancing, a large crowd gathered at the information centre of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in T Nagar for a four-hour dhanvanthri yaga to beseech the Gods to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

In the Nilgiris, Protestant and Catholic churches have cancelled mass till March 31. Sources at the Catholic Sacred Heart Church in Ooty said regular mass was called off till month-end though the church will remain open for individual prayers.

“This is the Lenten period, so we were supposed to have a grand mass this Sunday. We have now been told we will be intimated about it on Saturday,” said Anthony Patrick, a parishioner at Catholic St Mary’s Church in Ooty.

Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep, Bishop of Church of South India (CSI), said, “More than 200 churches and 145 educational institutions and hostels fall under the Coimbatore diocese of the CSI (which includes the Nilgiris). While schools are closed till March 31, churches will have regular mass but the duration will be reduced. Awareness on hand hygiene is being created.”

317,['20/03/2020'],Made in Kovai sanitizers keep Covid-19 in check,"Coimbatore: Some city-based educational institutions and brands have begun developing their own hand sanitizer as there is a huge shortage for the same in the market to break the chain of Covid-19 by maintaining hand hygiene. They seem to have taken inspiration from Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) that has come up with a hand sanitizer called Covai Rub.

On Thursday, Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology (SKCET) in Kovaipudur and skincare brand Vilvah announced their own hand sanitizers. While SKCET plans to use the product on its campus itself, Vilvah would distribute its product to people at high risk of exposure to the virus free of cost. “This includes health care workers, delivery partners and scavengers in rural areas who are regularly in touch with patients,” said a statement from Vilvah.

The two are, however, aware that they could meet only a fraction of the demand. Vilvah said, “We have developed only 100kg so far, but we have received emails requesting 1,000kg. So, we want to target rural healthcare workers first and then go forward.”

J Janet, SCKET principal, said they had developed 2,000 litres of hand sanitizer, which they would fill in 100ml bottles to be placed in classrooms, library, laboratories, toilets, hostels, and halls, etc., for the use of students and staff. “The case is same with our group institutions. Our students also know they don’t need to buy sanitizer from market after they return on March 31. If we have extra, we can distribute it to the villages that we have adopted - Perur Chettipalayam and Arumugakoundanur.”

CMCH is, meanwhile, producing 10 litres of Covai Rub a day to meet their requirements. While Covai Rub contains isopropyl alcohol, glycerin and hydrogen peroxide, SKCET’s hand sanitizer contains 80% alcohol and natural ingredients like aloe vera extracts, rose petals and lavender. Vilvah’s sanitizer has 70% alcohol and other ingredients.

On a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the country to exercise ‘restraint’ and emphasised on social distancing in the nation’s fight against coronavirus, Sawant with his shortsightedness has proved that people’s safety is last on his list of priorities. The chief minister seems to have forgotten that democracy is for the people and not for the politicians. Modi minced no words in underlying the gravity of the threat and said there is no room for complacency, but Sawant through his repeated actions has shown that he is unaware of the gravity of the pandemic. Even the religious bodies—church and temples—have cautioned and advised people to pray privately. But Sawant, who is guilty of addressing large gatherings, has shown scant regard to any of the guidelines. His first and foremost responsibility is the safety of the people, including children and senior citizens. By his highhandedness, Sawant is putting lives at risk. He should stop behaving selfishly and put people first.

PANAJI: The Goa government, which was adamant on going ahead with the zilla panchayat (ZP) polls on Sunday despite the central government calling for social distancing, decided to postpone the polls by two days after PM Modi called for ‘Janata Curfew’ from 7am to 9pm on March 22. They will now be held on Tuesday.“Respecting the appeal made by PM Modi for ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22 and in the interest of wider participation of the electorate in the ZP elections, the state government, in consultation with the state election commission (SEC), has decided to postpone the ZP polling date to March 24,” CM Pramod Sawant said.While the SEC is yet to finalise counting day, which was earlier scheduled for March 23, there will be no change in the campaign period that ends on Friday.Immediately after Modi called for ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday over the spread of coronavirus , Sawant met with state election commissioner R K Srivastava and chief secretary Parimal Rai late Thursday night.The opposition had earlier been demanding that the ZP polls be deferred in view of Covid-19 scare.The government last month had postponed the election date from March 15 to March 22. The last ZP polls were held on March 18, 2015, and the first meeting was conducted on March 25 that year. “The five-year tenure ends on March 24. We have to constitute ZPs before that,” Srivastava had told reporters last month.A total of 203 candidates are in the running for the elections to two bodies – South Goa ZP and North Goa ZP – each consisting of 25 constituencies. BJP has fielded candidates for 43 seats while Congress has put up candidates in 38 seats. MGP, which has an informal pact with Congress, will fight the elections in 17 seats. AAP and NCP have put up candidates in 17 and six constituencies respectively. Besides, 79 independent candidates are in the fray.Forty-nine members remain to be elected to the ZPs as one from Sancoale has already been elected unopposed.Thirty of the 50 constituencies are reserved for women, ST, SC and OBC. A total of 9,500 staff were roped in for the elections that were to be held across 1,210 polling booths.The high court last month declined to stay the reservation of constituencies done by the government.Although the high court admitted the petitions, a division bench stated that it would not interfere with the election process and would hear the petitions in eight weeks, after replies were filed by the government in the matter.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74726138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-377259,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-wider-participation-sawant-defers-zp-elections-by-two-days/articleshow/74720872.cms

KOZHIKODE: The temporary ban by the UAE government on entry of resident visa holders who are currently outside the country has in effect made the ongoing Covid-19 related travel disruptions for NRKs to the Gulf almost complete.

The decision, imposed as part of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, is for a period of two weeks, subject to renewal. The UAE is home to 8.3 lakh NRKs and the announcement has caught many expats who had come on leave or had sent their family members home unawares. With this, all the six GCC countries, except Bahrain, now have travel restrictions in place for expats from India. Other GCC countries like Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Oman and Qatar had already announced entry restrictions.

Karipur airport, which has international flights only to the Gulf countries, is left in an unenviable situation of being able to having flights to just one country- Bahrain. The restrictions have severely hit flight operations and passenger traffic with majority of flights getting cancelled.

Airport director K Srinivasa Rao said as of now the only flight that is scheduled to operate is the Air India Express flight to Bahrain.

The UAE had on Wednesday suspended issuance of visas upon arrival and all types of labour permits, including drivers and domestic workers, effective Thursday.

“Though expats are bound to face travel-related uncertainties on the personal front, there is no reason to worry about their jobs or visa status as the UAE government is expected to take a considerate view on the matter,” P K Anwar Naha, an NRK based in Dubai said.

The UAE government has requested all residence visa holders outside the UAE to contact the country’s diplomatic missions in their respective countries for support and to provide a way of returning.

325,['20/03/2020'],New Hussainsagar master plan envisages a tourist spot,"Hussainsagar lake

HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has decided to prepare a fresh master plan on Hussainsagar , having failed in its previous attempts to rid the lake of pollutants and unbearable odour.

Senior officials said the government was keen to turn Hussainsagar into a national and international tourist destination. S Jeevananda Reddy of Centre for Sustainable Environment pointed out that HMDA was found wanting in its efforts to keep the lake and its surroundings clean.

“HMDA has spent Rs 350 crore on Hussainsagar cleaning, but the lake still reeks of pollution. Several commercial establishments have come up on the lakebed by violating the norms. Neither HMDA nor the Telangana State Pollution Control Board has taken action against them,” he told TOI.

However, officials said HMDA would go the whole hog to give Hussainsagar a new look replete with international standards. “The Hussainsagar area will get a distinct identity. We will make the lake area visually appealing and an enjoyable destination for tourists. Presently, the Buddha Purnima Project Authority areas (lake surroundings) have entertainment facilities,” a senior HMDA official said.

The lake area would be divided into two stretches — Indira Chowk to Buddha Bhavan and Buddha Bhavan to Sanjeevaiah Park — covering a distance of 5 km, the perimeter of the lake.

Officials said designs and concept plans were yet to be prepared for which HMDA has recently invited request for proposal (RFP) for consultancy services for redevelopment and preparation of master plan. “The consultant will give detailed design drawings for development of the lake on engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode,” an official said.

HMDA had taken up integration of master plans four years ago. Last year, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had asked the municipal administration department to come up with a new master plan for HMDA. But, there has been no forward movement on that front.

Jeevananda Reddy said the government wants to convert the entire Hussainsagar lake area into a real estate venture in the name of redevelopment.

“The CM talked about making Hussainsagar water pure and potable. But, the authorities have forgotten about the cleaning work,” he added.

One kilo of tomato, which was sold for Rs 5 until Wednesday, was sold for Rs 20 on Thursday. Similarly, one kilo of small onion, which was sold for Rs 30, was now sold for Rs 80. “The price of garlic has increased to Rs 100 from Rs 50,” A Raja, one of the buyers said.

According to the shandy vendors, they usually bring three tonnes of small onions for sale. “Due to sudden demand for small onions, we brought eight tonnes on Thursday,” S Venkatesh, an onion vendor said. Agents who had huge stock sold it for exorbitant price utilizing the opportunity.

“Many of my regular customers have purchased huge quantity of vegetables from my shop,” P Ganesan, another vendor added.

Meanwhile, Erode-based activist A Aadhavan urged the state government to keep the vegetable and essential commodities prices on control. “Many vendors will utilize the opportunity to increase the prices,” he lamented.

An official resolve to this effect has been passed in the recent meeting of the executive council of Batu recently.

The proposed facility will have three teachers of the rank associate professor and will promote research in chosen fields.

Ulhas Shiurkar, principal of Deogiri Institute of Engineering and Management, who is also the co-coordinator for Batu regional centre, said that the research centre on Mechatronics and cyber-security should come up at the earliest.

“It is a good initiative to promote research in the fields of Mechatronics and cyber-security. The proposed facility will be beneficial to students, teachers and local industries,” he said.

Batu authorities said that the location and other infrastructural arrangement for the proposed centre will be finalized shortly.

Notably, Batu has been recently enrolled as the institutional member in the National Cyber Safety and Security Standards. The recognition and benefits associated with it can be utilized for the proposed research centre at Aurangabad. The National Cyber Safety and Security Standard, a national level body, has vision of setting up research centres across the country in collaboration with various colleges and universities.

“Mechatronics has emerged as the multidisciplinary branch of engineering. It focuses on the engineering of both electrical and mechanical systems and incorporates streams such as robotics, electronics, computer, telecommunications, systems, control, and product engineering. Being an educational and industrial hub, Aurangabad is an ideal place for setting up the research centre,” Shiurkar said.

Hours after Chennai recorded a third Covid-19 positive case, the health department began screening domestic passengers at the Coimbatore airport. “The second Chennai case, a barber from Rampur, is a case of community transmission and local transmission, and he travelled across the country. So, we must start screening passengers travelling within states too,” a health department official said.

Meanwhile, the food safety department has requested hotels and restaurants to take extra measures to prevent spread of Covid-19. The measures include setting up a clear cleaning chart of how many times they disinfected all the surfaces in restaurants, ensure they have hand soaps or hand sanitizers next to their wash areas and toilets and have banned any employee with a cold, cough or fever from working on the premises. “Covid-19 symptoms and helpline number too have to be displayed in front of restaurant’s entrance, above hand wash area and cashier,” a press statement said.

“Star hotels should also update us if anyone from outside the state or country is staying in their hotel,” it added.

My journey had begun in Bilbao, Spain , at 5.45pm local time on Tuesday when I took a Vueling Airlines flight to Barcelona.From there, I boarded the 6.45pm Qatar Airways flight to Doha the same evening. At 9.25pm on Wednesday, I took the Qatar flight to Kolkata. But when we were told that everyone would be taken to a government quarantine facility, there were murmurs of discontentment. After all, none have been exposed to a government hospital and held a very grim view of it. Much of the apprehensions got allayed at the first glimpse of the New Town facility. We were called by turns and asked about our travel history and health. Those who were assessed to be fine were allowed to go home and advised to stay put there for the next 14 days. I was suffering from cold for around a month and told the doctor, who suggested that I remain under observation at the centre for a couple of days. I agreed. Not only did the facility look fine but I also knew the importance of isolation, having witnessed Spain suffer after the virus spread in the community. I don’t want to endanger either my parents, neighbours or fellow Kolkatans I have been provided a bed on fourth floor where a few others have been quarantined. Doctors in protective gear have made their rounds. Since I am a chef, I am naturally curious about food. Considering this is a government hospital, it’s been quite good.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala urged people’s representatives in local bodies to set aside adifferences and take vital steps at local-level to prevent Kerala from entering the ‘ community-transmission phase ’, ‘which the state is likely to enter in a couple of weeks’ time’.

In a joint video conference, addressing all the ward members of panchayats, municipalities and corporations on Thursday, the leaders said it was the prime responsibility of local administrations and people’s representatives to ensure that people are following restrictions and ban to keep the dreaded phase at bay.

“There’s a big possibility that the virus may spread unexpectedly in Kerala (a second phase of community spread). A local-level screening system must be ensured by local bodies and people’s representatives. They should check and see if restrictions are being followed,” said Vijayan.

Chennithala said Kerala - ‘considering the experience of other countries and experts’ - may enter the ‘community transmission phase’ in the next 10-15 days, ‘during which sources might go untraced and the number of cases might double everyday’. “We should remain united irrespective of our political differences and brace up to face such a phase, and survive,” he said.

Stressing on the need to remain alert every second to keep the situation under control, the chief minister said society should stay united even if Kerala takes unusual preventive measures.

“We were able to contain the outbreak to a certain extent, thanks to our integrated prevention activities. But, continuous intervention of local bodies, political leaders and every citizen is required now to achieve a total containment,” he said.

Pointing out that almost 30,000 persons were under observation at their homes, Vijayan said their protection and requirements were major responsibilities of the respective local administration.

There shouldn’t be denial of basic requirements, and LSGs and ward members should ensure a normal life for them as they are in ‘care centres’ and not detention, he said. Vijayan directed local bodies to act tough on those hoarding food items, provisions and medicines and to ensure their availability in the market through repeated raids and inspections. “LSGs should also involve migrant workers in prevention activities after creating the required awareness,” he said.

Chennithala, in his address, called for proper preparations at panchayat (block and district) levels to contain Covid-19.

The screens will also generate non-ticketing revenue for CMRL as there will be provision to display advertisements.CMRL has floated tenders for design, supply, installation and commissioning of the digital display screens for its entire fleet of 52 trains which includes the 10 new trains procured for the phase-1 extension line in north Chennai.A metro rail official said the screens, which will be linked to the signalling system, will be put up in all trains for operations when the 9km north Chennai line opens by mid-2020. “Each of the four cars in a train will have these screens,” an official said.According to the tender invite, the screens will have automatic visual and audio broadcasting of route-related information in CMRL two-corridor phase-1 and phase-1 extension lines as well as inter-corridor operations between corridor 1 and corridor 2.CMRL decided to opt for display systems as the existing fleet of 42 trains are designed only for the 45km phase-1 route and stations and not does not include the stations in phase-1 extension line. The 9km line linking north Chennai from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar with the rest of the city is expected to be ready mid-2020.The CMRL official said there may be a minimum of two screens in every train car. While one will display the route map and inform commuters when the train approaches a station, the other will have information on the amenities available at the station, feeders services, intermodal facilities and landmarks around a station.The present operational fleet has dynamic route map display panels fixed above the doors inside train cars where lights fixed next to name of every station in the route blinks as a train approaches a station. This helps commuters know where the train is headed. All four-car trains have eight such panels but only four of them work while the rest are meant to show only the route map.“Since display panels are linked to the signalling system and works automatically, we will switch off these panels and link the signalling subsystem to the LED screens,” the official said.The display panels in the current fleet are also designed to show only phase-1 routes and station from Washermenpet to Airport and Central Metro to St Thomas Mount. Since the upcoming line from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar is only an extension of the phase-1 corridors, the same trains will also be operated from Wimco Nagar all the way to Airport. But the trains are not designed to show commuters the nine stations in the extension line. Commuters also cannot get any information on feeders services or nearby landmarks until they alight at a station and reach the concourse level.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74721902,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-627150,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/metro-trains-to-get-digital-info-screens/articleshow/74720867.cms

HYDERABAD: Even as finishing touches are being given to the new GHMC Act, the municipal administration department is gearing up to increase the number of wards to about 200. GHMC has 150 wards presently and population of each ward is between 40,000 and 50,000.

Sources in the government said the municipal administration department is contemplating creating a division (ward) for every 30,000 to 35,000 population. “While some divisions have around 40,000 population, especially in surrounding wards like Ramanthapur , Uppal, AS Rao Nagar and Kapra , population in Saroornagar division is 49,128 and Ramnas Pura and Kishanbagh in Old City have around 49,300,” a senior GHMC official said.

Officials said some newly-created municipalities have 1,500 people in each ward in the rural areas while maximum population is about 10,000 in municipal corporations. “In some municipal corporations like Jawaharnagar or Badangpet, total population is about one lakh, which is half of one municipal division in Greater Hyderabad ,” a zonal commissioner of GHMC said.

The state government wanted to bring the new GHMC Act in the budget session in which the government would mention the guidelines for creation of wards in GHMC. But, the assembly session was abruptly adjourned due to coronavirus impact. Sources said the government is likely to place the new Act in a special assembly session which is likely to be held next month.

Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said on the floor of the assembly that the government would enhance the number of wards in GHMC. “There is a need to enhance the number of divisions in Greater Hyderabad. It is expected to touch 200 divisions going by the present population in Greater Hyderabad limits,” mayor Bonthu Rammohan said.

Interestingly, municipal circles in and around Hyderabad are likely to get more wards after delimitation as population in the peripheral areas is on the rise while it is stagnant in the core areas. Presently, the Old City has about 50 wards in seven circles. “Since physical boundaries of the wards are changed in the delimitation process, there will be a change in the reservations of wards. Of the total wards, 50% of them are reserved for various categories like SCs, STs, BCs and women and changed according to their population,” a GHMC election wing official said.

Habitat development activities have been carried out in the last one year by the forest department which will decide on future developments based on the outcome of the census.

The two-day census was carried out by the forest department at the sanctuary by roping in volunteers from some colleges and biodiversity conservation foundation (BCF), Trichy last week.

Saying that the census reports were encouraging, S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forest, Thanjavur circle said there are adequate signs of increasing wildlife population slowly after the Gaja cyclone.

Recalling the lost blackbuck population during Gaja cyclone, he said the fact that about 48 blackbuck fawns were spotted during the census is a clear sign of a breeding population in a conducive habitat. He said the sanctuary is not meant only for protection of wild animals but sometimes it can also be used for rehabilitation of captive elephants.

A total of 41 spotted deer living in captivity for over two decades in a mini zoo in Thanjavur district were translocated to Point Calimere wildlife sanctuary. They have got acclimatised to the sanctuary and are doing well, he said.

Lesser known animals like Ruddy mongoose, civet cats and fruit bats have also been spotted during the census.

“A blueprint will be developed on what all activity is required to be carried out for habitat development in the sanctuary based on the outcome of the census,” he said.

“We can conclude if a habitat is suitable or not for an animal by searching for indirect signs that they leave,” said founder director of Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (BCF) A Kumaraguru.

“In the case of blackbucks, there are effective signs of the animal utilising the space. Blackbucks are very sensitive and earmark lavatory sites and leave urinal markings apart from debarking trees with their spiral horns. We could find such indicators in many parts of the sanctuary,” said Kumaraguru.

Indian Jackal is the biggest predatory species at the sanctuary which was spotted in eight transect line, he added.

Police identified the mastermind of the murder as Parvez Hanif Shaikh (42) of Hadapsar, an ex-convict in a 2018 body offence case registered by the Sangvi police. Shaikh, having a history of arrests in 18 serious crimes, walked out of the Yerawada central prison in February last year on completion of his jail-term.

Shewani, the shoe shop owner, was accosted and abducted from Maldhakka Chowk while he was returning home in his car on the night of January 4. The following day, he was found dead with a couple of bullet wounds at Padegaon village near Lonand in Satara district. The police later arrested five suspects, including an employee from his shop, but still had no clue about the murder motive.

On Thursday, additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale said, “Shaikh plotted Shewani’s abduction for extortion, but the suspects opted for killing him as he was reluctant to part with money and was evasive about his financial status.”

DCP (crime) Bachchan Singh, ACP (crime) Shivaji Pawar and crime branch inspector Mahendra Jagtap worked on various leads to track and arrest Shaikh.

Shaikh’s role in the crime came up during the interrogation of the five arrested suspects — Afridi Rauf Khan (23) of Nana Peth, Sunil Namdev Gaikwad (49) of Kondhwa, Kiran Sunil Kadam (21) of Hadapsar, and Ajinkya Hanumant Dhumal (21) and Pritam Ambre (25), both from Saswad. Gaikwad worked at Shewani’s shop and his role was to provide updates about his employer’s activities and movements.

Morale said, “Shaikh wanted money after he left prison. One of his associates took him to Shewani for securing loan from the latter, but Shewani did not entertain him. Shaikh then came in contact with Gaikwad, who told him that Shewani had good money with him. Shaikh then planned Shewani’s abduction for extortion.”

Inspector Jagtap said, “Shaikh brought the five other aides, including Gaikwad, together and promised them good money on the execution of his extortion plot. Gaikwad was providing updates to the rest of the group members and on the night of January 4, the suspects followed Shewani’s car in a four-wheeler and accosted the victim at Maldhakka Chowk before forcing him into their vehicle.”

This 234 km stretch from Hyderabad to Gowrelly (ORR) via Valigonda and Thorrur was supposed to be developed up till Kothagudem from where there is an already developed highway till Bhadrachalam.It is a state highway and the state government expected central funds for its development. However, the Centre has not notified it as national highway.Interestingly, this is not the only road awaiting notification and funding. Of 3,150 km, 700 km of roads have not been notified as national highways. Officials said several letters have been written to Union ministry and TRS MPs have taken up the matter with the central government to notify the roads as national highways and start funding for its development. But the response from the union ministry has not been positive.The talk in official circles is that ever since the Parliament elections in May 2019 saw BJP getting majority on its own in Lok Sabha, the state is no more on the priority list of the Centre in terms of funding for development of highways. Also, the economic slowdown is being cited as another reason for the union ministry not being liberal in notifying the state roads as highways.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74723738,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487397,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/year-on-hyd-bhadrachalam-road-awaits-notification-funds/articleshow/74719107.cms

The suspect, Krishna Namdeo Dabhade (52), had sought the money from a flour-mill owner for renewal of license and covering up earlier action taken for certain violations.

“Dabhade had sought Rs 10,000 for renewal of license and another Rs 25,000 for hiding shortcomings observed at the establishment during a recent crackdown. The demand for money was put before the mill-owner on March 13 following which he approached the ACB,” an official release said.

Acting on the complaint, the ACB sleuths on Thursday laid a trap and caught Dabhade red-handed after he accepted the bribe. “Another man, Rajeshwar alias Dnyaneshwar Shewale, has been also arrested by the ACB during the crackdown. The 24-year-old runs a photocopy machine center and took the money on behalf of Dabhade,” an official said.

The suspect, who was also holding additional charge of Osmanabad, was in the limelight recently for series of actions he took against commercial establishments in Beed for different non-compliances and violations.

A section of owners of such establishments, however, suspected the motive behind the crackdown and accused of vested interest. A group of traders burst fire-cracker in the old market area of the city as the news of ACB action against Dabhade spread in the city.

“The FDA official hails from Ahmednagar district and owns property at hometown as well as in Nashik,” ACB sources said adding that all movable and immovable assets of Dabhade would be scrutinized.

The bullet grazed victim Madhukar Dattatreya Khandve’s right temple, the Airport police said, adding that Khandve was rushed to a nearby private hospital where he recorded his statement after treatment, naming two of the assailants as Abhijit Balasaheb Shejwal (26) and Suraj Balasaheb Shejwal (28), who stay in his neighbourhood.

Khandve, owner of a packaged drinking water unit, told police that he was not familiar with the other two men who accompanied the Shejwal brothers at the time of the incident, which occurred around 9.45pm in front of his house in Khandvenagar.

Later, the police arrested the Shejwal brothers and launched a search for their two accomplices. Senior inspector Gajanan Pawar of the Airport police and his team also visited the crime spot and recovered a live cartridge, an empty bullet shell and the front portion of a fired bullet from the spot.

In his FIR, Khandve stated that for the last 10-12 years, the Shejwal brothers and their two relatives had been involved in a dispute with the local residents over an access road.

The Shejwals had threatened Khandve and his son for using the road in the past, following which he and other residents had lodged complaints with the Airport police, the FIR stated. More recently, Khandve had to seek police protection for filling up huge potholes on the access road as they feared the Shejwals would obstruct the repairs.

Around 9.45pm on Wednesday, Khandve came out of his bungalow upon hearing someone ring the doorbell. On reaching the main gate, he saw Abhijit and Suraj standing with another man, the FIR stated.

On seeing Khandve, Abhijit pulled out a pistol, aimed at him and tried to fire a round, but the pistol did not fire. In a desperate move, Suraj snatched the pistol and pulled the trigger, the FIR stated, adding that the weapon did fire this time and the bullet grazed the complainant’s right temple.

Khandve raised an alarm, prompting his wife Maya, son Omkar, cousin Kishor Khandve and nephew Prateek Devkar to rush out. The assailants then fled towards Nagar Road. The victim’s relative took him to the hospital, the FIR stated.

354,['20/03/2020'],"6.4 tonne of tobacco seized, four arrested","Trichy: The Pudukottai police on Thursday seized 6.4 tonne of tobacco products illegally stocked in four locations and arrested four people in this connection. The arrested have been identified as Soundararajan, 40, Mohamed Ali, 47, Veeramani, 38, and Narayanan, 46, all from Pudukottai district.

This is the biggest ever haul in recent months and police team could arrest the key people who were distributing tobacco products in the district, said senior police officials from Pudukottai.

Soundararajan, the key accused, was nabbed following a tip-off that a large quantity of tobacco products has been stashed in his place. Police conducted a search at Soundararajan’s grocery shop and seized about 100kg of tobacco products.

His godown was also searched from where 2.8 tonne of tobacco was seized. He revealed the names of three more people who had stocked tobacco products. All the three were arrested and the products were seized from them. The arrested told police that they used to bring the products along with grocery items in goods vehicles.

They told police that the demand for such products prompted them to indulge in the illegal activity. Soundararajan also told police that customers had been avoiding his grocery shop as he was not selling tobacco products. This has forced him to source the banned items from outside. The state government has banned tobacco products, including pan masala and chewable tobacco since 2013.

CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) has scrapped city’s costliest housing scheme in Sector 53 and decided to refund the amount to the applicants decided by the demand survey. However, the officers have been asked to consider framing of a new scheme with lesser cost.

CHB’s board of directors in their meeting on Thursday decided, “The proposed general self-financing housing scheme in Sector 53 needs to be made more lucrative. To reduce the land cost component, the matter may be taken up with the UT administration to increase the floor area ratio (FAR) so that more flats can be constructed. Further, the possibility of some changes in the specifications and design also need to be explored. Considering that framing a new scheme with lesser cost and further possible changes may take considerable time, the board has decided to refund the amount deposited by the applicants…”

There was a poor response to the demand survey of the scheme, as only 178 applicants came up for 492 flats. The CHB had reduced prices of flats twice and even extended the deadline for demand survey. After witnessing poor response, the CHB, on January 14, further reduced prices by 5% to 7%, and extended the date for submission of online application to February 24.

In July 2019, the CHB had proposed a 3BHK flat for Rs 1.85 crore, 2 BHK for Rs 1.6 crore, 1BHK for Rs 1.15 crore and accommodation for the economically-weaker section (EWS) for Rs 58 lakh, drawing a lot of criticism.

Thereafter, the board released a new price list on October 10: 3BHK for Rs 1.63 crore, 2BHK for Rs 1.36 crore, 1BHK for Rs 90 lakh and a two-room flat for EWS Rs 50 lakh. Then on January 14, the board decided that 3BHK will cost Rs 1.5 crore, 2BHK Rs 1.28 crore, 1 BHK Rs 86 lakh and a two-room flat for EWS would remain unchanged at Rs 50 lakh. The board official had said persons applying under the demand survey would be given preference in allotment. The scheme was proposed to be made open for all.

How much they cost

Category : Price of flats : Response

HIG (3BHK): Rs 1.50 crore: 95 applications

MIG (2BHK): Rs 1.28 crore: 33 applications

LIG (1BHK): Rs 86 lakh: 12 applications

2 rooms flat (EWS): Rs 50lakh: 38 applications

NEW DELHI: NBCC , the winning bidder for Jaypee Infratech , is unwilling to take charge of the beleaguered firm’s real estate and road projects and is set to challenge the National Company Law Tribunal’s order , arguing it impacts the financial viability of its plan.

A key concern is the tribunal’s decision to get NBCC to pay Rs 350 crore to dissenting creditors — ICICI Bank, IFCI and SREI — over the next 12 months and also service all fixed deposit holders around Rs 120 crore, instead of Rs 29 crore proposed by the public sector company. NBCC is also peeved at having to bear the farmers’ additional compensation burden, something most homebuyers have done in case of other projects, sources told TOI.

At a meeting with lenders this week, NBCC chairman P K Gupta told bankers the PSU would like to take control of Jaypee’s assets only after getting clarity on these issues. This was despite lenders led by IDBI Bank pointing to the instances of Essar Steel and Jyothi Structures, where a monitoring agency was appointed to handle the affairs of the companies till the final disposal of appeals.

But NBCC sources said the cost of completing the entire realty project would be to the tune of Rs 6,500 crore, and only around Rs 3,000 crore is to come from homebuyers.

The special programmes on Covid-19 include Q&A sessions as provided by doctors and translated into Paniya dialect. Apart from that, we have ensured that at least three short audio clips go on air every half hour between programmes,” said Radio Mattoli station director Fr Bijo Thomas Karukappally.The messages in their own tribal dialects are expected to create awareness in many colonies where radio is still the only window to the outside world. Radio Mattoli authorities had distributed over 4,000 radio sets to Paniya tribal community, hence the reach of the messages is assured to a certain extent.District medical officer R Renuka said that they were trying to create and broadcast messages in other tribal dialects like the Kattunayikka dialect, considering the reach of the radio among the marginalized communities. “Besides, we will be providing training to tribal promoters in small batches to create awareness about the disease and the safeguards and precautions to be taken,” she added.Steps are being taken to improve the nutritional status of tribals by distributing food to needy families through Anganwadis, she said.",kozhikode,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/messages-in-tribal-dialects-on-air/articleshow/74719140.cms

SECUNDERABAD: The GHMC is laying Vacuum Dewatered Cement Concrete ( VDCC ) road at Vidyanagar underpass to prevent waterlogging and avoid frequent damages during monsoon. Officials said the underpass, which has been closed for the last one month, will open in a month’s time.

“The VDCC road will be laid after the shifting of utilities. The road is prone to waterlogging. Compared to regular bitumen roads, the VDCC road lasts longer as it helps prevent water stagnation and damage to the roads,” said a GHMC engineer.

The work was halted for a week following objections by South Central Railways (SCR). “As the road is being laid on the road under bridge (RUB), the SCR granted us permission to lay the road after we explained them the project,” said a GHMC official.

On Thursday, the underpass was filled with water after rain. “Even if it does not rain, the road is in pathetic condition. The work was halted for a week and resumed only four days ago,” said V Ramakanth, a resident of Vidyanagar.

Residents said that construction debris is strewn along the road, which leads to Shankar Mutt and Shivam Road. “Ever since the work began, commuters are having to take an alternative route, which is taking more time. I wanted to reach RTC Crossroads from Amberpet , as the underpass was closed I had to take a U-turn and go to Nallakunta crossroads to reach my destination. Authorities should complete the work on a war footing,” said Dayanand, a resident of RTC Crossroads.

Adding salt to injury is the laxity shown by the civic body as it has shown no concern or action to clear these encroachments that have turned the bay into an unhygienic spot, said commuters.

As the existing Central bus terminus spread on six acres cannot accommodate all city and suburban buses, two lanes of Rockins Road is earmarked for the buses to embark and disembark passengers. The platforms for passengers to wait for buses were sheltered and provided with seats.

However, a section of traders and hawkers have been encroaching the bus bay and they are using the platforms as stockyard to store their belongings and even to dump their waste. “Water receding from the waste accumulates along the bus bay’s platforms. The corporation prefers to ignore the unhygienic condition prevailing near the bus stand,” R Krishnanandam, a passenger at the Central bus stand said.

Though passengers have often complained to Ponmalai zone officials about the inconvenience caused to the public, who are in desperate need of shelter to safeguard them from the scorching weather, locals said that no solution was provided by the civic body. Corporation officials, when contacted, said necessary action will be taken.

After a two-day hearing where senior advocates from Congress and BJP were pitted against each other and which ended at 5.30pm on Thursday, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta adhered to the time-tested constitutional principles enunciated by the SC in the Bommai case to say, “State of uncertainty in the state of MP must be effectively resolved by issuing a direction for convening a floor test.”

In doing so, the bench steered clear of a carefully crafted web of warnings couched in interpretation of constitutional provisions cited by senior advocates A M Singhvi and Kapil Sibal . Appearing for Congress, the duo argued that holding immediate floor test would reward the rebel MLAs and BJP for the “constitutional sin” they had committed by engineering defections through allurement of ministerial posts to destabilise an elected government.

Congress’s arguments were vigorously countered by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Maninder Singh, who joined ranks with solicitor general Tushar Mehta to defend the governor’s decision to ask the Kamal Nath government to face a floor test. They said the governor acted out of the knowledge that 22 Congress MLAs had deserted the party and that had prima facie reduced the Nath government to a minority in the House.

After hearing the parties at length till 5.30pm, the bench pronounced the three-page order and laid down conditions under which the floor test would be conducted.

Sources told TOI that the speaker is likely to initiate steps for disqualification of the 16 MLAs, which would prevent them from being given ministerial berths if a new government is formed by BJP. In the 230-member House, Congress had 114 members and BJP 109. Congress had formed government with the help of two BSP MLAs, one SP MLA and four independents.

370,['20/03/2020'],"Coronavirus outbreak: 1,300 hand sanitisation points in place across south Delhi","Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: After the invocation of the epidemic clause of Section 376 of the Delhi Municipal Act, 1,374 hand sanitisation points with soap-water and alcohol sanitisers have been set up across south Delhi.

According to the latest progress report on hand sanitisation, till Wednesday, 271 residents welfare associations (RWAs), 595 eateries and restaurants, 41 banquet halls, 46 market associations, 23 malls and 398 hotels have operational points. The west zone is the poorest performer while Najafgarh leads in the drive. A health official said the Najafgarh zone was the most vulnerable due to the presence of the IGI Airport and a large number of hotels.

To strengthen the fight against novel coronavirus, the health department of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has issued a warning to all these entities to provide hand-washing infrastructure. “Enough time has been given and punitive actions under Indian Penal Code will be initiated now,” the official said.

Among the RWAs, 195 in the Najafgarh zone, 41 in the west, 25 in the central and just 10 in the south zone have complied with the direction. In terms of markets, too, both central and south zones are lagging with just five and six associations complying with the order.

Not all RWAs are happy with the directive. Chetan Sharma, who heads the Confederation of National Capitial Region RWAs, said these were voluntary organisations with no provision for funds. “The corporations should provide us resources and we can facilitate setting up such points. They charge taxes from us while we don’t have any provision for funds collection,” he added.

Rajeev Kakria of the GK-I RWA, said the commissioner should request, and not order, for the services RWAs provide due to SDMC’s shortcomings and inept functioning.

Under Section 376 of DMC Act, it is mandatory for all such entities, including malls, to set up proper sanitation facilities. The directions will remain applicable till March 31 for now.

“Violators will be deemed to have committed an offence under IPC 188 for causing danger to human life, health or safety and can be punished with a fine or an imprisonment of up to six months,” a senior official said.

Last time the provision was used was in 1997 to deal with the dengue outbreak when people were said “mosquito-genic” conditions on their premises could lead to severe repercussions.

371,['20/03/2020'],30 homes gutted as major fire breaks out in Wadarwadi slum,"Pune: About 30 tin-roof dwellings were completely destroyed in a major fire that broke out around 1.30am on Thursday in the Wadarwadi slum. No one was reported injured.

While the fire brigade and the police had no immediate clue about the source of the fire, residents of the slum suggested that a short circuit triggered the blaze. At least two LPG cylinders exploded, adding to the intensity of the fire that caused a major panic in the area as people ran away from their dwellings to safer areas. It all started suddenly, they said, while most of the residents were asleep.

The fire brigade had a tough time accessing the area, which is congested. They had to surround the scene of the fire three sides and use hose pipes to spray water on the blaze, which died around 5am.

“I woke up around 1.30am after hearing a blast-like sound, and found that people were running helter-skelter. I then found about the fire in the lane adjacent to the one I live in. Our homes were safe. But I ran towards the burning houses, which belonged to my relatives,” Hitesh Dhotre, a resident of Wadarwadi, told TOI.

Dhotre said that there was complete darkness in the area as power supply was cut off. “I first shifted children and elderly people to safety,” he said, adding, “Along with a few other youths, I climbed to the top of a house and started pouring water on the flames.”

He said the fire brigade too reached the spot and began dousing the fire three sides. “They brought the fire under control within an hour,” he added. .

Chief fire officer of Pune Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade, Prashant Ranpise, told TOI that the fire brigade received a call about the fire around 2am. “Three fire tenders from Aundh, Kasba and Nal Stop were immediately dispatched,” Ranpise said.

Ranpise too rushed the spot from the central office. “The area was congested. We had to park the fire tenders at a distance and reach the spot with hose pipes,” he said.

He said that fire spread due to LPG cylinders’ blasts. “At least two cylinders exploded,” Ranpise said.

The fire brigade used nine fire tenders, three Devdoot tenders and three water tankers. “We doused the fire around 5am. Our fire officer Shivaji Memane sustained minor injuries,” Ranpise said.

30 families lose everything

Parashuram Mane, whose house was completely destroyed in the fire, said he had to run away with his ailing son and family members as soon as the fire broke out. “Our neighbours alerted us as we were fast asleep. We just took an LPG cylinder with us and ran,” Mane said.

Mane said he just left with the clothes he was wearing. “I have lost everything. I am a daily wage worker. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, I hardly able get any work,” Mane said.

Another resident, Balamma Sidhallor, too lost everything. “Due to age I was not able to move fast. Someone lifted me and made me sit at a safe place. I have lost everything,” she said.

Santosh Dhotre too was busy in shifting damaged tins of his house. “I will have to work hard to build my house again,” he said.

The affected families have been shifted to the nearby Sant Ramdas school. “We have provided them with breakfast and lunch,” said a local resident.

372,['20/03/2020'],Nurses put themselves at risk to save lives,"Bengaluru: Medical staff tending to positive and suspected Covid-19 patients also undergo tests at regular intervals to ensure they are safe and healthy to continue tackling the crisis efficiently and they don’t inadvertently put others at risk. Many have minimised contact with family members, waiting till test reports confirm they have not picked up the infection.

“As a precaution, I didn’t visit my hometown, which is 140km from Bengaluru, for a at least month. I travelled there to check on my parents only after I tested negative,” said a male nurse in the 15-bed isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), which is in the forefront of the coronavirus fight. He told TOI that all staff members involved in the efforts tested negative two days ago.

Nurses, along with doctors and other medical staff, are on the front line of the battle against Covid-19, interacting with patients regularly to boost their morale, apart from handling hospital tasks.

“A psychiatrist also comes here every day to counsel patients and make sure they are psychologically fit. Patients naturally get upset when they learn they have tested positive. It’s crucial to reassure them and boost their morale. For that task, we need to be confident ourselves,” another nurse said.

As on Wednesday, there were 10 patients in the isolation ward. Five have tested positive.

Recently, medical education minister K Sudhakar started a Twitter campaign, #HealthWarriors, to provide praise and encouragement to healthcare workers.

Some staff members at RGICD complained that they had not been provided with hazmat suits; they were making do with gloves, masks and caps. But the articles are sent to the incinerator after single use.

Most nurses in the isolation are contract employees, lacking job security. “For all the hard work we are putting in and the risks we are taking, we hope to get absorbed in government service. The Covid-19 crisis is recent, we have been dealing with infectious diseases like tuberculosis and H1N1 for years now. Naturally, our families are concerned about our health,” said a nurse working in the isolation ward.

When Sudhakar visited the facility recently, nurses urged him to make their jobs permanent. “The minister assured us that he would look into the matter,” the nurse said.

373,['20/03/2020'],‘Animal husbandry must help in preventing death of ducks’,"ALAPPPUZHA: Duck farmers have demanded effective intervention from the animal husbandry department (AHD) to prevent the mass death of ducks in Kuttanad and Upper Kuttanad areas.

According to duck farmers, over 10,000 ducks died within two weeks in Kuttanad. Alappuzha Tharavu Karshaka Sangham leaders on Thursday conducted a news meet here and alleged that the AHD does not have a vaccine against Riemerella — a bacteria that leads to the death in young ducks. Sangham secretary K Samuel said that though the AHD does not have the vaccine, they are claiming that they have stocked adequate vaccine against this disease. “It is misleading information. The department has failed to prevent the death of ducks due to Riemerella. If a duck is affected by the infection, it will die within four days. The department takes many weeks to find the reason for the cause of death. When they found the reason, almost all affected ducks die. It should change, and the department should have a facility to prevent the mass death of ducks as soon as possible. They should give us a proper vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease,” he said.

Farmers first felt that avian flu was the reason for the unexpected death of ducks.

AHD officials collected samples of the dead ducks and tested at Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Manjadi near Thiruvalla. The lab identified that Riemerella was the reason for the death. The mass death of ducks was mainly reported in Thalavadi and Mankombu in Kuttanad.

The protesting labourers gathered near intensive care unit of the hospital and raised slogans against the hospital authorities. The protesters alleged that despite the coronavirus outbreak, the hospital authorities were disregarding their safety. While the permanent staff at the hospital were provided with masks and other safety gadgets, they were being ignored, the protesters alleged.

They also complained that the hospital was denying them benefits like provident fund. Moreover, they had not received their salaries for the last two months, the protesters said.

District secretary of CITU, Murugaiyan, along with functionaries of the trade union took part in the protest and demanded that the hospital authorities heed to the genuine demands of the contract workers. The protesting workers also stayed off from on Thursday.

375,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Kerala: How equipped are our pvt hospitals?,"KOCHI: The state government has asked all private hospitals to keep rooms ready to admit patients if there is Covid-19 community outbreak . District collectors of all districts held separate meetings with private hospital managements and informed them that they need to keep the rooms ready to treat any Covid-19 patient who comes to the hospital.Now, the private hospitals are in the process of setting up isolation rooms either in a block or floor of the hospital. Depending on the total number of rooms, the hospitals are keeping 2 to 20 isolation rooms ready. They are ensuring that separate entrance and lift are made available to the isolation rooms and the area where the isolation rooms will be set up has been quarantined. Some of the 500-plus bedded hospitals have kept two-three negative pressure rooms ready.In each hospital, there is a Covid-19 crisis management team consisting of doctors and managers who prepare contingency plans. They have been trained to handle isolation wards and are provided with personal protection equipment. Just like in the ICU, in the isolation room, the hospitals plan to maintain nurse-patient ratio of 1:1. The staff in the isolation will be posted for maximum 6 hours in a day.However, many small and medium private hospitals have raised concerns of lack of adequate personal protection equipment. “Many private hospitals don’t have adequate personal protection equipment and therefore, we have written to the respective district medical officers to provide the same,” said Kerala Private Hospital Association president Dr P K Mohamed Rasheed.Incidentally, though the district collectors during the meetings have made it clear that a person who comes to them with Covid-19 symptoms should be treated in the hospital and not shifted to a government hospital, there is some apprehension. “Most of our hospitals don’t have the facility or infrastructure to treat critical cases of Covid-19. Such patients we will have to shift to government medical colleges,” added Dr Rasheed.Who will bear the cost of treatment in private hospitals is another issue. Though some private hospitals had raised doubt over the cost involved for treating patients, there was no further discussion on it.“Government authorities have informed us that they would be first utilizing the government facilities. Once that’s filled up, then we will need to admit patients and we are ready for it,” said VPS Lakeshore CEO S K Abdulla.“At the moment, there is no patient load and therefore, if government facilities are exhausted, we can admit Covid-19 patients in our hospitals,” said Dr K G Alexander, chairman, Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode.Meanwhile, some of the hospitals have identified separate hostels where staff can be quarantined in case they do get infected. “We have kept a facility with 60 beds ready to accommodate our doctors and medical staff if they need to be quarantined,” said Dr M I Sahadulla, chairman and managing director, KIMS Healthcare Group.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74730579,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-749916,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/how-equipped-are-our-pvt-hosps/articleshow/74719202.cms

377,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare in Delhi: Rumours make people rush for bulk buying,"TimesView Taking precautions at a time like this is understandable. But there is a thin line that separates being cautious from succumbing to panic. Hoarding essentials because you believe they might not be available tomorrow is certainly on the dangerous side of that line, as the PM pointed out in his address to the nation. It only adds another chaotic element to an already grim situation. There is absolutely no reason to believe that we are running out of supplies of goods of daily consumption and hence no cause for panic buying. Remember, your hoarding up for a month could well make it impossible for someone who needs rice, wheat or dal for next week to find them.

NEW DELHI: Kusum Sehgal reached her local supermarket in Malviya Nagar, south Delhi, early in the morning. Usually, she replenishes her stock of groceries and other stuff at the beginning of the month, but on Thursday, she decided not to wait for another 10 days. “We have bought some extra pulses, aata, biscuits, vegetables, non-perishables and noodles. You never know when the shops will run out of these items and a lockdown is announced,” she explained.The coronavirus scare had led to panic buying in the past few days but on Thursday local markets across the capital witnessed a rare frenzy. Anxious people were propelled by rumours of markets closing down and the spectre of shortages crowded grocery shops and pharmacies. Ignoring clarifications by the Government and traders’ associations that there was no shortage, they bought stuff in bulk.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address later in the evening, assured citizens that there won’t be any shortage of supplies and appealed to them not to hoard. “Please don’t race to hoard these things. Just buy like you normally do. Panic buying is wrong,” he added.Shivam Singh, a resident of Munirka, said he was out to replenish his stock of insulin. “The government will not close chemist shops but it is better to keep your own stock as others may start hoarding leading to a shortage. You don’t know what may happen tomorrow,” he added.Defence Colony residents reported panic buying across grocery stores. “Home deliveries have been stopped by most shops as they don't have enough staff to meet the demand. Defence Store, Le Marche, Modern Bazaar etc have long queues as everyone fears a lockdown from tomorrow,” one of the residents said. Bhavreen Kadhari, a resident, she couldn’t find any milk. “I got a call from my niece who needed milk and it wasn’t available. There were long queues outside Krishna Super Marche,” she said.Harjinder Saroha of Vasant Kunj RWA said a lot of hoarding was being reported from grocery shops. “Whatsapp messages and rumours floating in social media have led people to believe that a shutdown will be announced. We are holding awareness sessions with our staff and maids,” he added. Kapil Kakkar from Jangpura Extension and Rajiv Kakria from GK-I acknowledged that people were stocking up. “Some vegetable vendors spread the scare that Azadpur Mandi may be closed down but a video from the mandi chairman cleared the air,” he added.Sanhita Mandal of C R Park said prices of some veggies had been arbitrarily hiked. Pinaki Das, who had gone out to buy some stuff at one of the local markets in the area said there was such a rush, with people scurrying around wearing masks, that he returned home.Many marts and bigger outlets reported that they were facing a shortage from wholesale vendors. Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) clarified that so far no trade association has taken any decision to close markets. “However, if the government takes any such decision, traders will comply,” said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of CAIT said.Many people who reached the shops late and couldn’t get the items they were seeking tried to order on online platforms with mixed results.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74721765,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-248993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rumours-make-people-rush-for-bulk-buying/articleshow/74720350.cms

Nonetheless, UDF went ahead with the budget, with an expected revenue of Rs 409.09 crore and expenditure of Rs 378.75 crore, and it mainly focuses on infrastructure development, including roads and other facilities. The ombudsman had stayed the council meeting on March 18 but there was no stay on budget presentation, said UDF.

Apart from improving roads and bridges in the city, and also renovating footpaths, the corporation would take up renovation of the Jawahar Stadium complex, for which Rs 10 crore was earmarked.

To improve the tourism potential of Kannur, ‘Night-less Kannur’ would be launched with an aim to set up a trade and shopping complex that would function round the clock. Besides attracting tourists, it would also ensure the safety of women out at night, said the deputy mayor who earmarked Rs 10 lakh as initial fund.

To provide a platform for Kudumbashree groups and farmers’ clubs to sell their products, a temporary facility would be opened at the Stadium Corner at an expense of Rs 10 lakh. Further, a storage building for fishermen will be constructed at Adikadalayi at an expense of Rs 5 lakh.

On the environmental front, the rejuvenation of Kakkad river is a major project for which Rs 1 crore would be spent. This includes eviction of encroachments and restoring the natural flow of the river.

Other important projects: Drinking water scheme at Chelora (Rs 1 crore), children’s security (Rs 3 lakh), Vijaykiran (to improve academic standard of students from the SC/ST community and provide them special coaching for SSLC and Plus Two – Rs 8 lakh), Nanma Award for initiatives in plastic-free campaign, waste management and organic farming (Rs 5 lakh).

The transport department is planning to stop issuing learner’s licences and also reduce the number of appointments being given out per day.

“In the meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, which was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other senior ministers and officials, it was decided that all Delhi government work will be segregated into two categories, essential and non-essential,” said an official. “All non-essential activities are likely to be suspended, which includes learner’s licences,” he said.

More than four lakh learner’s licences are issued by the transport department every year and more than half of the applicants are in the age group of 18 to 24. The tests also include touching biometric scans and online tests on touchscreen computers, which might get contaminated.

“It is very likely that issuance of learners licences would be deferred as it is very difficult to sanitise keyboards, mouse and touchscreens after each applicant takes their test. That is why it is better to defer this for a few weeks,” said a Delhi government official. “A decision is likely very soon.”

The official added that the number of appointments at RTOs may also be curtailed to avoid crowding.

“In spite of the outbreak of the global pandemic, there has been only a dip of about 10% in number of applicants coming to RTOs. As the schedules for driving tests, license renewals or registration certificate transfer etc. are made in advance and paid for, applicants don’t want to miss their appointments,” said an official of a busy RTO . “We are also apprehensive for our own health.”

One more person involved in the incident has surrendered before a judicial magistrate in the Madurai district court, after police closed in on him. The two have been identified as Malaisamy and Jayaram. The third accomplice has been identified as Yasin Mohammed Ali. Ali has been remanded in the Madurai Central Prison in judicial custody.

A low-intensity improvised explosive device (IED) went off in the house located in 1st East Cross Street in Anna Nagar on Monday. CCTV footage showed that two people, who had come on a bike had planted the bomb inside the gate and left. The bomb exploded a few minutes later. Police higher officials, including city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham had visited the house and conducted an inquiry.

Based on a complaint from Velusamy, a case was registered with the Anna Nagar police the same day under The Explosive Substances Act. Special police teams arrested Malaisamy and Jayaram. Police inquiries revealed that Malaisamy was involved in the murder of Velusamy’s son 15 years ago. He was convicted in the case and had served life sentence. After coming out of prison a year ago, he planned to take revenge on Velusamy, who had lodged a complaint against him in connection with the murder.

Around 3,000 textile shops associated with Bangalore Wholesale Cloth Merchants Association in Chikpet will close from March 22-25.“Every shop has 8-10 salespersons who come from various parts of the city,” said Prakash Pirgal, president of the association. “Besides Karnataka, many of our customers come from other states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. We have to consider interests of both sections, so we decided to close down for the time being.”Prakash pointed out that footfall has decreased by 60-70% over the past 10 days and shop owners are facing severe financial constraints.The Mysore Silk Cloth Market Council (Wholesale), which has around 550 shops under its umbrella in Chickpet, Jumma Masjid Road and Chowdeshwari Temple Street, shut shops from Thursday. The shops will remain closed till March 25.“Employees in our industry are from Bengal and Odisha. They are engaged in dyeing, printing and other activities. Embroidery is being done by a minority community from Varanasi. Taking into account all this, we decided to stay closed,” said Mahendra Jain, president.Businessman Mahipal Surana said the move is part of social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. “The voluntary shutdown, which comes in the run up to Ugadi festival, will affect the trading community severely. But we have to act in the larger interest of society,” Surana said.Other associations that have called for a closedown are: Bangalore Apparel Manufacturers Association (from March 20-22), Bharatiya Resham Udyog Sangh (March 20-25) and Bengaluru Jari Traders Association (March 20-24).Traders in other goods such as electrical, plywood, hardware and paper among others will remain open, but footfall has fallen drastically. “Shops are open, but there are hardly any customers.

384,['20/03/2020'],Kin of fishers stranded in Iran seek early repatriation,"Kanyakumari: The Centre’s reply in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that 255 Indians in Iran are among 276 Indians outside the country who have tested positive for Covid-19 has left the nearly 800 Indian fishermen and their relatives back home worried. They have demanded fast-tracking of their testing and repatriation. Though external affairs minister C Jayashankar had said last week that nearly 6,000 Indians are stranded in Iran, till date only less than 600 have been repatriated.

“We have been asking for help for 22 days, but not one official from the Indian Embassy has visited us,” Sahaya Ascar of Kanyakumari who is in Zero, Iran, told TOI through a WhatsApp audio message. “Minister Jaishankar said that fishermen are in the safe zone and hence the delay. My Iranian employer told me that 22 people on Kish Island are infected and at least two are dead,” said Jesu Rethnam of Ramanthurai who is one of the nearly 350 Indian fishermen on Kish Island.

“We are safe because we are confined to our boats for 22 days. What if one of us gets infected” he said. “Three days ago the embassy officials called us and asked for the list of provisions we need for our survival till we are repatriated,” fellow fisherman L John Britto, 34, of Thoothoor said. But on Wednesday the embassy officials called them to inform that they will not be able to make it. The nearly 800 Indian fishermen including more than 600 from Tamil Nadu – over 500 of them from Kanyakumari district – wondered if Government of India will reach out to them before they are infected.

Director of coastal peace and development, Kanyakumari district, father M Stephen said they had petitioned chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, MEA C Jaishankar and minister of state V Muraleedharan along with AIADMK Rajya Sabha MPs. On March 12 Kanyakumari MP H Vasanthakumar raised the issue in the parliament and also petitioned the Prime Minister. “But all these efforts have not yielded any results,” he said.

387,['20/03/2020'],Covid-19 outbreak: AIIMS doctors make sanitisers to beat shortfall,"NEW DELHI: One of the biggest challenges healthcare workers are facing in dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak is shortage of hand sanitisers and protective equipment, such as masks. They are in short supply in hospitals as well as wholesale markets.To deal with this crisis, which may worsen in the coming days, the infection control team at AIIMS has started preparing both alcohol-based handrubs and plastic face shields in their own lab.Dr Purva Mathur, professor of laboratory medicine at the hospital, who heads the infection control team, told TOI they have already prepared about 20 litres of hand sanitisers. Larger quantities of the alcohol-based handrub can be prepared at short notice, she said.“We don’t have a crisis in our hospital at present. But this exercise is being done to prepare the hospital for a crisis situation,” she added.According to Dr Mathur, making alcohol-based hand rub isn’t difficult. It requires Ethanol, Hydrogen peroxide, Glycerol and distilled water that are easily available in the market and the process of mixing them is clearly laid out by World Health Organisation. “Fifteen years ago, when commercial hand sanitisers weren’t available, this is how hospitals used to prepare them,” Dr Mathur explained.Doctors deputed for the screening of Covid-19 patients need to cover their face with masks to reduce the risk of contracting infection. In anticipation of scarcity of the crucial personal protective equipment, the AIIMS team has also been working to develop their own indigenous mask.“We have prepared a few using transparency film and foam at a fraction of the cost of the masks available in the market,” Dr Mathur said. “In the coming days, we would be able to prepare more of these protective items,” she added.While the common people have been advised to stay home to check the spread of Covid-19 and reduce the risk of contracting the infection, healthcare workers are on the ground to care for patients. However, this comes at a high risk of catching the infection. Data shows 1,700 medical workers have been infected by Covid-19 in China and at least six have succumbed to it.Though no healthcare worker has been affected in India, the anxiety level among the staff at hospitals such as Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia, where coronavirus patients are being treated, is high.

NEW DELHI: Indian Railways on Thursday announced it had cancelled 84 more trains — which would not be operating between March 20 and March 31 — owing to the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country.

Coronavirus in India live updates

Thursday’s announcement took the total number of cancelled trains to 155. Officials said that only low-occupancy trains had been cancelled, with the passenger occupancy dropping drastically over the last few days.

A railway official, working at the ticket refund office at New Delhi Railway Station, had to be admitted to Northern Railway Central Hospital in Paharganj as precaution after she allegedly hosted a few Italian nationals at her residence.

“The woman lived in the railway colony and a few Italians visited her house in the last few weeks. At present, she is a suspected case. She had also visited the railway refund office after hosting them several times,” said a railway official, who did not wish to be identified.

Deepak Kumar, CPRO, Northern Railways, said the woman had been sent to the hospital for a check-up and all others, who came in contact with her, have been asked to be in isolation. “The office is being sanitised. It has, however, not been sealed yet,” Kumar said.

A senior railway official said a large number of train tickets had also been cancelled over the last few days. “The total tally of cancelled trains all over India, due to low occupancy, is 155 pairs, including a few passenger trains,” he added.

Railways have individually informed all passengers who had booked tickets for the trains that now stand cancelled. “No cancellation fee will be charged for these trains. Passengers will get 100% refund,” the official added.

The official, however, said that EMU, DEMU and MEMU inter-state local trains are yet to be cancelled, despite the drop in occupancy rate. “Even though the occupancy rate for these trains and footfall at stations has dropped, they are still running at the moment. They may be cancelled if required,” he added.

Northern Railway said there is also likely to be a 50% reduction in railway staff, with the majority of workforce asked to focus on sanitising trains and stations. “All trains are being disinfected and fumigated prior to a journey. Instructions have also been issued to frequently disinfect and sanitise points of passenger contact, including rails, doors, windows, snack tables, lift buttons and seats,” the official added.

It also suspended, with immediate effect, all community devotional practices and gatherings including the Way of the Cross, ‘ Santos Passos ’, processions, domiciliary visits of the statue of Our Lady, retreats and Lenten dramas.The archdiocese has further advised that marriage celebrations with large attendance should be postponed to a safer time and funerals be conducted only with close family.Stating that this unprecedented situation called for unprecedented measures, archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao, in a circular issued on Thursday, strongly advised children, people above 60 years, those with common cold symptoms, and those having co-existing ailments not to attend Mass. People who have travelled from any virus-hit areas after March 1, have also been advised to not attend.The circular discourages the faithful from daily Mass unless it is strictly necessary and to keep a distance of not less than one metre from one another.Priests should take sanitary precautions before distributing communion and should continue to celebrate Mass even without a congregation, the archbishop said, while also instructing the faithful to receive communion on the hand.“Wherever possible, the celebration of the Mass is to be live-streamed or recorded and then broadcast,” he stated.Ferrao also advised that churches and chapels be kept open during the day, at least for a few hours, so that the faithful can pray privately while taking all the necessary precautions.“All meetings of association and church groups are to be suspended, barring those that are necessary for urgent consultation or decision-making and for charitable activities,” the circular stated.Earlier on Thursday, the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima at Don Bosco, Panaji , announced that its Blessed Sacrament chapel will remain closed till further notice.

In Virudhunagar, for example, the collector has directed the fireworks industry not to employ more than 50 people at a time in an unit.Madurai District Tiny and Small Industries Association (Maditssia) former president V S Manimaran said that this was going to be a big problem for micro and tiny industries that employ over 100 employees in small places.“Almost all our industries have bank loans which have to be repaid and putting work on hold would mean difficulty in making repayments. The government should come forward to give us at least six months for repayments and make interest waivers on these loans,” he said.Many such units have people working in close quarters without even one feet distance between them in work places. “Downsizing the workforce would be a solution but only to some extent, but this too would cause problems,” said B Muruganantham, president Maditssia.Meanwhile, all of them have started stressing on the importance of handwashing frequently, especially when the workers go out for lunch or use toilets.There are a few garment industries which employ over 1,000 people and industrialists say that the government should prescribe some norms like salaries for workers in case of a total lockdown as their business and workers would stand to suffer if some sought of grant is not assured to them, in the wake of Covid-19 crisis.Sources say that random checks would be conducted in the next few days to ensure if they are adhering to the norms.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/social-distancing-a-challenge-for-micro-and-small-scale-industries/articleshow/74720365.cms

On the other hand, activists are seeking government intervention.Deputy labour commissioner N N Itkari said there are no provisions in the law for financial aid to workers who lose their employment in the wake of such an emergency. “Such a situation has happened for the first time and we do not have a backup for it. However, if the government announces relief, we can implement it.”Subhash Lomte, general secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Hamal Mapadi Sanghatna, said the government has completely ignored the catastrophe that has struck the workers in the unorganised sector.“Government’s own data states that only 6% to 7% of the total workforce is in government sector or are on the payroll of private organisations. This shows that the remaining 93-94% are in the unorganised sector. However, even as industry is hit by cessation in exports and imports due to the coronavirus outbreak, the workers in unorganised sector are worst hit,” he said.Lomte said the government should ask industries and employers to provide sustenance allowance to the such workers until the situation is back to normal and that they can be engaged in extra work later.Rakhamaji Jadhav of Jadhav Mandap and Decorators, who provides event management services for weddings and conferences, said the coronavirus scare has led to the collapse of the event management business.“March 10 was an auspicious day for weddings but the closure of wedding halls and ban on gatherings in the wake of covid-19 threat has dealt a blow to the business.

The order comes into effect from midnight of March 20-21.Director of health services Jose D’Sa issued the order on Thursday evening in the view of the novel coronavirus Though the state has not reported a Covid-19 case till Thursday, it is feared that mass gatherings could lead to the spread of the disease since Karnataka and Maharashtra have detected cases.On Wednesday, health minister Vishwajit Rane had expressed the need to shutdown shopping malls. Many pubs have already halted operations, while cinema halls are closed till March 31.A health official said that regular bazaars will continue as their closure would inconvenience citizens in buying groceries and other items.The weekly markets held in the talukas are thronged by people from adjacent villages as well as from across the border who come to shop or sell vegetables, fruits and grains, the official said.The wide range of relatively cheaper items sold at these markets are much sought after by people.This is mostly seen at the Mapusa and Valpoi weekly bazaars, he said.Authorities have not ordered the closure of restaurants, but owners have been advised to follow social distancing as a preventive measure, he added.Pernem takuka is popular for the fruits and vegetables that are sold by vendors from neighbouring Banda and Sawantwadi in Maharashtra, while vendors from Karwar in Karnataka sell their wares at Canacona.With regards to coaching classes, he said, it was brought to their notice that some coaching classes are continuing even after schools and colleges were shut down and exams were postponed.On March 14, chief minister Pramod Sawant had directed the closure of all educational institutes, pubs, clubs, gyms, casinos, cinema halls, spas and boat cruises till March 31.Sawant had also urged tourists not to visit Goa until March 31, when the state government would conduct a review of the situation, before deciding on the future course of action.

The Act existed till Bikaner state still it merged with the Union of India and later in Rajasthan.The Act named ‘Khatarnak Phelne wali Bimario ka Act (Infectious disease Act 1927) was passed by the Bikaner state assembly in view of the spread of two diseases—plague and cholera — under the reign of Maharaja Ganga Singh (1880-1943). The Act says it will be applicable once the state notified the outbreak or pre-empt the spread of any infectious disease in the state or the neighbouring state.Documents at Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner suggest that how the Act helped the state preventing its people from the spread of any infectious disease till it was merged with India. “It shows the wit and commitment of the ruler who ruled the state close to 90 years ago by granting special powers to health workers and enforcement agencies to screen any suspected patient of any infectious disease,” said Mahendra Khadgawat, director of Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner.At present, the country has banned the entry of foreigners and sealed its borders as an effective tool to stop the spread. The erstwhile rulers have also on occasions formed check-posts at borders screening the entry of outsiders, health workers at public places including the railway station, bus station, kutchery (Court) and other public places. “Great emphasis has been laid on creating awareness on the infectious disease by pasting posters, banners and verbal announcements. I don’t see any parallel of this visionary Act in India during the time the country was taking on Britishers,” said Khadgawat.The country is yet to make the violators of stringent measures as a punishable offence, the former rulers have granted the special powers under the Act to run a legal case against them.

397,['20/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Delhi: Hospitals may pool resources for ICU needs,"NEW DELHI: Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, causes mild symptoms in 80% of the patients. But 20% of them suffer from complications, mainly respiratory distress, which may require ICU support. Does Delhi have enough ICU support, especially ventilators, to save them?“It depends on the number of cases that can’t be predicted. However, we are fully prepared to deal with any situation,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of AIIMS, which has more than 200 ICU beds at its main hospital. “All hospitals have been advised to postpone non-emergency or routine surgeries so that the current strength of ICU beds can be utilised to meet increased demand, if needed,” he added.In addition, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar, also run by AIIMS, and the Trauma Centre have earmarked 125 and 20 beds, respectively, for acute management. Of this, 45 are ICU beds with ventilator facilities. “The number of ICU beds can be scaled up further by pooling in critical-care beds from other departments. We have a plan in place,” Dr Guleria said.The Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia hospitals, two other central government-run facilities, have also been asked to be ready to deal with any emergency situation. Together, they have more than 200 ICU beds.Delhi government runs 33 tertiary-care hospitals with a total bed capacity of 10,059, out of which 3.5% have ventilator facilities. Recently, the government told the high court that 63 ventilators were being procured at 15 hospitals, and it would be completed in six months.Mechanical ventilators help patients breathe, or breathe for them. They are critical in the management of severe Covid-19 cases because the infection, once it reaches the lower respiratory tract, damages the lungs. “In severe cases, complications can be limited to symptoms such as shortness of breath and low-oxygen saturation.

399,['20/03/2020'],Region gets highest ever representation in RS,"CLEARED SKHER

Aurangabad: Marathwada has now got its highest-ever representation in the Rajya Sabha after the BJP, Congress and NCP each nominating a member from region.

Bhagwat Karad of BJP, Rajiv Satav of Congress and Fouzia Khan of NCP are from Marathwada. They have been elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha.

At present, only industrialist Rajkumar Dhoot, whose third-term as RS member is slated to end next month, was the representative from Marathwada in the upper house of the Parliament.

Karad, former Aurangabad mayor, is considered the OBC face from Marathwada. With former minister Pankaja Munde Palwe, another OBC leader from the region, facing defeat in assembly election, Karad’s elevation is being seen as BJP’s move to give representation to the community.

Satav, an ex-MP from Hingoli, did not contest the last Lok Sabha election but was granted the RS nomination. A former youth wing president of the Congress, he is known to be close to the top Congress leadership.

Fouzia Khan, who hails from Parbhani, is considered a loyal member of the NCP and served as the minister of state for school education in Maharashtra. She is hailed as progressive and well educated woman leader within the Muslim community.

Sharad Advant of advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad said the region should benefit from the representation in the Rajya Sabha. “The elected leaders must ensure that the issue of developmental backlog of Marathwada is addressed. The necessary advocacy on pending issues is expected from leaders,” he said.

Earlier, Janardan Waghmare (2008- 2014) and Gopalrao Patil (1994-2000), both from Latur, were Rajya Sabha member of NCP and BJP, respectively. Rajni Patil from Beed was also Rajya Sabha member from 2013 to 2018.

In his petition, P Vellaisamy, who cultivates crops on four acres of land at Kansapuram village near Watrap, stated that the land is dependent on the Seevaneri irrigation tank. Surplus water from the tank would flow through the Nondi Virisal channel.

He stated that government had allotted Rs 5lakh for the construction of a check dam at the channel during 2018-19. However, since it was constructed using substandard materials, the dam was damaged within three months and is currently in a dilapidated condition.

This is the first of its kind in the state, as the three-year-old study and research brought them success in commercially cultivating this wonder mushroom which is popular for healthy food supplements that have already caught up across the world.

Cordyceps Militaris can be added to tea, coffee, cereals, juices and much more. Its medicinal use has already been documented in Tibetan and Chinese medicines.

Two young entrepreneurs, founder and chief operations officer Raghu O Nair and co-founder, Jayakrishnan K had started Pournami Agritech in Chandranagar three years ago. With extensive study and research, they could successfully commercially cultivate Cordyceps Militaris in Palakkad.

“Through our research, with the help from various other agencies and experts, we have started tissue culture and commercial cultivation of Cordyceps Militaris. It is first of its kind in Kerala. We are now planning to take this initiative in phases. In the first phase, we had our first successful harvest. In the next phase, with the help of Kerala Startup Mission, we are seeking investment for rolling out value-added nutraceutical products to make it available to a larger segment of people”, said Raghu.

“We are also planning to collaborate with various research organizations for the research and development of this rare herb. Hopefully, the world of Cordyceps will pave the way towards innovative and healthy products,” they said.

Meanwhile, the fungus was first reported from Kerala in 2013 by T Santhosh Kumar , assistant professor, Regional Agricultural Research Station, Pilicode, while conducting a research on managing the coconut root grub (Leucopholis canephora). It was later confirmed as a species belonging to the Cordyceps genus also known as caterpillar fungus.

“Preliminary studies conducted at the Regional Cancer Centre showed that the species is capable of suppressing tumour cells and inhibiting the proliferation of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) cells. Thus, there is every possibility of using the species to develop immunity enhancement, anti-ageing and anti-fatigue functional food on a commercial basis,” said Kumar.

“Asking people to wear masks and sanitize their hands while coming to a funeral is also not possible. Self-restraint will be the best option in such situations,” said health department sources, because not many would be ready to listen to rules and regulations at funerals.

On Wednesday, too, there was no challan for drunk driving. According to the Delhi Police data on drunk driving, only six challans were issued on March 14 against 89 on February 14. From March 15-18, 11 challans were issued while 176 were recorded during the same period in February.Delhi Traffic Police has already issued instructions regarding novel coronavirus for the safety of its personnel and motorists. Besides extra masks and hand gloves, the traffic police personnel were also given extra straws for using alcometers, said an officer. “We had even asked our personnel to wash hands if possible or use gloves in the presence of a suspect. They have been instructed not to interact without a mask especially during an alcometer test,” said a senior officer. The cops even assured everybody that a new straw was being used for each check.But in most cases the drivers still refused to let the cops bring the alcometer close to their mouth. Considering the scare among people and the spread of the infection, “we have now decided to keep the checks limited to the drivers found to be driving dangerously,” the officer said.A spotting team will be placed at various locations across the capital to identify suspected drivers and alert another team that will be stationed a few metres ahead to flag down the violators. “A fresh straw will be placed in the alcometer and the policemen operating it will put on gloves and masks in front of every suspect to assure them before conducting a check,” said another officer.Traffic cops have also asked the liquor shops to advise buyers not to drive after drinking.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74722787,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-209813,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-breath-test-unless-driver-visibly-drunk/articleshow/74720407.cms

NEW DELHI: A Romanian has been arrested for allegedly duping people by installing skimming devices and cameras at unguarded ATMs in south Delhi areas. His act was exposed after an advocate from Greater Kailash-I informed police about the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 40,000 from his debit card.

The accused has been identified as Claudiu Cosmin (29). According to police, Cosmin and his associate Danial came to India in February 2019. They would install skimming devices and cameras to steal the card and PIN details at several unguarded ATM kiosks in south Delhi areas. They stole data of at least 50 people.

“The accused managed to withdraw about Rs 15 lakh from the cards which were cloned from Greater Kailash, Malviya Nagar, CR Park, Vasant Kunj and other areas,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police, South. Eight cloned cards, a laptop, a mobile phone, masks and other devices were recovered. Danial is yet to be arrested.

NAGPUR: A former sarpanch, who allegedly abducted two members of the panchayat samiti to ensure the victory of his wife in by-election to the post of deputy sarpanch at Bokhara , are now finding themselves in the dock as the cops have slapped charges of kidnapping against him and his aides.

The was held on March 16 in which Sneha, wife of former village head Ranjitsingh Chavan, defeated Javed Shaikh of the Congress party by a wafer thin margin of two votes.

Chavan was so desperate to get Sneha elected as deputy sarpanch that he scripted a reel life kidnapping drama and allegedly abducted two village panchayat members, Shakeel Anwar Shaikh and Vinod Parte, from different places and forced them to stay at a lodge at Mouda without mobile phones till the election result was announced.

Chavan was helped by his accomplices, brother Abhijeet , Shubham Dixit and Dilip Barde.

Sneha contested the election as an independent candidate and emerged victorious against Javed, who was supported by Shakeel Shaikh and his group.

The post was lying vacant after the resignation of former deputy village headwoman Varsha Tayade.

Narrating the chain of events, Shaikh, cousin of Javed, said he was about to leave for voting when Chavan, his brother Abhijeet and others came in a car to his saloon at Mankapur Chowk and asked to be with them for a meeting with Parte at his liquor bar on the ring road.

Shaikh said, “I did not oppose Chavan. After picking up Parte, we were told that there would be a meeting with the current sarpanch Lalla Bhai . Meanwhile, Chavan left us near powergrid and Shubham Dixit joined.”

Shaikh said, “My and Parte’s mobile phones were snatched. We were taken to a lodge at Mouda and locked up. There was no other way to contact others to seek help. Abhijeet also started threatening with knife which scared us.”

Shaikh and Parte were released at 5pm on March 17 after the result was declared. “We were threatened of dire consequences if we reported the matter to police. However, we gathered courage and lodged a police complaint,” he said.

He also said the sarpanch will now lodge a complaint with the authorities concerned to cancel the election.

Mankapur police have registered an offence of kidnapping against Chavan brothers, Dixit and Barde. Police have so far arrested Barde and launched a search to nab the other accused.

418,['20/03/2020'],Choreographer posts Covid-19 status on FB,"Bengaluru: Choreographer Diya Naidu from Bengaluru went public on Thursday with her Covid-19 infection, saying her throat swab test confirmed it and is now waiting for the blood test result. The state government declares a person Covid-19 positive only after the second confirmatory test.

She returned from Switzerland on March 9 and was admitted to the isolation ward of ESI Hospital, Indiranagar on Wednesday night.

Diva posted on Facebook: “I am sorry to do this here. The BBMP is supposed to but seeing how unprepared we are I'm trying to make sure. I have tested positive for Covid-19 and am in hospital currently. I was barely symptomatic... In case you have come into contact with me or someone who has met me - please quarantine yourself.”

She added: “The only thing I got was total loss of smell - no cough or cold or fever or shivering - none of the typical symptoms yet.”

Several people asked Diya why she didn’t go into home isolation. But many appreciated her for going public when there is fear, stigma and discrimination of Covid-19 suspected cases and patients.

Diya told TOI on phone that when she returned to Bengaluru, no one told her about home isolation. “The focus was only on countries like Italy, Dubai, the US and the UK. I called the helpline number posted at the airport, but couldn’t connect despite multiple calls. I went to a private hospital to check if I should be tested. But the general physician told me I would be tested if I developed symptoms.”

“I went out on work for one day. I took part in a fund raising activity. I was an audience member at a public event on March 12. I have told the organisers that I’ve tested positive,” she said.

On Thursday evening, India Foundation for the Arts (IFA) sent a note stating that an audience-member at the Mir Mukhtiyar Ali Concert it had organised on March 12 has tested positive and all those present must take precautions and contact local health authorities if they experience any symptoms.

“Diya Naidu is a suspected Covid-19 patient and was admitted in our hospital for quarantine purpose. Her test results are awaited,” a doctor from ESI Hospital, Indiranagar, said.

Firm says employee is positive

Kronos Incorporated, a provider of workforce management and human capital management cloud solutions, said on Thursday that one of its employees in Benglauru tested positive.

“We can confirm that an employee from Bengaluru region has a positive diagnosis following travel outside India and hasn’t come to our office since February-end. We communicated this to Kronites in that region and the building landlord, ensuring that the employee did not come to the office,” it said.

419,['20/03/2020'],US-Kolkata ticket costs Rs 1.6 lakh ahead of flight ban,"KOLKATA: International flight fares shot up on Thursday after the government announced a ban on all international flights from Sunday. Though the embargo is for a week, aviation industry sources said it could be extended if the number of coronavirus cases in India rose.On Thursday evening, fares were sky-high with a one-way trip costing as much as a return journey. A French national bought a ticket to Paris for Rs 64,000 while a Swiss national had to cough up Rs 67,000 to travel to Zurich. For a German engineer, the trip to Dusseldorf was even more expensive at Rs 74,000. As the handful of foreigners who have been stuck in India scramble for a seat on the last few flights out of Kolkata before the shutdown, the fares could escalate still more.Return flights have already touched astounding levels with Indians desperate to return before the skies shut. A student studying in Purdue in the US bought an economy class ticket from Chicago to Kolkata for a whopping Rs 1.6 lakh! It’s not just west-bound flights whose fares are sizzling. A Kiwi citizen of Indian origin bought a ticket to Auckland for Rs 67,000 while another who lives in Brisbane paid Rs 74,000 for the flight home. “Airlines are making the most out of people’s desperation,” said a travel agent.At Kolkata airport though, the international flight ban didn’t come as a surprise. The advisories that led to gradual shutdown of flights from EU, the UK, Turkey, Malaysia and Philippines followed by the roll-out of compulsory quarantine on Gulf flights had hinted at the shutdown.“The daily flight count had come down from 35 to 16. The passenger count had dwindled from 4,500 a day to fewer than 1,500. Retail stores and food & beverage outlets had begun to shut. One of the two duty-free outlets had closed as well. Flights were operating half empty,” recounted an airport official, adding that the immediate challenge would be to maintain an empty facility and bear the expenses with no cash-flows.While the shutdown appeared inevitable, it is the long journey to revival that has everyone worried now. Though all airlines have assured the airport authorities they will return after the havoc caused by the pandemic is over, they are unlikely to restart operations with the usual number of weekly flights.“It has to be a slow ramp-up. Passengers will initially be reluctant to travel. Students and businessmen will be the first to fly but it will take time for leisure travellers to regain confidence.

However, thanks to the steady flow of patients, hospitals, specially the state-run ones, continue to remain crowded. This, doctors said, could pose a threat to the whole concept of social distancing to prevent transmission of the virus.“The Karnataka government has already come up with a circular, asking only patients who need emergency care to visit government hospitals over the next two weeks. We hope the Bengal government comes up with similar restrictions to decongest hospitals,” said a senior doctor at SSKM Hospital. The hospital sees a footfall of nearly 14,000 OPD patients daily on an average. The rest of the four medical colleges in the city get 6,000 to 7,000 OPD patients each daily. Relatives accompanying them add to the crowd.“We are trying to limit the number of visitors and OPD patients. For example, for patients with common illness, we are giving them medicine for one month and asking them not to come back during this period unless there is an emergency,” said Raghunath Misra, medical superintendent and vice-principal (MSVP) at SSKM Hospital.NRS Medical College and Hospital has already started restricting the number of visitors to the hospital by allowing a patient to be accompanied by only one relative. Other measures are expected to follow. “Meanwhile, we have started our fever clinic from Thursday where all patients with flu symptoms are isolated and checked so that they do not mix with other patients. We have five ventilators in the RCU reserved in case they are needed to treat Covid-19 patients,” said Saurabh Chattopadhyay, MSVP at NRS Medical College and Hospital.The Calcutta National Medical College (CNMC) administrators will meet on Friday to find out ways to reduce crowding on the hospital premises and also chalk out a roadmap to tackle suspected Covid-19 patients. “About 80% of patients who throng the OPD in government hospitals complain of common condition like abdomen pain. If we can attend to only 20%, who really need immediate medical attention, during this crisis, the crowd will thin down significantly,” said a CNMC doctor.RG Kar has already held rounds of meeting on decongesting the hospital premises. The hospital will start segregation of patients with influenza symptoms. The authorities are also mulling planned intervention including scheduled surgeries. “The kind of crowd in government hospitals is a serious threat as far as transmission of coronavirus is concerned. Even our doctors are at risk. We have a few plans lined up to tackle the patient rush but we cannot implement them unless the directive comes from the health department,” said an administrator at RG Kar Medical College.While most of these hospitals have kept their isolation wards ready, they need uninterrupted supply of PPE (personal protective equipment) for healthcare workers who will deal with such patients.

423,['20/03/2020'],Need to turn tide on deforestation in Nagpur,"Representative image

NAGPUR: Forests cover one third of the earth’s land mass, performing vital functions around the world. Around 1.6 billion people, including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures, depend on forests for their livelihoods, medicines, fuel, food and shelter.

Forests are the most biologically-diverse ecosystems on land, home to more than 80% of the terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. Yet, despite all of these priceless ecological, economic, social and health benefits, global deforestation continues at an alarming rate.

The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed March 21, the International Day of Forests in 2012. The organizers are the United Nations Forum on Forests & Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with governments, the collaborative partnership on forests and other relevant organizations in the field.

The day raises awareness about importance of all types of forests. On each international day of forests, countries are encouraged to undertake local, national and international efforts to organize activities involving forests and trees, such as tree planting campaigns.

The theme for each international day of forests is chosen by the collaborative partnership on forests. The theme for 2020 is forests and biodiversity. António Guterres , secretary general of United Nation, says, “2020 has been referred to as a ‘Nature Super Year’ and must be the year where we turn the tide on deforestation and forestry loss.”

Over the past 25 years, the annual rate of net global deforestation has slowed by over 50%, which is a credit to the efforts of governments and other stakeholders working to sustainably manage forests. Yet, vast areas of forest continue to be lost. Our global environment is being degraded by our unsustainable choices. The way we consume natural resources is accelerating biodiversity loss and exacerbating climate change.

Forests, their sustainable management and use of resources, including in fragile ecosystems, are key to combating climate change, and to contributing to the prosperity and well-being of current and future generations. Forests also play a crucial role in poverty alleviation and in the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

One average grown up tree sequesters 0.2 mt of CO2 per year and releases 0.118 mt of oxygen per year. Humans need oxygen for their survival at the same time trees inhale the CO2 released by the human beings.

Our ancient literature says, “Save trees, they will save you.” An ordinary person in a hospital requires 3 oxygen cylinders per day whose cost is Rs2,100 per day. If average life expectancy of a person is 65 years, every human is consuming oxygen worth Rs5 crore over his lifetime. Hence, it is too precious to lose forests.

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday met principals of 16 Delhi University colleges , which are partially funded by the government, to discuss infrastructure expansion and improvement of facilities.

A day earlier, Sisodia had met officials of 12 DU colleges fully funded by Delhi government. These colleges are yet to receive funds from the government and have been unable to pay salaries to their staff for over two months. A principal with one of the colleges said, “There is no clarity yet on when we will get the funds. The deputy CM said the file is under consideration.”

The 16 colleges included Shivaji, Motilal Nehru, Rajdhani, Kamala Nehru, Gargi and Delhi College of Arts and Commerce. These colleges get 95% of their funds from UGC and 5% from Delhi government.

Kalpana Bhakuni, officiating principal of KNC, said, “The meeting with the deputy CM focused on improving higher education. We were asked our issues and promised all support.” Rajiv Chopra, principal of DCAC, said, “The deputy CM told us that we should look at expanding the college’s infrastructure.”

However, many principals said that there was no concrete talk about governing bodies, despite it being a contentious issue between the government and the university.

Meanwhile, National Democratic Teachers Front DU Executive Council member VS Negi sent a letter to vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi alleging that the meeting violated autonomy of the colleges. “The university should ensure that there is no political interference in the formation of the GBs,” he added.

Many are worried about not receiving funds despite the formation of GBs. Sujit Kumar, professor at Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, who has not been paid for the past two months, said, “Salaries of staff should not be linked to GB formation. It is we who are suffering in the fight between two political parties.”

The four men accused Kamthe of giving them ‘dirty looks’ over the past few days,” senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad from the Kondhwa police said.

The officer said the four men were armed with sickles. “They attacked Kamthe and Pethe with the sickles and chairs before fleeing the spot,” he added.

Sub-inspector Nilesh Chavan from the Khadi Machine chowkey said “The injured victims were rushed to a private hospital in Hadapsar. We recorded their statements and inspected the crime scene after receiving information of the incident from the city police control room.”

Two of the four assailants, Tushar Dukare (21) and Pratik Tilekar (20), were arrested on Wednesday, Chavan said, adding that a search was on for the two others.

“One of the absconding suspects is a minor with a criminal record. Dukare and Tilekar were arrested on the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt of the Indian Penal Code, among others,” he said.

Those activities categorised as ‘essential’ will, however, continue.These and other decisions were taken in a joint meeting of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal with other Delhi ministers and senior government officers at Raj Niwas.The categorisation of ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ services is likely to be done by Friday, the chief minister said.The joint meeting of top government functionaries and senior officers witnessed the health department making a detailed presentation on the present status of coronavirus spread in Delhi, action taken by various authorities, availability of quarantine facilities and hospital beds and proposed measures to contain Covid-19.In a statement issued after the meeting, Baijal said directions were issued to make thermal screening mandatory at public places and efforts would be made to scan every person going in public space while traffic police have been told to stop breath analyser test. Hotels that have the facility to quarantine people have also been directed to waive the tax on rooms.Neighbours and RWAs should be informed about those under home-quarantine in a residential complex and fine on spitting in public places is to be strictly enforced.Briefing the media, Kejriwal said the Delhi government was taking all relevant measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. “We have a capacity of 768 beds installed at the quarantine facilities till now, with only 57 beds that are currently occupied. We have 550 isolation beds in the Delhi government hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, out of which 40 beds have been occupied. There are 95 beds available in the central government hospitals, out of which 67 beds have been occupied by suspected Covid-19 patients. We are also mapping the requirements of all the government and private hospitals in Delhi, and we will issue directions that all the machinery and ventilator facilities in these hospitals should be in working conditions,” the CM said.“Following reports that many people are escaping from quarantine facilities, we have started stamping all those who have been advised to self-quarantine themselves. This is a very dangerous situation as they infect others who deliberately or non-deliberately come in their contact. If they don’t abide by the do's and don’ts, we will have to take strict measures against them, including filing FIR or taking them into custody,” Kejriwal said.He added that while all restaurants in Delhi shall remain closed till March 31, home-deliveries and take-aways will continue. “All educational institutions have also been shut down, including ITIs, polytechnics, universities, colleges, and schools till March 31 for both teaching and non-teaching staff,” he said.The CM appealed to people to “comprehend the intensity” of the situation and avoid stepping out of their homes, especially senior citizens. “Stay at home as much as you can. Private sector institutions should also allow employees to work from home. Senior citizens are the most vulnerable of all and they should avoid going out,” he said.Responding to reports of people hoarding eatables, Kejriwal said panic buying should be avoided. “It will only worsen the situation. Both the Centre and state governments have been working in close coordination. There has been no community transmission until now and if we continue to work like this, we will be able to control the situation,” Kejriwal said.The LG has also directed officials to explore the possibilities of running mobile vans in residential areas to sell essential commodities of daily use and medical items.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74721798,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178940,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-capital-is-closing-down-to-shut-out-virus/articleshow/74720453.cms

KOLKATA: Ships whose last ports of call have been in China, Italy and 13 other countries will be quarantined for 14 days before being allowed to use the facilities of the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust (SPMPT). These restrictions started on Thursday and will continue till March 31. The decision will be reviewed thereafter. SPMPT had started taking precautions since January 29 and screened 100% of the crew of all ships entering the ports of Kolkata, Haldia and Budge Budge. Shore leaves for crews were also cancelled.

“The list of the restricted countries includes China (including Hong Kong), Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain, Germany, United Kingdom, Turkey, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Malaysia and the Philippines. Crews of ships arriving from ports in other countries will continue to be screened. They will not be allowed shore leaves though the ships will be allowed to berth at the ports. Shipping agents will also take adequate precautions while boarding vessels that berth at the ports,” a senior SPMPT official said.

Restriction on movement of ships to China had affected the transportation of iron ore from Haldia. The latest decision to quarantine more vessels is likely to affect movement of other cargo as well. This will happen as the turnaround time for ships will go up. However, the restrictions are necessary for the safety of port officials and workers. Though isolation facilities have been created at the port hospitals in Kolkata and Haldia, no port user, seaman or employee has tested positive for Covid-19 till now.

Port authorities have also confirmed that the country’s first woman marine pilot, who is now employed at SPMPT, has tested negative to Covid-19. The woman had travelled to Sri Lanka on vacation and had returned with certain symptoms suspected to have been displayed upon contracting the virus. She was admitted to the Beliaghata ID hospital in Kolkata a couple of days ago and her samples were sent for tests. She has now returned home.

PUNE: Autorickshaw driver Rafiq Shaikh earned most of his evening fares from the stand outside the southern entrance of the Phoenix Marketcity mall till a week before. However, with the closing of the establishment amid coronavirus scare, all of that has changed.

“This (the Ahmednagar Road entrance) is where I stand till 11pm to ferry passengers. Till recently, there used to be regular customers. But as you can see, it’s completely empty now after the mall shut down amid the coronavirus scare. I hope this situation improves soon,” Shaikh said, while shifting to another location, a few hundred metres ahead at the Vimannagar crossing.

As fears of the spread of the coronavirus caused the state government to shut down shopping malls, people operating small businesses outside such commercial establishments have taken a beating too.

The tea and vada pav stalls as well as paan kiosks, located a few metres away from the entrance of the mall, are now lying closed, with only the bits of plywood and stickers of wallet payment systems being the only remnants of the shacks. Similar is the fate of a slightly more permanent juice parlour just off the pavement near the mall.

These stalls were heavily patronised by the staff that worked in the mall, besides by the workers at an adjacent construction site. A patron recalled as to how crowded the stalls used to be in the evening till a week back. At 5.30pm on Thursday, all these stalls, however, were eerily empty.

“These stalls have been empty since last Wednesday or Thursday. I visit this stall quite often for tea and vada pav and I know the stall’s owner as well. His business depended on the people from the mall. Once the mall closed, he had no other option but to leave,” Ashok Mandal, a construction worker at a site next to the mall, said.

437,['20/03/2020'],"Work-from-home option continues to elude many, confusion reigns","Pune: Several IT companies have implemented the practice of work-from-home in the time of Covid-19 in two ways — some have allowed all employees to function remotely while many have adopted the split-working model by ensuring only half the staffers step in at any point.

Though the government has issued advisories to employers to allow staffers to work from home, wherever possible, the absence of an order has made the implementation arbitrary. The Forum for IT Employees, a registered union, has urged the collector to issue an order, instead of an appeal or advisory, to do away with any grey areas.

“Some companies with just 1,000-1,500 employees have issued a blanket work-from-home order. Others are biding their time in the absence of a mandate,” a union member told TOI.

Industry insiders said at least 2.5 lakh of the city’s 4.5 lakh direct and indirect workforce were still going to work on a daily basis.

Authorities at Cognizant said they were monitoring developments and reassessing its progress, including ways to expand measures such as work-from-home. “Employees are being checked and sanitation has been increased. Thermal screening is the norm. Food is served on tables and cafeterias are kept free,” said a senior executive at Cognizant. Another associate from the company said the cafeteria witnessed a substantial crowd daily and people took turns to sit at the same table.

Sources in companies such as HSBC said they were working with skeletal staff and decisions were being driven from London.

None of the companies, which have allowed split-working and TOI spoke to, was clear as to how having 50% of the staff report to office would help in adequate social distancing. “It has been left to the managers’ discretion to take a call on where the employees of a team should work from,” said Deepak Nair, who works with a large captive in Pune.

The state government also increased the checklist of countries under corona watch to 11, by including Qatar, UAE, Oman and Kuwait.

This has practically brought every other country within the ambit. The two international flights coming to Nagpur are from Sharjah in UAE, and Doha in Qatar. The planes also bring passengers from other countries, who board the connecting flights at these locations. With Qatar and UAE in the list, all passengers arriving at Nagpur from Air Arabia’s Sharjah flight and Qatar Airways’ flight from Doha are liable to be quarantined.

Each person will now have to stay at least for 48 hours at the MLA Hostel. However, those who have to travel further out of Nagpur after landing here will have to stay put for 14 days, even if they test negative during this period.

Flyers who are co-morbid, which means they have disease like hypertension or diabetes, too will have to spend 14 days in quarantine area even if no symptoms are seen, said divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar.

If passengers alighting from international flights are detected with Covid-19 symptoms, they will be straightaway taken to Mayo Hospital from the airport, the officer told TOI.

Meanwhile, at MLA Hostel, 20 more persons were taken in on Thursday even as six were released for being home quarantined.

Two others refused to leave and preferred to stay there for the entire 14 day period, said an official. Now onwards, every person released from MLA Hostel will be taken home in a government vehicle. They will be barred from using any public transport. If symptoms develop, the person will have to call up the authorities and not use public transport to reach the hospital, an official managing the affairs said.

TOI had on March 17 reported that some of the persons released from the hostel had gone home on their own, risking infection in the drivers.

Meanwhile, the situation has improved at MLA Hostel. The canteen workers serving food to the quarantined flyers were given personnel protection equipment. This incudes a robe, gloves, cap and goggles. TOI had also reported lack of facilities for them in its report.

“We got this two days ago and it’s safer. They should also test us. We go inside at least thrice a day. Each time the food parcel is dropped I have to ring the bell. How many persons touch that bell,” said a canteen worker, as some of the persons due to be released were standing close in the corridor.

“Tests can be conducted on the staff if symptoms are seen,” said an official at the site.

The block where people are housed has one doctor and a staff nurse on regular basis who examine them. Meanwhile, the flyers have also been asked to clean up the rooms on their own so that workers need not go inside their rooms. Leftovers and cardboard food parcels are destroyed in the manner biomedical waste is done away with, an official said.

The flyers were also provided internet dongles as they had complained of lack of connectivity.

Police started the investigation after CPM worker Anneri Vipin (35), who along with his father and eight others was awarded life imprisonment in the murder of BJP worker K Pramod in August 2007, failed to report at the central prison here on the completion of his parole on March 16.

According to police, the probe was initiated after his wife Shruthilaya complained that Vipin left home on March 16 and his whereabouts are not known. Though the family thought he had gone back to jail on completion of parole, later, they came to know that he did not reach the jail. The prison authorities then filed a police complaint.

Police sources said that Vipin had apparently taken up some quarrel with his wife, who is working as a nurse abroad and then left home. Though his whereabouts are unknown, the indication is that he left for Mumbai or nearby area. His mobile phone has been switched off since.

On April 4, 2018, the Thalassery additional sessions court awarded life imprisonment to Vipin, his father Anneri Pavithran and eight others in the murder case. After he was awarded jail term, Vipin went on parole within one year and got married. He had availed around 200 days of parole using various means after he was imprisoned, said officials.

Jail authorities said since it is a parole break case, a warrant would be issued. They would also alert police in other states where he is likely to go.

442,['20/03/2020'],Pune: Day temperature crosses 37°C two days in a row,"Day temperatures are likely to hover around 35-36 degrees till March 24.

PUNE: The city saw its hottest days of this summer so far on Wednesday and Thursday. The Lohegaon weather station registered 37.4 degrees C on Wednesday, the highest day temperature of the post-monsoon season (March-May). The next day, the day temperature at the same station fell marginally to 37.1 degrees C.

On Wednesday, Shivajinagar recorded 37.1 degrees C and Pashan 36.8 degrees C. The next day, the two stations registered 36.1 and 36.3 degrees C respectively.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI that the rising day temperature has been the result of the wind regime in Maharashtra which has been westerly and southeasterly. “These winds have been flowing from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Hence they are relatively moist and warm. Day temperatures dipped slightly on Thursday because the wind regime changed to westerly and northwesterly. This means that these winds were coming only from the Arabian Sea,” he said.

Day temperatures are likely to hover around 35-36 degrees C till March 24. “Though these day temperatures are almost normal, they are likely to rise after the next 48 hours as will the night temperatures. Though Shivajinagar on Thursday recorded a slightly low minimum temperature at 15.8 degrees C, Lohegaon’s minimum was 1.2 degrees C above normal at 19.2 degrees C,” he said.

Sources in Skymet Weather Services said, “This is the time when day temperatures in the north, eastern, central and southern states of the country rise. Also, the first arrival of summer is seen in the states of south and central India. The mercury crosses the 35-degree mark in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka coastal areas, Maharashtra coastal areas and Odisha,” a source here said.

Most stations in Maharashtra, except Konkan, have crossed the 35 degrees C mark recently. On Thursday, Malegaon in central Maharashtra was the hottest spot in the state at 38 degrees C. Incidentally, this temperature was just one degree higher than what Lohegaon had recorded as its day temperature on Thursday.

Buses were diverted to other areas instead of the curfew-affected areas, including the bus stand. Majority of the Jhunjhunu-bound buses had fewer passengers as people preferred to cancel and postpone their journies to Jhunjhunu.

The RSRTC administration on Thursday decided not to operate its buses till the main bus stand in Jhunjhunu since curfew was imposed in town following the confirmation of three Covid-19 patients in the town who had returned from Italy.

“Buses were allowed till Peeru Singh Circle and Panchdev temple area and were not allowed to be operated up to the central bus stand, Jhunjhunu,” said Vasudev Sharma, chief manager of Jhunjhunu bus depot.

Majority of the buses to Jhunjhunu from Jaipur, Churu, Pilani, Chirawa, Jodhpur, Delhi and from other places had a poor occupancy due to the curfew in some parts of the town. “A few buses from Pilani to Jhunjhunu, Chirawa to Jhunjhunu and Khetri to Jhunjhunu were to be cancelled to availability of no passengers on the route,” said Khaitan Singh, a bus conductor at the Pilani bus depot.

Likewise, the private operators and Lok Parivahan Sewa also decided not to operate their buses to Jhunjhunu. TNN

444,['20/03/2020'],Bar council decides to abstain from work till March 31,"EDITED:

Jaipur: The Bar Council of Rajasthan and other bar associations on Thursday declared that they will abstain from work till March 31. This was declared by the BCR even as a full bench of Rajasthan High Court maintained that the courts will continue to hear the urgent matters. Not subscribing to the idea amid the coronavirus threat, the BCR passed a resolution to abstain from work from Friday onwards.

A full bench chaired by chief justice Indrajit Mahanti invited Bar Council of Rajasthan, Rajasthan High Court Bar Association, the Jaipur district bar association and its office bearers to discuss the modalities of the court working, amid of the coronavirus scare, on Thursday. The full bench proposed that urgent matters should be listed and heard where lawyers would have the facility to email and WhatsApp on urgent matters.

CJ Mahanty made it clear that the courts cannot be completely closed. However, opposing this, BCR chairman Syed Shahid Hasan said that in a scenario where public gatherings are being checked by the state government and when there is a fear of infection of coronavirus, lawyers can’t come to the court.

“It is a national emergency where we can’t play with our health. Since the full court decided to hear urgent matters only, we have passed a resolution to abstain from work till March 31. At least 80,000 lawyers affiliated to us would not come to work from Friday onwards,” Hasan told TOI.

CJ Mahanty also said that court has given the lawyers a facility to email and WhatsApp on hearing of urgent matters and can even take their arguments via email.

However, Rajasthan High Court Bar Association and other associations of the district lawyers opposed it. Since consensus on this could not be made, the lawyers attending the meeting said that if judges want to run the court they can, but lawyers won’t be available.

Lower courts and high court were almost empty, with the complete lockdown of canteens. The litigants were clueless and were seen haggling with the lawyers. At the sessions court some of the entry gates were closed while gate no 5 of Rajasthan High court was closed to ensure minimal entry of the public.

He was to return on March 20. However, flights to New Delhi were cancelled by various operators due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus in India and other countries.

In the video, the minister said, “We had come with our friends from Haryana to Tashkent, but all the flights here have been cancelled due to coronavirus. I request the Government of India and the state government to bring the other Indians stranded with us.”

Back home his family members are anxious and trying to contact Singhal through video calling and ISD. The family members though refrained from talking much on the issue, but appealed to the state government to bring him back along with his colleagues and other Indians.

447,['20/03/2020'],"Pune: House sparrows take to artificial nest boxes,four years of conservation shows success","Picture for representational purpose only.

PUNE: Over 84% house sparrows accepted the artificial nest boxes placed for them as part of an assisted breeding programme aimed at their conservation. The move was initiated by the Ela Foundation and Maharashtra forest department in 2016-2017.

The ongoing conservation efforts have entered the fifth year. Ornithologist and director of Ela Foundation, Satish Pande, said 1,200 nest boxes were deployed all over the state with the participation of common public, students, NGOs, forest department staff and Ela Foundation volunteers in the first phase.

Pande said, the nest boxes — pipe-shaped, a foot-long and four inches in diameter — were placed horizontally under the roofs of houses, factories, shops and godowns, among others, barring trees.

“The nest boxes were monitored for acceptance, number of eggs (clutch size), number of chicks hatched (hatching success), number of young chicks who flew (fledging success) and the number of nest boxes that were successful (at least one young fledged). Other species accepting the nest boxes were also recorded,” Pande said.

At present students are monitoring nest boxes at Pingori, Valhe, Daundaj, Jejuri, Kolvihire, Morgao, Nira, Kodit and Saswad among other villages.

Pande said, “Adult house sparrows (male and female in a pair) and the young in the nest were ringed as part of the study to monitor future behaviour and trends. Same male and female house sparrows were seen in the same nest box in several instances. In some cases the pairs kept changing and the male or female were different, but they came to the same nest box. Some house sparrows that were ringed in 2016 are still alive. A young one that was ringed in the nest in 2016 has now started breeding in the third year after hatching.”

He said one house sparrow was spotted 500m from the site where it was ringed, he said.

Pande said, “Entanglement of sparrows in nesting material (thread, wool, nylon), expulsion of chicks by mynas and parakeets, spraying of insecticide , cats and other predators, lack of breeding sites, drinking water, and food, and young sparrows dying due to collision with fans in homes are some major threats that we have identified as part of the project.”

Non-tolerance by humans due to littering of nesting material and fecal droppings is also a worry, he added.

Researchers Rahul Lonkar , Rajkumar Pawar , M N Mahajan, Omkar Sumant, Rushikesh Sankpal, Amit Pawashe, Faiyaz Shaikh and Banda Pednekar are involved in the project

PUNE: Experts at B J Medical College-attached Sassoon General Hospital are gearing up to start tests for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection from Friday.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has certified the state-run medical institution to carry out the tests on the throat swab samples of the suspected persons.

“Following the ICMR’s approval, we have received the required primers and probes from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for conducting the tests. All test controls have been examined prior to interpretation of patient results on Thursday. We will start getting throat and nasal swab samples of the suspected patients to analyse them for the presence of the virus from Friday,” hospital dean and spine surgeon Ajay Chandanwal told TOI.

Three laboratories in Maharashtra are currently handling the task of testing samples of the suspected novel coronavirus patients. Of the three facilities, the Pune-based NIV is the apex referral laboratory, which gets samples even from South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries for confirmation of various types of infections, including the novel coronavirus.

Apart from NIV, one lab is currently being operated at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) in Nagpur and the other one at Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai.

“We have the required machinery, called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We plan to purchase one more machine, if needed, to scale up the testing work. We can currently handle the load of 50-100 samples a day. We can churn out the results within four to six hours,” Chandanwale said.

Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday announced eight new testing laboratories for coronavirus across the state. He said among these, the facilities at BJ Medical College in Pune and KEM hospital and Kasturba hospital in Mumbai would start fuctioning from Thursday. The minister said the additional laboratories would test 180-250 samples a day to reduce the burden on NIV.

One testing centre would be set up in Mumbai’s JJ Hospital and two at Haffkine Institute. There will be a facility each in Aurangabad, Dhule, Miraj and Solapur.

They also complained about the centre, located within the Telangana State Institute of Rural Development (TSIRD), being infested with mosquitoes.Infuriated, many passengers packed their luggage and crowded around the main gate of the premises, by evening, demanding that they be allowed to go home.

As per protocol, all international passengers housed there have to be under quarantine for 14 days.“Even if we test negative for coronavirus , we will certainly contract either malaria or pneumonia if we are forced to stay here,” said Najma M, who landed from the United States via Doha late on Wednesday night. “The rooms are extremely unhygienic and we are being made to share them with strangers. There are no sanitisers or hot water. The food is contaminated,” she added.Others too had similar grievances. “It is impossible for us to stay here.

“Only after seeking necessary permissions can they start functioning. The health department will monitor these laboratories,” the minister told TOI on Thursday. “We are working on increasing the government laboratories in the state to 10, but accredited laboratories, once they get sanction from ICMR, can start the process as per the guidelines. At present, the guidelines specify that testing is allowed only for symptomatic individuals with a travel history to affected countries or those in direct contact with an infected individual,” he added.

He said private labs may be allowed to conduct coronavirus tests as per the Centre’s notification. There are 50 to 60 private labs, accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Laboratories. These laboratories in the state will have to approach ICMR if they want to conduct tests, he said.

At present, only government labs are permitted to test. Though their capacity is around 5,000 samples per day, only 60 to 70 samples are being processed daily as per protocol.

Tope said as per the coronavirus testing protocol not everyone can take such tests. “Those detected with symptoms of coronavirus and those who have returned to India from coronavirus affected countries can be tested,’’ he added.

On Wednesday, Tope had said eight laboratories were expected to come up in the next 10 days in addition to the current three. He also expected 10 lakh personal protective equipment kits from the Centre.

Besides, there are 600 isolation beds and 700 ventilators to treat the Covid-19 patients across the state. “The Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act are in place and we can have private hospitals reserve beds and rooms if required,” he said.

He had announced three labs at KEM hospital, Kasturba hospital in Mumbai and at BJ Medical College. The facility at BJ Medical college had started and the standardisation process is on, he added

Two labs at Haffkine Institute in Mumbai will be active in the four days, he said. The government is keen on opening labs in Dhule, Aurangabad and Solapur. The National Institute of Virology will provide equipment in these proposed eight labs.

“Each one of the labs will test 180 to 250 samples every day, but the National Institute of Virology (NIV) will validate their test results,” he added.

Health minister Rajesh Tope has directed all districts to be ready with the disaster management plan to deal with Covid-19. As per the Centre’s directives, all states with Covid-19 cases were to reserve beds, ICUs, medicine and material.

On Wednesday, the minister had directed the district administration in Pune to have its plan ready. Collector Naval Kishore Ram has nominated officials as per the plan to check on quarantine facilities, handle material and man management.

Moreover, 18 empanelled private hospitals have been directed to reserve beds if the government facilities fall short of space. On Thursday, divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar told TOI that he has directed all health officials and the administration to ensure that there is enough stock of masks and supportive treatment.

“We have ordered 2,000 N95 masks which should arrive shortly. There is no shortage of medicines,’‘ he added.

Trains are already facing poor turnout due to the Covid-19 scare for the past one week. “Due to poor passenger load in the trains and to ensure safety of the public, we have decided to terminate the services of nine pairs of trains upto March 31,” said a senior officer of NWR on Thursday.

At Jaipur railway station, a majority of the trains including Pooja Express, Mandore Express, Aashram Express, Jaipur-Delhi double decker, Jaisalmer-Delhi via Jaipur, Aala Hazrat Express and others witnessed a very poor turnout. “We are reviewing the situation every day and depending on the passenger load, decision has been taken to terminate trains upto March 31,” said a senior officer of the commercial wing of NWR.

Passengers were confused and clueless on their cancellations, especially those who had pre-booked their tickets online. “In this emergency situation, railways should give us full refund,” said Arjun Ahlawat, who came for cancelation of his tickets to Mumbai which was planned for March 22.

Still we are unsure,” he said.After the coronavirus outbreak, bookings for hotels rooms have seen a sharp drop. Some hotels even took renovation work as the footfalls of customers reduced drastically.“There will be huge losses.

456,['20/03/2020'],HC upholds family court’s lump sum order,"Ahmedabad: In an important judgment, the Gujarat high court on Thursday ruled that a family court is empowered to direct a Muslim man to pay lump sum as permanent alimony to his wife on divorce, and payment of this alimony is not conditional to the wife’s remarriage.In its order, the high court narrated the progression of the rights of Muslim women in India from pure Sharia law that was in existence before 1939, and said that a family court can order a Muslim man to pay permanent alimony not only under the Family Courts Act, but also under Section 3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.The HC was hearing a case, in which an Ahmedabad family court had ordered the man to pay Rs 10 lakh as permanent alimony to his wife while granting a divorce decree in January 2019 on the wife’s application. She re-married, but the husband had contracted another marriage in 2014. The husband challenged the family court’s jurisdiction to order permanent alimony saying that the power lies with the magistrate under the 1986 Act, which was passed by Parliament after the Shah Bano case. Later, he also pointed out that the wife had remarried after divorce and he was not therefore liable to pay her the alimony.A bench of Justice J B Pardiwala rejected the man’s contention and said, “The right of maintenance and right in the matrimonial property are the consequences of the marriage or its dissolution…very much an integral part of the decree of ‘dissolution of marriage’.”On the husband’s claim that no law provides for permanent alimony on a divorce petition by the wife, the court said, “The ever-changing needs and situations may require judicial determination: it cannot be that the courts are powerless to act in the absence of specific provisions in the codes.” The HC further said that the 1986 Act very much provides for this relief for a woman on divorce. Besides Indian laws, the HC cited various verses from the Quran and their interpretations to assert the women’s right to equality in marriage among Muslims and how the religious law itself has provisions for alimony for women at the time of separation.On the woman’s right to permanent alimony in case of her remarriage, the HC clarified, “Such sum is not granted on the condition against remarriage for all times to come or for any particular period.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-upholds-family-courts-lump-sum-order/articleshow/74719572.cms

Their samples were sent to the lab at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH or Mayo) from across Vidarbha and other parts of Central India.

Out of the 28 swab samples, 21 were from Amravati, two from Nagpur GMCH, three from Gadchiroli, one from Akola and one from Buldhana.

In Nagpur, no fresh case was reported while suspects from the city and several places were reported at the government colleges.

Authorities in Chandrapur heaved a sigh of relief after a passenger, who had come in contact with positive patients in some other state, was alighted from a train coming from Hyderabad and taken to GMCH there on Wednesday evening. His swabs were sent to Mayo lab. He is yet to be discharged.

There was panic after reports emerged that three Azerbaijan nationals have developed symptoms while their stay in Gadchiroli. Report about a flyer who was advised home quarantine from this district too is awaited.

In Yavatmal, no new admission at the isolation ward of GMCH was reported. District collector MD Singh said there are seven patients including the three positive at the GMCH Yavatmal isolation ward. Among the four suspects, two have no symptoms while the other two have symptoms.

Their swabs were sent to Mayo on Wednesday and the report is awaited. Singh said 127 persons are in the home quarantine across the district and special teams are deployed to keep a watch on their movements.

The condition of the positive patients is stable and they are recovering speedily. In Pusad, three elderly women who returned from Nepal after a tour have been asked to remain under home quarantine though they have no symptoms of coronavirus.

The three nationals from Azerbaijan were among the 21 home quarantined at Gadchiroli after they developed some symptoms.

Amravati district collector Shailesh Naval said that 24 throat swab samples sent for examination till Wednesday were found negative while reports are awaited for 11. He said citizens returning from abroad are being checked and advised to subject themselves to home quarantine.

His samples were urgently sent to Nagpur for testing the same night. The test result came negative,” said civil surgeon Dr ND Rathod.

He informed that the patient has not been discharged and is still being treated at Chandrapur GMCH.

Health administration has so far tested seven suspected patients of coronavirus in Chandrapur and all of them have been found negative.

461,['20/03/2020'],3 years of Uttarakhand government: How has forest minister fared?,"DEHRADUN: As state forest minister, Harak Singh Rawat heads what is arguably one of the most significant departments in the state, since Uttarakhand has around 72% of its geographical area under forest cover. With the BJP government in the state having completed three years in office, how has been his performance like? Most experts feel that besides a few milestones like the state registering a 0.03% increase in its forest cover even amidst rampant developmental activities, the minister’s tenure has not seen many remarkable achievements. Speaking to TOI, Harak Singh Rawat also acknowledged that he is “not very satisfied” by his performance as forest minister.

“I believe I could have done lot more in forest, wildlife and environment for Uttarakhand. But my hands are tied. The central government is treating us like a stepchild, when one considers the kind of incentives that are being given to Himachal Pradesh or any of the Northeastern states of the country,” he said.

The forest department has grabbed headlines mainly for the wrong reasons like the controversy surrounding definition of deemed forests, Kandi road project as well as the Laldhang- Chillarkhal road that connects Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) with Rajaji Tiger Reserve , rampant human-wildlife conflict, tigers spotted chewing plastic inside CTR, Gupta brothers’ wedding at Auli, muck dumping for all-weather road construction work etc.

When queried on these issues, the minister said that “there has been a rise in wildlife numbers in the state which is a matter of pride for us but this has also resulted in more human-wildlife conflict cases which is why we have brought these conflicts into disaster category so that victims get instant financial support of upto Rs 4 lakh.”

On his other decisions, Rawat said, “The central government had asked all the states to define deemed forest on their own and that’s what we did. We are going to battle out our case at Supreme Court now. As far as Kandi road project is concerned, we have put in Rs 2.5 crore for the survey of road, and we will get it approved as well. Laldhang road is our achievement. Though there are some riders,we will share our concerns with the Union environment ministry.”

Environmentalists though feel that the department led by the minister should have acted in a more pro-active manner to retain Uttarakhand’s ‘green identity’. “We are among the fortunate states in the country who are sitting on an abundance of natural resources like the Ganga, Himalayas, glaciers and forests which other states don’t have. But instead of fostering this green identity and enhancing it further, the forest department has been acting more like a construction work department akin to the PWD and has not had much focus on conservation,” said Doon-based activist and environmentalist Reenu Paul.

In a similar vein, Anil Joshi, founder of the Dehradun-based Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organisation, said, “ In three years, we could have acted in a more eco-system-centric way. The good thing is that now at least the government seems to be moving in that direction as they have realised the importance of concepts like Gross Environment Product (GEP) and are working towards it.”

462,['20/03/2020'],"Covid-19: Random sampling not the right way to find out extent of pandemic, says ex-ICMR expert","ICMR's decision to conduct random sampling to gauge if there has been community transmission in India is much debated. What is your opinion on this strategy?

What, in your opinion, is the right approach?

What could be the downside of random sampling?

India is currently said to be in Phase II and measures are being taken to halt progression to the next stage. Will the measures be adequate?

What should the government have done?

Dr Jacob John , former chief of ICMR's Centre for Advanced Research in Virology , speaks to TOI on why the outcome of random sampling may not be a correct measure of the extent of the Covid-19 threat— I personally don't agree with it. At this time, I feel it could be a waste of time and resources, or even diverting resources from what they should be actually doing. It assumes that cases of Covid-19 are randomly distributed, which is not the case. A time will come when distribution of infection is widespread, when random sampling will tell us the likely magnitude of infection prevalence. When you know that infection has reached a region, then testing pneumonia cases there will help. Without knowing if infection is spreading in a place, random small-size sampling will give misleading data.— A ""sampling approach"" is for monitoring statistical probability. That is a research method to monitor statistical trend. What we need is diagnostic support service for all suspected cases. What we need is universal testing based on the criteria for suspecting Covid-19 infection. All hospitals should be instructed to ask patients with fever of recent origin if fatigue and cough are present. If all three symptoms are present, that is a suspect case. If you want to know if the infection has reached a particular town, clinical screening is first step. In random sampling, you could test 10 patients, but what if the 11th one has Covid-19?— For a rare infection, random sampling is almost always negative. It could lull people into confidence and complacency. For a common infection, random sampling will give a measure of magnitude. If you want to know if infection has reached some place, all suspect cases — not just a sample — must be tested. So, the crux is knowing prevalence frequency before one goes for a sampling approach.— Phasing this pandemic can be tricky. Cities or communities could be going through different phases at any given point in time. To say that a city — Pune or Patna , for instance — and the rest of the country are in the same Phase II is unscientific and could make people confident that things are under control.Think of fire sparks falling in different spots at different times. At each spot, the fire will go through various phases. These phases depend on when Phase I started. India had many places at stage zero, some in stage 1, others in stage 2. In the states ( Maharashtra and Kerala), careful analysis is needed to see if a shift from stage 2 to 3 is happening. If stage 1 occurs, 2,3 and 4 are inevitable. When in stage 2, interventions appropriate for 3 must be in place. Always ahead of the progression of the epidemic.— The government should have understood that this is a national emergency of unprecedented magnitude. A strategy for uniform application in all states should have been planned. Allowing each state to decide for itself is not good. There should have been a strategy planning group.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-random-sampling-not-the-right-way-to-find-out-extent-of-pandemic-says-ex-icmr-expert/articleshow/74721302.cms

AHMEDABAD: Infocity police of Gandhinagar on Thursday arrested three persons including a woman for allegedly duping several men with promise of providing sex workers’ services and taking their money.

Inspector Sumit Rajput of Infocity police said the cops raided on a house in Randesan on the basis of specific intelligence that some persons there were duping men with the lure of sex workers’ services through a website.

When police raided the house, they found two persons — Akhlaq Khan, 25, and a woman of 29 — who confessed during questioning that they were running a racket through a website on the instructions of their employer, Kamal Wadhwani, 35, a resident of Thakkarbapanagar in Ahmedabad.

In their primary investigation, police learned that the two posted pictures of women on a website and if someone searched for sex workers, they would come across the website. The accused persons also provided a contact number with pictures of women.

Lured by the images, if a person called the accused, they would first take half the money for the deal, ranging between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000. They would tell the person to go to a particular hotel and promising him he would find the sex worker there. When the person would reach the hotel, the accused persons would ask them to pay the remainder before availing of the service.

Eager to meet the sex worker, most men paid the money but when they reached the hotel room no one would be there. After this, when the victim tried to reach the accused, they find their phones switched off, said Rajput. Police booked them for breach of trust and cheating besides offences under the Information Technology Act.

Since both the persons belong to different faiths, the police and the girl’s family were against their union. The couple is from Devbhoomi Dwarka district. The girl was separated from her boyfriend and placed in a protection home. The man approached the HC earlier this month and placed a notarized copy of their live-in relationship agreement. He also told the court that they had decided to marry, sources said.

Upon the court’s notice, the woman appeared before the court. The court thought it fit to call her parents too to avoid confusion.

When all were present, the woman’s father told the court that he did not want to consent to the marriage because the man is from a different faith. On hearing this, the daughter made it clear that she had met her boyfriend’s family and they had no issue if she continued to profess her religion.

The couple informed the court that they will get their marriage registered under the Special Marriages Act so the question of conversion does not arise.

467,['20/03/2020'],Quality of hand sanitizers under drug control scanner,"Kozhikode: Drugs control department in the district has strengthened surveillance in all regions to check the sale of poor quality hand sanitizers to public.

Many persons and groups have started producing large quantities of hand sanitizing lotions using alcohol as its demand increased steeply with the spread of Covid-19.

The drug control department has started inspecting pharmacies, wholesale stores of drugs, warehouses of drug dealers and other places where alcohol-based hand sanitizers are being prepared for sale.

The inspection has been strengthened following the seizure of large quantities of fake hand sanitizer from the city three days ago.

“Our priority is to ensure the availability of good quality hand sanitizers to the public,” said regional drug inspector Shaji Varghese. The focus is to check the quality of hand sanitizing lotions and rubs being sold through medical shops, supermarkets and other outlets, he added.

On Monday, a team of drugs control department officials seized fake hand sanitizers from a building at Chinthavalappu in the city. The officials also booked the owner of the pharmacy for preparing the product without a valid license.

The team of officials had seized seven cartons of drugs which were labelled as hand rubs. “The firm Smart Enterprises started the preparation of the solution aiming to make a huge profit in a short span following increased demand for hand sanitizing rubs,” said the official. They were manufacturing the solution in the absence of any qualified personnel and lacking quality control, the official added.

Many firms started manufacturing hand sanitizers without following quality control measures, said Shaji Varghese. The manufacturer should possess a licence to ensure quality control of the product, he said.

Taking into account the huge demand for hand sanitizers, the drugs control department has started issuing loan licence to many groups that have expressed interest in producing antiseptic lotions. The persons can make use of the facilities at licenced drug manufacturing factories to ensure the quality of the product.

JAIPUR: A day after being tested positive for Covid-19, Jhunjhunu’s three patients were shifted to Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital for treatment on Thursday evening. The hospital has treated three Covid-19 patients successfully, while one patient is still undergoing treatment for it there.

Keeping in mind the hospital’s successful record of treating Covid-19 patients, it has been decided by the state government to provide the treatment to all the three Covid-19 patients at SMS Hospital.

SMS Hospital doctors claimed that all the three Covid-19 patients are stable. “We have sent our rapid response teams to Jhunjhunu, to keep a watch on their health in the morning. They all are stable,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS medical college.

469,['20/03/2020'],"Covid-19: As Hyderabad firms log into WFH, rent &amp; prices of laptops, computers soar","Many IT companies have asked their employees to work from home, in Hyderabad.

HYDERABAD: As tech companies graduate to a complete work from home scenario due to the coronavirus threat, Hyderabad, which has about over 5 lakh IT sector employees, is not only staring at an acute shortage of laptops and desktops for sale but for rentals as well. What’s more, some vendors are learnt to be demanding double the going rate for providing dongles to companies as well, according to IT industry sources.

Sources in the IT sector pointed out that while there are hardly any new laptops and desktops or even rental ones available in the market, prices of the few pieces available for sale or rent have shot through the roof over the past week to 10 days.

Coronavirus in India live updates

“Vendors who were giving laptops with higher configuration on rent to IT companies for Rs 1,700-2,000 per month, are now quoting over Rs 4,000 per month,” said Ravi Rao, managing director, ValueMomentum, and secretary of HYSEA

According to Chenoy Trade Centre in Secunderabad , which houses several computer dealers, it is doing brisk business with dealers jacking up prices to cash in on the shortage of hardware supply from China, which accounts for a bulk of the manufacturing of these products.

“We had around 400 laptops that we have already rented out to our clients. Due to a spurt in queries from IT companies over the past week to 10 days, we have been trying to buy some new laptops but for the few pieces available dealers are quoting a premium of Rs 5,000-10,000,” pointed out Biplab Mondal of C Prompt Solutions that supplies laptops and desktops on rent to IT companies. Mondal typically gets queries for about 100 laptops a month but since the Covid-19 scare queries have shot up for about 5,000 laptops.

Another vendor, Kumar of D-Digitech said they have run out of stock of laptops and desktops on rent over the past week or so. “We had about 12,000 laptops and 6,000 desktops before but with demand for these shooting up over the past 10 days we don’t have even a single laptop or desktop available for rent.”

471,['20/03/2020'],Railways withdraw several sops to discourage travel,"SECR Nagpur division DRM Shobhana Bandopadhyay sanitises her hands

Nagpur: After cancelling many low-occupancy trains on several routes due to coronavirus scare, the Indian Railways on Thursday withdrew concessions on booking of tickets.

To discourage unnecessary travel and to prevent vulnerable category of senior citizens from undertaking unnecessary travel, concessional booking of all tickets, except for patients, students and divyangjan (persons with disabilities) category for unreserved and reserved segment were suspended from March 20.

Central Railway has also banned entry of all outsiders into the Divisional Railway Manager’s (DRM) office premises with immediate effect.

As a precautionary measure and to discourage non-essential travel and overcrowding of trains, so far 155 pairs of low occupancy trains have been cancelled up to March 31.

“Trains are cancelled keeping in view availability of alternate trains for passengers and ensuring that no passenger shall remain stranded. Full refund is being given to all passengers if train has been cancelled,” said railway officials.

Indian Railways has also facilitated return of students stranded in northern part of the country due to sudden closure of educational institutions to their homes in southern, northern-eastern and eastern regions of India.

Advisories are being issued to passengers to avoid non-essential train journeys and to ensure that they do not have running fever while they are commencing the journey. At any point in the journey, if a passenger feels that he has fever, he can contact railway staff for medical attention and further assistance.

To avoid unnecessary crowding at railway stations in the wake of spread of Covid-19, divisional railway managers (DRMs) have been instructed to review the situation at railway stations and raise price of platform ticket to Rs50 wherever necessary.

Apart from Nagpur, Chandrapur, Ballarshah, Betul, Sewagram and Wardha under Central Railway, platform ticket rates have been increased to Rs50 at Itwari and Gondia stations under South East Central Railway (SECR).

Both SECR and Central Railway have intensified the drive against spitting and littering by passengers. “In the last 18 days, from March 1 to 18, we penalized 289 passengers and recovered a fine of Rs30,000,” said Central Railway spokesperson SG Rao. Similarly, SECR registered 110 cases and recovered a fine of Rs10,800.

SECR has made sanitary hand wash mandatory for all those visiting the DRM office administrative building. Even the DRM and other officials are being told to go through it.

Regular announcements are being made at railway stations and aboard trains to sensitize the public about various dos & don’ts to keep hands clean with frequent washing, maintaining social distance and covering mouth while sneezing and coughing.

Even as regular steps are being taken, there has been a spurt in cancellation of tickets by passengers. In the last five days, over 60,500 bona fide passengers cancelled tickets in Nagpur division. Of these, 45,000 passengers were from Nagpur station alone.

Hubballi Airport director Pramod Kumar Thackeray said that screening would be mandated at the terminal once the equipment for thermal screening was procured. Interestingly enough, the lack of screening equipment at the airport when chief minister BS Yediyurappa alighted here on March 15 had raised eyebrows. “We expect the thermal screening equipment to arrive anytime soon,” Thackeray said.Bidar-based veteran medical practitioner Dr Maqsood Chanda opined that, regardless of whether an airport is an international terminal or a domestic one, screening ought not to be neglected in such a time. “Community outbreak will become a reality unless stringent measures are taken. Screening commenced at Kalaburagi and Bidar a week ago, but that was late to begin with. But better late than never. Other airports must follow the example to contain the outbreak,” Dr Chanda said.Sambra Airport director Rajesh Kumar Maurya told TOI, that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had not yet directed domestic terminals to screen all passengers. On being pressed as to why the airport had not taken upon itself the duty to screen all passengers, Maurya replied that he was not in Belagavi, and would respond on returning. However, during a later conversation with TOI, he retracted his former statements, asserting that all patients were being screened. However, this ran contrary to the observations of the staff at the airport, who said that this was not the case.Physician Srinivas Kakkailaya also pressed for screening of all passengers at domestic airports.Employees at airports felt that there was the possibility of individuals yet to display symptoms of the infection could be roaming around the country. “Mandatory screening may help locate such people,” they said.",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74725136,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185229,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/doctors-fret-over-absence-of-mandatory-domestic-screening-at-domestic-airports/articleshow/74718460.cms

Their sense of angst is stemming from the fact that while Indians stranded in Rome, Tehran and other Covid-19 hotspots are being brought back, the government is not considering a similar course of action for those in Kuala Lumpur, which has put them in a desperate situation.Mahima Gupta, one of those stranded in Kuala Lumpur, in a tweet to minister for external affairs, S Jaishkar, stated, “India please don’t abandon us here. We want to go back home. We are doctors and hence understand the gravity of the situation and agree to cooperate with all the screening and quarantine procedures.” Mahima and Navin Mallya are students from Kasturba Medical College, Mangaluru, who went to Malaysia for their medical internship.Luckily for Mahima, she has stocked up essentials that can last for a week. Moreover, KMC has ensured that she and Navin are looked after well by their local guardians in Kuala Lumpur. Rajeev Kumar Gupta, Mahima’s father, said that with Malaysia in total lockdown and stores empty, the situation of those stranded will worsen. There are the old and infirm keen to return to India. They must wait for the government to intervene on their behalf, he said.Noting that the situation was not this alarming when Navin and Mahima went to Malaysia on March 12, and the authorities there were positive about their invitation, Gupta said interns were told to return to India on Tuesday, following a directive from the government there. The Air Asia flight that came to Vishakhapatnam and Delhi on Wednesday brought stranded transit passengers from the Philippines, while leaving behind those stranded in Kuala Lumpur.Observing that there have been no reports of any of the passengers stranded in Malaysia reporting positive for Coronavirus, Gupta said on the other hand the government is bringing back Covid-19 positive people from the hotspot regions of the world, and sending them to quarantine facilities. “It is our request that those stranded in Malaysia too are brought back home at the earliest, before they contract the disease and the situation worsens for them,” he added.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74725741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/stranded-indians-in-kuala-lumpur-grow-more-desperate/articleshow/74718645.cms

Mangaluru: Udupi deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha, who is heading the magisterial inquiry into the alleged police firing in connection with the December 19 violence in the city, will now submit his report by April 23. Jagadeesha told reporters on Thursday, “I requested the government for more time as the documents and videos have to be examined. Based on my request, the government has provided an additional month, and the report will now be submitted by April 23. All videos and documents submitted have to be examined,” he said.

Meanwhile, the next high court hearing is scheduled for April 21. The Udupi DC is expected to submit the inquiry report before the high court.

Following the December 19 violence and the death of Nauseen Kudroli,49, and Jaleel Bengre,23, due to alleged police firing, the state government commissioned two probes, one magisterial and the other CID. As per the government order, a report on the inquiry was to be submitted before March 23. The DC has now got a month’s extension. A total176 policemen will depose before the magistrate.

On Thursday, 35 people including 29 police personnel, mostly constables, deposed before the magistrate. About 30 more policemen are yet to be examined.

Jagadeesha said, “About 30 police personnel, the Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner, assistant commissioner and doctors who conducted the postmortem, will depose before the magistrate on Monday. We will also give the public one last opportunity to appear before the magistrate and submit documents, and this date will be announced on Monday, after which the hearing will be closed,” he said.

ACP (north) and nodal officer Belliappa K U was present, and the DC has asked the police to submit all the pending documents.

489,['20/03/2020'],"Tourism development committee to hire architect for better landscaping, branding","Udupi: The district tourism development committee has decided to avail the services of an architect in order to make their tourism projects more attractive. The projects with unique designs conceptualised by the architect, should give places of tourist interest a truly international look, and thereby attract both domestic and foreign tourists in equal measure, said deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha , who is also the head of the tourism development committee.

“The project design should be such that places of tourist importance are recognised on a national and international level,” said Jagadeesha, who chaired a meeting of the committee. Explaining the reason for this move, Jagadeesha said if all beaches and places of tourist importance have the same façade, it will not enthuse tourists. Accordingly, when the committee takes up new projects, it will carry vital inputs from the architect, as well, he said.

With the committee striving for Blue Flag notification for all its beaches, Jagadeesha said it is imperative that all works envisaged under this process be completed by March 31. The Blue Flag tag is a move by the ministry of environment and forests for select beaches in India, and is accorded by the Foundation for Environment Education, Denmark, based on 33 stringent criteria in four major areas. Beaches in Karnataka under this are Kasarkod and Padubidri.

With the current state budget focussing on coastal tourism, Jagadeesha directed authorities to prioritise tourism development projects in the district, prepare estimates for them, and send it to the government for approval and implementation. The tourism development task force committee should prepare a draft report and submit it to the district tourism development committee at the earliest, the DC said, underscoring the need for speedy execution.

With the tourism department selecting 13 beneficiaries for the taxi scheme, Jagadeesha said such taxis should compulsorily carry the department sticker given to them. With tender for maintenance of Kaup Beach coming to an end, the DC directed the department to call tenders afresh, and take steps to repair toilets there. The committee also cleared applications received to start tourist boats and adventure sports activities in the district.

The committee also decided to appoint a professional agency to handle social media promotion activities of tourism spots. Applications to start homestays in the district will be cleared only if they conform to rules laid down for the purpose, Jagadeesha said. Training will be imparted to tourist guides who will be deployed at select tourist places, so that they can convey information about the place to more number of tourists and locals going there, he said.

The operation which stretched over two days from March 11, saw DRI officers first seize 5.6 kg of gold bars in crude form at Mangaluru Central railway station from Syed Mohammad and Ashoka K S.

Sources privy to and involved in the bust – the largest that DRI Mangaluru office has carried out so far—said the operation was conducted based on specific information about a network of operators who were bringing smuggled gold crude bars from Kozhikode to Mangaluru. The gold was then remelted and cast into 100 gram bars with foreign markings, using foreign marking moulds. This in turn was distributed to various locations across Karnataka.

The operation that saw the involvement of DRI officers from Bengaluru and Kozhikode, also swooped down on Manjunath Shet, alias Rupesh, who was supposed to receive the gold from the duo apprehended at the railway station, from the parking lot of the railway station. The sleuths also carried out simultaneous searches in three different premises at Car Street, Udupi, and in Shivamogga, leading to more gold being recovered, the sources said.

Sleuths traced the source of gold to jewellers in Kozhikode, and swift follow-up action led to seizure of gold and Rs 82 lakh. Two Toyota Etios vehicles belonging to the syndicate, with specially-designed cavities for concealment, that was used for transporting cash and gold between Kozhikode and Mangaluru, was also seized. DRI arrested seven people including Naveenchandra Kamath, the mastermind from Udupi, in this entire operation.

An investigation is on to uncover the role of other people involved in the racket, the source said, lauding the role of 40 officers from Bengaluru, Mangaluru and Shivamogga in this coordinated effort. Incidentally, DRI sleuths in January had seized 5 kg gold worth Rs 2 crore at the air cargo complex at Old Airport in Bajpe. “With this latest bust, we have more than doubled the value from our previous raid,” the sources added.

Initially, the name of both the banks will also be there in the branding though the merged entity will be Indian Bank. The Allahabad Bank board will be dissolved following the merger and the head office of the merged entity would be in Chennai.

Indian Bank CEO & MD Padmaja Chunduru said that the bank has targeted a loan growth of 12% for the combined bank and may tap the capital market in the second half of the next fiscal. Chunduru was talking to reporters through a conference call.

She pointed out that as per the plan both logos will be combined. “First, there will be a logo of Indian Bank and then Allahabad Bank. The latter bank has a huge legacy. The existence of logo and name in the new branding will give comfort to Allahabad Bank customers and employees,” she added.

The Indian Bank MD and CEO argued that the biggest advantage of the merger would be no geographical overlap between two banks. Only 150-200 branches may overlap. “The merged bank would have 6,000 branches. Indian Bank is strong in south where Allahabad Bank is strong in east and north,” she added.

She has also assured the Allahabad Bank customers by saying that one executive director of the bank will be based in Kolkata for the time being.

According to her, it has set a target of Rs 10-lakh-crore business for the merge entity which it is now expecting to touch by 2022. “All depends on how the economy is doing. The current scenario is difficult though it should change in two months,” she added.
