0,2020/03/12,"Amid coronavirus threat, the Olympic flame is lit","The torch will be carried by 600 runners covering 3,500km and 842 nautical miles

The Olympic flame for the 2020 Tokyo Games was lit in ancient Olympia on Thursday amid an unprecedented health lockdown as Greece registered its first death from coronavirus.

With spectators banned, an actress dressed as an ancient Greek high priestess lit the flame using the rays of the sun reflected off a concave mirror, launching a week-long torch relay in Greece before the flame is handed to Tokyo organisers on March 19.

Flame of ‘hope’

“Today marks the beginning of the journey of the Olympic flame to Japan,” said International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach. “When the flame returns to Tokyo after 56 years, hope will light the way across the entire country,” he said.

Japan last hosted the summer Olympics — also in Tokyo — in 1964.

Now it seeks to use the 2020 Olympics to show the world it has regained its creative flair and innovative energy, but also as a means to highlight reconstruction following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima.

“Japan will demonstrate its ground-breaking innovation and boundless creative energy with regard to sustainability, technology and human-centred growth,” Bach said. “The Olympic Games... will again be a symbol of hope and confidence for all Japanese people.”

But, with the coronavirus causing devastation in world sport, doubts are increasingly being raised over whether the Olympics can be held as scheduled from July 24 to August 9.

Organisers have insisted the Games will go ahead as planned and the IOC has said there has not yet been any talk of cancellation or postponement. The IOC has said it will coordinate closely with the World Health Organisation, which has now officially classified the outbreak as a pandemic.

The torch relay in Greece is scheduled to pass through 37 cities and 15 archaeological sites covering 3,500km and 842 nautical miles and will be carried by 600 runners.

The hydrogen that powers the Olympic flame will be produced in the town of Namia in Fukushima, one of the worst affected areas, said Toshiaki Endo, acting president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee. And the torch has been partially produced from recycled aluminium originally used to build temporary housing units in the aftermath of the quake, he said.

Greek Olympic shooting champion Anna Korakaki was the initial torch-bearer, the first time a woman has been chosen for the role. She was followed by Mizuki Noguchi, gold medallist in the women's marathon at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

Hollywood actor Gerard Butler will be among the runners once the torch relay reaches Sparta.

Closed doors

The ceremony was held without spectators after dozens of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the broader western Peloponnese. Up to 12,000 had been expected to make their way to Olympia, where the ancient Games were held.

Only 100 accredited guests from the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, compared to 700 originally, were allowed to attend Thursday's ceremony.

The dress rehearsal on Wednesday was also closed to the public and dinners and galas arranged for the torch lighting have been scrapped. The only precedent is in 1984 when the Greek leg of the torch relay was abandoned in a protest by Greek organisers against what they saw as the commercialisation of the Los Angeles Olympics.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/vwxhlw/article31052834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13FLAME,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/amid-coronavirus-threat-the-olympic-flame-is-lit/article31052835.ece

Tiger Woods will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in its class of 2021.

The 44-year-old will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in December after the age of entry was lowered from 50 to 45.

“Tiger has done more for the game than anyone ever thought possible,” said PGA Tour commissioner and World Golf Foundation board member Jay Monahan, as quoted by the BBC Sport.

Woods has bagged 15 Majors and has a joint record 82 titles on the PGA Tour. “This past year has been such an incredible journey and the support I’ve received from my family, friends and fans has been overwhelming,” said Woods. “This achievement is the ultimate recognition to never give up and keep chasing.”

Woods won the Zozo Championship last year by three shots to make golfing history after he saw off favourite Hideki Matsuyama.

Rising Indian shuttler Lakshya Sen was knocked out of the All England Championships after losing in straight games to Victor Axelsen here on Thursday.

Lakshya went down to the world number seven Dane 17-21 18-21 in a hard fought second round battle which lasted 45 minutes.

The 18-year old Indian, who won five titles last season, had defeated Hong Kong’s Cheuk Yiu Lee 17-21 21-8 21-17 in the opening round.

On Wednesday night, star Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal’s chances of qualifying for the Olympics took a hit after she made a first-round exit, following a loss to Japanese nemesis Akane Yamaguchi.

Up against world number three Yamaguchi, it was a tough opening round for Saina, who lost 11-21 8-21 in just 28 minutes.

Saina is placed 20th on the BWF rankings with 46267 points and the 2012 London Olympics bronze-medallist needs to enter the top-16 bracket by April 28 to make the cut for the 2020 Tokyo Games.

She now needs strong performances to pocket crucial ranking points but considering that several sporting events are being cancelled in view of the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak, it remains to be seen how many she actually gets to play.

3,2020/03/12,"NBA suspends season until further notice, over coronavirus","""As we’ve said from the beginning, the health and safety of our fans, employees, players and partners is our top priority,” Orlando Magic CEO Alex Martins said

The National Basketball Association(NBA) has suspended its season “until further notice” after a Utah Jazz player tested positive Wednesday for the COVID-19, a move that came only hours after the majority of the league’s owners were leaning toward playing games without fans in arenas.

Now there will be no games at all, at least for the time being. A person with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positive was center Rudy Gobert. The person spoke to on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the team confirmed the presumptive positive test.

""The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight’s schedule of games until further notice,” the league said in a statement. “The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”

The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups and tip-off was moments away when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed “due to unforeseen circumstances.”

""It’s a very serious time right now,” Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I think the league moved appropriately and prudently and we’ll all just have to monitor the situation and see where it goes from here.”

The Jazz released a statement saying a player — they did not identify Gobert — tested negative earlier Wednesday for flu, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection. That player’s symptoms diminished as the day went along, but the decision was made to test for COVID-19 anyway. That test came back with a preliminary positive result.

""The individual is currently in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City,” the Jazz said, adding that updates would come as appropriate.

""As we’ve said from the beginning, the health and safety of our fans, employees, players and partners is our top priority and thus we fully support the NBA’s decision to postpone games,” Orlando Magic CEO Alex Martins said. “We will continue to stay in contact with the league, and local, state and federal health experts as we closely monitor this public health crisis.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ohgc5b/article31046594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSBASKETBALL-NBA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nba-suspends-season-until-further-notice-over-coronavirus/article31046596.ece
4,2020/03/12,This is how Google has blocked Amazon’s smart TV dream,"Google can revoke the software licenses from Android TV makers if they also build devices running forked versions of Android, including Amazon Fire TV, reports Protocol

Do you know why Amazon has not been able to bring its Fire TV platform on most smart TVs and cable set-top boxes globally? Blame it on Google.

Google can revoke the software licenses from Android TV makers if they also build devices running forked versions of Android, including Amazon Fire TV, reports Protocol.

Google’s licensing terms for Android — Android Compatibility Commitment — say that TV makers would no longer be able to run the Play Store and Google apps on any devices they build with other platforms like Fire TV, including phones and tablets.

“Amazon has sold millions of Fire TV streaming devices in recent years, but its efforts to expand the Fire TV platform to smart TVs and cable set-top boxes have been slow-going,” the report mentioned.

The TV makers “cannot do Android TV and Fire TV simultaneously.”

Google last year announced it struck deals with six out of 10 smart TV manufacturers and 140 cable TV operators across the globe.

Marc Whitten, VP and GM, Amazon’s Fire TV, said recently: “We don’t expect them to only use our services or our software. We think that partners should be able to pick the solutions that work for them, which may actually vary between lines of TVs, or different categories of devices and territories. I think that diversity of options is a really good thing.”

Going against Google’s licensing terms could be disastrous for TV manufacturers like LG and Samsung who also make smartphones that run Android OS.

The Google’s Android Compatibility Commitment is a confidential set of policies — formerly known as the Anti-Fragmentation Agreement — that manufacturers of Android devices have to adhere to in order to get access to Google’s Play Store and other apps.

According to Google policy, devices that want access to the Play Store must run a version of Android that’s compatible with the Google-approved version of Android.

“That means if TV makers want to have the Play Store on their TVs, they can’t make TVs with other operating systems, like, for example, Amazon’s competing Fire TV,” reports The Verge.

Manufacturers that have signed on to the Android Compatibility Commitment for their mobile phone business are effectively not allowed to build Fire TV devices.

In 2016, the European Union took on to the tech giant during its antitrust investigation of the Android OS.

The regulators alleged that the company was “preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code.”

The probe resulted in a $5 billion fine against Google, which the company has appealed against.

Both Google and Amazon are facing a tough battle against Roku in TV OS adoption.

Over 30% of all new TV streaming devices sold in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year ran Roku software, according to Strategy Analytics.

Amazon’s Fire TV accounted for 12% of devices sold, while Android TV counted for only 9%.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/1gyhsb/article31049362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12NETGOOGLEAMAZON,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/this-is-how-google-has-blocked-amazons-smart-tv-dream/article31049363.ece

Far-right terrorism and extremism are the biggest danger facing democracy in Germany today, the domestic intelligence agency chief said on Thursday, after the country was hit by several extremist attacks in recent months.

The most radical right-wingers number 32,000 in the country, said BfV chief Thomas Haldenwang, adding that 13,000 are considered potentially violent.

“Right-wing extremism and right-wing terrorism are currently the biggest danger for democracy in Germany,” he said at a press conference.

His agency also placed under formal surveillance the far-right AfD party’s most radical faction Flüegel (The Wing), which now has about 7,000 members.

Founded in 2013, the AfD has grown and shifted further right over the last seven years. Railing against Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to keep Germany’s borders open to refugees, the AfD has increased its support base. It is now the largest opposition group in the Bundestag, Germany’s lower house of Parliament.

The AfD’s most radical wing, the Flüegel, was founded by far-right firebrand Bjoern Hoecke, who has sparked outrage with statements on Germany’s Nazi past.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1qe1d5/article31052412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Thomas-Haldenwang-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/far-right-terror-biggest-danger-to-democracy-in-germany/article31052413.ece

8,2020/03/12,"Seeking contrast with Trump, Democrat Biden to give ‘presidential’ speech on coronavirus","The speech clear-eyed about the challenges we face and offer thoughtful ideas on the path forward, a Biden adviser said

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden will deliver a speech on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, 16 hours after the man he hopes to beat in November’s election, Republican President Donald Trump, addressed the nation from the White House.

The former vice president’s speech, slated for 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) will give Mr. Biden, who has criticized Mr. Trump’s response to COVID-19, a chance to portray himself as a steady, experienced hand in the face of a public health crisis.

“Today’s speech will be presidential, not political,” a Biden adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the upcoming remarks. “It will be clear-eyed about the challenges we face and offer thoughtful ideas on the path forward. It will offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president.”

Mr. Biden, who has taken control of the two-way nominating battle between him and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, will speak in his home state of Delaware.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 30-day ban on travel to the United States from Europe and promised economic stimulus measures, vowing to contain the pandemic.

But already battered global financial markets plunged again on Thursday. U.S. stock indexes were down up to 7.4% in morning trading as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq cratered into a bear market.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have been forced to re-evaluate their approach to campaigning in the face of warnings about the health dangers inherent in big crowds and handshakes, two staples of traditional political races.

Both candidates cancelled events in Ohio and dropped off the campaign trail after Mr. Biden rolled to big wins over Mr. Sanders in four of the six states that voted on Tuesday.

Mr. Biden’s campaign on Wednesday converted planned rallies in Florida and Illinois into “virtual” campaign events as the coronavirus outbreak officially became a global pandemic.

The Biden campaign created a committee composed mostly of doctors to advise on how to keep the candidate, staff and voters safe. Mr. Sanders’ campaign has said it will address plans on a day-to-day basis.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is a highly contagious respiratory illness. The number of U.S. coronavirus cases has risen steadily to 1,311, with 38 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist, said on Wednesday he would stay in the race despite his primary losses to Mr. Biden and would keep pushing for his economic and social justice agenda.

Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, will debate in Phoenix on Sunday ahead of next week’s nominating contests in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. The debate will not have an in-person audience because of health concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.

Despite his recent losses, Mr. Sanders said his anti-corporate economic agenda was gaining support from young people, who he called the future of the country. But he acknowledged that many Democratic voters still believe Mr. Biden has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, 73. “While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,” he told reporters on Wednesday in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont.

Mr. Sanders’ losses on Tuesday, coming after a series of Mr. Biden wins in last week’s Super Tuesday contests, put him in a deeper hole in the delegate count. Mr. Biden leads Sanders 786-645 in the race for the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at July’s Democratic convention.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jwd2zy/article31052206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/seeking-contrast-with-trump-democrat-biden-to-give-presidential-speech-on-coronavirus/article31052207.ece
9,2020/03/12,Coronavirus | WHO says COVID-19 is a ‘controllable pandemic’,"Tedros said countries needed to find the right balance between protecting health and preventing social and economic disruption.

The new coronavirus outbreak “is a controllable pandemic” if countries step up measures to tackle it, the head of the World Health Organization said on Thursday.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged on Wednesday that the global outbreak of COVID-19 could now be considered a pandemic — a disease actively spreading globally.

But he told diplomats in Geneva that describing the outbreak as a pandemic should not mean that countries give up the fight to stop it spreading further.

“This is a controllable pandemic,” he said, according to a statement of his remarks.

“We are deeply concerned that some countries are not approaching this threat with the level of political commitment needed to control it.

“The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous,” he stressed.

More than 4,500 people have died, according to an AFP tally, while the WHO said some 125,000 cases had been reported from 118 countries and territories.

“To save lives we must reduce transmission,” Mr. Tedros insisted.

Full coverage on COVID-19

“That means finding and isolating as many cases as possible and quarantining their closest contacts,” he said, urging states to test every suspected case of COVID-19 in a bid to slow transmission.

“Even if you cannot stop transmission, you can slow it down and protect health facilities, old age homes and other vital areas — but only if you test all suspected cases.”

The majority of cases have been in China, where the outbreak emerged in December, but major hotspots have also emerged in South Korea, Iran and Italy.

Together, those four countries account for more than 90 percent of all reported cases, according to the WHO.

'Robust surveillance'

The pandemic has disrupted cultural and sporting events around the world as authorities try to prevent large gatherings.

Mr. Tedros said countries needed to find the right balance between protecting health and preventing social and economic disruption.

However, “containment” needed to remain the central pillar in any plan to tackle the spread, he said.

“You can't fight a virus if you don’t know where it is. That means robust surveillance to find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission.”

Mr. Tedros urged unaffected countries to prepare their health facilities, and pressed all states to innovate and share any new ways to prevent infections and minimise the impact of the outbreak.

More than $440 million (390 million euros) has been pledged towards the WHO's strategic preparedness and response plan, he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7e6hzy/article31049964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TedrosAdhanomGhebreyesus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-who-says-covid-19-is-a-controllable-pandemic/article31049965.ece
10,2020/03/12,Coronavirus: Death toll in Iran from coronavirus reaches 429,"Health Ministry says 1,075 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified, 75 new deaths reported in the last 24 hours

Iran on Thursday reported 75 new deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said, bringing the death toll to 429 in the worst-hit country in the Middle East.

“We have identified 1,075 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, meaning that there are 10,075 infected people in the country. The death toll is 429,” Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state television.

The outbreak has infected a host of senior officials, politicians, clerics and members of the elite Revolutionary Guards in Iran, the fourth worst-affected nation after China, South Korea and Italy.

At least seven officials and politicians have died since Feb. 19, when Iran announced first infections and two deaths from the virus.

Iran's clerical rulers have been struggling to contain the spread of the virus, despite the closure of schools and universities and the suspension of religious, cultural and sports events across the country.

Iranian officials have repeatedly urged people to avoid unnecessary trips and stay at home.

12,2020/03/12,"Iraq fears escalation after deadly rocket attack, air strike","President Barham Saleh and Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbussi condemned a “terrorist attack” which targeted “Iraq and its security”.

Iraq and United Nations officials scrambled on Thursday to contain the fallout from an unprecedented rocket attack that killed three U.S.-led coalition members and threatened yet another escalation of Iran-U.S. tensions.

Within hours of the attack on the Taji air base north of Baghdad — the deadliest in years on a base used by U.S. forces in Iraq — an air strike killed more than two dozen Iran-aligned fighters in neighbouring Syria.

It marked a dramatic uptick in violence less than three months after rockets killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq, unleashing a round of tit-for-tat attacks between Washington and Tehran on Iraqi soil.

Fearing an even bloodier flare-up this time, Iraq officials and the United Nations were quick to condemn the deaths. Iraq's military command said it was “a serious security challenge” and pledged to open an investigation.

President Barham Saleh and Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbussi condemned a “terrorist attack” which targeted “Iraq and its security”.

The UN mission in Iraq called for “maximum restraint on all sides”.

“These ongoing attacks are a clear and substantial threat to the country, and the risk of rogue action by armed groups remains a constant concern,” it said.

“The last thing Iraq needs is to serve as an arena for vendettas and external battles.”

Briton, Americans killed

Wednesday's attack was the 22nd on U.S. interests in Iraq since late October. It saw a volley of 18 rockets slam into the Taji air base, one of about a dozen facilities across Iraq where coalition forces are based.

The coalition confirmed three of its personnel were killed and around a dozen more wounded. One of the dead was a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps, Britain confirmed. A U.S. military official told AFP the other two were a U.S. soldier and an American contractor.

There was no immediate word on Iraqi casualties. No group claimed responsibility, but Washington has accused hardline factions of Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary alliance of carrying out similar attacks.

The Hashed is a web of mostly Shia armed factions, many of which have close ties with neighbouring Iran, and has been incorporated into the Iraqi military.

In late December, the U.S. accused Iran-aligned faction Kataeb Hezbollah of killing an American contractor at a base in northern Iraq. It responded with air strikes in western Iraq that killed 25 of the group's fighters.

Days later, a U.S. drone killed senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis near Baghdad airport.

Iran then launched its own strikes on a western Iraqi base, leaving dozens of U.S. troops suffering from brain trauma. Hashed factions have repeatedly pledged to avenge Muhandis's death in their own way.

Hashed hammered in Syria

Within hours of Wednesday's attack, an air strike killed 26 Iran-aligned Iraqi fighters in neighbouring Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The Britain-based war monitor said it was carried out by three planes which probably belonged to the US-led coalition.

Iraq counts years of close ties with both Iran and the United States, and has been put in an increasingly difficult position by the spiralling tensions between its allies.

In January, Iraqi lawmakers voted to oust all foreign troops from Iraq in reaction to the killing of Soleimani and Muhandis. Some 5,200 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq as part of the coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State jihadist group.

While IS has lost all of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, sleeper cells remain capable of carrying out attacks on both sides of the border.

On Sunday, two U.S. soldiers were killed north of Baghdad while helping Iraqi forces battle IS remnants.

U.S. officials previously told AFP they considered the Hashed a bigger threat than IS, given the frequency and accuracy of rocket attacks on U.S. troops that could be traced back to the paramilitaries.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gfesmd/article31049061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12Iran-airstrike,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iraq-fears-escalation-after-deadly-rocket-attack-air-strike/article31049062.ece

Saudi Arabia has extended flight and travel bans over coronavirus fears to include the European Union and 12 other countries after announcing 24 new cases overnight to bring its total to 45, state media reported on Thursday.

Citizens and residents in the affected jurisdictions have 72 hours to return to the kingdom, state news agency SPA said, citing an official source at the Interior Ministry.

Passenger traffic through all land crossings with Jordan was also suspended, while commercial and cargo traffic is still allowed.

The kingdom had already banned travel to some 19 countries, including neighbouring Arab states, and said it would impose a fine of up to 500,000 riyals ($133,000) on people who did not disclose health information and travel details at entry points.

Other preventive measures include locking down the oil-producing region of Qatif, where many of its cases are centred, suspending the Umrah pilgrimage, closing schools and cinemas nationwide, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and postponing a G20 ministerial meeting scheduled for next week.

As well as the EU, the latest decision includes Switzerland, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

Millions of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia come from many of those countries.

The decision excludes health workers in the kingdom from the Philippines and India as well as evacuation, shipping and trade trips involving necessary precautions, the SPA report said.

15,2020/03/12,Congress acts to limit Trump on military action in Iran,"The House gave final legislative approval to the measure Wednesday, 227-186, sending it to Mr. Trump. The president has promised to veto the war powers resolution, warning that if his “hands were tied, Iran would have a field day.”

Defying a veto threat, Congress has approved a bipartisan measure to limit President Donald Trump’s authority to launch military operations against Iran.

The House gave final legislative approval to the measure Wednesday, 227-186, sending it to Mr. Trump. The president has promised to veto the war powers resolution, warning that if his “hands were tied, Iran would have a field day.”

The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., declares that Trump must win approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran. Kaine and other supporters say the measure is not about Trump or even the presidency, but instead is an important reassertion of congressional power to declare war.

Six Republicans joined 220 Democrats and independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan to support the measure. Six Democrats and 180 Republicans opposed it. In the Senate last month, eight Republicans backed the resolution.

The resolution “sends a clear message that the American people don’t want war with Iran and that Congress has not authorized war with Iran,” said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

While tensions with Iran have abated since a U.S. drone strike that killed Iran’s top general in early January, the resolution clarifying Congress’ power to declare war is still important, Rep. Engel said.

“Congress doesn’t have to wait until the president alone decides to use military force again,” Rep. Engel told House members during floor debate Wednesday. “It’s our responsibility to do something, because we know the tensions could flare up again at a moment’s notice. Iran has not been deterred as the administration promised.”

Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, called the war powers measure divisive and irresponsible and based on a false premise.

“It orders the president to terminate hostilities against Iran. The problem is, for the other side, we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran,” Rep. McCaul said.

If the US military launches strikes in Iran, I believe that the president would need to come before this body to ask for a new authorization for the use of force, Rep. McCaul said.

“But that is not what we are facing.” The House vote marked a rare exertion of authority from Congress, which also moved to impose restrictions on U.S. involvement with the Saudi-led war in Yemen last year after U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a gruesome murder at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Turkey. Mr. Trump promptly vetoed that measure.

The Democratic-controlled House passed a separate, nonbinding resolution on Iran in January, a few weeks before the Senate approved Kaine’s resolution. Two-thirds votes in the House and the GOP-run Senate would be needed to override an expected Trump veto.

Seantor Kaine hailed the House vote.

“For years, Congress has abdicated its responsibility on matters of war, but now a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and House has made clear that we shouldn’t be engaged in hostilities with Iran without a vote of Congress,” he said in a statement.

The legislation doesn’t prevent the president from defending the United States against imminent attack,” but instead demands that the decision of whether or not we go on offense and send our troops into harm’s way should only be made after serious deliberation and a vote of Congress,” Kaine added.

“If President Trump is serious about his promise to stop endless wars, he will sign this resolution into law.

In a statement of administration policy, the White House said the resolution should be rejected because it attempts to hinder the president’s ability to protect US diplomats, forces, allies and partners, including Israel, from the continued threat posed by Iran and its proxies, including militia groups and foreign fighters in Syria.

“Iran has a long history of attacking United States and coalition forces both directly and through its proxies, the White House said, adding the congressional resolution could hinder Trump’s ability to protect US forces and interests in the region.

“This joint resolution is untimely and misguided. Its adoption by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,” the White House said.

Tehran responded to the US attack on its top general, Qassem Soleimani, by launching missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house American troops. The attack caused traumatic brain injuries in more than 100 US soldiers, the Pentagon said.

Democrats and Republicans alike criticized a briefing by the Trump administration shortly after the drone strike, saying US officials offered vague information about a possible attack being planned by Iran but no substantial details.

Kaine has long pushed for action reasserting congressional power over military conflict. At the request of Republican senators, he removed initial language that targeted Trump in favour of a generalized statement declaring Congress has sole power to declare war.

The resolution also directs Trump to terminate use of military force against Iran or any part of its government without approval from Congress and commends Trump for killing Soleimani, who was long designated a terrorist by the US.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f53lej/article30953990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/congress-acts-to-limit-trump-on-military-action-in-iran/article31046988.ece

Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, a former presidential aide who still accompanies Mr. Duterte to official functions.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte would be tested for the new coronavirus Thursday after he met with Cabinet officials who were exposed to infected people and have now self-quarantined, official said Thursday.

Mr. Duterte has no symptoms of COVID-19 but wanted to make sure he is healthy and could continue to engage with the public, said Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, a former presidential aide who still accompanies Mr. Duterte to official functions.

""Considering that some Cabinet members we engage with regularly have been exposed to individuals who were tested positive of COVID-19 .... it is just prudent for us to take precautionary measures in compliance with the advice of our health officials,” Go said.

Mr. Go, who had been an aide to Mr. Duterte for years before being elected to the Senate last year, told reporters he and Mr. Duterte planned to be tested but did not elaborate.

At least five Cabinet members, including Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, have said they were exposed separately to COVID-19 patients and decided to self-quarantine, officials said.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said some finance officials who have been with Dominguez later gave a news briefing to reporters at a presidential palace briefing room, which would now be disinfected along with a media working area.

""Some members of the Malacaũang press corps who covered the economic briefing also deemed it best to undergo self-quarantine,” Andanar said, referring to journalists regularly covering presidential palace events.

Quarantines and avoiding or restricting public interactions has been a primary method of trying to prevent the spread of the virus.

Philippine health officials have reported 49 cases of infections and two people, a Chinese and a Filipino, have died.

The illness causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people but can be severe in the elderly and people with other health problems.

The 74-year-old Duterte, who skipped work due to illness a number of times last year, postponed a trip to Boracay island on Thursday due to concerns over COVID-19, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said. He had planned to travel to the famed beach resort to promote domestic tourism amid a slump in arrivals of foreign tourists because of the pandemic.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/czo8cm/article28652607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHILIPPINESDUTERTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/philippine-president-to-be-tested-for-virus-palace-cleaned/article31046938.ece
17,2020/03/12,Coronavirus: Italy shuts stores across country as death toll crosses 800,"The announcement came hours after his government promised to spend up to 25 billion euros to fight the disease

Italy on Wednesday shut all stores except for pharmacies and food shops in a desperate bid to halt the spread of COVID-19 that has killed 827 in the the country in just over two weeks.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the latest wave of restrictions in a dramatic appeal to the nation that came with the country of 60 million battling its biggest crisis in generations.

""Thank you to all Italians who make sacrifices. We are proving to be a great nation,"" Conte said in his nine-minute evening prime time address to the nation.

An existing clampdown on public gathering and basic travel had already emptied streets and shuttered everything from churches to restaurants.

Cathedrals posted hand-written notes cancelling mass and cafes apologised to their regulars for having to turn them away.

""I can't even recognise Rome now,"" 30-year-old Muscovite Yekaterina said while posing alone for a photo by the usually bustling Trevi Fountain in the heart of Rome.

Conte said the closure of nearly everything that had remained open would run for at least two weeks. How Italians will get by in the meantime is not entirely clear.

""All shops will be closed except for basic necessities, such as pharmacies and food stores,"" said Conte. ""Bars, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and canteen services will close. Home delivery is allowed. No need to rush to buy groceries,"" he stressed.

Conte's announcement came hours after his government promised to spend up to 25 billion euros ($28 billion) to fight the disease that has put hospitals and the economy under intense strain.

Total shutdown

Italy has witnessed nearly 60% of the deaths recorded outside China since the epidemic first started spreading from the Asian giant's central Hubei province in January.

The government responded to the outbreak last month by quarantining 50,000 people in 11 villages that were worst affected in the north.

That was followed on Sunday with social distancing measures in Milan's Lombardy region and surrounding areas in which more than 15 million live and 40 percent of the nation's economic activity occurs. The Lombardy measures were extended to all Italy on Tuesday morning.

Conte's announcement Wednesday ratcheted the restrictions up another notch. The multitude of measures have had a profound and slightly surreal effect on Italian life.

The central streets of Rome were deserted on Wednesday evening and buses that are usually crammed with commuters ran almost empty.

Tourists have essentially disappeared and the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square has closed to all but those who want to enter the basilica to pray under its soaring dome overlooking Rome.

People have been told to keep at least a metre (three feet) from each other and handshakes are frowned upon. Italians have found themselves starting to talk to each other a few steps apart — while often laughing about the regulations along the way.

""As soon as the emergency has passed, we will organise a free carbonara day for doctors, nurses and healthcare workers,"" a closing note by a restaurant in Rome's popular Trastevere neighbourhood said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xcty3x/article31046847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001PS95P,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-italy-shuts-stores-across-country-as-death-toll-crosses-800/article31046848.ece

Cancelling the 2020 Olympics is ""unthinkable"" although the classification of the coronavirus as a pandemic will likely have some impact on the Games, the Tokyo city governor said on Thursday.

""It can't be said that the announcement of a pandemic would have no impact... But I think cancellation is unthinkable,"" Ms. Yuriko Koike told reporters.

Doubts are increasingly being raised over whether the Olympics can be held as scheduled from July 24 to August 9.

Organisers have insisted the Games will go ahead as planned and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with whom the final decision rests, has said there has not yet been any talk of cancellation or postponement.

The IOC has said it will coordinate closely with the World Health Organization, which has now officially classified the outbreak as a pandemic.

A Kremlin envoy to the talks on the conflict in eastern Ukraine said on Wednesday that another exchange of prisoners is being negotiated.

Dmitry Kozak, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aide on Ukraine, said the lists of prisoners to be exchanged by Ukrainian authorities and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine should be verified until March 18. He added that there is a hope that the deal will be made later this month.

U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Thursday and were close to hitting their daily down limit after President Donald Trump's speech outlining the administration's response to the coronavirus epidemic disappointed investors.

S&P 500 futures fell as much as 4.7% to 2,610 points, near the daily downlimit of 2,601 points.

“Investors were expecting perhaps a more detailed outline of targeted stimulus and I think, according to the futures market at least, it left investors wanting.

23,2020/03/12,China’s coronavirus epicentre sees single-digit cases for first time,"The capital of Hubei, Wuhan, reported all of the new cases on Wednesday, the National Health Commission said on Thursday.

China had eight new coronavirus infections in Hubei province, the first time the epicentre of the epidemic recorded a daily tally in single-digits, as more businesses reopened with local authorities cautiously easing strict containment measures.

The capital of Hubei, Wuhan, reported all of the new cases on Wednesday, the National Health Commission said on Thursday.

The domestic spread of the disease has slowed markedly in the past seven days, a result of weeks of strict measures imposed to control the movement of people and traffic, including the virtual lockdown of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.

Outside of Hubei, mainland China had seven new cases, including six cases imported from abroad.

Of the six imported cases, Guangdong province accounted for three, while Gansu province and Henan province were responsible for two and one, respectively.

Overall, the 15 new confirmed cases in mainland China on Wednesday was a drop from 24 cases a day earlier.

That brings the total number of confirmed cases recorded in mainland China to 80,793. As of Tuesday, 62,793 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital, or nearly 80% of the overall infections.

As of the end of Wednesday, the death toll in mainland China had reached 3,169, up by 11 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for 10 of the new deaths, including seven in Wuhan.

The ruling Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, warned in an editorial that while the number of new virus cases in China is falling, conditions were still difficult and there were risks of further outbreaks.

As the spread of the virus slows, China is focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by strict containment policies which prevented millions of people from travelling and returning to work after extended China Lunar New Year holidays.

Factory activity plunged to its worst level on record in February, and while more businesses have reopened in recent weeks as containment measures are eased, analysts do not expect activity to return to normal levels till April.

Local governments must do their utmost to ensure people return to work as soon as possible, the official China Daily said in an editorial.

Many businesses are still facing labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions, the China Daily said.

An American soldier, a British soldier and one U.S. contractor were killed Wednesday, a U.S. official said, in the deadliest rocket attack in years on an Iraqi military base hosting foreign troops.

The attack threatens a dangerous escalation, with suspected U.S.-led coalition air strikes promptly targeting Iran-aligned Iraqi fighters in neighbouring Syria, a war monitor said.

On Wednesday evening, a volley of rockets hit the Taji air base north of Baghdad, which hosts troops from the U.S.-led coalition helping local forces battle jihadists.

A coalition official first told AFP the force had sustained “several” injuries on Wednesday ranging from “light to critical,” but a U.S. military official later confirmed three deaths.

The Iraqi military said the rockets were fired from the back of a truck, but it did not comment on any casualties.

There was no initial comment from Washington or London on those killed, nor was there an immediate claim of responsibility.

Also read | In the ruins of unilateralism

Washington has blamed Iran-backed factions from Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi military network, which is incorporated into the Iraqi state, for similar violence in the recent past.

Within hours of Wednesday’s attack, three warplanes likely belonging to the U.S.-led coalition bombed Hashed factions stationed on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.

“Ten explosions shook the area near Albukamal,” said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman, citing a Syrian border town with a heavy Hashed presence.

Hardline Hashed factions have fought alongside Syrian government forces for several years and have been targeted by both coalition and Israeli air strikes in Syria.

Wednesday’s attack on the Taji air base was the 22nd on U.S. installations in Iraq, including the American embassy, since late October.

One of the earlier attacks killed an Iraqi soldier and in late December, a spree of rockets killed a U.S. contractor working at a base in northern Iraq.

That killing sent tensions spiralling.

Two days later, the U.S. responded by bombing Kataeb Hezbollah, a faction within the Hashed that is heavily backed by Iran and which Washington has blamed for several rocket attacks.

At least 25 Kataeb Hezbollah fighters were killed and their supporters on 31 December besieged the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

A U.S. drone strike outside the Baghdad airport on January 3 killed powerful Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani and the Hashed’s deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Iran then retaliated by launching a volley of missiles at the western Iraqi base of Ain Al-Asad. While no personnel were killed in that attack, dozens of U.S. soldiers suffered from brain trauma.

The tit-for-tat attacks on Iraqi soil left Baghdad furious, and in January its parliament voted to expel all foreign soldiers from Iraq in reaction to the killing of Qasem Soleimani.

Among them are some 5,200 U.S. forces stationed across Iraq as part of the international coalition — comprised of dozens of countries — formed in 2014 to confront the Islamic State jihadist group, which took swathes of territory that year.

26,2020/03/12,U.S. Supreme Court hands Trump ‘Remain in Mexico’ win,"A federal appeals court ruled the practice illegal last month but allowed it to remain in place while the Trump administration appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court

The U.S. Supreme Court handed the White House a victory on Wednesday by allowing a policy to remain in place that allows asylum seekers to be sent back to Mexico.

The “Remain in Mexico” policy unveiled in December 2018 by the Trump administration calls for non-Mexican asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases are being decided.

Tens of thousands of asylum seekers, most of them fleeing poverty or persecution in Central American nations, have been forced under the policy to stay in Mexico while their cases are under consideration.

A federal appeals court ruled the practice illegal last month but allowed it to remain in place while the Trump administration appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court granted a stay of the ruling by the lower court pending a full consideration of the issue.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco said if the “Remain in Mexico” policy was struck down, then “substantial numbers of the up to 25,000 returned aliens who are awaiting proceedings in Mexico will rush immediately to enter the United States.

“A surge of that magnitude would impose extraordinary burdens on the United States and damage our diplomatic relations with the government of Mexico,” Mr. Francisco argued.

The American Civil Liberties Union denounced the Supreme Court order.

“The Court of Appeals declared it illegal and (the Supreme Court) should as well,” the ACLU said. “Asylum seekers face grave danger and irreversible harm every day from this policy.”

President Donald Trump has named two conservative justices to the nine-member Supreme Court since taking office, and they now outnumber liberals by a five to four margin.

The court has handed the Trump administration several notable victories on immigration in the past few months, including allowing the use of military funds to help build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

27,2020/03/12,"Activist Chelsea Manning tried suicide, say supporters","She helped leak classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan making her a hero to anti-war and anti-secrecy activists

Former U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning tried to commit suicide on Wednesday, two days before a court hearing on her refusal to appear before a grand jury, a support group said.

“She was taken to a hospital and is currently recovering,” the Sparrow Project said on its website.

Ms. Manning “is still scheduled to appear” on Friday before a judge in Virginia, who is to consider whether punishment against her will continue, the group said.

She was ordered back to jail in May last year for refusing to testify before a grand jury targeting anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.

Her leak years earlier of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan made her a hero to anti-war and anti-secrecy activists, and her actions helped make WikiLeaks a force in the global anti-secrecy movement.

“She remains unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse,” the Sparrow Project said.

“Ms. Manning has previously indicated that she will not betray her principles, even at risk of grave harm to herself.”

A judge in March last year ruled Ms. Manning in contempt of court and ordered her held not as punishment but to force her testimony in the secret case, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in the Alexandria, Virginia federal court, just outside Washington, said at the time.

She was freed in May but sent back to jail about two weeks later for still refusing to testify.

“I object to this grand jury... as an effort to frighten journalists and publishers, who serve a crucial public good,” she said in a letter to the court last year, according to the Sparrow Project.

She also has said she answered all questions about her involvement with WikiLeaks years ago.

Ms. Manning was ordered to testify earlier last year for an investigation examining actions by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2010, according to her own description, inadvertent court revelations and media reports.

At the time Ms. Manning, a transgender woman then known as Bradley Manning, was a military intelligence analyst.

She delivered more than 700,000 classified documents into WikiLeaks's hands. The documents exposed cover-ups of possible war crimes and revealed internal U.S. communications about other countries.

Sentenced in 2013 to 35 years in prison, she was released in May 2017 after the commutation of her sentence by president Barack Obama.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ih6l15/article31052668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Chelsea-Manning,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/activist-chelsea-manning-tried-suicide-say-supporters/article31052669.ece
28,2020/03/12,Bernie Sanders says still in White House fight despite Joe Biden surge,"Mr. Sanders also made clear that his main priority was to see the defeat of “dangerous” President Donald Trump

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday dashed speculation over an immediate end to the Democratic primary contest, saying he remains in the fight against centrist frontrunner Joe Biden, despite pressure to withdraw for the sake of party unity.

But in a brief, passionate speech carried on live television, Mr. Sanders also made clear that his main priority was to see the defeat of “dangerous” President Donald Trump. And he acknowledged that many Democrats see him as less electable than Mr. Biden.

Also read | U.S. Presidential Election 2020: What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?

Mr. Sanders had been holed up in his home state of Vermont overnight after suffering heavy defeats in primaries across the country Tuesday.

Speculation had been growing that he might respond to pleas from Democratic activists to step aside, giving Mr. Biden a chance to focus fully on campaigning against Mr. Trump.

Also read | Is it all over for Bernie Sanders?

But the fiery leftist broke his silence to say that despite his performance, he was still in the fight and preparing for his first one-on-one televised debate Sunday “with my friend Joe Biden.”

While he remained defiant, Mr. Sanders did make a number of unusual statements accepting his losses during the primary race and that he was “losing the debate over electability.”

Mr. Sanders then listed questions he wanted Biden to answer on how to deal with far-reaching inequality and other structural issues that he believes can only be addressed by radical economic change or “revolution.”

Appeal for unity

Mr. Biden's trajectory to a November showdown with Mr. Trump began looking unstoppable after he scooped a series of devastating primary wins on Tuesday, including in the industrial powerhouse of Michigan — a state that will be crucial in the general election.

Mr. Biden racked up wins in Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho and Michigan, building on his come-from-behind triumph a week earlier on Super Tuesday.

Addressing supporters in Philadelphia as his victory took shape, 77-year-old centrist Mr. Biden reached out to Mr. Sanders, thanking the leftist Vermont senator and his supporters for their “tireless energy and their passion.”

The former vice president under Barack Obama struck a unifying tone as he affirmed on national television that he and Sanders “share a common goal and together we will defeat Donald Trump.”

Another of the six states on offer, North Dakota, was called for Mr. Sanders early Wednesday. He also led the count by around 2,100 votes in Washington state, the other major prize of Tuesday's primaries, with around 70 percent of the vote counted.

Uniting the ticket

With Mr. Biden's path to the Democratic nomination increasingly locked in, the overwhelming question is whether Mr. Sanders will swallow his pride and get his supporters behind the candidate — or risk party civil war.

“It will be vital for Sanders to mobilize his supporters behind the ticket,” tweeted Princeton University history professor Julian Zelizer.

“But Biden has to reach out to Sanders's energized movement. It will require a two-way effort to unite the ticket.”

Many Democrats accuse Sanders and his devoted supporters of having caused fatal damage to Hillary Clinton four years ago when she was struggling — ultimately unsuccessfully — against Mr. Trump. They warn a similar scenario could play out this time.

Reflecting the shift in power, Democratic super-PAC Priorities USA, which had been neutral in the race, came out in support of Mr. Biden after Tuesday's results.

“What tonight has made clear is that the delegate math is now a straight line to Joe Biden's nomination,” chairman Guy Cecil told U.S. public radio network NPR.

“So we're going to do everything we can to help him in the effort looking forward to November.”

Adding to nerves in a country on edge after three tumultuous years under Mr. Trump, fears of the coronavirus pandemic prompted both campaigns to cancel rallies planned in Cleveland, Ohio.

29,2020/03/12,Twitter makes work from home mandatory,"Twitter announced the decision on Wednesday after “strongly encouraging” its employees to work from home earlier this month

Amid rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, Twitter is making it mandatory for its nearly 5,000 employees to work from home.

The social media company announced the decision on Wednesday after “strongly encouraging” its employees to work from home earlier this month.

“Our top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic,” Jennifer Christie, Vice President, People at Twitter, wrote in a blog post.

“To continue this push, we are moving beyond our earlier guidance of ‘strongly encouraging work from home’ provided on March 2 and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home,” she said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. The virus has spread globally, infecting over 1,18,000 people and killing more than 4,000.

“We understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times,” Christie said.

For contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their responsibilities from home, Twitter will continue to pay their labour costs to cover standard working hours while Twitter’s work-from-home guidance and/or travel restrictions related to their assigned office are in effect, she added.

31,2020/03/12,"The fascinating, yet chequered history of Kochi’s Volga Tourist Home","From Pala to Volga

In 1960s Kochi, eating out was purely aspirational. It was the exception; not the norm and people from ‘respectable families’ never ate out. To this milieu came KC Mathew with an idea so modern and so radical he knew his hometown Pala would not be able to take it.

So he opened one of Kerala’s first ever “Western-style” restaurants in Kochi and called it Volga. Situated at the Carmel Buildings on Banerji Road, it was ahead of its time in every way. One had to wear a suit to be allowed entry, it served Chinese, continental and Mughalai fare, which were exotic to this part of the world and the liquor was fancy and foreign. A live band played and a cabaret was added for effect.

A banker by profession, who managed the Delhi branch of Pala Central Bank (owned by his maternal family), one of the country’s first private sector banks, Mathew had no previous experience running a hotel. Yet, he was completely invested in the project. He travelled, did research in his own way, sent out people to head hunt for Volga’s kitchen and ran it like a professional. “Appachan wanted it to be something the city had never seen before,” says KM Alexander, Mathew’s eldest son and Managing Partner of Volga Tourist Home.

Mathew brought in chefs who had experience working in bigger cities and he ensured the décor was top notch. “The doors alone were the topic of discussion. Made of rosewood, they were heavy and inlaid with brass. They opened into a large hallway, which led to the restaurant, with an elaborately ornate false ceiling, one of the first of its kind at that time,” says Alexander. Opened in 1967, Volga was indeed the talk of the town. “When a few from Pala showed up in mundus, they weren’t allowed entry. Miffed, I think they held it against Appachan for a long time,” Alexander reminisces.

It is unclear how Mathew arrived at the name though. “He might have been inspired by the Volga, Russia’s largest river,” says Alexander. “Or perhaps, he would have come across a hotel by the same name somewhere,” offers Mathew Alexander, Mathew’s grandson, Partner of Volga Tourist Home and entrepreneur.

Tourists made up most of Volga’s customers. It even had a shuttle service that ferried tourists from the port to the hotel and back. In 1970, three years into its existence, Volga ran into troubled times. Following an issue with the trade union, the hotel was temporarily shut down. However, it reopened a few months later, cutting a few of its frills, including the dress code. But it still drew businessmen from different parts of the State, who made it a point to halt at Kochi to visit Volga. It hosted an after-party of a film award festival held in 1967, which had Sharmila Tagore and Sunil Dutt, in addition to the top stars of Malayalam cinema participating.

Volga Appachan as Mathew was fondly called, passed on in 1992. Ten years later, in 2002, Volga ran into trouble again. An anti-liquour campaign forced it to shut down the bar. The hotel functioned without a bar till 2006, but gradually shut down. When it reopened in Kadavanthra as Volga Tourist Home, a striking building in white, Volga had however, only its rich legacy to build on. Kochi had grown tremendously and other players had secured their foothold in the F&B segment. Volga Tourist Home, however, still had a set of patrons, who had seen its day in the sun, who dropped in regularly, mainly for its ginger prawn.

As we sit, mulling over Volga’s chequered history, Satheesh Shinilal, the chef, walks in bearing a plate of its historic dish — the ginger prawn. The dish remains unchanged since it was first made by Shinilal at the hotel almost 50 years ago. “It still has a devoted set of fans,” declares Mathew Alexander. The ginger chicken and ginger prawn, that old Volga served, was the stuff of fantasies.

Arun, the playful tusker Manoj Mathew, the youngest son of KC Mathew (Volga Appachan) was a well-known aana premi (elephant lover). Thanks to him, the family owned an elephant, which was brought in from Kodanad. Arun, as he was named, was mischievous and was a darling of the family. “He has all the attributes of a traditional Kerala elephant,” says Mathew Alexander. Popularly known as Volga Arun, his love for jackfruit was legendary, says Mathew. Once, while on work in an estate near Chalakkudy, Arun decided to take a break. He waded into a nearby river, and splashed around, enjoying himself. This startled a few people who worried whether he was in a state of musth. The mahout, who found him in the river, tried to call him, but Arun refused to come out. It was only after the mahout dangled a jackfruit in front of him that Arun followed him, recounts Mathew.

Arun was given away to another family in Vadakkancherry.



When one of Appachan’s managers went to Bangalore, he happened to eat at the hotel where Shinilal was the chef. Impressed by the dishes he tasted, the manager asked if Shinilal would like to come to Kochi and join Volga and he gladly agreed. “The association with Volga, which began in the 70s continues to this day,” says Shinilal. “Volga was number One those days, followed by Oberoi and then Sealord,” he adds. Shinilal doesn’t share the recipe, but what makes his dish distinct is that theprawn is always fresh, he emphasises. Alexander’s brother and Appachan’s second son, KM Paulson (Pappachan), the managing partner, ensures that the fish and meat are bought fresh.

Volga, which is now a two-star property, has a bar in the basement, and a family restaurant with a rooftop eating area as well. And the other dishes that tick the right boxes are bar snacks Kerala pork roast, the BDF (beef dry fry) and kozhi idichathu.

Not many may be aware of its history, but as Mathew Alexander says, Volga is a name that still resonates with an old timer in Kochi.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/v84f4d/article31049596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPKADAVANTHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/society/volga-the-rage-of-the-1960s/article31049610.ece
32,2020/03/12,"Deepa M makes healthy baby food, noodles and sevai with millets","Deepa M on how she began making healthier alternatives to baby food, as well as noodles and sevai, with millets

It was the task of finding appropriate baby food for her son that set Deepa M on the entrepreneurial path. Armed with a post-graduate degree in Food and Nutrition from Chennai’s Women’s Christian College, she studied the nutrition labels of various brands but found them “loaded with preservatives,” she rolls her eyes. “So I decided to make my own.”

The pause after this statement is filled with the background noise of chatter and vehicular movement, as we sit in the forecourt of Prozone Mall. Wasn’t that a rather rash idea, I ask hesitantly. “Not really. It was only a question of applying what I had learnt in college.” This happened back in 2013 and, since her classmates also worked as nutritionists, Deepa got them to approve her samples and finally zeroed in on what is now called Some More Complete Health Mix. “I would make around five kilos because neighbours, friends and relatives also bought it from me.”

This health mix is made of millets, red rice, pulses and legumes and dry fruits, with all ingredients being from organic farms in Tamil Nadu. The millets are sourced in Theni, explains Deepa, and the other ingredients from a local source in Tirupur. “The farthest is Chennai. All the items are native and organic.”

From this health mix, Deepa moved to noodles and sevai. “Both are popular tiffin items,” she smiles. Again what troubled her was that available options were mostly made of maida. So she began experimenting and came up with 10 variants of noodles all made from millets and whole wheat flour. “No additives or preservatives,” she emphasies, adding, “Even the masala that comes with the noodles is my formulation.” After her PG, she did a course in food processing, which she used to develop these products.

In the past seven years, Deepa has developed three baby food items, which retail under the brand name First Spoon. The Health Mix, Millet Noodles and Millet Sevai are sold as Some More products. “The Health Mix actually began as a weaning food for babies. Now it is a complete easy-to-digest meal.” Her second product was derived from khichdi: rice, wheat and dal mix. “I now have 24 products,” Deepa says proudly; 10 variants each of sevai and noodles and two more baby food products.

Her latest product under First Spoon is a Ragi Banana Mix made of sprouted ragi flour, dried and powdered nendrampazham, pottukadalai (fried gram) and cardamom. “Ragi is a source of micronutrients and the nendrampazham is full of prebiotics, which is good for gut health.”

Deepa works on the R&D and product development with a food scientist on her team. Once the formulation is ready, she looks for manufacturers. “I prefer to work with small-scale entrepreneurs. I am very particular about hygiene and the process of manufacturing, so I conduct periodic checks.”

Cook and see The Complete Health Mix is pretty easy to cook. For one glass (250 ml), only around 1.5 teaspoons of the mix is required. Cook it with water and add milk. Even without additional sugar/jaggery, the drink is faintly sweet with an after taste of cardamom. If you’re looking for a porridge-like consistency, then a little more of the mix will do the job.

I prefer another iteration: cook with water, pour buttermilk, mix well. Add a light garnish of finely chopped small onion, green chillies and coriander leaves. Finish with a tadka of mustard. It makes a truly delicious summer drink. One glass is quite filling and keeps you feeling comfortably full for quite some time.

For someone used to commercial brands, the taste of the Red Rice Noodles takes some getting used to. The masala has a distinct home-made aroma and flavour. Add a cup of vegetables when you cook them and one packet makes a comfortable meal for two people.

Once the product is ready, she looks after the marketing. Apart from her own websites, her products are available on Amazon and D Mart. She is in talks with Reliance and Big Basket to scale up the availability. “I hope to enter the hypermarkets soon,” she smiles. “It doesn’t take much time to launch new products but I can’t do both that and the marketing.”

Asked about reactions from her family to her business ventures, she candidly admits that there wasn’t much support initially. “My husband runs his family business and my father had his own as well. So their attitude was: ‘why do you want to work?’”

But she refused to let this deter her. “Once I proved myself and started contributing to the family income, they have come around. Now I am able to travel only because they help look after my son who’s now in class 6. We have to be persistent. One can’t say ‘I don’t have family support’ and give up,” she says firmly.

33,2020/03/12,Advice from women founders of two successful apps: Be persistent with a great idea,"Gauri Angrish and Sairee Chahal, while serving up some facts, encourage young women to get into the innovation game

While there have been successes and challenges in the path of many women developers in the country, the next decade seems uncertain. Two well-regarded professionals, Sairee Chahal, founder of the Sheroes app, and Gauri Angrish, known for starting the Caredose app, share their advice for budding developers, who want to make it big. “You have to be persistent with a great idea... and you have to push it along with serious momentum.” says Chahal.

Since 1999 she has seen some major turning points. “I’ve seen how the tech space has responded to the financial crises, which has certainly affected funding for startups — especially women-run ones. The ecosystem now, though, is ready but the resources aren’t stacked as high.”

Ask Angrish if she would have had the same opportunities as she does now, five years ago and she notes a “positive evolution for women in tech.” However, she adds, “I don’t think things have changed drastically enough to [have made] a difference in resources between now and five years ago.”

SHEROES founder Sairee Chahal

Angrish, who was working in big pharma before starting Caredose, knew of the extent of the problem of medicine non-adherence. “What got me excited about trying to solve this problem was not only the sheer patient numbers, but also the fact that the problem impacted each and every entity in the healthcare spectrum — from pharmaceutical manufacturers to health insurance companies; from providers to public health systems.”

She then quit her corporate job to open a brick and mortar pharmacy in Delhi to get a tangible idea of the problems patients, as well as those in the supply chain, face. The research then culminated in Caredose, an app which helps people keep a track of medicine dosages every day.

“I think the most impactful change has been in education. A lot of universities are building programmes that encourage women to explore the world of technology. They also carve out opportunities with companies to give students early exposure and therefore interest in tech,” says Angrish.

She says that while it has been great to see “the positive evolution towards a more equality driven mindset, we still have a long way to go.”

Caredose founder Gauri Angrish

But Chahal says that women are naturally inclined towards community building. “The next few years will see a huge growth for collaboration. Technologists often find opportunity for this when they use the same coding language. This is how the community mobilises for stronger knowledge transfer,” she adds.

Within the reality that few start-ups even make it, things are “truly more difficult for women,” Chahal says. Mental and emotional strength are important because “rejection is just a part of the game,” she concludes.

34,2020/03/12,Retail auto sales up 2.6% in Feb.,"Ecosystem focussed on liquidation of BS-IV stocks: FADA

Retail sales of automobiles in the country, as measured by vehicle registration numbers, grew 2.6% to over 17.11 lakh units in February 2020, according to data shared by Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations.

The automobile dealers’ industry body added that sales of passenger vehicles declined by 1.17% to over 2.26 lakh units last month. However, retail sales of two-wheelers stood at over 12.85 lakh units, up 1.52%, while sales of commercial vehicles grew by 13% to 92,805 units.

Additionally, three-wheeler sales were up 20.7% to 65,752 units, while tractor retail sales grew 13.52% to 41,485 units.

FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said, “February turned positive for retail sales for most of the segments as the entire auto ecosystem focussed on liquidation of their BS-IV stocks.” He, however, added that despite year-on-year sales growth, the overall retail sales were much below expectations as there was no pre-buying for BS-IV stocks.

“Rural sales contributed to retail sales turning green, with tractors also being in double-digit growth for the second month in a row,” he added. Mr. Kale said inventory levels remained a serious concern for BS-IV two-wheelers and asked manufacturers to handhold dealers for 100% liquidation of stocks before the March 31 deadline.

Lack of support

“FADA survey reveals that a very high number of two-wheeler dealers will not be able to fully liquidate their BS-IV inventory and expressed inadequate support from their OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] for 100% liquidation of this stock,” Mr. Kale said.

With regard to passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, he said the overall inventory was at a reasonable level, but the challenge remained in slow-moving, non-popular models as dealers looked for adequate OEM support for liquidation of the same in March.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/8z6lb6/article31052709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBUFADA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/retail-auto-sales-up-26-in-feb/article31052710.ece

The government is currently not considering any proposal for a relief package for the telecom industry that is reeling under severe financial stress, Parliament was informed on Thursday.

Asked whether the government was considering working on a relief package for telecom service providers and if a committee of secretaries had been constituted for the same, Minister of State for Communications Sanjay Dhotre, in a written reply to Rajya Sabha, said, “No such proposal is under consideration by the government.”

Replying to a separate question on the adjusted gross revenue-related dues, the Minister said the Telecom Department would issue revised demand notices to the telcos following a reassessment exercise on the basis of documents submitted by them in support of their self-assessed dues.

“The telecom service providers have been directed to make payments on the basis of self assessment and submit requisite documents for compliance. Following this, DoT will carry out reassessments on the basis of documents submitted by the telecom service providers in accordance with the licence agreement and issue revised demand notices,” the Minister said.

He added that the AGR case was sub-judice and in 2016 it was submitted in the Supreme Court that DoT would keep raising the demand but not insist on payments till the final judgment by the court.

“After the judgment dated 24.10.2019, the dues are crystalised and the TSPs have made some payments... The DoT has also directed the TSPs to make remaining payments vide letters dated 13.11.2019, 20.01.2020, 14.02.2020 and 04.03.2020,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/v7zzg7/article31052657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBUMOBILE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-plan-for-any-telco-package-centre-tells-parliament/article31052658.ece

The executive committee of the central board of the State Bank of India has approved purchase of 725 crore shares of Yes Bank at ₹10 apiece, the country's largest lender said in a communication to the stock exchanges.

This would mean SBI can now invest up to ₹7,250 crore in the troubled private sector lender. SBI’s shareholding in Yes Bank would remain within 49% of the paid-up capital of Yes Bank, it said.

“We advise that the Executive Committee of Central Board (ECCB), at its meeting held on 11.03.2020, accorded approval for purchase of 725 crore shares in Yes Bank Ltd. at a price of ₹10 per share subject to all regulatory approvals.

While announcing the draft plan for the reconstruction of Yes Bank after the bank was put under moratorium, RBI had said that the authorised capital would be ₹5,000 crore and number of equity shares would be 2,400 of ₹2 each, aggregating to ₹4,800 crore. RBI said that the investor bank must agree to invest in the equity of the reconstructed bank to the extent that post infusion it holds 49% shareholding at a price not less than ₹10.

The investor bank will not be able to reduce its holding below 26% before completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital, according to the draft plan. Chairman Rajnish Kumar had said the bank’s investment in Yes Bank would not exceed ₹10,000 crore.

37,2020/03/12,RBI tells States not to shift deposits from private banks,"‘Making every effort to finalise Yes Bank revival plan’

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked all State governments to refrain from shifting their deposits from private sector banks to government banks.

The move came after the Maharashtra government directed all its departments, civic bodies and semi-government corporations not to transact with private banks after private sector lender Yes Bank was put on moratorium last week.

Observing that some other State governments were also contemplating such a move, the RBI, in a strongly-worded letter to all chief secretaries of the States, said apprehension regarding safety of deposits in private sector banks was highly misplaced and such reactions would not be in the interest of the financial stability of the banking system. “We strongly believe that such a move can have banking and financial sector stability implications,” the letter said.

“We would like to point out that the Reserve Bank has adequate powers to regulate and supervise private sector banks and by using these powers it has ensured depositors’ money is entirely safe. It is pertinent to mention that the resolution of weak private sector banks in the past has been done in a manner that the depositors are not put at a loss.

“It is precisely with the view to retaining depositors’ confidence in private banks and their mitigating their hardship that, after the imposition of moratorium on Yes Bank Ltd., the RBI has drawn up the draft scheme without any delay, and we are making every effort for the finalisation of the scheme,” RBI said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-tells-states-not-to-shift-deposits-from-private-banks/article31052630.ece

39,2020/03/12,Indian airlines to continue flights to most international destinations,"Airlines to adopt wait-and-watch policy; visa ban to cripple airlines, says CAPA

Indian airlines will continue to fly to most international destinations for the time being, but with reduced frequencies, as they adopt a wait-and-watch policy following the government’s ban on entry of foreign nationals and overseas citizens of India to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Air India has cancelled its flights to Rome, Milan, Seoul and reduced its frequencies to Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid after the latest government advisory.

An Air India executive said, “the airline is holding on for sometime” from taking a decision on bulk cancellations across its international network. All Indian carriers had cancelled flights to different destinations in China such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Hong Kong in January. IndiGo informed the BSE on Wednesday that it expects “quarterly earnings to be materially impacted” after a 15-20% fall in daily bookings in the past few days. The airline also hinted in its filing that while earlier it was able to redeploy airplanes freed up due to cancellations, that may not be an option anymore as there is an overall slump in demand across international and domestic markets. An airline executive said on the condition of anonymity, “we won’t cancel all international flights, but there will be a curtailment,” adding the domestic demand had taken a hit because of worries over catching an infection.

With Indians still allowed to travel abroad, domestic carriers will continue to fly on most international routes until operating them becomes financially unviable.

Go Air has also suspended 50% of its international flights with operations to Male, Bangkok, Kuwait, Dammam and Singapore out of a total nine international destinations suspended, according to its vice-president for corporate communication Bakul Gala.

Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation P. S. Kharola held a meeting with officials of SpiceJet on Thursday. He had already met executives from IndiGo, GoAir, AirAsiaIndia and Vistara over the past few days. The Ministry will “soon” be submitting a report to the Finance Ministry on the impact on the aviation industry along with recommendations.

“This ban will cripple the industry with a very serious impact on airlines with weaker balance sheets. The domestic sector will see a further slump in demand in the next few weeks and the first quarter, which was likely to be peak travel time, has already been significantly compromised,” according to CAPA’s India CEO Kapil Kaul. The first quarter is usually a good quarter for airlines due to summer vacations when demand for travel peaks.

According to an analyses by CAPA, South-East Asia has seen the maximum percentage drop in capacity deployment for the week commencing on March 9,2020 as compared to week commencing December 2, 2019.

Deployment to China by Indian airlines has seen a drop of 96.2%, to South Korea 50%, Japan 25%, Hong Kong 100%, Thailand 64.5% and Singapore 28.8%. To India’s west, airlines have slashed capacity by 42.9% to Italy, 18.7% to U.K., 12.8% to Kuwait and 9.9% to Qatar.

Interestingly, the rate of cancellations by foreign carriers to these routes is much less — 0% change in deployment to Italy, 2.3% drop for UK, 60% to Hong Kong, 16.8% to Singapore and 1% to Qatar.

Meanwhile, Minister of State for Civil Aviation told Lok Sabha that international passengers arriving at Indian airports had fallen to 62,000 from 70,000. He said that this might come down to around 40,000 following the travel advisory issued on Wednesday.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cslwby/article31052612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBUPLANE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-airlines-to-continue-flights-to-most-international-destinations/article31052613.ece
40,2020/03/12,RBI opens dollar-swap window,"Central bank takes first step to fire-fight market volatility

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has opened a six-month dollar sell-buy swap window to pump liquidity in the foreign exchange market — the first move following financial markets in India and across the globe experiencing turbulence over the spread of COVID-19, which could lead to a slowdown in growth.

“On a review of current financial market conditions and taking into consideration the requirement of U.S. dollars in the market, it has been decided to undertake a six-month U.S. dollar sell/buy swaps to provide liquidity to the foreign exchange market,” the RBI said on Thursday.

The central bank will conduct U.S. dollar-rupee sell-buy swaps worth $2 billion on March 16, to begin with, in its effort to fight market volatility.

The swaps would be conducted through the auction route in multiple tranches and the auctions would be multiple price-based, that is, successful bids will be accepted at their respective quoted premiums.

RBI said the financial markets worldwide are facing intense selling pressures on extreme risk aversion due to the spread of COVID-19 infections, compounded by the slump in international crude prices and a decline in bond yields in advanced economies.

“It stands ready to take all necessary measures to ensure that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy are mitigated, and financial markets and institutions in India continue to function normally,” RBI said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/o751yg/article31052593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-opens-dollar-swap-window/article31052594.ece
41,2020/03/12,CAD narrows to 0.2% of GDP in third quarter,"Contraction due to lower trade deficit

The country’s current account deficit narrowed sharply to $1.4 billion, or 0.2% of GDP, in the third quarter of the current financial year from $17.7 billion (2.7% of GDP) of the same period of the previous year, latest data released by Reserve Bank of India showed.

The deficit was $6.5 billion or 0.9% of GDP in the second quarter of the current financial year.

“The contraction in the CAD was primarily on account of a lower trade deficit at US$ 34.6 billion and a rise in net services receipts at US$ 21.9 billion as compared with the corresponding period of last year,” the RBI said.

Net services receipts increased on the back of a rise in net earnings from computer, travel and financial services, the RBI said adding that private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, increased to$ 20.6 billion, up by 9% from their level a year ago.

Foreign portfolio investments recorded net inflows of $ 7.8 billion – as against an outflow of $ 2.1 billion in Q3 of 2018-19 – on account of net purchases in both the debt and equity market.

Net inflow on account of external commercial borrowings to India was $ 3.2 billion as compared with $2 billion in Q3 of 2018-19.

“There was an accretion of $ 21.6 billion to the foreign exchange reserves (on BoP basis) as against a depletion of $ 4.3 billion in Q3 of 2018-19,” RBI said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cad-narrows-to-02-of-gdp-in-third-quarter/article31052571.ece
42,2020/03/12,"GST on cellphones, fertilizers, man-made fabrics, garments may be hiked to 18%","Experts said the rate hike would improve working capital position of the manufactures as it would correct the inverted duty structure but may lead to increase in price of the finished goods.

GST rates on mobile phones, fertilizers, man-made fabrics and garments are likely to be hiked to 18% in the next GST Council meeting on March 14.

Experts said the rate hike would improve working capital position of the manufactures as it would correct the inverted duty structure but may lead to increase in price of the finished goods.

Currently, under the goods and services tax (GST), certain manufactured goods attract a tax rate of 5% or 12% while their inputs, input services and capital goods attract GST at the higher rate of 18% or 28%. The manufacturers have to claim a refund of accumulated input tax credit (ITC) where the tax rate on input is higher than the finished goods.

According to sources, the refund claimed on account of inverted rate structure is about ₹20,000 crore per year and there is a need to correct this anomaly.

Significant items in inverted rate structure are fertilizers, mobiles, footwears, man-made yarns and fabrics, renewable energy devices and tractors. A number of other smaller items such as utensils also attract inverted duty structure.

“The GST Council will take up in phases the correction of inverted duty on items as per the recommendation of the officers’ committee. On Saturday, 4 items – mobiles, fertilizer, footwear and man-made fibre, fabric and garments – would come up for correction,” the official said.

Currently, cellphones attract a GST rate of 12%, while its inputs are taxed at 18%.

“There is hardly any justification for retaining mobile at the slab rate of 12%, while many items such as TV, torches, geyser, iron, heaters, mixer, juicers, etc., attract GST at a higher rate,” the official added.

In the pre-GST era, under the dual excise scheme, a manufacturer had two options for excise duty – basic excise duty (BED) at 2% or 1% without CENVAT Credit, and BED at 12.5% with CENVAT credit. Imported mobile phones were being subjected to additional duty of customs (equal to higher of the BED) at 12.5%. In central excise, there was no provision for refund of input tax credit on account of inverted duty structure.

While fertilizer was originally placed in 12% slab, the Council later lowered the rate to 5%. A total of ₹6,000 crore have been claimed as input tax credit refund on fertilizers from July 2017 till date.

Fertilizer manufacturers have been claiming lower rate on other inputs such as ammonia and sulphur. Besides, 18% rate on services and capital goods adds to duty inversion, the official added.

The total pre-GST tax incidence, including central excise, tax on inputs, average VAT, CST and octroi, on fertilizers was estimated to be about 9.75%.

Besides, the duty inversion in man-made fibre (MMF) value chain has led to a total refund claim of about ₹1,600 crore so far on man-made yarn and another ₹2,300 crore on fabrics and other textile items.

The MMF value chain such as polyester, acrylic and viscose has unlike GST rate structure. While fibre attracts GST at the rate of 18%, their value-add products, namely yarns, attract GST at the rate of 12%. Thus, there exists an inversion at fibre to yarn stage. Fabrics, however, attract GST at the rate of 5%.

The textiles sector currently has a differential GST rate of 5, 12 and 18%. This leads to difficulty in issuing and claiming of refunds.

With regard to footwear, the Council in June last year had lowered GST rate to 5% on items worth up to ₹1,000, while those above this value attract 18% duty. However, inputs used by the sector attract GST rate in the range of 5-18%.

EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said, “An increase in the rate of GST for some of these products should help liquidating the accumulated credits and thereby bettering the working capital costs for businesses manufacturing these goods. However, the rate increase on these goods may result in price hike and, thereby, may impact demand of these goods.”

AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said, “Economy is going through a rough patch and any further increase in tax rates would run negative sentiment throughout the entire sector and push the demands further down deteriorating the overall economic stability in the country.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/j8xc3b/article31050313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Smartphones,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gst-on-cellphones-fertilizers-man-made-fabrics-garments-may-be-hiked-to-18/article31049997.ece
43,2020/03/12,NCLAT sets aside CAIT plea against CCI nod to Walmart’s acquisition of Flipkart,"A two-member Bench of the appellate tribunal said CAIT failed to establish its allegations against CCI granting approval for Walmart-Flipkart deal

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by traders’ body CAIT against CCI nod to Walmart’s $16-billion acquisition of Flipkart.

A two-member Bench of the appellate tribunal headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya said CAIT failed to establish its allegations against CCI granting approval for Walmart-Flipkart deal.

NCLAT also said Flipkart was not even made party by CAIT in its plea.

“We find no merit in it, accordingly the appeal is dismissed,” said NCLAT, upholding the CCI nod to the deal.

The appellate tribunal also observed that the deal would add value to the Flipkart platform.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on August 8, 2018 had said it has approved U.S. retail giant Walmart’s acquisition of Flipkart.

NCLAT had reserved its order on CAIT’s plea in January last year.

In the following month, NCLAT asked Walmart International Holdings Inc to file a reply before it explaining the way of doing business in India.

CAIT was also asked to file its understanding over Walmart’s business model in India.

44,2020/03/12,Coronavirus | Evacuation only for ‘compelling reasons’,"The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday advised against holding of mega sports events like IPL because of the growing threat of COVID-19.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Addressing the weekly MEA press briefing, Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi said the viral outbreak was a serious threat and Indians abroad would be tested before they were brought back from the affected countries like Italy and Iran.

“We are also analysing a lot of requests of this nature like mega sports events that are being planned in India. I think it is for the organisers to decide as to whether they want to go ahead with it or not. We will be open to the idea if they really want to do it. Our advice will be not to do it at this time but if they still want to do it, it’s their decision,” said Mr. Ravi who has been appointed as the nodal officer to coordinate India’s international efforts in response to the coronavirus crisis.

Elaborating on the evacuation efforts he said: “We need to understand that evacuation doesn’t mean that we are going to bring everybody. People who are not contaminated will be first brought in. That’s the process. The medical team will go to Italy. First there will be sample testing and those who are negative cases will be brought in. In Iran there is already a medical team stationed and the samples are coming in and these are being tested. That’s a situation we are evolving on a daily basis,” said Mr Ravi. The statement came a day after India suspended all visas except diplomatic, UN and project-related visas to deal with the threat of coronavirus which has so far affected 114 countries with Iran, Italy and China among the worst hit.

Apart from the evacuation plans, Mr Ravi referred to the factors that will determine whether individuals living in the worst hit countries can travel to India for personal reasons explaining the situation in Europe is “alarming” and advised Indians there to “stay put” and travel only for “compelling reasons”. He said that individuals willing to travel to India will be evaluated by mission heads and other diplomatic officials if they want to visit India for some urgent work and mentioned, “health reasons”, “weddings” that could possibly qualify as “compelling reasons”.

He assured that those willing for evacuation to India will be tested first by Indian medical teams in Iran and Italy where the diplomatic teams are assisting them. Indian ambassador to Iran Dhamu Gaddam said on Twitter on Thursday, that boxes bearing hundreds of swab samples are being readied by embassy personnel for transfer to India.

India also declared that it is considering requests from Iran Bhutan, Maldives and Italy for medical supplies and items to deal with emerging health requirements related to the coronavirus. “Some of the countries are quite affected in India’s neighbourhood. We sent a consignment in February to China which brought back our nationals in the return flight. We are at this moment processing such requests from Bhutan, Maldives, Iran, Italy. We can only spare items that we have at this point in time and accordingly based on the availability of such items, packages are being put together,” said Raveesh Kumar, Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rtz8vm/article30972478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CORONAVIRUS-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-evacuation-only-for-compelling-reasons/article31052945.ece
45,2020/03/12,Coronavirus | Centre justifies total visa suspension over COVID-19,"Health Minister says things are under control, no lapse in screening at airports

Amid growing concern over the spread of SARS-CoV-2, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar made statements in the Lok Sabha, detailing the government’s response to the WHO-certified pandemic.

Mr. Jaishankar defended the decision to suspend all visas, except those for officials and diplomats, arguing that “exceptional situations require exceptional response”.

Quarantine cases

“India has said that if people from certain countries are coming here, they have to go through quarantine — in certain cases compulsory quarantine and in some cases discretionary quarantine — and Indian citizens who are coming back will obviously come back to quarantine conditions if that is required,” he said.

He was responding to a remark by N.K. Premchandran of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) that “the only country which is imposing a total ban is India”.

“At this time, travel in itself is not recommended as it only heightens risks,” the Minister said.

Stating that the virus outbreak was a matter of “great concern” and the government’s initial focus is to bring back Indian pilgrims stranded in Iran, Mr. Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha that there were over 6,000 Indian nationals in various provinces of Iran. These included some 1,100 pilgrims mainly from Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir and Maharashtra.

In addition, there were nearly 300 students, primarily from Jammu and Kashmir; some 1,000 fishermen, many from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat; and others who were on longer term stay in Iran for pursuing their livelihood and religious studies.

In response to questions by MPs from the DMK (T.R. Baalu), the Congress (Hibi Eden and Manish Tewari) and the Aam Aadmi Party (Bhagwant Mann), Mr. Jaishankar detailed efforts made by the government for the safe return of the stranded Indians.

Mapping contacts

Dr. Harsh Vardhan made a detailed statement on the government’s efforts at testing, quarantine and mapping contact points of those who had been infected.

“There has been no lapse in terms of screening. I myself have spent over three hours at the Delhi airport to check our screening process. Today, we are screening at over 30 airports across the country,” he said.

“Members of Parliament should appreciate the fact that we are not getting anyone back without completion of scientific protocols, including 645 people from Wuhan, the epicentre of the disease. For Italy, too, we are trying to follow scientific protocols to bring back our people,” he said.

“Things are under control, and I request all MPs to openly discourage any large gatherings in your areas, and educate people on how they can protect themselves from the disease,” the Minister said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c7lgz1/article31052902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TH-HARSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-jaishankar-justifies-total-visa-suspension-over-covid-19/article31052903.ece
46,2020/03/12,"Parliament proceedings | No doubtful category in National Population Register, says Amit Shah","‘No documents will be asked. You are free to give whatever info you have’, says Home Minister

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday asserted in the Rajya Sabha that there would be no doubtful category in the National Population Register (NPR) even if a person failed to furnish information. He invited opposition leaders to meet him to clear all their doubts on the issue.

Also read | No foreign travel, PM Modi tells Ministers

“No documents will be asked under the NPR. You are free to give whatever information you have and need not give the information that is not available. There will be no doubtful category... no one will be marked as a doubtful citizen. And all of you [Opposition] can come to me to ask any doubts on NPR,” Mr. Shah said.

This assertion comes in the backdrop of doubts raised by many within the ruling NDA on the NPR form seeking information about the birth date and place of birth of respondent’s parents. The opposition members raised many questions on Mr. Shah’s assertions but were not allowed to speak.

Mr. Shah also sought to assure everyone that no one had to be afraid of NPR for whatever reason.

Parliament proceedings | March 12, 2020

Hate speeches

He spoke this at the end of a raging verbal duel with Congress leader Kapil Sibal. “Hate speeches started soon after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed by Parliament. Fear was instilled across the country in the minds of minority that the CAA will snatch their citizenship. Please tell me of a single clause in the law that says that citizenship of Muslims will be revoked,” he said, pointing at Mr. Sibal.

Also Read Shah contradicts himself on Delhi riots

To this, Mr. Sibal replied that the Congress never said that the CAA could revoke anybody’s citizenship but it had to be seen in connection with the NPR that would be followed by the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “It is not just about Muslims, it is also about the poor, tribals and so on. Many additional questions will be asked in the NPR and those who are unable to answer these questions will be put in doubtful category,” Mr. Sibal said.

Judge’s transfer

Mr. Shah also claimed that the issue of Delhi High Court judge Justice S. Muralidhar’s transfer was routine and was done on the advice of the collegium. Justice Muralidhar was transferred a day after he ordered an FIR in case of hate speeches delivered by BJP leaders Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Verma and Union Minister Anurag Thakur.

“The transfer orders had come on February 12 and was done on the collegium’s advice and with judges consent. You [Opposition] should know better that the government has little role to play in judge’s transfer,” Mr Shah said.

The Home Minister hit out at the opposition saying that it was unfair to say that only one judge could deliver justice. “Why do you think only one judge can do justice? I am against this mentality — why a particular judge? Won’t others deliver justice?” Mr. Shah asked.

The Left members had referred to Delhi riots as ‘state-sponsored’ terrorism. To this, Mr. Shah said would a government orchestrate riots when they were hosting an international guest. “Please use some common sense,” he said.

Riots cases

With Opposition leaders saying that there is blood on the Narendra Modi administration’s hands, Mr. Shah attempted to counter it with the claim that 76% riots cases were recorded under the Congress regime. He rattled off the major riot cases, counting only 2002 Gujarat riots under the BJP government. “Instigating riots not our nature; our nature is to stem them,” he asserted.

‘Communal virus’

Mr. Sibal initiated the discussion on behalf of the opposition. He accused the Modi government of unleashing “communal virus” and questioned why an FIR had not yet been filed against Mr. Mishra, Mr. Verma and Mr. Thakur for hate speeches just days before the riots. It amounts to “a licence to kill,” he said.

“While Delhi was burning for more than 70 hours, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remained silent,” Mr. Sibal said. He accused the Delhi police of being complicit with the rioters, citing videos of Delhi police officers breaking CCTVs. The Congress MP also cited the example of injured persons who were poked with lathis by the Delhi police and forced to sing the national anthem while they were bleeding.

Mr. Sibal said Delhi had a strong police force of 87,000 but unfortunately the riots could not be contained. He took a dig at the government saying that the Solicitor General, when asked by a judge about the FIRs, said it was not an opportune time. “When is the opportune time to file an FIR?” Mr. Sibal questioned.

‘Children worst hit’

Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien said children were the worst sufferers in the riots and “deep scars” had been left. “Genocide is a process. It doesn’t start with gas chambers, it started with inciting slogans,” Mr. O’Brien said. Referring to National Security Adviser Ajit Doval’s visit to riot-hit areas, the TMC MP asked, “If the Delhi police were doing a good job, why was the chain of command superseded and the NSA was given command?”

Mr. O’Brien equated the 2002 Gujarat riots with 2020 Delhi riots saying that the same men who were in power in Gujarat then were in power in Delhi now.

Plea for probe

Congress MP Anand Sharma sought a judicial probe overseen by the Supreme Court and said the Delhi police Special Investigation Team was not good enough to investigate the riots. “Why wasn’t curfew imposed on the first day, why no shoot at sight orders? Despite security arrangements for [U.S. President Donald] Trump, this happened,” Mr. Sharma said.

Key BJP ally Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral said Delhi riots reminded him of the 1984 riots when the city saw a similar orgy of violence. “Sir, it’s a mystery who initiated the riots only an impartial and transparent inquiry can reveal the truth,” he said.

BSP’s Ashok Sidharth said the riots had a definite pattern. The first day they were merely a clash between the anti-CAA protesters and the Delhi police, by second day it had taken a communal colour and by third day the minority community was targeted. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva taunted Mr. Shah saying that no one expected him to resign because he was not like former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri to take onus of any shortcoming. The opposition members blamed the Home Ministry and the Delhi police for the inaction.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mnl2i0/article31052886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TH-AMIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-no-doubtful-category-in-national-population-register-says-amit-shah/article31052888.ece

48,2020/03/12,"Parliament proceedings | Rajya Sabha passes IBC, mineral law Bills","Sitharamn says need for amendment in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code arose because of ‘changing requirement’

After days of disruption, the Rajya Sabha on Thursday passed two Bills —The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and The Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020.

Parliament proceedings, as it happened on March 12, 2020

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) Amendment Bill, that will help ring-fence successful bidders of insolvent companies from the risk of criminal proceedings for offences committed by previous promoters, was passed by the Lok Sabha on March 6. The Bill replaces an ordinance.

The IBC, which came into force in 2016, has already been amended thrice. Introducing the Bill, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Bill was an exact replica of the ordinance and the changes recommended by the Standing Committee of Finance would be incorporated later.

The Minister said the need for amendment in the IBC arose because of the “changing requirement” and “requirement of fine tuning” the law.

‘This is euthanasia’

Opening the debate on the Bill, Congress member Jairam Ramesh said only 10% of defaulted loans had been recovered other than seven big ones to be resolved so far. The law was brought to find a way to keep the firms afloat. However, Mr. Ramesh pointed out that out of 970 cases referred to the IBC, 780 had been liquidated, indicating a mortality rate of 80%. “This is euthanasia,” he said.

Mr. Ramesh said that against admitted claims of ₹3.51 lakh crore, ₹1.50 lakh crore had been recovered by way of auctioning the defaulting firms to new buyers. The recovery was 43%, implying that banks took a hair cut of 57% on their loans, he said.

If the big seven firms — Electrosteel, Bhushan Steel, Monnet Ispat, Essar Steel, Alok Industries, Bhushan Power & Steel and Jyoti Structures — were excluded then the total recovery was 10%, he said, “This means banks took hair cut of 90%.”

‘Protect MSMEs’

He wanted a clause in the law that directed the small and micro enterprises to continue supplying goods and services to the defaulter firm dropped since this would hurt the MSME sector. “You should not sacrifice the interest of the MSME sector,” the Congress member said.

Many members expressed concern over the clause on homebuyers, treating them differently from financial creditors. The law says that the homebuyer can initiate insolvency proceedings against the builder only if 10% of the applicants come together. Samajwadi Party’s Ravi Prakash, BJD’s Amar Patnaik and CPI(M)’s K.K. Raagesh raised the issue.

Minister clarifies

Speaking later, Ms. Sitharaman said the government was taking care of the interest of homebuyers and the requirement of minimum number of homebuyers in the IBC had been included to avoid “frivolous litigations.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/i66b38/article31052785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-RAJYASABHA-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rs-passes-ibc-mineral-law-bills/article31052728.ece

Denying that Italy has been lax in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Italian Ambassador to India Vincenzo de Luca has said that the government in Rome took “immediate, progressive and serious” actions to contain the virus.

Italy has emerged as one of the worst-affected countries after the virus manifested in China’s Hubei province and has now spread to most parts of the world.

After Wednesday, when Italy saw a 30% jump in deaths due to the virus within a day, with more than 800 dead and about 12,500 people infected, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a shutdown of all commercial establishments except grocery stores and pharmacies.

Cites WHO praise

Asked if the measures came too late, Mr. Luca said even the World Health Organisation (WHO) had praised Italy for responding “energetically”.

“Since the beginning of the emergency, our government adopted restrictive measures that were extended to the whole national territory: Italy is in lockdown. Severe restrictions to mobility, except for very limited purposes, are in force. These measures have already proven to be effective in those territories that were the first to adopt them,” he said in written responses to The Hindu.

Given the large number of cases in Italy, and confirmed infections in as many as 15 Italian tourists as well as several Indians who either came into contact with them or had returned from Italy, New Delhi has decided to block any passengers from boarding flights to India from any Italian airport without undergoing COVID-19 tests there. The move has led to more than 300 Indians being stranded at Italian airports.

According to Mr. Luca, the Indian Embassy in Rome and the Embassy of Italy in Delhi have been “working closely” and a task force has been set up in Delhi along with the Ministries of External Affairs, Health and Family Welfare and Tourism.

He did not, however, provide details of how stranded Indians would be looked after as they await Indian medical teams and three special relief flights to evacuate them over the next few days.

On a day the stock markets in India tanked, addressing a press conference, Mr. Gandhi said “it is just the beginning of a tsunami and things are going to get much worse”.

“We can see what is happening to the stock market. The economy has been destroyed by Mr. Modi’s ideology and his policies,” he told reporters outside the Parliament House.

‘Buffer is gone’

The former Congress president said that a flawed demonetisation policy destroyed India’s informal economy and millions of the citizens continued to suffer. “In 2008, there was a shock wave similar to this, but the Indian economy was protected by our policies. Everybody was saying that Europe and the U.S. are decimated but our policies protected India. Let me tell you that the informal economy protected India at that point. The money that people had kept in their houses protected India at that point. With demonetisation, you have taken that buffer out, you have taken that shock absorber out. Now, you are going to face the full shock that you didn’t face in 2008,” he said.

﻿The Army is incurring an expenditure of ₹3.5 lakh per day to run the quarantine facility at Manesar for persons suspected of being infected with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and 60 personnel have been committed to run the facility, Army officials said on Thursday. Some of those quarantined have been demanding special facilities, resulting in some arguments, officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“While the facility is deemed to be an emergency facility responding to emergency requirements given by the Government, those managing the facility have indicated that many detainees demand special facilities like independent rooms thus creating hindrances in smooth functioning of the medical and administrative staff at the facility,” an official said.

Observing that people brought in had already travelled together, the official asserted that there was not much merit in putting people in an individual quarantine space for 14 days. “Despite differing individual preferences and demands, the army has gone about doing their job in the best possible way,” the official added.

Till date, a total of 455 individuals who had arrived from Wuhan (248), Japan (124) and Italy (83) had been quarantined in three batches at Manesar. The emergency quarantine facility can accommodate 300 people and those quarantined are monitored for a period of two weeks as per established procedure.

With the government set to bring back more Indians from abroad, Col Anand added, “We are expecting more citizens to be brought back in the next few days. We are ready with the facilities at Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Deolali, Jhansi, Gorakhpur, Kolkata, Chennai and Suratgarh.”

56,2020/03/12,Online tools for teachers and students to hold virtual classes during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Many educational institutions are increasingly switching to online instruction.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on Wednesday. Many schools, colleges and universities are closing down their premises to reduce the spread of infections. And many of these educational institutions are increasingly switching to online instruction.

Harvard University asked its students to not return after the spring break ending on March 23. It has asked students residing on campus to vacate in five days and to not return until the end of the semester. During this period, the Ivy League university plans conduct virtual classes.

Stanford University said in a statement that it will begin its spring quarter on time, but will use virtual learning instead of in-person classes. The reaction to COVID-19 is same across many campuses in the U.S. and several other countries.

Thirty-nine countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, north America and South America have announced or enforced school and university closures as on March 11, according to UNESCO. Twenty-two countries have closed schools nationwide, impacting about 37.23 lakh children and youth.

As a growing number of countries are resorting to school and university closures, there are some online tools that educators and students can use to teach and learn virtually.

Classdojo is a free educational app that enables teachers, students and parents to interact online. It allows teachers to create a virtual classroom in which they can share videos and pictures. An account on the app can be created only by the teacher. The student can access the virtual classroom with an access code sent by the teacher.

EkStep is an on-demand platform that allows educators to create, share and distribute free community-sourced educational content for K-12 class students. The app is loaded with several educational videos that students can access any time and learn in a self-paced way.

57,2020/03/12,Analysis: Scindia’s rising discontentment in Madhya Pradesh was obvious,"Yet the Congress plunged itself into crisis by downplaying differences, snubbing detractors, or simply looked the other way

During the 14-month tenure of the Madhya Pradesh government, ominous signs of Jyotiraditya Scindia’s seething revolt were read accurately, and astutely, by a political party, though on the wrong side of the spectrum — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress, on the other hand, took him for a fusspot, downplayed differences, snubbed detractors, or simply looked the other way.

Also read | Jyotiraditya Scindia is BJP's Rajya Sabha candidate from Madhya Pradesh

If the January 2019 meeting after the Assembly elections, between the BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan, denied the Leader of the Opposition’s post, and Mr. Scindia, denied the Chief Minister’s post, failed to rouse the Congress, at least his support for Article 370’s dilution; the erasure of references to the posts Mr. Scindia has held with the Congress from his Twitter handle (the “former Union Minister, MP of Guna” is now described as “public servant, cricket enthusiast”); his unhappiness with the survey of damage caused by the 2019 floods and claim that poll promises were unkept, pointed to only one direction — an imminent cutting of ties. Still, his undue advice to Chief Minister Kamal Nath to “listen to others” was too sinister to go unnoticed.

Full circle

At the “courtesy meeting” with Mr. Chouhan at his residence, he hinted at burying the hatchet after the election by saying “raat gayi toh baat gayi”. The BJP on the stump, especially in his Gwalior-Chambal stronghold, had mocked his titular title: “Maaf karo Maharaj, hamara neta toh Shivraj (‘Sorry Maharaj, our leader is Shivraj’). On Wednesday, Mr. Chouhan, coming a full circle, stated: “Today Maharaj and Shivraj have become one,” this time, in the presence of Mr. Scindia’s aunt Yashodhara Raje, a BJP MLA, while in New Delhi Mr. Scindia praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership after joining the party.

In 2018, the denial of Chief Minister’s post to him was reminiscent of his father Madhavrao Scindia’s fate in 1989, when a scam forced Arjun Singh to step down, but still he made sure Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi spurned the scion of Gwalior’s erstwhile royal family.

Also read: Opinion | A self-created political decline

Second-most popular

Mr. Scindia toured around 100 segments in the run-up to the election and was the second-most popular leader after Mr. Chouhan, the former chief minister who strode ahead by 10%-12% points, according to a CSDS-Lokiniti survey. If during the Lok Sabha election, a BJP candidate secured the mandate to re-elect Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister, the Assembly election brought back Congress that rode on Mr. Scindia’s popularity, with his appointment as Chief Minister as the logical end. Refusing to settle for the Deputy Chief Minister’s post, Mr. Scindia was placated by close friend Rahul Gandhi to accept Mr. Nath instead.

Also read | Cong. seeks disqualification of six Madhya Pradesh Ministers loyal to Scindia for anti-party activities

Ahead of the Lok Sabha election, Mr. Scindia stood alienated and diverted from his bastion, Guna, seeking to guard it a fifth time, after being made All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge for west Uttar Pradesh. His absence afforded Mr. Nath, who had accommodated six Scindia loyalists in the Cabinet, room to manoeuvre, and stave off easily any possible nitpicking by Mr. Scindia. This cost him the seat, from where the family had won 14 times, foreclosing his only option to retain an official responsibility. Even 11 months later, the humiliation stuck with him. In Shivpuri district in October 2019, he told reporters: “I am hurt by the Lok Sabha results. But I will continue to work for my area.” After the Congress rout, the self-inflicted receding of Mr. Gandhi to the background has almost been coterminous with Mr. Scindia’s loss of prominence within the Congress.

The first clear sign of factional rift between Mr. Scindia and Mr. Nath came rather obliquely in the form of Ministers from both sides squabbling in a Cabinet meeting in June, days after the Congress secured the Chhindwara seat, the Nath family’s base, the only one of the 29 seats in the Lok Sabha election. A Minister close to Mr. Nath interjected Pradyumna Singh Tomar while speaking, symbolising an open cornering of the Scindia faction, prompting the Chief Minister to intervene.

Amplified nationally

Then in August, Mr. Scindia’s dissent amplified nationally, with his backing for diluting Article 370, opposed by the Congress in Parliament. Flirting with the idea of his changing ranks, the BJP in Bhind put up a poster congratulating him for supporting the Centre’s decision, positioning Mr. Scindia, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Mr. Modi in the same frame. Still, to the Congress, the episode seemed too trivial to take notice. Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava even called upon him to quit the party.

Also Read Analysis | Jyotiraditya Scindia revolt a likely turning point in tussle within Congress

Although Mr. Scindia had publicly nursed the idea to be the Chief Minister, later he too often said he never ran after post or power. Yet, his supporters relentlessly and openly vouched to make him the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief, another portfolio with Mr. Nath, to secure a Rajya Sabha ticket for him, and pledged allegiance even if he abandoned the party.

Several signs

While in August, a loyalist threatened to quit the party along with 500 workers if Mr. Scindia was kept at bay from the State’s politics and not made PCC chief, in November an MLA stated he would be the first to quit the party if Mr. Scindia did, in January this year an MLA sat on dharna in the Assembly claiming poll promises were not kept, and another leader in February implored him to revive his father’s defunct party. During each of these episodes, Congress spokespersons told The Hindu infighting within the party was a spectre conjured up by the BJP to stoke anxiety and divert attention from governance.

The only time the Congress’s central leadership took notice was when Forest Minister Umang Singhar wrote to Sonia Gandhi, alleging Digivijaya Singh was attempting to destabilise government and interfering in it. While Mr. Scindia backed the Minister, Mr. Nath said only he was in-charge of the government, denying the charge, further alienating Mr. Scindia. Sonia Gandhi had later sought a report, but no disciplinary action was taken.

BJP’s estranged ally

The BJP noticed an ally in him, estranged from his own party, for the first time in October when Mr. Scindia claimed farm loan waiver, a poll promise that former party chief Rahul Gandhi had said would be kept within ten days of coming to power, was not fulfilled even in October. Mr. Chouhan then conveniently trained guns on Mr. Nath telling him “your own people are showing you the mirror”. Mr. Nath has since persistently tried to defend the fulfilment of the promise that fetched the Congress crucial votes of OBCs (Other Backward Class) who make up over half the State’s population, but it never struck a chord with the electorate.

But things turned ugly this February, when Mr. Scindia, three months after erasing references to his positions in the Congress on his Twitter handle, threatened to hit the streets if poll promises remained unkept, a challenge Mr. Nath did not savour, and said: “toh utar jaaye” (‘so let him descend’). Later, the eerie connection between Mr. Scindia and Mr. Chouhan was unwittingly admitted by the Chief Minister himself, when he said : “How could I be angry with him when I couldn’t be with Mr. Chouhan,” proverbially pointing to the crisis the Congress government has plunged itself into now, capped with the exit of Mr. Scindia from the party after 18 years.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/336u7m/article27070364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JYOTIRADITYASCINDIA-BL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-scindias-rising-discontentment-in-madhya-pradesh-was-obvious/article31049971.ece
58,2020/03/12,Opposition warns government against Railway privatisation,"S.S. Palanimanickam said there should be a separate Railway Budget that will encourage the Rail Ministry to discuss demands of various railway zones.

The Opposition on Thursday demanded that the government not undertake privatisation of railways and come out with a separate Rail Budget to better analyse the performance.

Also Read Metro Man rues end of rail budget

Participating in a discussion on demands for grants of the Ministry of Railways in Lok Sabha, M.K. Raghavan (Congress) said the BJP government has shown consistent apathy towards railways in the last five years and the dismal performance is visible in the high operating ratio, which is the worst in last 10 years.

“Railways is a services sector. BJP is unaware of reasons for establishment of railways. Railway is not an engine to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, it is for poor man’s service,” he said.

Mr. Raghavan said the focus of the Union Budget on railways is cursory and reveals neglect. There is a drive to sell off public assets and a colossal failure in its management, he said.

“This Budget is a call for privatisation and eventual selling off of railways which is the lifeline of Indian people,” he said.

S.S. Palanimanickam [DMK] said the BJP government is moving towards privatisation of railways.

“Air India is on verge of privatisation, land and sea transport have already been privatised. I suggest just give up the idea of privatisation of railways,” he said.

Mr. Palanimanickam said there should be separate Budget which will encourage the Rail Ministry to discuss demands of various railway zones.

“Earlier there was separate budget for all zones. The Rail Minister used to hold meeting with MPs to know demands of zones, but now no such meetings take place,” he said.

The government had merged Railway Budget with General Budget from 2017-18 onwards, ending a 92-year old practice of a separate budget for the country’s largest transporter.

The presentation of separate Railway Budget started in 1924, and had continued even after Independence as a convention rather than under Constitutional provisions.

Noting that railways is now appointing only contractual labourers, Mr. Palanimanickam said, “If you have the mindset to privatise, how can you save railways?”

Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh on Thursday filed his nomination in Bhopal for the March 26 Rajya Sabha election.

Mr. Singh reached the State Assembly secretariat around 12.30 p.m. and submitted his papers to the returning officer and Vidhan Sabha Principal Secretary A.P. Singh.

He thanked Congress president Sonia Gandhi, and party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for reposing faith in him and nominating him for a second term in the Upper House of Parliament.

Three Rajya Sabha seats from Madhya Pradesh, currently held by Digvijaya Singh, and BJP leaders Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatiya, are falling vacant next month.

The Congress has re-nominated Mr. Singh, while the BJP has named former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the saffron party on Wednesday, as its Rajya Sabha poll nominee from Madhya Pradesh.

Both the Congress and BJP are sure to win one seat each and a keen contest is likely for the third one.

Union Minister Ramdas Athawale and BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale, the 13th direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, also filed their nomination papers for the poll from Maharashtra.

Mr. Athawale is president of RPI(A) and a BJP ally while Mr. Bhosale is a former Lok Sabha member from Satara in western Maharashtra.

Mr. Bhosale won last year’s Lok Sabha poll but quit the NCP to join the BJP on the eve of State Assembly polls held in October. He contested the Satara Lok Sabha bypoll as BJP nominee but lost to NCP.

63,2020/03/12,"‘Name and shame’ posters: Supreme Court refuses to stay Allahabad HC order, refers appeal to larger Bench","On March 9, the High Court ordered district and police authorities in Lucknow to ‘forthwith’ remove banners displaying personal details of persons accused of ‘vandalism’ during the anti-CAA protests in December 2019

A Vacation Bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday did not stay an Allahabad High Court order to district and police authorities in Lucknow to “forthwith” remove roadside banners displaying the personal details of select persons accused of “vandalism” during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in December 2019.

The High Court Bench led by Chief Justice Govind Mathur had on March 9 held that the way-side posters were a violation of individual privacy, a fundamental right which globally “underpins human dignity and key values of a democracy”.

On Thursday, the Vacation Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose did not interfere with the High Court order.

Noting that the controversy involved “issues which needs further elaboration and consideration”, the Vacation Bench referred the appeal filed by the Uttar Pradesh government to a larger Bench, to be set up by Chief Justice of India S. A. Bobde “immediately”.

It ordered the case to be listed before an appropriate Bench in the coming week. The Supreme Court reopens after Holi vacations on March 16.

Significantly, the Allahabad High Court had ordered the Lucknow District Magistrate and police chief to remove the posters without delay and file a compliance report on March 16. With no express stay of the High Court order by the Supreme Court, it is to be seen if the State would comply and take down the posters.

‘Not covered in law’

During the hearing, Justice Lalit orally remarked that State’s action of displaying the names and personal details of people on roadside banners was not “covered in law”.

Justices Lalit and Bose said there was a difference between videographing a person’s unsocial or riotous behaviour as evidence and the State displaying personal details and photographs of citizens.

The posters had come up even before the 30-day deadline to pay the compensation was over, the Supreme Court found.

Did the State have a right to display their faces in the public domain and give rise to a presumption that they were guilty for all time to come, the court asked the Uttar Pradesh government.

“On one side, there cannot be vandalism. Wrongdoers have to be brought to book. But can the State go two stages beyond and start displaying their faces on posters?” Justice Lalit asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Uttar Pradesh government.

“Do you know the difference between what an individual and a State can do? An individual can do anything not prohibited by law. A State can do only what the law empowers it to do,” Justice Bose addressed Mr. Mehta.

Mr. Mehta argued that the crux of the High Court order was the right to privacy of individuals featured in the posters. These people were not arbitrarily picked.

A competent authority had applied its mind on 95 cases of vandalism during the anti-CAA protests. It had examined records, issued notice and heard everyone. Finally, 57 people — all featured in the posters — were held responsible, the law officer argued.

“Privacy has many dimensions. If you wield your gun in a riot, you cannot turn around and claim privacy,” Mr. Mehta argued the State’s appeal.

He quoted judgments from foreign jurisdictions to justify the posters.

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi and advocate Shadan Farasat, appearing for a former IPS officer who features in the posters, said the banners were part of a “name and shame” policy against anti-CAA protestors.

“Uttar Pradesh, a State the size of Europe, has an official policy to name and shame me by putting up my posters across its length and breadth... Even in the case of child rapists and murderers, do we put out their posters? Since when do we have in this country a policy to name and shame them. If there was such policy, an accused on bail walking in the streets would be lynched... Putting up such posters is an open invitation from the State to come and lynch me, to hit me and spit at me. The idea here seems to be though there is no evidence to convict me, there is enough to hang me from the nearest lamp post,” Mr. Singhvi argued.

‘Open invitation to mob’

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, for another individual on the posters, said there was no video testimony to support the accusation of vandalism.

Mr. Gonsalves said he was representing a lawyer, Mohammed Shoaib. “He has represented minorities in many cases. My picture on a poster is an open invitation from the State to the mob to enter my home and assault me and my family. This is the grossest of acts,” Mr. Gonsalves submitted.

‘Vindictive State’

Senior advocate C.U. Singh said the act of putting up posters reeked of a “vindictive State”.

Justice Lalit reiterated that the question before the courts was whether the “the State machinery and apparatus was justified in resorting to such an act”.

On March 9, the High Court justified its suo motu intervention in the issue, saying that public display of the personal details of citizens on road-side banners was an “undemocratic functioning of government agencies who are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in a manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values”.

It had said the “placement of personal data of selected persons reflects colourable exercise of powers by the Executive”.

The banners had come up at a major road side with personal details of those accused of vandalism during the anti-CAA protests. The posters sought compensation from the accused persons and further to confiscate their property, if they failed to pay compensation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m79z6j/article30998200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bannerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/name-and-shame-posters-sc-does-not-stay-allahabad-hc-order-refers-appeal-to-larger-bench/article31048157.ece
64,2020/03/12,"Parliament passes amendments to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, 2020","The Bill was passed by voice vote in Rajya Sabha.

Parliament on Thursday passed amendments to the insolvency law that will help ring-fence successful bidders of insolvent companies from risk of criminal proceedings for offences committed by previous promoters.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was passed by voice vote in Rajya Sabha. It was approved by Lok Sabha on March 6.

The Bill replaces an ordinance.

Replying to a short debate on the Bill, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said amendments are sync with time and also adhere to a Supreme Court order in “letter and spirit.”

The Minister said need for amendment in the IBC arose because of “changing requirement” and “requirement of fine tuning” the law as several MPs wanted to know why the government was bringing in so many amendments to a new law.

Stressing that the government is “very responsive” and has been talking to the industry, she assured the House that amendments to the IBC are are not being “unthinkingly done.”

The IBC, which came into force in 2016, has already been amended thrice.

Ms. Sitharaman said the government was taking care of the interest of home buyers and the requirement of minimum number of home buyers in the IBC has been included to avoid “frivolous litigations.”

The Bill seeks to remove bottlenecks and streamline the corporate insolvency resolution process. It aims to provide protection to new owners of a loan defaulter company against prosecution for misdeeds of previous owners.

India was testing samples taken from the citizens stranded in Iran and would soon operate a limited number of commercial flights to evacuate them, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar informed the Lok Sabha on Thursday.

Making a suo moto statement, the Minister acknowledged that the novel coronavirus crisis was a serious issue and officials on both sides were working on the plan.

“As per available information, there are over 6000 Indian nationals in various provinces of Iran. These include about 1,100 pilgrims mainly from the Union Territories of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir, and the State of Maharashtra; 300 students mainly from Jammu and Kashmir; about 1,000 fishermen, including from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat; and others,” said Dr. Jaishankar. Certain protocol would be followed in ensuring the evacuation of the citizens.

The region where most of the fishermen were located was not impacted by the outbreak. Over the last one week, India had sent a team of six health officials to set up a laboratory there. “The first batch of 108 samples were received in India on 7 March. These were tested and 58 Indian pilgrims [26 men, 31 women and 2 children], who tested negative, were repatriated in a special C-17 flight on March 10,” said Dr. Jaishankar. The same flight brought back samples of 529 more Indians and they were being tested in the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Out of these samples, 299 have tested negative and work on the rest was on. Iran had been witnessing an extreme case of the viral outbreak, causing anxiety among the Indians living there and they have been urging the Indian government to evacuate them at the earliest.

“We are working with the Iranian authorities to operate some limited commercial flights for facilitating early return of the remaining Indians after testing them,” the Minister said, adding that preparation was under way for the same.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8gkspi/article30967268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SJAISHANKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6000-indians-in-iran-efforts-on-to-bring-them-back-jaishankar/article31047780.ece

Petitioner-advocate Mohan Babu Agarwal told a Vacation Bench, led by Justice U.U. Lalit, that holding the IPL, starting on March 29, would constitute a risk as crowds of over 40,000 would flock stadia across the country, foreign delegates would come and the matches would go on for most of the next two months.

But Mr. Justice Lalit, without opining on the merits of the petition, said the Vacation Bench was set up for a specific purpose, which did not include an urgent hearing of petitions to reschedule IPL matches. The Bench asked the lawyer to plead for an urgent hearing before the Regular Bench when the court reopens after the Holi vacation on March 16. “This is not a matter which cannot wait till the re-opening of the court,” Mr. Justice Lalit said.

Mr. Agarwal told the court that players, commentators and broadcasters from the affected countries might come to India for the matches, leading to the spread of the virus. “IPL is just a domestic professional tournament with no contribution to ICC records and is a private tournament, and the risk in the times of COVID-19 [coronavirus] is quite high, owing to a huge crowd gathering, including players, staff and cheerleaders,” the petition said.

The New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Rajasthan Electronics and Instruments Limited (REIL), a Central Public Sector undertaking, to develop charging infrastructure in 32 locations covering Vijayawada, Guntur, Kakinada, and Tirupati for electric mobility.

Ramana Reddy, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, NREDCAP, on Thursday discussed with Rupesh Chawla, Deputy General Manager, REIL, about development of charging infrastructure in the State. He said works on the project would start in a month.

Explaining about the charging options for electric vehicles, he said two-wheelers would have the options of Slow Charging (SC)/ Battery Swapping (BS) at a private charging facility and slow charging at a Public Charging Facility. Owners of three-wheelers could opt for SC/BS both at private and public charging stations; passenger vehicles (cars) would have SC/BS at private station while at public charging stations, they would have the option of Fast Charging (FC) and buses could either opt for SC/BS at private charging station or FC/BS at a public charging facility.

Privately owned two-wheelers and cars can opt for BS only at a private charging infrastructure, while for three-wheelers, BS is proposed to be made available in a private facility.

Exclusive transformer

Every public charging infrastructure will have an exclusive transformer with the related sub-station equipment, including safety application, if required and adequate space for charging and entry/exit of vehicles.

Speaking to the media here, the Collector said the health and medical department was fully geared up to tackle any threat. “As thousands of pilgrims visit Tirumala, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, from all over the world, every day, the surveillance on COVID-19 has been mounted at the Tirupati airport, besides covering individuals who return from foreign trips,” he said.

All the medical and paramedical personnel were instructed to keep a watch on the reports of the suspect cases. “The individuals and families, who return from foreign trips, should opt for self-quarantine at their respective houses for 28 days, in view of their safety,” he said, adding that a special centre has been set up Tiruchanur for suspect or positive cases.

The Collector said that earlier the test samples used to be sent to Hyderabad and Pune for confirmation of the virus, but now the facility was created at SVIMS Hospital in Tirupati.

72,2020/03/12,Medical shops told to sell masks at lower price,"Kurnool drug dealers’ association to sort out supply, pricing issues

As the demand for masks has gone up due to COVID-19 concerns, the district drug dealers’ association has advised all the chemists in the district to sell masks at a reduced price.

“While the intensity of the virus is not high in Andhra Pradesh, it has caused a lot of concern among people and demand for masks as well as sanitisers has increased,” said Y. Pullaiah, the general secretary of the association, while addressing reporters here on Thursday.

He claimed that the suppliers had also increased the prices, hoping to make a quick buck taking advantage of the situation. “However, we have told all chemists to sell them at less than the MRP,” he added.

People could inform the association if any medical shop was selling masks at an inflated price. “We will initiate necessary action against them. Recently, a medical shop was shut down for seven days by the government for selling masks at a higher price,” he added.

Because masks were not considered drugs, all kinds of stores were selling them. “Masks are being sold in kirana shops, general stores and even on the roadside,” Mr. Pullaiah said, and advised the public to purchase them from chemists.

“As the demand has gone up, there would naturally be a shortage. We are working towards solving that issue,” he said.

Responding to a query, he said that a meeting over pricing issues would be held with taluk heads next week. “We also are planning to distribute masks in government schools, once the supply stabilises,” Mr. Pullaiah added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/medical-shops-told-to-sell-masks-at-lower-price/article31052748.ece
73,2020/03/12,Former chairperson’s family miffed over denial of tickets,"Avanapu family likely to approach YSRCP chief

Former municipal Chairperson Avanapu Suribabu’s family has reportedly decided to approach the Chief Minister and YSR Congress Party president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy over denial of tickets to their supporters for the ensuing Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation elections.

Mr. Suribabu’s family is said to have close relations with Mr. Jagan as it was instrumental in organising Odarpu Yatra in 2010, laying the foundation for the YSRCP in the district headquarters. Neither Mr. Suribabu’s wife Avanapu Chinnammalu nor his sons Vikaram and Vijay were given tickets to contest as corporators, which came as a shock to the family and their supporters who have a strong presence in more than 15 wards in the district.

YSRCP district general secretary Kalla Gowri Sankar, who has close relations with Avanapu’s family, said that the injustice would be brought to the notice of Mr. Jagan. “In spite of the disappointment, we have decided to extend wholehearted support to the party candidates in all wards. The party’s victory in the first corporation elections is important for us,” he said, while speaking to the media.

Vizianagaram MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy announced the list of candidates for all the 50 divisions.

According to sources, he is also unhappy as his daughter Sravani’s immediate elevation is not possible with the reservation of Mayor’s seat for BC women.

Kolagatla’s supporters contend that Avanapu’s family had not cooperated with him in 2014 and 2019 elections.

Top brass concerned

Meanwhile, the YSRCP high command is worried over the infighting among the various groups in spite of its relentless efforts to bring unity ahead of the municipal elections. With the directive from the party headquarters, Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana has reportedly directed Avanapu Suribabu’s family to cooperate with Mr. Veerabhadra Swamy since the Chief Minister is very particular about the party’s victory in civic polls.

Mr. Satyanarayana’s nephew and political coordinator Majji Srinivasa Rao has already held discussions with Avanpu family and sought their cooperation.

Accompanied by Joint Executive Officer P.

Gouthami to oversee the arrangements being made at the venue.

The preliminary inspection ahead of the annual event comes in the wake of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s decision to participate in the celestial wedding of Lord Rama and Sita at Vontimitta. “Every year we are bettering our development activities at this historical place and this year’s addition are the permanent sheds,” Mr. Singhal told the media.

The customary ‘Talambralu’, to be used during the wedding ritual and later distributed among the participating public, is getting packed in sachets to ensure easy distribution.

77,2020/03/12,"YSRCP’s long, arduous trek to power","Ten years on, party seeks to stitch a wider social base

On a muggy afternoon, Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy was to address a public meeting at Pavurala Gutta, the foothills of Nallamalla Hills in Kurnool district, where his father the then Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy died in a helicopter crash on September 9, 2009. After 14 days, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy flew from Hyderabad to the crash site and later addressed a massive public meeting.

Mr. Jagan promised in an emotional tone that he would visit each and every family who have lost their near ones. In the months to follow, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy begins a ‘Odarpu Yatra’ visiting families, expressing his condolences and covering the entire State criss-crossing districts.

Soon, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy leaves the Congress Party, with which his family has been associated for over three decades and forms a new party, Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP).

But all it mattered was that the party carried the signature of YSR.

This Wednesday marks the 10th year of the formation of the party, which rode to power on a massive vote share of 51% in the general elections held in 2019 winning 151 out of 175 seats.

The YSR Congress Party’s journey to power had never been smooth. In May 2012, Mr. Jagan was arrested by the CBI probing in a case relating to corruption charges.

By then he was released from prison on bail, the State had witnessed tumultuous changes in the landscape. The State was bifurcated and a Telangana was carved out with Hyderabad as the common capital for 10 years.

In the general elections held in 2014, the YSRCP won 67 seats but with 40% vote share it came close to power.

The TDP government announces Amaravati as the capital, and in March 2017, the first Assembly session was held in the new Assembly.

Mr. Jagan, then as a leader of opposition, continued to mount pressure on the government by undertaking protests in Guntur and Vijayawada demanding Special Category Status.

As the countdown for the general elections began, Mr. Jagan decided to embark on ‘padayatra’ covering all the 13 districts of the State. Mr. Reddy began his yatra from Idupulapaya village in Kadapa district in November 2017, where his father Rajasekhara Reddy was laid to rest. The ‘padayatra’ covering 3,648 km covered the entire length and breadth of the State.

Mr. Jagan set off on a scorching pace covering 14-20 km per day. Walking in gruelling summer, and in pouring rain, Mr. Reddy was able to meet all sections of society, holding impromptu meetings. He chose not to sleep at any private residences but instead slept in a convertible tent.

In the elections held in April 2019, Mr. Jagan led an invigorated party to a sweeping victory against the TDP. The party won 151 out of 175 seats powered by an en masse transfer of traditional Congress vote base of Dalits, Muslims. Most Ministers in the TDP government lost their deposits and a new set of young political leaders came on stage.

Mr. Jagan did not stop with it. He constituted the council of Ministers which included Mekathoti Sucharita, a Dailt Home Minister and five deputy Chief Ministers, all from Backward Classes, SC and ST community with an aim to build a social coalition consisting of Dalits and Other Backward Classes.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysnj13/article31047016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30GTVRRHI-W077GBK4IJAOL131VZVIJPAGE5JAGANjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcps-long-arduous-trek-to-power/article31046927.ece

79,2020/03/12,Indian Bank to auction TDP MLA’s property,"‘Firm in which he once served as director defaulted on payment of ₹220.66 crore’

For the second time in six months, Indian Bank has put up a property belonging to TDP MLA Ganta Srinivasa Rao for e-auction.

The decision to e-auction an apartment built in 444 sq yards at Balayya Sastry Layout was taken because of default on loans to the tune of ₹220.66 crore.

The auction process was initiated by the bank’s Daba Gardens branch. A notification was issued in newspapers stating that the online auction would be conducted on April 16. Application can be filed from April 11 to 15.

According to the notification, the application and details of the property can be downloaded from www.bankeauction.com. Pratyusha Resources and Infra Private Limited, in which Mr. Srinivasa Rao had served as director, defaulted on repayment of loan of ₹141.68 crore. The bank had issued a demand notice on October 4. 2016.

Despite the demand notice, the company allegedly did not clear the loan. The total outstanding, including the interest component, stood at over ₹208.68 crore as on November 7, 2019, when the bank issued the first e-auction notice.

Later, the e-auction was postponed after an assurance given by Mr. Srinivasa Rao and other serving directors. Since the payment was not made, the outstanding amount went up to ₹220.66 crore as on March 2, 2020.

It was learnt that 26 properties belonging to Mr. Srinivasa Rao and P.V. Prabhakara Rao, K.B. Subrahmanyam, Narni Amulya and Parachuri Bhaskara Rao, all directors of the company, were attached by the bank.

Assets belonging to the companies such as Pratyusha Resources and Infra, Pratyusha Global Trade and Pratyusha Estates were also attached and put on auction.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/io2l3q/article31045831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11KRARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/indian-bank-to-auction-tdp-mlas-property/article31045832.ece
80,2020/03/12,E-auctioning of tobacco starts in 3 platforms in Prakasam,"Farmers fear fall in prices in the wake of global economic crisis

E-auctions began in three Southern Black Soil(SBS) auction platforms in Prakasam district on Wednesday amid fears of falling prices in the wake of the global economic crisis accentuated further by coronavirus outbreak.

Six firms made bids on the opening day in Ongole II, Tangutur I and II auction platforms as Tobacco Board Secretary A. Sridhar Babu oversaw the process.

Farmers, who brought nine bales realised an average price of ₹170 per kg in Ongole II, while their counterparts who marketed 18 bales each in Tangutur I and Tangutur II got ₹169.05 per kg and ₹168.13 per kg respectively, Tobacco Board SBS Regional Manager G. Umamaheswara Rao said.

Farmers in the traditional tobacco growing areas coming under SBS and Southern Light Soil(SLS) auction platforms are a worried lot in view of the uncertainty over the global demand for the produce this year as the outbreak of the novel virus came at the time of marketing.

The Tobacco Board should speed up the auctions and ensure participation of a good number of exporters to facilitate liquidating of the stock early, demanded Ongole II Farmers Association secretary V.V. Prasad.

They were expecting to make good the losses incurred last year following severe drought, following rains at the time of sowing this year. The excess rains had adversely affected the quality of the crop, he said, adding medium and low grade varieties accounting for 70% of the total crop.

The crop production has been estimated at over 95 million kg in SLS and SBS auction platforms, according to sources in the trade.

Flue-cured tobacco produced here are used in major cigarette blends overseas and the outbreak of the novel virus is likely to adversely affect the prices for different tobacco varieties by 10 to 20%, they say.

The farmers were a disappointed lot as they were expecting a price of ₹180 to ₹200 per kg for bright grade to start with.

E-auctions in the traditional tobacco growing areas are expected to pick up later this month when the ongoing auctions in Karnataka are expected to conclude.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/r7bhvx/article31044530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJPAGETOBACCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/e-auctioning-of-tobacco-starts-in-3-platforms-in-prakasam/article31044531.ece

84,2020/03/12,TDP leaders’ car damaged in mob attack at Macherla,"Naidu stages protest in front of State police HQ

Telugu Desam Party leaders Bonda Umamaheswara Rao and Buddha Venkanna and High Court advocate Para Kishore were allegedly assaulted at Macherla on Wednesday morning as they were proceeding to Veldurthy mandal where the nomination of a TDP ZPTC aspirant was rejected on Tuesday.

Police said trouble started when the SUV in which they were travelling hit a boy on the main road. Locals rushed to the spot and town YSRCP president Turaka Kishore tried to stop the car and in the melee, its windowpanes were broken.

As the crowd became restive, the car driver sped along the Macherla-Veldurthy road and on the way, an inspector provided escort. The DSP of Gurazala also intervened. The advocate drove to Nagarjuna Sagar and called up TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu who asked him to lodge a complaint at the nearest police station.

“A frenzied mob of about 100 persons attacked us with large sticks and hurled stones on us. They even attacked the police vehicle, and for a moment, we thought we would be killed,” said Mr. Umamaheswara Rao, a former MLA.

Inspector General of Police J. Prabhakar Rao and SP, Guntur Rural, Ch. Vijaya Rao, rushed to the spot and took stock of the situation. The SP said the situation was under control.

Later, Mr. Prabhakara Rao said that Turaka Kishore, Battula Nagaraju and Malala Gopi were taken into custody in connection with the violence and cases under Section 307 were registered against them.

Mr. Naidu condemned the attack, terming it a ‘black day’ in democracy. He said the TDP would seek the intervention of the Governor and the State Election Commission.

“What is the Chief Minister doing when Opposition leaders are being attacked? What is the DGP doing when anti-social elements are targeting the police? Is Andhra Pradesh becoming another Bihar?” fumed Mr. Naidu. Later in the evening, he staged a sit-in in front of the State police headquarters after walking from his party office in Mangalagiri.

YSRCP denies hand

The YSR Congress Party refuted the allegations made by Mr. Naidu. Narsaraopet MLA Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy said TDP leaders tried to instigate the locals by coming in a convoy of cars.

85,2020/03/12,"Panchakarla quits TDP, bats for Vizag as Executive capital","‘I cannot go against the sentiments of the people of the region’

TDP rural president and former MLA Panchakarla Ramesh Babu on Wednesday announced his decision to quit the party.

The reasons he cited were the party’s stand on the YSRCP government’s announcement to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital and interference of other leaders in his constituency and in the discharge of his responsibility.

“I brought to the notice of party national president N. Chandrababau Naidu the internal decisions and developments. Though he had assured to rectify them, he did not do so,” Mr. Ramesh Babu said at a press conference here.

His decision comes two days after another former MLA S.A. Rahaman joining the YSRCP and ahead of the local body elections later this month.

Mr. Ramesh Babu, however, said he had not decided his future course of action.

“I cannot go against the sentiments of the people of Visakhapatnam with regard to the city’s development as Executive capital,” he said.

The TDP should fight for ensuring justice to the farmers of Amaravati, but it should have the same commitment in respecting the sentiments of the people of Visakhapatnam and for their all-round development, he observed.

That was the reason why I could not carry out protests in favour of Amaravati as dictated by the party, he said.

‘Malicious campaign’

The reasons being cited to oppose Executive capital such as “traffic will become worse and rowdyism will gain ground” were nothing but malicious campaign, he said, and added that development of Visakhapatnam would have a positive impact on the north coastal and East Godavari districts.

Mr. Ramesh Babu said people had rejected the party by giving it only 23 Assembly seats, but Mr. Naidu continued to be surrounded by the same coterie. “There is no post mortem on the defeat. People like me are not given an opportunity to speak,” he alleged.

“People did not accept the making of Nara Lokesh as MLC and Minister. A few days ago, Mr. Lokesh held a meeting with the families of 30 to 40 political leaders in Hyderabad,” Mr. Ramesh Babu said, and accused the leadership of creating groups.

Joins YSRCP

In a similar development, former Minister from Kadapa district P. Ramasubba Reddy quit the TDP and joined the YSRCP in the presence of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at his camp office. Addressing the media later, Mr. Ramasubba Reddy said he was impressed by the welfare schemes introduced by the Chief Minister and quit the TDP as it lacked direction.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/panchakarla-quits-tdp-bats-for-vizag-as-executive-capital/article31044354.ece
86,2020/03/12,Gov. plans to auction red sanders,"Process to be initiated soon after obtaining DGFT clearance

The State government is contemplating auctioning red sanders soon. It has sought the permission of the Central government to auction 318 tonnes of red sanders with a view to fetching about ₹100 crore.

The Forest Department has so far earned ₹1,700 crore from the sale of 8,498 tonnes of red sanders.

In fact, the deadline to sell red sanders seized from the smugglers ended in December 2019.

However, with the Forest Department approaching the Centre seeking renewal of its approval, the State has been permitted to sell the seized logs till the end of December this year.

MoEF nod

When contacted, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests N. Prateep Kumar has said that the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Environment (MoEF) has given an in-principle approval for the auction.

The State government, however, is yet to get clearance from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). The auction process will be initiated as soon as the DGFT clearance is obtained.

“The A.P. Forest Development Corporation Limited (APFDC) will invite global tenders through the MSTC, an e-commerce portal of the Central government. It is estimated that the red sanders sale will fetch ₹100 crore,” Mr. Prateep Kumar says.

Huge demand

“There is huge demand for the red sanders in the international market. China is a major importer. The wood is mainly used to make furniture, musical instruments and dolls. The huge demand and non-availability of the wood is giving scope for smuggling. With the government selling the seized red sanders in the international market, the smuggling activity has come down drastically,” says Mr. Kumar.

There was no sale in 2006-08 though the seizure was high. Between 2009-10 and 2013-14, the sale was suspended. This had resulted in an increase in seizure of the logs. “The government began selling the red sanders from 2014-15, leading to drastic reduction in the seizure,” he adds.

Mr. Prateep Kumar says that the average demand in the international market is 1,000 tonnes per annum.

“About 8,000 tonnes has been sold, and the government has permission to sell another 318 tonnes. In addition, 5,500 tonnes of red sanders stock is lying at the central red sanders godown in Tirupati,” he says.

The Forest Department has taken several measures to prevent illegal smuggling. The efforts are yielding results. Red sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus) is among the endangered species of wood found in Chittoor, Kadapa, Kurnool and Nellore districts of Andhra Pradesh.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gov-plans-to-auction-red-sanders/article31044323.ece
87,2020/03/12,"‘Complete allocation of power sector staff between A.P., TS by March 30’","This should be done without withholding salaries of the allocated employees: panel

The Justice Dharmadhikari Committee stated in its supplementary report on Wednesday that the process of allocation of employees between Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) and Telangana power utilities should be completed before March 30.

This should be done without withholding the salaries of the allocated employees. The salaries should be paid by the company to which each employee was allocated on either side, it said.

Justice (Retd) Dharmadhikari stated that the employees allocated and relieved would be allowed to join the company of a State in which they were allocated even if the orders of individual postings to a particular location were delayed for some cogent reason.

The employees relieved (including 655 from Telangana for A.P. under the allocation lists contained in the final report), as a result of allocation, would be treated to be in continuous service regardless of any time lag in their relieving and joining, and should be paid salaries and other monetary benefits attached to the post due from January 2020 and for succeeding months along with all the service benefits they were entitled to.

He further stated that the employees allocated in each State to a particular company should be considered at par with other employees in accordance with the service rules and regulations for other service benefits, including their due consideration for promotion.

‘Contempt of court’

The committee said the top executives of the companies on both sides would be held personally responsible for strict implementation of the directions of the one-man committee within the prescribed time limit, and any disobedience, or delay, in complying with the directions would amount to contempt of court.

Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said that the elections were being conducted as per the model code of conduct prepared by the ECI. The High Court has directed to follow the ECI model code of conduct.

‘Review meets can be held’

The Chief Minister could conduct review meetings on development on welfare. It was the responsibility of the State government. It was not necessary to cover the statues of the late leaders if installed by people through contributions.

The High Court had ordered removal party colours on government buildings. The court also stipulated time for it. Necessary action would be taken.

Also, it had come to the notice of the State Election Commission (SEC) that a few untoward incidents took place in the State. The commission was taking note of the cases being filed in the State. The district Collectors concerned were asked to take necessary action, he said.

The commission would release the schedule for phase 1 election for panchayats on March 15. The schedule for phase 2 would be released on March 17.

The volunteers could extend their services as per work chart but they should not campaign for any political party. Complaints relating to such cases would be viewed seriously, he said.

Police said that of the five accused, four hail from Visakhapatnam Agency area while one is from Tamil Nadu. Another person, a native of Tamil Nadu who was with the accused, is absconding, police said.

The accused were transporting 1,575 kg of dry ganja in three vehicles when they were intercepted by an Excise team led by Excise Inspector of Paderu D. Anil Kumar under the supervision of Assistant Excise Inspector, Visakhapatnam district, S. Srinivasa Rao.

Officials said that the smugglers procured the ganja from interior areas of Visakhapatnam Agency and were shifting it to Tamil Nadu.

“The smugglers were planning to hand over the ganja to another group of smugglers at some point on NH-16, who would then shift it to Tamil Nadu,” said an officer.

The seized ganja is estimated to be worth around ₹1.5 crore to ₹2 crore, officials said.

On February 28, officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) nabbed four persons when they were transporting around 1,638 kg ganja in a four-wheeler at NAD Junction.

A CBI court convicted a former employee of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to five years of rigorous imprisonment in a fraud case, here on Wednesday.

Third Additional Special Judge G. Satya Prabhakara Rao pronounced the judgment convicting Dharavathu Sakru, then Higher Grade Assistant at LIC’s Jaggaiahpeta branch in Krishna district, and slapped a fine of ₹30,000 on him.

CBI officials said that Sakru fraudulently prepared and issued cheques amounting to ₹77.19 lakh to 12 persons, who then encashed the cheques and misappropriated the money, causing wrongful loss to LIC and wrongful gain to themselves.

Sakru committed the crime by colluding with the 12 persons and abused his position as the custodian of the cheque books, officials said.

After completion of the trial, the CBI court convicted Sakru under Sections 420, 409, 467, 468 & 477-A of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the PC Act, 1988, and ordered that sentences imposed on the accused shall run concurrently.

Joint Collector L. Shiva Shankar instructed officials to make foolproof arrangements for the conduct of the Class X examinations, which will be held from March 31 to April 17.

Mr. Shiva Shankar held a review meeting in this regard with officials from the Education Department and Police here on Wednesday.

The Joint Collector said that 56,796 regular and 615 private candidates will appear for the examinations, which will begin at 9.30 a.m. and end at 12.15 p.m. As many as 251 examination centres have been allotted in the district, he said.

93,2020/03/12,"Over 10,000 security men to be deployed for local polls in Agency","All 300 polling stations are sensitive and affected by Left Wing Extremism, say police officers

The district administration will deploy over 10,000 security personnel in the 11 Left Wing Extremism-affected mandals in the Agency to ensure that the upcoming Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituency (MPTC) and Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituency (ZPTC) elections are held peacefully.

All the 11 mandals in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam district are declared ‘sensitive’ because of the presence of the banned CPI (Maoist). Elaborate arrangements are being made by the authorities concerned to ensure that the elections pass off without incident.

According to initial security plans, about 50 companies of Greyhounds, the elite anti-naxal force, around 40 platoons of A.P. Special Police (APSP), 12 companies of CRPF, and men from the Armed Reserved Police will be deployed on election duty, covering all 11 mandals.

“Campaigning for the MPTC and ZPTC elections will begin from March 15 and end on March 19. However, the crucial phase will be the polling day on March 21 and the counting and the results day on March 24,” Superintendent of Police Attada Babujee told The Hindu.

This apart, the panchayat election is also scheduled on March 27 and 29.

Elections crucial

“In the past, it has been seen that violence flares up around the time of local body polls, as many contestants consider winning the election a prestige issue. A lot is at stake, such as family prestige, village prestige, and most importantly, the prestige of the tribe. It has been seen that people go to great lengths including seeking the intervention of the Maoists to help settle scores,” a senior police officer said.

The Maoists have in the past tried to meddle in the elections and cause disturbance but this time around, the elections are being held at short notice, which is expected to work in favour of the security forces.

In the 11 mandals, there are 172 MPTC seats and 11 ZPTC seats, and around 300 polling stations have been identified. Of the 300 polling stations, 10 have been identified as hypercritical, 50 as critical and the remaining as LWE-affected.

“This gives an indication that all 300 stations are sensitive and LWE-affected,” Mr. Babujee said.

Technology to the rescue

Covering 11 LWE-affected mandals spread across inhospitable terrain in an area of over 6,200 sq km is a challenging task for the security forces. Apart from pumping in manpower, the security forces will be relying on technology this time to get the job done.

Drone cameras will be deployed and will be monitored by security forces from mobile command control centres. This apart, CCTV cameras have been installed at all critical junctions and strategic points. Arrangements are also being made to keep the entire ground force on a satellite communication network.

“We intend to keep challenges such as lack of road connectivity, inhospitable terrain, remoteness of polling booths and bad weather at bay with the help of technology,” said a senior officer at the ground-level.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1bmfqx/article31043950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-VZ-AGENCYPOLLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/over-10000-security-men-to-be-deployed-for-local-polls-in-agency/article31043951.ece

95,2020/03/12,FIR against co-operative bank for not returning FD amount to customer,"The Shankarapuram police have registered an FIR against the president and directors of Sri Guru Sarvabhowma Souharda Credit Cooperative Ltd. for allegedly failing to honour a fixed deposit of ₹5.8 lakh invested by a man from Bengaluru.

Acting on a complaint filed by Prasanna Narasimha Y.G., the police have filed an FIR and charged the accused for criminal breach of trust. According to Mr. Narasimha, he had invested an FD worth ₹6.8 lakh in 2016 towards his son’s education. “It was money he and his wife had saved. Last month, Narashima wanted to withdraw the FD. But he wasn’t allowed to do so,” said a police officer.

Mr. Narasimha spent 20 days trying to get his money, but the bank staff only forwarded him ₹1 lakh and allegedly asked him to contact the bank president and directors for the rest. “The victim said he tried to do so, but they were either unreachable or did not respond to calls,” the officer said. At his wits’ end, he approached the police, who have summoned the staff of the cooperative bank for questioning.

The police are probing the bank’s finances to see if the problem is more pervasive. In February, another cooperative bank was booked for cheating hundreds of customers.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fir-against-co-operative-bank-for-not-returning-fd-amount-to-customer/article31053192.ece

According to sources, Mr. Jadhav handed over the letter to the Union Minister at Parliament House on Thursday.

In the letter, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, he has cited three references — The Hindu’s coverage of the press conference of M.B. Sajjan, general secretary of All-India University Employees’ Confederation, who demanded the resignation of CUK Vice-Chancellor H.M. Maheshwaraiah for his alleged involvement in the irregularities, after The Hindu broke the story; a follow-up story carried by a news portal; and a letter Mr. Sajjan wrote to the President of India demanding an inquiry into the allegations and action against those involved in the scam.

97,2020/03/12,Will ignore views of legislators on police transfers: Karnataka government,"The State government on Thursday gave an undertaking before the High Court of Karnataka that it would ignore all recommendations made by MLAs, MLCs and MPs on transfer and retention of police officers while exercising the powers of transfer under the Karnataka Police Act.

An affidavit by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Rajneesh Goel was filed before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by V. Shashidhar, an activist from Bengaluru.

“It is assured to court that the State government shall follow the dictum of this court and the mandate of the apex court in the case of Prakash Singh and others,” Mr. Goel stated in the affidavit.

A similar affidavit was filed in February by Director-General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood, in his capacity as chairperson of the Police Establishment Board, stating that the board, which is entrusted with the task of transferring police officers, would ignore recommendations from MLAs, MLCs and MPs.

The affidavits, treated as undertakings by the government and the board by the court, were filled after the court, during an earlier hearing, passed orders pointing out that the transfer of police officers was governed by the Karnataka Police Act, which was amended as per the directions of the apex court in the case of Prakash Singh to set up the Police Establishment Board and the Police Complaints Authority.

As the issue of transfer of police officers is governed by the police Act, both the second respondent and the State government cannot get influenced by such recommendations made by members of the Legislative Assembly, the court had observed in its earlier orders.

It was pointed in the petition that several MLAs had written to the Chief Minister and others making recommendations for transferring and retaining individual officers.

Examination order

On the plea of the petitioner for initiation of criminal action under the Indian Penal Code and the Representation of People Act, 1951, against the MLAs and MLCs for this alleged violation of the oath of office, the Bench directed the government to examine this aspect and take action, if necessary. It subsequently disposed of the petition.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/will-ignore-views-of-legislators-on-police-transfers-karnataka-government/article31053163.ece

The protesters took part in the protest, which also coincided with the anniversary of Dandi March. They staged a dharna and raised slogans seeking immediate requisite action by the Union government. They also raised slogans saying that they loved India and were ready to sacrifice their lives for the country.

Linguist, researcher and activist Ganesh N. Devy and his wife Surekha Devy took part in the agitation and said that they were pained to see the efforts by the government to divide people on the lines of religion.

“At this time of economic crisis, low GDP and other problems, a ‘faltoo kanoon’ is not required. The Prime Minister of the country, who has been chosen by the people had talked of ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’. But now, there is no ‘sab ka saath’ and ‘vishwas’ has been lost as the new law decides on citizenship based on religion,” Mr. Devy said.

Clarifying that he does not belong to any political party, he said the love for his motherland had forced him to come out and participate in the agitation.

Recalling the call for boycott given by Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle, Mr. Devy said it was now time for using the same tool of boycott against CAA, NRC, and NPR.

Ms. Surekha Devy said that women have taken the lead in anti-CAA, NRC and NPR agitations, and they were sure to succeed in their efforts.

“The mask is recommended only for those who are either suffering from the virus or showing symptoms. Wearing the mask for no reason would create panic among people. School authorities should not force students to come to school wearing masks,” he said.

Chairing an awareness meeting on COVID-19 at the ZP meeting hall on Thursday, he told the Deputy Director of Public Instruction Department to issue a direction to schools not to make the mask compulsory. At the same time, he warned shopkeepers against hoarding of masks or selling them at a higher price.

Asserting that mere cough, fever or loss of breath does not mean the person is suffering from the virus, he said that foreign travel history or person coming in contact with those who have returned from overseas is essential.

“Don’t collect swab sample and send it to labs for testing just because the person is suffering from cough or fever. Since we have only five testing laboratories in the State, don’t burned them with unnecessary samples.

The State government would take up river rejuvenation initiatives in nine districts under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), said K.S. Eshwarappa, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj.

The Art of Living Foundation would also join hands with the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj in the implementation of the project. In the first phase, the project would be implemented in Shivamogga, Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Ballari, Yadgir, Belagavi, Kodagu, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts, he said at a press conference here on Thursday.

Mr. Eshwarappa said that it has been planned to construct structures on the banks of rivers and their tributaries, including check-dams and percolation pits to avoid waterbodies from going complete dry during summer and to enhance the groundwater level in the vicinity.

In addition to this, afforestation activities would also be taken up in the vicinity of river banks by planting saplings of trees that are endemic to the region to avoid soil erosion, he said.

Replying to a query, he said that scientific action plans would be prepared on construction of structures for water percolation and harvesting after conducting detailed survey.

As the work would be implemented under MNREGA, activities related to community mobilisation for the work, creation of the database of the job cardholders and enlightening local people on the need to rejuvenate the rivers would also be held, he said.

He said that the work would be implemented on the banks of Tunga and Bhadra rivers in Shivamogga district.

He said this was following directions from Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who has instructed officials to follow precautions and measures similar to those that are in place in other countries.

State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases) said two private medical colleges that are closer to the airport — Akash Medical College and another similar facility — have been identified. A final call will be taken after inspecting more facilities.

While the department’s helpline 104 will be a one-stop centre for queries, the government is trying to put in place a plan where some hospitals will be identified as first responder facilities, said Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey.

“These first responder hospitals will act as facilities for out-patient consultation of suspected cases. If a case is identified to be fit for admission, as per protocols, we will refer the case to a designated hospital in the integrated facility,” he said.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, she said that a proper survey of the number of members in the transgender community would help to extend the benefits of employment and housing schemes with a long-term vision.

The KSWDC had chalked out several welfare measures to help transgenders and Devadasis and bring them to the mainstream. As per data available with KSWDC, there are around 46,660 Devadasis in the State.

The beneficiaries of Devadasis rehabilitation scheme, housing scheme, Udyogini Scheme, microfinance scheme, Samruddhi Scheme, Chetana scheme, and Rehabilitation of transgender would be linked with Aadhar and covered under insurance. The State government allocated ₹171 crore for the KSWDC in the recent Budget.

Karnataka Bank Managing Director and CEO M.S. Mahabaleshwara has said the bank’s Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) was well above the minimum prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India and urged people not to get carried away by reports on visual media or social media.

A release from the bank on Wednesday quoted Mr. Mahabaleshwara as saying CPAR was the benchmark to assess a bank’s health and not the so called “M-Cap to Deposit Ratio.” Referring to the recent report by a television channel which was also widely circulated on social media, he was categorical in denouncing “M-Cap ratio” used by the TV channel to measure the health of banks and safety of deposits with them.

Audited balance sheet

Mr. Mahabaleshwara said as per the audited balance sheet as on March 31, 2019, CRAR of Karnataka Bank stood at 13.17% that was well above the minimum regulatory prescription. Bank’s internal policy stipulates maintaining CRAR of at least 1.% above the regulatory requirement. “We have been consistently maintaining CRAR above the minimum prescribed by the RBI as well as the Bank’s internal policy,” he said.

The MD further said Union government’s chief economic advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian, RBI Governor, State Bank of India and other banking experts have categorically endorsed the views that globally for assessing the health of banks the CRAR was used and banks in India were well capitalised; therefore were safe and healthy.

Allaying fear among depositors, Mr. Mahabaleshwara said the bank was in existence for 96 years that has been built on the trust of 11 million customers across the country.

Double whammy

But what has come as a double whammy for restaurant and hotel owners is the depleting patronage by locals who used to eat out during weekends or regularly. “Since the last couple of weeks there has been a steady decline in the number of local people who eat out,” said Mr. Gowda.

Consequently, many restaurants have given holidays to their employees as they are finding it difficult to pay salaries and wages. The minimum wage is ₹12,000 per month for a cook but most draw higher as owners want to retain their services. But with declining income, the hotel industry is bracing for a long haul and may struggle to pay their wages.

Stakeholders say the hospitality sector as represented by hotels providing accommodation always braces for low occupancy during February and March. But what is disconcerting is that the bookings made for April and May are getting cancelled en masse. This is true with in-bound domestic tourists and outbound local tourists most of whom have postponed their holidays.

Clamp down

A representative of a leading tour and travel agency in the city said with the governments around the world clamping down on travel, outbound tourists from Mysuru have also been affected. People have been forced to cancel or postpone their plans.

South East Asia was a popular destination among the tourists from Mysuru due to ease of securing visa, affordability and diversity of places of attraction. But with travel restrictions being clamped down, the outbound tourists have also put their plans on hold affecting the local players in the travel sector.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dho2vv/article31052347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGMYSURUTOURIST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/local-travel-hospitality-sector-feel-the-heat/article31052348.ece
106,2020/03/12,Mysuru lab identified for COVID-19 testing,"Samples of suspected cases can be sent to VRDL and results will be ready in about three hours

A state-of-the-art viral research laboratory in Mysuru has been identified as one of the testing laboratories for the detection of COVID-19. The samples of suspected cases can be sent to the lab for analysis and it would take about three hours to get the results.

The Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), which was set up from Central grants and functions at the Microbiology Department of K.R. Hospital, has been authorised to carry out the tests. This lab in Mysuru is among the 52-plus laboratories in the country.

Though the VRDL is equipped to carry out the tests, the sole authority of confirming the virus lies with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. VRDL is also the sole agency for collection and transportation of suspected samples of COVID-19 to NIV. VRDL, which is part of the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, functions on the advise of NIV.

According to the guidelines issued by ICMR, the results of the tests done here have to be shared with NIV the same day and the labs are not supposed to disclose the results since the NIV is the only authority to declare positive cases. Also, confirmation from the NIV should be awaited in case the samples test negative for COVID-19. The ICMR, in the guidelines made available on its website, has advised clinicians at labs to isolate the patient tested positive for COVID-19 in the identified facility and follow bio-safety precautions.

VRDL is a part of a network of labs established by the Department of Health Research, Government of India. The rise in the number of viral outbreaks and the resultant mortality had been cited as key reasons for the launch of network of such hi-tech labs in the country.

The NIV and the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi, are the top laboratories for the network, while the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, is the supervising authority for the data generated by the network of labs.

VRDL was established at a cost of ₹1.3 crore. Samples from neighbouring districts are also sent to the lab and the tests are done for free. “VRDL had received samples of two suspected cases of COVID-19. Both had tested negative,” said sources.

Thermal screening begins at Mysuru airport

Screening of passengers at Mysuru airport using thermal scanners began here on Thursday.

Passengers arriving and departing have to undergo the screening done by a team of doctors and nurses from K.R. Hospital.

A hand-held thermal scanner has been provided to the airport. If the person is found to have fever, he or she shall be counselled and isolated for further tests.

Though it is a domestic airport, the screening method had been introduced as a precautionary measure. If the passengers are found to be suffering from running nose and excessive cough, they shall be subjected to tests. The suspected cases are taken to the isolation wards set up at the K.R. Hospital. More thermal scanners are expected to arrive under NUHM soon.

Sources in the Health Department said suspected cases of COVID-19 are isolated and samples send to the lab. Until the samples test negative, the patient won’t be allowed to leave the ward. If the samples test positive, treatment would be started and the patients shall be kept in the ward until they recover.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e3qm65/article31052331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGLABVIRAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-lab-identified-for-covid-19-testing/article31052332.ece
107,2020/03/12,"COVID-19: Tourism sector in Hassan, Chikkamagaluru takes a beating","Some homestays are preparing to shut for some time fearing spread of virus

COVID-19 has hit the tourism sector in Chikkamagaluru and Hassan districts. Resorts, homestays and hotels have been badly affected.

Many people, who had planned their weekend travel to hill stations and areas surrounding the forest, cancelled their bookings. In some cases, the owners of homestays are preparing to shut down for some time fearing the spread of the infection.

Interestingly, during the general meeting at the zilla panchayat in Chikkamagaluru on Wednesday, a section of members wanted a ban on entry of tourists to the district as a precautionary measure. Kumara, Additional Deputy Commissioner, told The Hindu that no such decision had been taken. However, the administration had made arrangements to treat people with COVID-19 symptoms.

No bookings

The hilly areas of the districts have hundreds of homestays and resorts that charge from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000 per person per day. During the weekend, hundreds of people from Bengaluru and other cities book resorts to spend two days amidst greenery. However, for the last two weeks, the bookings have come down. “No bookings have been made for the coming weekend. Two teams, who had booked the rooms, cancelled them,” said Sagar, partner of a homestay near Kalasa in Mudigere taluk.

This has hit many people in rural areas. Each homestay employs an average of 10 to 15 people over the weekend. Families who provide food for the guests, those running private taxis, and local shopkeepers have been affected.

Helpline opened

Officers of Health and Family Welfare have instructed the hotels, resorts and homestays to inform them if foreigners check-in. The district administration has opened a helpline to receive calls.

“Normally, during weekends, the Bengaluru-Mangaluru Road is busy with hundreds of vehicles proceeding to tourist destinations. But last week, it was not so. Many homestays in Sakleshpur have no customers for next few weeks,” said Prasanna, a planter from Hanabalu.

In March, tourists are less compared to other months due to exams and end of the financial year. But, this time, no fresh bookings have been made for the vacation period, said H. Chandrashekhar, who runs a homestay in Sakleshpur taluk.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-tourism-sector-in-hassan-chikkamagaluru-takes-a-beating/article31052320.ece

109,2020/03/12,Rumours hit poultry salesin Vijayapura district,"Chicken price has fallen to ₹ 40 a kg from ₹ 180 a kg

Till a month ago, Alauddin Khatik was so busy in his poultry shop that his phone never stopped ringing during business hours. But it is a totally different scenario now.

Alauddin Khatik supplies chicken to restaurants in Vijayapura city regularly and now his business has been hit due to misconceptions surrounding coronavirus (COVID-19).

At Tiganabidri village in Babaleshwar taluk, about 40 km from Vijayapura, Mahadev Talwar who has 4,000 birds in his poultry farm is a worried man these days.

From a sales number of 2,000 birds a month, he is now facing almost no sales. “We are ready to supply birds free, but poultry shop owners are not keen on receiving them as their business too has been hit badly due to coronavirus scare,” he said.

According to an estimate, in Vijayapura city, around 20 quintals of chicken is sold every day.

“But because of coronavirus scare, we are unable to sell even three quintals a day,” said Israr Inamdar, another poultry supplier. False information that coronavirus spreads through chicken is the main reason for this development, feel the traders.

Makhtum Mulla, a poultry farm owner, said that without any returns, it is difficult to keep feeding the birds. “We simply can’t keep feeding the birds everyday without any returns,” he said.

The traders have spoken to the veterinary officers who have clarified that consumption of chicken has nothing to do with the virus. “However, false information has spread so much that we can do nothing,” Alauddin Khatik said.

Prices fall

The adverse impact has been so huge that the prices have come down from ₹ 180 per kg to just around ₹ 40 a kg.

111,2020/03/12,Act of tusker being fired at sparks outrage,"Video goes viral; wildlife activists up in arms

A wild tusker had a providential escape when a staff from the anti-depredation force “accidentally” opened fire at it when it was trying to cross the rail track fence in the Omkara range of Bandipur Tiger Reserve.

The gun pellets hit the rail track fence and the tusker swerved to its right, climbed the mound and escaped without any injury.

Officials said the pellet would not have been fatal but it would have been embedded in the animal for years, which could have led to long-term complications.

The incident is said to have taken place nearly a week ago but its video surfaced on Wednesday and it went viral triggering outrage from wildlife activists and conservationists.

The anti-depredation team was reportedly not in any danger though the elephant was rushing towards them, as it was on the other side of the fence and hence this act of firing pellets has drawn criticism.

When contacted, T. Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, admitted that the incident took place last week during an operation to goad the elephant back into the jungle. Loaded guns are carried by the force to drive the elephants towards the jungles and they open fire in the air during operations.

He said the force was goading the elephant back but it turned around and charged towards the squad members. “Their intention was to shoot in the air but in the melee the driver started the vehicle and there was a misfire with the pellets hitting the fence,” said Mr. Balachandra.

But according to activists, the video indicated that the distance was more than 50 feet and the rail fence separated the squad from the charging elephant and the animal posed no physical threat to them to warrant firing at it.

They say that the elephant, which was already agitated, could also have hurt itself as it ran in the other direction and into the trench and struggled to come out of it again. The squad members are heard talking among themselves with one of them goading the other to open fire.

Mr. Balachandra said subsequently the same elephant was goaded back into the jungle. “This is a problematic elephant which frequently strays into villages on the other of the forest border and hence the operation was on to goad the elephant back into the jungles which was successful,” said Mr. Balachandra.

However, he said that disciplinary action was being initiated against the staff while activists have also raised questions about the behaviour of the staff.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j0xwnn/article31046640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGPACHYDERM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/act-of-tusker-being-fired-at-sparks-outrage/article31046641.ece
112,2020/03/12,Cocoon production poised to pick up,"This will help meet rise in demand for indigenous silk

Cocoon production in the State, which had been hit by a mulberry disease, appears poised to pick up just in time to meet the growing demand for indigenous silk.

However, a change in climate over the last few days coupled with use of pesticides has brought the disease under control, and most cocoon markets across the State had reported an increase in arrivals.

With the price of cocoons easing and the demand for raw silk expected to increase in the wake of COVID-19 disrupting import of silk from China, the production of indigenous raw silk is likely to increase.

The prices of cocoon, which had remained high for the last three months, has also begun to ease in the last one week, said Deputy Director of Sericulture in Ramanagaram district Munishi Basaiah.

The cocoon market in Ramanagaram, one of the largest in the State, was trading barely 25 to 30 tonnes of cocoons every day during the last three to four months. But, during the last one week, the arrivals have crossed 50 tonnes a day, consequently bringing down the price, the officials said.

The average price of cocoons, which used to be around ₹480 to ₹495 for crossbreed and ₹630 to ₹670 for superior quality bivoltine during January and February this year, has eased to an average of ₹400 for cross breed and ₹492 for bivoltine during the last one week.

Chinese silk has become scarce in the Indian market as the available stocks are fast exhausting. With no consignment of silk from China reaching the Indian shores for almost two months now, the indigenous silk is expected to bridge the gap. Silk traders in Bengaluru confirmed that silk imports from China have been badly hit on account of coronavirus.

But, the export-oriented units account for only a small percentage of the silk goods manufacturers in the country. “Indian silk weaving industry caters primarily to the domestic market. Exports play a limited role”, said a source in the Central Silk Board.

Silk goods manufacturers catering to the local market, including saree makers, are, however, unperturbed by the disruption in supply from China.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/k9hfo1/article31043095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGSILK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cocoon-production-poised-to-pick-up/article31046588.ece
113,2020/03/12,Overwhelming response to ‘Jaggalagi Habba’ in Hubballi,"Event aims at reviving traditional flavour of Holi

The fourth edition of the annual ‘Jaggalagi Habba’ [earlier ‘Hubballi Halagi Habba’], an event aimed at reviving the traditional flavour of Holi, received an overwhelming response again on Wednesday.

Hundreds of people lined up on either side of the route earmarked for the procession and cheered the folk artistes. ‘Jaggalagi’ is a traditional drum [sometimes measuring almost the height of an average person], which is rolled on the ground while being played.

On Wednesday over 50 folk troupes from in and around Hubballi-Dharwad and neighbouring districts took part in the event. They first congregated on the Moorusavir Mutt premises.

By beating another traditional small drum ‘tamate’, Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami of the mutt inaugurated the event.

Sadashiva Swami of Hukkeri Mutt, Haveri, various political leaders, including Shankaranna Munavalli, Rajashekhar Menasinakai, Mahesh Tenginakai and others, were present.

Post the formal inauguration, the traditional drums set the tone for the ‘Ranga Panchami’ in Hubballi, which is scheduled to be celebrated on Friday.

One after the other, the folk troupes proceeded on the designated route beating the drums. Apart from the ‘jaggalagi’, troupes playing several other percussion and music instruments were part of the event.

As the procession moved slowly, the robust beats of the traditional percussion instruments, including ‘halagi’, ‘rana halagi’ and ‘jaggalagi’, and a spirit of celebration pervaded the locality.

With hundreds of people to cheer them, the beats became more intense and several onlookers even danced to the rhythm.

Despite a delayed start, the event attracted many. The performers made it a point to make intermittent halts at various points to display their talent in playing the ‘jaggalagi’.

The Tarakeshwar Yuvaka Mandal from Hangal, which presented a skit on the significance of Holi, was the special attraction of the event this year.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/balvyt/article31044122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12HBHUBBALLIHALAGI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/overwhelming-response-to-jaggalagi-habba-in-hubballi/article31044124.ece
114,2020/03/12,Kerala readying for long-term fight with COVID-19,"Two more positive cases on Thursday, condition of those admitted in various hospitals satisfactory

The State may have to engage in a long-term fight with COVID-19, as more positive cases of the disease from multiple nations are surfacing in the State.

The social disruption, necessitated by the stringent preventive and containment measures, is likely to be prolonged, it is feared.

On Thursday, two positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in the State. One was from Kannur district in a person who had come from Dubai, and the second in Thrissur, who had landed from Qatar. They are now in the isolation ward at the Pariyaram Medical College Hospital and Thrissur General Hospital respectively.

The total number of COVID-19 positive cases at present is 16.

However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who briefed media, said this number could become 17 as one case in Thiruvananthapuram was likely to be confirmed as positive (the sample which had tested positive in the first instance was being reconfirmed at the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha). This person, currently in isolation at the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital, had returned from Dubai, but after travel to multiple nations, including Italy. The condition of all COVID-19 positive cases in various hospitals is satisfactory.

Number may go up

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said the three cases are unconnected to the Pathanamthitta cluster. The State has moved to a situation wherein the threat of importation of more and more positive cases of the disease in the coming days is distinct and real, especially from nations where Keralites are residing in large numbers.

Ms. Shylaja had confirmed here on Wednesday that all airports in the State had begun to report increased arrivals of passengers from COVID-19-affected nations. As on Thursday, the State had 4,180 persons under surveillance, of whom 290 are isolated in hospitals and 3,910 on home quarantine.

Mr. Vijayan said the State was going through a crucial situation which called for strengthened vigil, responsible civic behaviour and strict adherence to the directives. The Health Department would focus on creating public awareness on giving special care and attention to the elderly, as they were vulnerable to the disease. Families should ensure that none with any respiratory symptom, especially relatives or visitors from abroad, comes into contact with the elderly.

116,2020/03/12,105-year-old Bhageerathi Amma joins Class 7 equivalency,"105-year-old learner plans to clear Class 10 exam afterwards

Bhageerathi Amma, the oldest equivalency course student in the history of the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority (KSLMA), has signed up for the next level by joining Class 7 equivalency.

The 105-year-old who had cleared her Class 4 papers last November expressed her desire to continue her studies to KSLMA director P.S. Sreekala and former Minister P.K. Sreemathy when they visited her on Thursday. In his 62nd Mann Ki Baat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had narrated her story and recently she was awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar, the country’s highest civilian honour for women.

At the centenarian’s request, application forms were brought from the KSLMA Kollam office to her house at Prakkulam and filled, making her officially a student of the programme.

“After this I want to clear Class 10 exam,” she told her visitors. While Class 4 equivalency examination had three papers, including Malayalam, Environment Studies and Mathematics, she will have to clear six subjects for Class 7 equivalency.

Bhageerathi Amma, who was married at the age of 15, could not complete her education due to many reasons and had enrolled for Class 4 equivalency course despite her advanced years.

Even after making headlines as the oldest student in the State, Bhageerathi Amma had no Aadhaar card or pension. But this week, the problem was solved and she was handed over her pension papers by the district administration and now she will be receiving a monthly pension of ₹1,500.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ymh20r/article31053274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tvbhagee,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bhageerathi-amma-joins-class-7-equivalency/article31053270.ece

The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Kerala Assembly will convene on Friday to deliberate whether or not to cut short its current session against the backdrop of the COVD-19 threat.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the House on Thursday that Independent legislator P.C. George and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MLA K.N. Khader had argued for curtailing the current sitting till the pestilence receded. As the first step, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan had banned visitors to the Assembly on Wednesday.

Mr. Vijayan said that on Saturday Cabinet Ministers would spread out to districts and hold conferences with respective District Collectors and local body office-bearers to cobble together a grassroots-level strategy to reassure the public and mitigate the economic fallout and disruption caused by the pandemic.

118,2020/03/12,Assembly terms Centre’s bar on returning NRIs inhuman,"Resolution against mandatory COVID-19 negative certification

The Assembly on Thursday adopted a rather strongly worded resolution that damned as “fundamentally inhuman” the contentious decision of the Central government to bar citizens stranded in Italy and South Korea without a COVID-19 negative certification from medical authorities at their respective port of departure from travelling to India.

The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition benches were empty when the ruling front passed the resolution by voice vote.

CM moves motion

Independent legislator and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally P.C. George backed the motion moved by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan under Rule 118. The resolution sought to urge the Centre to solve the problems faced by non-resident Indians (NRIs) due to the regulatory measures placed by the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Opposition had displayed support for the resolution on Wednesday but walked out of the House on another issue minutes before Mr. Vijayan tabled it.

Mr. Vijayan said the Centre had introduced the “unusual” requirement for travel to India from Italy and South Korea, both COVID-19 hotspots, in a circular issued on March 5. The order (4/1/2020-R) came into effect midnight March 10.

NRIs left in lurch

The Centre insisted that citizens grounded for days in airports in those countries required a medical testimonial from authorities there to board flights to India. The diktat tantamount to “cruel abandonment” of NRIs, he said. The government has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the citizens to come to India. “We can vet them for the virus and treat them in our country if necessary,” Mr Vijayan said.

The House also requested the Centre to extend the visa period of NRIs who were finding it challenging to rejoin work due to travel restrictions placed by various countries following the outbreak.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/526thi/article31053474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200312-WA0044,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/assembly-terms-centres-bar-on-returning-nris-inhuman/article31053248.ece
119,2020/03/12,Kerala Health department draws up new protocols,"For examining and surveilling people returning from COVID-19 hotspots

The Health Department has come up with new protocols for examining and surveilling people returning from COVID-19-hit countries.

People will be quarantined under ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories according to symptoms or their asymptomatic conditions.

Since the epidemiology of COVID-19 shows that 75-80% of the affected will develop only mild symptoms that do not require hospitalisation, the majority of patients will not require observation and treatment in a health-care institution.

As hospitals act as amplifying centres for epidemics, the burden of a mildly symptomatic patient can get enhanced in a hospital environment where high-risk patients are treated.

Hence, people with mild symptoms will not be taken to hospitals for testing and treatment. They will be undergoing clinical management at home.

Three categories

Those who have mild fever and cough will be under ‘A’ category, who will be quarantined at home for 28 days. A junior health inspector or a junior public health nurse will assess adequacy of isolation facility using a checklist and a doctor from the primary health centre will monitor the progress over the phone to assess any development of red flag signs.

Those having high fever, throat ache, and also those with low fever and cough, who are pregnant or over 60 years, having other illnesses of lungs, heart, kidney, diabetes or other disorders will be under category ‘B’. People under this category will have to contact the State Health enquiry Disha at 1056 or 0471 2552056 or the control room in the district and take treatment at the hospital directed by the control room.

Category ‘B’

Category ‘B’ patients could be either admitted or sent back for home isolation depending on the condition. The district surveillance officer will ensure the prescribed format of home isolation and also make the doctor at the nearby primary health centre in charge of monitoring the patient’s health.

Tourism industry stakeholders have flagged the lack of common guidelines in handling the COVID-19 scare and the attitude towards foreign tourists, branding them as carriers of coronavirus.

The industry, hit by a dip in arrivals, aired the concerns after the Idukki Collector ordered hotels and resorts not to accept bookings till March 31.

Although no travel ban has been announced, the decision has given a wrong message to tourists and tour operators outside the State. “With this, an impression of shutdown has been created and we are getting calls from tour operators and tourists. Enquiries are pouring into reservation desks whether it is safe to holiday,” Abraham George, member, National Tourism Advisory Council, said.

Directives issued by District Collectors and District Medical Officers have upset the industry. “Confusion prevails over these directives as they vary from district to district. The approach of officials is also against the sector and it shows lack of coordination. A directive by the Director of Health Services should have minimised the damage,” he said.

The industry is upset with the attitude towards foreign tourists who are in Kerala after visiting other States. A few tourists from Germany were denied rooms at Kanjirapally and instances of harassment have also been reported. A rally has been taken out with the support of a panchayat member at another place to oust foreigners terming them as carriers of coronavirus.

The industry has flagged these concerns at a tourism advisory council convened by Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran here on Wednesday.

“We are with the government and for preventive steps. A common Statewide directive is needed to avoid confusion,” senior vice president, IATO, E.M. Najeeb said. The Minister assured them that steps would be taken to address their concerns.

Meanwhile, Kerala Tourism cancelled the maiden Domestic Kerala Blog Express that was to be flagged off from March 25 from the State capital.

Thirty domestic bloggers was to board a branded luxury bus - Kerala Blog Express- for a two-week journey to the north to promote the destination and niche tourist products.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2yphgd/article31053409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVKOVALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tourism-industry-airs-concerns-to-govt/article31053201.ece
121,2020/03/12,Bird flu detected at Parappanangadi,"Sale of chicken or other birds banned within 10 km of Palathingal

The district administration swung into action on Thursday following the detection of bird flu at Palathingal within the Parappanangadi municipal limits in the district. An emergency was declared in the region, and sale of chicken or any other birds within 10 kilometres of Palathingal has been banned until further orders.

The culling of poultry and other pet birds within the one- kilometre radius of the place will begin on Saturday. About 4,000 chickens and birds are expected to

be killed in two days as part of measures to prevent the spread of bird flu.

Poultry shops

All poultry shops in the 10-km will be closed. Special squads of police and Motor Vehicles Department officers have been formed to prevent transporting of birds from or into Parappanangadi.

District Collector Jafer Malik said here on Thursday that poultry in the 10-km range should be protected by feeding them and they should never be sold or killed for meat.

Although no restrictions had been imposed on hotels and restaurants in the region on the use of chicken, Mr. Malik requested them to take extreme care while cooking poultry meat. He requested the people to seek

immediate treatment if they found any signs of the disease.

Control rooms

Two control rooms have been opened to address the queries and concerns of the people.

One of them is at the district level and the other at the Veterinary Hospital, Tirurangadi. They will be functioning round

the clock. They can be reached at 91884 65886, 94475 35222.

Ten rapid response teams (RRT) have been formed to deal with the bird flu emergency. There will be seven members in each team. They have been given special training to deal with the situation.

The culling will begin on Saturday and continue through Monday.

The culled birds will be buried at an appropriate place without leaving any chance for the carcasses to come in contact with waterbodies.

Ten passenger vehicles and 10 goods autorickshaws will be arranged for the culling process.

Safe culling kits, including masks and gloves, would be arranged soon, said Mr. Malik.

Health officials would supply prophylactic medicines for the people of Palathingal and surrounding areas. Measures such as vehicle announcement would be used to create awareness among the public.

Isolation ward

An isolation ward had been set up at Government Taluk Hopsital at Tirurangadi for observing those displaying symptoms of the disease.

They would be observed for two weeks.

Mr. Malik said that the cost of the culled birds would be calculated and a report would be given to the government seeking compensation for them.

No need to panic

Tests conducted on the carcasses of crows at Peruvallur, meanwhile, proved to be negative for bird flu. Mr. Jafer said that people need not panic over bird flu, but precautions and care must be taken.

However, he warned that strict action would be taken against those who deliberately refused to cooperate with the district administration in the fight against such epidemics.

Mr. Malik presided over an emergency meeting held here. District Police Chief U. Abdul Kareem, District Medical Officer K. Sakeena, Animal Husbandry Department Additional Director C. Madhu, Deputy Director Ayub, District Animal Husbandry Officer Rani K. Oommen, Dy.SP Jaleel Thottathil, Circle Inspector Vinod, tahsildar M.S.

122,2020/03/12,Bird flu confirmed at three places,"Besides two spots in Kozhikode, disease diagnosed at Parappanangadi in Malappuram

While suspected cases of avian influenza (bird flu) are being reported from various parts of the State, the disease has been confirmed only at three places in Kozhikode and Malappuram, Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development K. Raju has said.

Mr. Raju, while replying to questions in the Assembly on Thursday, said that while birds in parts of Kozhikode, including Kodiyathur and Vengeri, were initially affected, the disease had now been confirmed in Parappanangady in Malappuram.

Special squads

Special squads had been formed to cull birds within a certain distance around the affected areas. The situation had been brought under control.

According to a Malappuram report The culling of poultry and other pet birds within one-kilometre radius of Parappanangadi will begin on Saturday. About 4,000 chicken and birds are expected to be killed in two days as part of defensive measures being taken to prevent the spread of bird flu.

He said the State was well-equipped with specialised laboratories to diagnose zoonotic diseases without delay and adopt preventive measures. Besides the State Institute for Animal Diseases at Palode, the apex laboratory of the Animal Husbandry Department, four regional disease diagnostic laboratories functioned at Palode, Thiruvalla, Palakkad and Kannur.

Lumpy skin disease

Responding to questions by Eldo Abraham and N. Shamsudeen, the Minister said the recent spate of lumpy skin disease, caused by the capripox virus, among cattle and the drought in various parts of the State had taken a toll on milk production in the State. The production of milk had fallen from 19.1 lakh litres a day in December 2019 to 18.69 lakh litres by January 2020.

The situation had resulted in the decrease of 41,000 litres of milk a day.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4fz5q7/article31053029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVCHICKENFARM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bird-flu-confirmed-at-three-places/article31053025.ece

124,2020/03/12,Dalit boy sustains injuries in attack,"Incident happened last week at Ezhupunna

A 15-year-old Dalit boy has sustained injuries after allegedly being attacked by a man at Ezhupunna in the district.

The alleged incident happened last week. The Aroor police have registered a case against Gopi of Ezhupunna under Sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Arrest prevented

The police said the Kerala High Court prevented Gopi’s arrest after he moved an anticipatory bail application on Thursday.

As per a complaint filed by the parents of the victim, the boy, along with his friend, had gone to bathe in the pond of the Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu temple, Ezhupunna, following a disruption in the water supply on March 6.

The victim was blocked from entering the pond by Gopi stating that people of the Dalit community should not take bath in the temple pond. He then released air from the tyre of the victim’s bicycle. The boy questioned this and the accused beat him on his neck and punched him on the stomach.

“After getting information, I reached the spot and saw Gopi brutally assaulting my son and immediately took him to the Thuravoor taluk hospital. I came to know that Gopi used to scold and attack other children too. The incident has nothing to do with the temple committee,” said the father of the victim.

Boy discharged

After spending a couple of days at the hospital, the boy was discharged earlier this week to write the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination.

The accused, a retired railway official, reportedly is of the Kudumbi caste. Sasi Kumar, secretary, Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu Temple Dewasom, said that the pond was opened to all irrespective of religion and caste. “The incident has nothing to do with the Devaswom. It was an issue between individuals. People from all religions use the pond. It will remain like that,” he said.

Mr. Kumar added that the accused was not a member of the temple committee.

The police investigation into the incident is led by Cherthala Deputy Superintendent of Police A.G. Lal.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dalit-boy-sustains-injuries-in-attack/article31052875.ece

126,2020/03/12,Coronavirus | A glimpse into an isolation ward in Kerala,"A peek into the isolation ward of Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, where doctors and health-care professionals are fighting COVID-19 round the clock

At the reception desk of the administrative block of Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, you are asked to disinfect your hands using a sanitiser. On the wall across from the desk is a white board screaming out the word of the day, ‘Alert’ in English and ‘Jagrata’ in Malayalam.

At the other end of the lobby is a wide glass door, behind which a white curtain running across the small courtyard leading to a towering seven-storey building segregates two sets of people, all wearing face masks. Some are seated in chairs, while a few stand around having animated talk over their phones. A few desks with people in personal protective equipment (PPE) are seen in the portico and inside its opaque glass doors. It houses the largest isolation facility in the State for symptomatic suspected COVID-19 cases and confirmed patients.

Over the past two days, there has been a rush of inbound travellers at the Cochin international airport, mostly from the 13-affected countries bracketed in the high risk group, who were ferried to the isolation facility in sanitised ambulances driven by men in PPE for swab collection and screening.

Segregation

“In view of the rush, we segregated patients into high- and low-risk categories based on symptoms (or lack of it), history of illnesses and travel history. It was a need-based stratification based on which admission was done, with the rest being advised mandatory home quarantine. We have set up primary and secondary triages,” said Dr. Ganesh Mohan, in charge of the isolation facility and assistant nodal officer for COVID-19 control.

There are also secondary contacts and symptomatic home-quarantined people brought to the facility.

Also Read All about COVID-19

Dr. Mohan had taken the lead in setting it up a year ago to isolate suspected Nipah patients and it was being used to house the library and office quarters.

But, 49 days ago, when the first wave of COVID-19 hit the State in the form of Malayali medical students from China (they have since been cured of the infection and discharged), the medical college hospital led by Principal Dr. Thomas Mathew sprang to action to create an advanced isolation facility.

From the primary triage, symptomatic and sick people from highly affected countries are sent inside and their short history is recorded. The triages and the isolation area – with 30 bath-attached rooms across the third, fourth and fifth floors – have doctors, staff nurses and attenders working round the clock on four-hour shifts. All floors are under CCTV surveillance, with freshly drawn oxygen lines to meet emergencies and the patients are allowed to carry their mobile phones and are served food (often of their choice) and clothing.

The three-year-old patient here gets to enjoy his favourite pasta. “When separate groups of Americans and Russians were admitted here, we managed to get them their choice of food, too,” says a doctor.

Nerve centre

The nerve centre of the facility is a well-equipped, busy access-regulated control room in the admin block manned by house surgeons. “Continuous monitoring of the isolation building is done from here,” says Dr. Mohan. This is from where daily reports are sent to the government.

Its walls dotted with continuously updated white boards showing patients’ details, including bio, condition and treatment, doctors and nurses on duty, ambulance availability, screening details, stock of medicines, protective gear and related material besides videoconferencing facility, the control room is a hive of activity. Everyone makes it a point to sanitise their hands almost obsessively.

“This is what’s going to save you,” says Dr. Fathahudeen, head of the department of pulmonary and critical care and nodal officer for COVID-19, who walks in for a brief discussion, pointing at the hand sanitiser.

While the patients are taken in through the front entrance, the staff use the back entrance. There’s a donning room where they are assisted to put on the PPE and they use an elevator different from the one used by patients. The entire space is disinfected every now and then.

“You can’t eat or drink anything when you have put the PPE and you sweat profusely as the area cannot be fully air-conditioned. But they don’t complain. Nipah made them strong and they are cool,” says Dr. Fathahudeen.

Once the duty hours are over, they go to the doffing area to remove and set away the PPE for safe disposal. “This is done with even more care and then they walk down the fire escape stair so that they don’t mix with the staff arriving for duty,” adds Dr. Mohan.

Doctors have regular conversations with the patients in the isolation unit to keep them in good spirits.

The facilities

Oxygen lines, cylinders and echo machines are available on all isolation floors. There are two ICUs, but there could be two more. Samples collected at the triages are priorty-marked and rushed to National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, in viral transport mediums several times a day.

If 75 samples were sent on Tuesday, it was 49 on Wednesday. Similarly, everything used in the isolation facility is segregated, marked, coded and disposed, with the help of Indian Medical Association.

“Barcoded to trace them back to their source,” says a doctor. “The ambulance crew and the support staff are all trained and fully geared to do the work assigned to them. Doesn’t it show the strength of the public health system,” asks Dr. Fathahudeen.

A PPE costs ₹300 and PPEs worth over ₹30,000 are used daily. Add to that other expenses, including patient requirements and it is all on the system, adds another doctor. A fresh desk for contact tracing is also being added.

With the facility working almost to its capacity, more isolation centres, both in private and government, have been set up in the region for admitting symptomatic patients arriving from high-risk countries. “Ours is a world-class isolation model which has been commended by doctors from AIIMS and the NCDC as well, and therefore we need to ensure that only those requiring in-patient care are admitted here,” says Dr. Geetha Nair, medical superintendent in-charge.

“Active participation of private hospitals is also needed to meet exigencies,” they all point out. What if one of you gets infected? “Well, it’s been 49 days and we have taken utmost care to follow the protocols ourselves. We have even devised some on our own,” says Dr. Mohan, pointing to a chart.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dmtsg6/article31053580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVCOVID3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/behind-the-protective-gear/article31052745.ece
127,2020/03/12,Saviour of ailing pilgrims is no more,"In 37 years, Damodaran helped carry 5,000-odd pilgrims in stretchers to hospitals

Thanchavur Damodaran who has been heading a round-the-clock stretcher unit of the Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom (ABASS) at Sabarimala is no more.

Mr. Damodaran who fell unconscious at the Sabarimala Sannidhanam was taken to Pathanamthitta General Hospital in an ambulance of the Forest Department.

But, he breathed his last near Nilackal, before reaching the hospital. The body has been kept at the hospital mortuary for post-mortem examination.

The 74-year-old Ayyappa devotee from Chennai has been extending a helping hand to ailing pilgrims at Sabarimala for the past 37 years.

Sabarimala Sannidhanam does not have any medical facility as the Government Hospital there remains closed with the closure of the Ayyappa temple, despite the fact that around 300 people, including the head priest (Melsanthi), his assistants, and 20 policemen camp there all through the year.

Mr. Damodaran had become a full-time ABASS stretcher service volunteer in the early 1980s.

He had carried as many as 1,000 bodies from the hillock to Pampa, besides shifting around 5,000 pilgrims to healthcare centres at Sabarimala, Pampa and along the trekking path during the period.

Details in a diary

Mr. Damodaran used to keep the details of all those he had carried on his shoulders during the past 37 years in a diary.

His non-stop walk carrying a snakebitten cop from the interior forest areas of Kunnar at Sabarimala to Pampa was much talked about.

Mr. Damodaran was awarded a ‘certificate for best service’ by the police 10 years ago.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/saviour-of-ailing-pilgrims-is-no-more/article31052731.ece

136,2020/03/12,Janadhipathya Kerala Congress splits,"Splinter group to appoint new chairman and stay with the LDF

The infighting in the Kerala Congress (M), which has gripped the party for nearly a year now, is now shaking up the dynamics of group politics within the Kerala Congress platform after several years.

Nearly three weeks after the Kerala Congress (Jacob) was split, the Janathipathya Kerala Congress (JKC), a breakaway faction of the Kerala Congress (M), is poised for a split with party chairman Francis George set to realign with the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by P.J. Joseph. While the move will trigger a split in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) constituent, the residual group led by K.C. Joseph and Antony Raju has now decided to move on and appoint a new chairman.

“The decision by Mr. George to join the Joseph group was never discussed in any of the party forums. Against this backdrop, the party will be filling the chairman’s post during a State committee to be convened in Kottayam on March 14,’’ said K.C. Joseph, working chairman of the party.

According to him, Mr. George himself was present when the party State committee met last month and decided against a proposal to merge with the KC(M) Joseph group. Terming the meeting to be convened by Mr. George at Muvattupuzha on Friday as a mere group meeting, he claimed the support of majority of the district units and feeder organisations.

Party vice chairman Antony Raju said the core focus of the JKC was to constitute an alternative to the concept of United Kerala Congress having its foundations on individuals or families. “Our decision to walk out of the KC(M) four years ago was in protest against the anti-farmer stance adopted by K.M. Mani and P.J. Joseph following the K. Kasturirangan report. By returning to the KC(M) fold, Mr. George is contradicting his ideological position,’’ he noted.

Mr. George will be the second prominent Kerala Congress leader after Johny Nelloor to join the Joseph group following its split with the KC(M) group led by Jose K. Mani. As per reports, Mr. George will be accompanied by a few senior JKC leaders, including former MP Vakkachan Mattathil, general secretary (office charge) M.P. Poly and Thomas Kunnappally, among others",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/janadhipathya-kerala-congress-splits/article31052096.ece
137,2020/03/12,"LDF, UDF spar over Muthoot stir","Company refutes govt. claim, says 16 cases have been registered

Labour Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan has said that the State-wide agitation by a section of employees of Muthoot Finance Ltd. against the policies of the management has remained peaceful and that no instances of violence have been reported so far.

The company has, however, refuted the claim and has maintained that 16 cases have been registered against CITU activists who resorted to violence.

The Minister’s remarks were made in the Assembly while responding to a question raised by Aluva MLA Anwar Sadath. The Congress legislator accused the government of being mute spectator, while the prolonged strike affected several workers. The spate of unruly incidents could send out a negative message that the State is unfit for industrial ventures.

The allegations were countered by Mr. Ramakrishnan who claimed that the Muthoot management had violated the terms of a consensus formula that was mutually agreed by all parties. Besides, the company also dismissed 164 workers and shut down 42 branches. He said the government strived to become investor-friendly by protecting the interests of both employers and employees.

A subsequent remark made by M. Swaraj, who is also the State president of the CITU Muthoot Finance unit, that the Opposition have turned advocates for industrialists who held scant regard for the welfare of labourers sparked heated arguments. Claiming that no cases have been registered during the 71-day agitation, Mr. Swaraj accused the management of burning down an agitation pandal in Kozhikode.

Dismissing the claims raised against the company, the Muthoot management said that the 16 cases had been registered against CITU workers for attacking company employees, including its managing director. Eight of the cases were registered for attacks on women employees.

Accusing the agitators of resorting to ‘militant methods,’ the management stated that the strike had affected around 2,800 employees who were prepared to work. In its statement, the company claimed to have incurred heavy losses that have dimmed its growth prospects in the State

Referring to the destruction of the agitation pandal in Kozhikode, the Muthoot management said that it caught fire from the cigarette light of a worker and that no police case had been registered on the incident.

Meanwhile, the joint committee of trade unions had demanded steps to resolve the issue without further delay. The dismissal of 164 employees was unlawful and should be revoked, they added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-udf-spar-over-muthoot-stir/article31051938.ece
138,2020/03/12,Condition of stranded Malayalis worsens,"Fiumicino airport in Rome likely to be closed

The condition of 40-odd Malayalis stranded at the Fiumicino international airport in Rome for the third consecutive day on Thursday was rapidly deteriorating with reports of imminent closure of the airport, adding to their cup of woes.

They were supposed to board a flight to Kochi on Tuesday afternoon but were allegedly turned away for want of medical certificates vouching that they were not infected by COVID-19.

First terminal closed

“We have been told that the airport will be shut down on Friday and that the first terminal has already been closed. We have been waiting in front of check-in counter 252 of the Emirates airline in the third terminal since our journey was disrupted. Our window for a safe exit is fast disappearing,” said Abhijit K.S., who had even checked in and was on the verge of boarding when he was turned away by the airline on Tuesday.

He said it was a painful sight to see people from other nations leaving the airport for their homes while they were left staring at an uncertain future like abandoned refugees. “We have knocked at every door, including the offices of the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister. But still there is no clarity about our fate. Please do something to get us back to our home,” he said while talking to The Hindu over phone.

Kid among stranded

Among the Malayalis stranded at the airport were a two-month-old child, two- and three-year-old children, a pregnant lady, and the aged.

Santhosh Antony, another stranded passenger, said the government should have at least verified with the embassy concerned as to whether conducting tests and issuing certificates were possible before setting such a condition for permitting entry. “We are willing to undergo all tests and quarantine back home. But please let us in,” he said.

With no food available in the airport, they were dependent on the food arranged by the Malayali community. “We have been hearing about the imminent arrival of a medical team from India since Wednesday and we are still waiting,” Mr. Antony said.

A few chairs in the terminal being the only means to relax, passengers were taking turns sitting even as they desperately clutched on to the hope that they may eventually be able to make their way back home.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcrbp2/article31053255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tvairportcovid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/situation-of-stranded-malayalis-worsen/article31050981.ece
139,2020/03/12,Cancellation of events a big blow for cashew sector,"Huge financial losses for KSCDC and Capex

Already reeling under a dip in exports due to the COVID-19 impact, the mass cancellation of events and temple festivals has brought the cashew sector in the State to a virtual standstill.

While processors are bracing for a serious setback, the latest tenders floated by the Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) and Kerala State Cashew Workers Apex Industrial Cooperative Society (Capex) have been considerably underbid, leading to a huge financial loss. While there is a gap of over ₹40 lakh in KSCDC’s last two top bids, Capex registered a loss of ₹17 lakh on Thursday.

E-tender

“The participation in e-tender has also been very poor with the number of bidders coming down to four from the normal 14 or 15,” says S. Anilkumar, Managing Director, Capex. Since Holi celebrations were called off in most northern States, traders who stocked up for the festival season could not sell the majority of their product.

“As a result, the demand has come down and we are bleeding dry. Everything from the general economic slowdown to the decline in tourist inflow and cancelling of celebrations, including weddings, have affected the sector,” he says.

Nizamudeen. I, a processor who is currently in Nigeria to source raw cashew nut (RCN) for the next season, says the uncertainty in the sector has deepened since the latest outbreak of COVID-19 in Kerala.

“Last year I could procure over 2,000 tonnes of RCN from Nigeria for our domestic processors. But since the market is not stable, this time I couldn’t close any deals. As of now, processors can not decide whether to go ahead as the situation is highly unpredictable,” he says.

Prices falling

While the export market remains dull, lightly blemished whole (LWB), one of the most moving grades in domestic market along with splits, has skidded from ₹12,000 per box weighing 23.68 kg to ₹9,500. At the same time, the price of raw cashew nut (RCN) has been falling since Vietnam, the biggest global player, has cut down on procurement and processing.

“RCN prices are crashing and it has come down to $1,200 per tonne from $1,600. This is another reason stopping the processors from procuring huge volumes of RCN. If it goes down again that will amount to heavy losses later,” adds Mr. Nizamudeen, also the president of the Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters.

All stakeholders agree that it is an unexpected blow for the industry on a recovery mode and extra efforts will be required to stabilise the situation.

“Since it’s a food product we have closed all our factories as a precautionary measure. Currently we are trying to strengthen our domestic marketing network and online sales to tide over the crisis. We have already deployed a team for that and we are also planning to recruit marketing personnel in each district,” says S. Jayamohan, chairman, KSCDC.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cancellation-of-events-a-big-blow-for-cashew-sector/article31050743.ece

141,2020/03/12,COVID-19: Internet providers to step up network capacity,"Decision will benefit work-at-home workforce

Anticipating a spurt in work-at-home mode in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, Internet service providers in the State have agreed to step up the network capacity by 30-40% of the present capacity to meet the demand arising from the situation.

The decision was clinched at a meeting of representatives of various telecom service providers in Kerala Circle and officials of the Telecommunication Department convened by the Secretary, Electronics and IT, following a direction by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to look into the issue.

The decision will be beneficial for those working in IT institutions. The government has come out with a set of suggestions to avoid social gatherings in public places in view of COVID-19 spread. Telecom service providers have assured the government that they are well equipped to face the current situation.

The major part of Internet consumption in the State is made available through local servers. Moreover, global Internet traffic is very low compared to the overall consumption. So, increasing the capacity would not be difficult, service providers said.

Consumers have been directed to submit complaints regarding the low availability of Internet due to the spurt in consumption of Internet to the complaint redressal number of service providers or the State government call centre (155300). But complaints regarding insufficiency in the current network infrastructure should be strictly avoided.

The IT Department will also demand daily reports from various telecom service providers. By analysing these reports, remedial measures will be taken after bringing the sudden increase in consumption to the notice of service providers.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-internet-providers-to-step-up-network-capacity/article31050319.ece
142,2020/03/12,Coronavirus scare: Decision on shortening Kerala Assembly session to be taken on March 13,"CM Pinarayi Vijayan says public should not be scared but must be vigilant about the contagion and take measures to prevent its spread

The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Kerala Legislative Assembly will convene on Friday to deliberate whether or not to cut short its current session against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 threat.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the House on Thursday that Independent legislator and National Democratic Alliance partner P.C. George and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) lawmaker K.N. Khader had argued for curtailing the current sitting till the pestilence receded. As a first step, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan had banned visitors to the Assembly since Monday.

Mr. Vijayan said the public should not be scared but must be vigilant about the contagion and take measures to prevent its spread. He said he had learned that people were reluctant to travel and move about in public. However, there was no ground for such an alarm in Kerala.

The Health Department had effectively contained the illness. Moreover, most persons under surveillance had tested negative for the virus.

Mr. Vijayan said that on Saturday Cabinet Ministers would spread out to districts and hold conferences with respective district collectors and local body office-bearers to cobble together a grassroots level strategy to reassure the public and mitigate the economic fallout and disruption caused by the pandemic.

‘Don’t exaggerate threat’

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala termed the move to shorten the Assembly session as alarmist. He said the government should reassure the public. Ideally, its actions should not exaggerate the threat of contagion and spread unnecessary, fear and panic in society by calling of the Assembly.

Kerala had reported the first coronavirus case in the country on January 30. A student who had returned from Wuhan, a coronavirus hotspot, in China, had tested positive for the flu. Soon, two other returnees from China tested COVID-19 positive. The government isolated and treated them until further laboratory tests proved they were virus-free.

However, the virus reared its head again in Kerala on February 29. Three persons of a family who had returned to Pathanamthitta from Italy had “dodged” the surveillance at Kochi airport by concealing their port of the last departure.

They inadvertently passed on the illness to eight others. The returnees also caused the Health Department to put scores of persons in the district under intense surveillance.

It also prompted the government to impose a partial lockdown. The State closed educational institutions, cancelled summer camps and private tuitions, sporting events, religious festivals, government functions and public gatherings.

The government also attempted to muster popular support to prevent the contagion from overwhelming the public health system by requesting people to take safeguards and keep attendance at weddings and social functions to a minimum until March 31.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ra8o39/article31047949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONASCARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-scare-decision-on-shortening-kerala-assembly-session-to-be-taken-on-march-13/article31047951.ece

The district administration has decided not to allow religious, political and organisational events and celebrations in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the State. This decision was taken at a meeting convened by District Collector T.V. Subhash with political and religious leaders here on Wednesday.

Mr. Subhash said that it was agreed at the meeting to restrict essential rituals to mere ceremonies. He advised the police not to allow loudspeakers for public activities till March 31.

“Though the virus has not yet been confirmed in the district, vigilance is needed to prevent its spread”, the Collector said. There was no need to panic in this regard, he said.

Mr. Subhash said everyone should be prepared to follow the instructions given by the district administration and the health department.

He commended the religious and political organisations that had come forward voluntarily to comply with the restrictions.

Mr. Subhash said that it had been noticed that masks and sanitizers were being overpriced and hoarded and this was a serious offence. Action had been initiated against those who spreading false propaganda through the social media and creating unnecessary fears regarding COVID-19. If any such cases were noticed, action would be taken against them, the Collector said.

District Panchayat President K.V. Sumesh said the district planning committee had been holding meetings and it had been decided to create awareness among the public on the coronavirus threat.

These activities will be overseen by a committee headed by the local body president, secretary, health permanent committee chairman and doctors. It had been instructed to notify authorities immediately if suspected cases were found, he said.

Leaders who spoke at the meeting pointed out that there was a situation where people came together in connection with the voter list hearing. The Collector said the matter would be taken up in consultation with the State Election Commission. Arrangements should be made to provide masks and sanitizers through government hospitals.

Since school holidays had been announced, the visits to relatives should be avoided. The meeting proposed to create awareness among migrant workers in the district and to strengthen the surveillance at the airport and railway stations.

145,2020/03/12,Autopsy performed on KFD suspected macaque monkey,"Ticks from area collected to identify presence of virus

While the Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever, a tick-borne zoonotic disease, is posing a serious threat to public life on the fringes of the forest area in the district, a group of veterinary experts performed an autopsy on the carcass of a bonnet macaque at Onnam Mile near Kattikulam in the district on Wednesday.

The veterinary experts, led by Dileep Falgunan, District Veterinary Epidemiologist and Jawahar, veterinary surgeon, Veterinary Hospital, Kattikulam, performed the autopsy on the 14-year-old male bonnet macaque that collapsed from a tree near the house of a farmer adjacent to the Begur forest range under the North Wayanad forest division.

Dr. Dileep told The Hindu after the autopsy that they had been observing the primate in the area for the past three days and the animal was too weak. They would hand over the collected samples to the Health Department and it would send them to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Since KFD is a tick-borne viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans, the forest department officials were asked to report the sighting of primates in a critical state or their carcasses in Thirunelly grama panchayat, he said.

Vector control

The vector control unit of the Health Department collected ticks from the area to identify the presence of the virus causing the disease. The sample would also be sent to the NIV for testing.

“As many as 16 tick samples collected from the areas where monkey deaths were reported this year were sent to NIV, Pune, for further analysis, but, we are yet to get any positive ressults”, district surveillance officer Noona Marja said.

The ticks sample would also sent to the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University for identifying the species, Dr. Dileep said.

147,2020/03/12,Coronavirus: Vikram’s ‘Cobra’ shoot suspended in Russia due to COVID-19 scare,"Director Ajay Gnanamuthu posted on social media that the travel ban rules by the Indian government led to this decision

The shooting of actor Vikram’s next film Cobra has been suspended in Russia halfway, due to the coronavirus scare and the WHO declaring it a pandemic.

Director of the film, Ajay Gnanamuthu posted on Twitter, “Corona attack for #Cobra. Packing up shoot in Russia halfway due to the travel ban rules by Indian Government!! Pongaya neengalum Unga corona vum!!”

Besides Vikram, the film’s cast includes director KS Ravikumar, Srinidhi Shetty, Sarjano Khalid and former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan. The movie has music by A.R. Rahman.

Cobra becomes the first big-budget Tamil film to have its shooting stopped, as the pandemic spreads worldwide, and other Kollywood films could follow suit.

149,2020/03/12,"Four Kannada films set to release, despite COVID-19 panic gripping the state","'Shivarjuna', 'Naragunda Bandaya', 'Ambaani Putra' and 'Hulidurga' are hitting screens today

The film industry admits a fall in attendance in theatres, especially in multiplexes because of COVID-19. Theatres, however, will not be closed like in Kerala, unless they get a clear health directive from the Government.

After the new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed and the total count of Indian patients shot up to 60 plus, fear has gripped people. Kannada cinema is also hit by the new virus and screens across the state wear a deserted look.

Regardless of the virus threat, as many four Kannada films, including Shivarjuna, Naragunda Bandaaya, Ambaani Putra, and Hulidurga are hitting screens today.

Of the four films, Naragunda Bandaya is drawing attention as it is a fictionalised version of the historic revolt of farmers of Naragunda. In 1980, two farmers were killed in police firing during an agitation against betterment of levy imposed for water. Nagendra Magadi fictionalised this incident. Raksh and Shubha Pujna play lead characters.

Umesh Banakar, the vice-president of Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) has observed that the number of the audience is dwindling, especially in Bengaluru. Regardless of the quality of the film and prestigious banners, film goers are thinking twice before they set foot in multiplexes and single screens.

Kannada cinema, which faces competition from other language films, dubbed films from Hollywood etc. is now further threatened by the wave of misinformation on social media, Banakar said. Though over 60 plus films have been released in the last 70 days, only four succeeded in recovering their investment, says a source in KFCC.

Admitting that there is a significant decrease in the number of audience coming to watch films, KV Chandrashekar, of Veeresh Theatre says, “There is a 25% drop in the audience.” Sources in KFCC disclosed that; films such as Baaghi-3 and Dhrona starring Shivarajkumar have also been affected to a great extent because of the virus. The release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, has been postponed.

150,2020/03/12,"It’s not an easy film to watch, says Tymur Yashchenko of his debut feature","‘U311 Cherkasy’ is based on the true story of the crew of the Cherkasy resisting seizure by Russian forces

“It is not an easy film to watch; it’s not for everyone. The highest mark for me as a director is when people either love or hate the film,” says Tymur Yashchenko, of his debut feature, U311 Cherkasy, which was screened at BiFFes. Tymur had earlier made the short, Lev, a prologue to U311 Cherkasy.

Based on true events, the film follows two men, Mishko and Lev, serving on the minesweeper Cherkasy. The crew of the ship resisted seizure by Russian forces during the annexure of Crimea in 2014 before ultimately being captured. It was the last Ukrainian military vessel in Donuzlav Lake, Crimea, to be seized by the Russian Navy.

The affable Tymur sat down with MetroPlus for a chat.

Excerpts.

What inspired you to make this the subject of your first feature?

I think I received the energy after the Revolution of Dignity (2014) when we kicked out President Viktor Yanukovych. That energy was just waiting for realisation. Then I read that the Cherkasy was resisting in Crimea. I’m from Cherkasy, it is my hometown. I started checking and became interested in this story about the ships being blocked and resisting. I watched a one-minute YouTube video that sailors from another ship had put up one day before the Cherkasy was seized. The sailors are holding sticks and singing a hymn of the Maidan (the resistance). I saw how the sailors looked, they were fighting and singing. It is really Ukrainian to fight and sing (laughs). When I watched the video, I clearly felt that this has to be my debut.

What do you hope will be the audience’s takeaway?

The film is about self-identification. It is not political; politics is in the background for me. I was trying to show the collective image of the Ukranian Navy but I went much deeper and tried to show a portrait of Ukraine. It is just a lot of my love, a lot of my support and a lot of me as a Ukrainian.

Have you watched any Indian films? What is your opinion of them?

When I was young, there were a lot of Indian films on Soviet television and I was in love with commercial films like Seeta Aur Geeta. Indian films are very honest; I appreciate the passion, the music and the songs. And I love Indian culture; it is very similar to Ukraine. We also love to sing and we are also emotional people.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/52g9u6/article31049065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06bgmtymur1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/its-not-an-easy-film-to-watch-says-tymur-yashchenko-of-his-debut-feature/article31049069.ece
151,2020/03/12,Black sheep should not be allowed to use religion as a crutch: Neeraj Pandey,"Ahead of the release of 'Special Ops', Neeraj Pandey talks about targetting a particular religion in terror-related stories and his historical on Chanakya

As the Parliament Attack of 2001 refuses to fade away from public memory, writer-director-producer Neeraj Pandey, known for his thrillers set against real incidents of terror, is making his web debut with a story that spirals from the incident. Called Special Ops, it is premiering on Hotstar on March 17.

The catalyst

A poster of the series

“It was a shocking incident for the country and it is imperative that we don’t forget and draw lessons from it. When we were researching for Baby (2015), I got a tidbit of information on the Parliament Attack. Over the years, it developed into a story and kept returning to me,” says Pandey, as he opens up on the project, headlined by Kay Kay Menon. The senior actor plays an intelligence officer Himmat Singh who is in search of the mastermind behind a series of terror attacks in India in the last 19 years, starting with the Parliament Attack where five terrorists were gunned down on the spot.

The recent developments have indicated the involvement of a Jammu and Kashmir police officer in the case. Pandey says the role of Davinder Singh has emerged in the last couple of months.

“We have been working for the last two years but it is very interesting that new details are coming out. There are a lot of question marks on how it happened and why it happened. As for our story, it starts from a real backdrop and then builds into an organic fictional narrative,” he clarifies. “Himmat Singh believes that there is something that doesn’t meet the eye and that there was a sixth guy as well and follows him with remarkable tenacity,” adds Pandey.

Advertently or inadvertently, such narratives often put one religion in the dock. “I don’t think religion comes in the way of my narratives,” says Pandey, who shot to fame with A Wednesday. “Right from the first film, it is always about the offender,” he remarks. One reminds him of a staple situation that occurs in such thrillers where a guy explains the true meaning of Islam to an offender even as the writer juxtaposes a good Muslim against a bad Muslim. “See, such scenes emerge in the narrative when somebody distorts the true meaning of Islam,” counters Pandey.

It is true and it adds to layers, but we don’t get to see such black sheep on the other side of the spectrum. And even if they are, they don’t get any lesson on the true meaning of Hindusim. “I agree. It should be about black sheep on both sides and they should not be allowed to use religion as a crutch,” admits Pandey.

Sometimes, clips of his films are used to push a jingoistic agenda. “That’s terrible, but there is very little we could do once the film is out. It is used for memes and pushing agendas...but I think the audience is smart enough to distinguish between the intention of the director and the intention of people who misuse it.”

Shot in three different countries, promos suggest that the scale of the eight-part series is huge. “Let’s not see the digital medium as a smaller medium or look at it in a patronising way. We didn’t want to become content filling company judged by the number of hours of programming. It is exciting for us what we are offering is no less than what audience watch on the big screen.”

If a Neeraj Pandey thriller could be watched on a laptop, who would venture out to queue up at the box office. “There will be interesting stories that would not require more than two hours to tell. I will continue to make them for the big screen,” he justifies. Pandey, who has a novel to his credit, says writing a web series is like writing a novel. “I won’t say it is better than writing films. It is exciting and challenging. Here, like a novel, you can put the main strand on a pause, and digress a bit.”

Chasing stories

Pandey agrees it is hard to eke out information from India’s security apparatus. “Most of the information is classified but like good journalists, we keep chasing stories. Most officers don’t open up, but a few do,” he chuckles.

After Special Ops, Pandey is gearing up for a historical film on Chanakya. These days many people are looking for a modern-day Chanakya but Pandey clarifies that he is only focussing on the Chanakya who is a towering figure of our ancient history. “It was Chandraprakash Dwivediji who got the idea in my head. His knowledge and experience have come into play,” he says, referring to the director who made a popular teleseries on Chanakya for Doordarshan in 1990.

Pandey says he is not following a trend. “It has been with me for six-seven years. At that time, there was no trend and the technology to mount such an ambitious project was either not there or was very expensive.”

He promises not to look at the past from the prism of today. “It is about an important period in our history when the characters had their share of problems. Having said that Chanakya was a great mind and you find him as relevant as he was then.”

On casting Ajay Devgn as Chanakya, Pandey says the actor was the first choice. “His body of work speaks for itself.” Will he make him put on weight as the popular image of Chanakya is that of a portly intellectual? “It is too early to talk about such details but I guess there is no strong visual image of Chanakya. Many aspects of his life have been poorly documented. We are trying to do as much research as possible,” he sums up.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/h4nq6f/article31048771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG7636,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/black-sheep-should-not-be-allowed-to-use-religion-as-a-crutch-neeraj-pandey/article31048774.ece
152,2020/03/12,Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary ‘Get Back’ to release in September,"The film will showcase the making of the legendary band’s studio album ‘Let It Be’ and their final live concert as a group, on London’s Savile Row

The Walt Disney Studios has acquired the worldwide distribution rights to acclaimed filmmaker Peter Jackson’s previously announced Beatles documentary Get Back, which will release in September.

The film will showcase the warmth, camaraderie and humour of the making of the legendary band’s studio album, Let It Be, and their final live concert as a group, the iconic rooftop performance on London’s Savile Row.

The Beatles: Get Back will be released by The Walt Disney Studios in the US and Canada on September 4, additional details and dates for the film’s global release to follow. The announcement was made on March 11 by Robert A. Iger, Executive Chairman, The Walt Disney Company, at Disney’s annual meeting of shareholders.

“No band has had the kind of impact on the world that The Beatles have had, and The Beatles: Get Back is a front-row seat to the inner workings of these genius creators at a seminal moment in music history, with spectacularly restored footage that looks like it was shot yesterday,” said Iger, adding: “I’m a huge fan myself, so I could not be happier that Disney is able to share Peter Jackson’s stunning documentary with global audiences in September.”

The Beatles: Get Back will be presented by The Walt Disney Studios in association with Apple Corps Ltd. and WingNut Films Productions Ltd.

Compiled from over 55 hours of unseen footage, filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and 140 hours of mostly unheard audio recordings from the Let It Be album sessions, The Beatles: Get Back is directed by Jackson and produced by Jackson, Clare Olssen and Jonathan Clyde, with Ken Kamins and Apple Corps’ Jeff Jones serving as executive producers.

The music in the film will be mixed by Giles Martin and Sam Okell at Abbey Road Studios in London. With the restoration behind it, The Beatles: Get Back will create a vivid, joyful and immersive experience for audiences.

Talking about the film, Peter Jackson said: “Working on this project has been a joyous discovery. I’ve been privileged to be a fly on the wall while the greatest band of all time works, plays and creates masterpieces. I’m thrilled that Disney have stepped up as our distributor. There’s no one better to have our movie seen by the greatest number of people.”

To this, McCartney added: “I am really happy that Peter has delved into our archives to make a film that shows the truth about The Beatles recording together. The friendship and love between us comes over and reminds me of what a crazily beautiful time we had.”

Ringo Starr shared: “I’m really looking forward to this film. Peter is great and it was so cool looking at all this footage. There was hours and hours of us just laughing and playing music, not at all like the version that came out. There was a lot of joy and I think Peter will show that. I think this version will be a lot more peace and loving, like we really were.”

The Beatles: Get Back features the footage of the band at work in the studio, capturing John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr as they create their now-classic songs from scratch, laughing, bantering and playing to the camera.

A fully restored version of the original Let It Be film will be made available at a later date.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fw5unr/article31048695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APWASTHERE-BEATLESARRIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/peter-jacksons-beatles-documentary-get-back-to-release-in-september/article31048696.ece
153,2020/03/12,Hollywood reacts to Harvey Weinstein sentencing: ‘It’s the power of people who speak up’,"More than 90 women, including A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Uma Thurman, came forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault and sexual harassment

Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault, and the women who accused the disgraced Hollywood mogul welcomed the verdict, terming it as the victory of the justice system and the “power of people who speak up”.

Weinstein, who has been accused of violating scores of women, was convicted last month of raping a once-aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on former TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi at his apartment in 2006.

The producer behind Oscar-winning films as Shakespeare in Love and Pulp Fiction was the first prominent Hollywood name to be accused for his alleged predatory behaviour in the bombshell expose by The New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on October 5, 2017, followed by Ronan Farrow’s piece in The New Yorker on October 10.

Also Read Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison

The report sparked off the #MeToo movement, which empowered survivors of sexual assault, abuse and rape to raise their voice and hold the perpetrators responsible.

Actor Mira Sorvino, who was one of the first to go on record to accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, said she cried “tears of amazement and gratitude” after the sentence was pronounced.

“23 years. Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for his crimes of rape and sexual assault. I literally cried tears of amazement, gratitude that the justice system has worked on behalf of all of his victims today,” Sorvino tweeted Wednesday.

The Silence Breakers group, which has spoken out against sexual harassment and assault and includes several Weinstein accusers like actors Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd, released a statement after his sentencing.

“Harvey Weinstein’s legacy will always be that he’s a convicted rapist. He is going to jail — but no amount of jail time will repair the lives he ruined, the careers he destroyed, or the damage he has caused. The Silence Breaker community was founded on solidarity, support and compassion. The New York trial has ended, but the Silence Breakers will persist in our crusade for cultural change, justice and to have our voices heard,” the statement read.

Farrow tweeted about the power of those who speak up.

“A lot of news underlines how hard it is to hold wealthy and connected people accountable. Today’s shows the power of people who speak up, from a position of far less power, at great personal risk.

“The Weinstein sentence reminds us of the importance of those sources and of leaders at news organizations who refused to kill the story-including the editors at the New Yorker who published the first allegations of rape and assault about Weinstein,” he tweeted.

More than 90 women, including Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong’o, Lea Seydoux and Uma Thurman, eventually came forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault and sexual harassment after the news expose.

Rosanna Arquette, another member of The Silence Breakers, paid gratitude to McGowan, one of the first women to call out Weinstein, among scores of other “brave” women who broke their silence.

“Gratitude to all the silence breakers especially Rose and all survivors of weinstein to the brave women who testified and to the incredible investigative reporting of Ronan Farrow who uncovered the sabotage and spying and to David Remnick thank you Rich McKuen and NY Times,” she wrote on the microblogging site.

After the sentencing, Kate Beckinsale recounted a 2001 incident with Weinstein that left her in tears. In 2017, the Underworld star accused the producer of inappropriate advances when she was a teenager.

In a lengthy Instagram post, the actor detailed a meeting with Weinstein that occurred a day after the New York premiere of Serendipity.

“These photos were taken at the premiere of Serendipity on October 5, 2001. We all refused to go because holding a premiere mere weeks after 9/11 with the city still smoking felt like the most insensitive, tone deaf, disrespectful idea possible,” she said.

Beckinsale said Weinstein “insisted” on the premiere, and the morning after, Beckinsale and her toddler daughter Lily were invited to his home for a playdate with Weinstein’s daughter.

She said the producer rained profanities at her for “ruining” the film’s premiere by not wearing a short, tight dress.

The actor said Weinstein’s sentencing was “a huge relief to me on behalf of all the women he sexually assaulted or raped, and I hope will be a deterrent to that sort of behavior in this and any other industry.”

Actor Olivia Munn, who was one of six women who came forward with sexual harassment and assault accusations against filmmaker Brett Ratner in the wake of #MeToo, hailed the Weinstein accusers for creating a “huge shift” in the world.

“To the women who bravely testified against Weinstein + the Silence Breakers who courageously told their stories unsure of what repercussions might unfold: Your strength & resilience created a huge shift in the world and empowered millions of people. Myself included. Thank You,” the X-Men: Apocalypse star said in a tweet.

Time’s Up, the organisation which was born out of the Weinstein expose, thanked all the women who testified in court against the producer for their courage.

“First and foremost, we are grateful for the courage and strength of Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, and Lauren Young, who bravely testified in court, and we remain in solidarity with the more than 100 survivors who suffered abuse, harassment, and rape at the hands of Harvey Weinstein. The trauma of sexual assault and harassment is lifelong — we can only hope that today’s sentence brings all of the survivors of Harvey Weinstein some measure of peace,” Tina Tchen, president and chief executive officer of the foundation, said in a statement.

Weinstein was acquitted of the more serious charges against him of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault.

154,2020/03/12,Ekta Mittal’s new film looks at myriad moods of migration,"Inspired by Shiv Kumar Batalvi’s poem, Ekta Mittal’s 'Gumnaam Din' looks at the inner worlds of migrant workers

Presenting the pain of separation, Ekta Mittal’s Gumnaam Din depicts the journey of migrant workers who get lost in the urban jungles. Produced by the Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT), the film was screened in the Shorts category at the recent Berlin International Film Festival. Migration is not a new subject for Ekta. She has made Birha, a feature-length documentary on the lives of people who leave their homes in search of a better life.

Ekta Mittal

“Gumnaam Din is part of a longer film and multimedia project called Behind the Tinsheets which looks at the inner worlds of migrant workers building cities. This is the fifth film under the project produced by PSBT,” says Ekta.

“After working on three films set in Bangaluru, I felt the urge to go back to the families of workers across different parts of the country,” adds the filmmaker, who works at Maraa, a media and arts collective in Bangaluru. An interesting aspect of the 27-minute film is its form. It is inspired by Shiv Kumar Batalvi’s poem by the same title which translates loosely to “Missing Days”. “The film is a response to the mood and metaphor this poem which touched upon grief and separation. For me, Batalvi’s poems are dreams and visions of the pain and suffering caused by separation and longing. His poems guided me in representing stories of the families and workers I met along the journey of making this film,” explains Ekta.

Editing the film, says Ekta, was a “great exercise of moving away from structured ways of working on a narrative and arriving at our own logic of creating a landscape of waiting and uncertainty.” “I work closely with my crew to arrive at the visual treatment but I also rely on my dreams for clues for sound and visual,” she notes.

Edited excerpts:

Tell us about the poetic form of the film. Usually, such subjects are dealt with journalistic tools.

I deliberately chose to stay away from the journalistic tone because I wanted to indulge the viewer in the days of the missing person. I tried to show the silence, the lamentation, the waiting and the ethos around the missing person. Besides I wanted to address undocumented, unaccounted and unregistered disappearances that comprise the mysterious trajectories of migration in the country.

How did Shiv Kumar Batalvi’s birha poetry comes into your life? How did you connect it with the cinematic form in Gumnaam Din — a Punjabi poet giving voice to the separation felt by the migrant workers from Bihar.

I stumbled upon him by chance when I was trying to think of the form of my film which I knew was not a film filled with facts and figures. I wanted to be attentive to the pain and grief that people endure when they lose or they are unsure if someone they love would ever return; the strength of survival is derived from shared experiences of everyday life. For this, I turned to poetry and found some of his early poems online and his interview that moved me. While I was familiar with birha poetry, his poetry particularly guided me further in my production. I found his poems to be metaphorical and visually rich. His poems are like visual essays in themselves. And the film is a response to his poem, not literally but keeping in mind the essence and mood of it but in the context of migration.

Both Batalvi and the film talk about the loss of identity, which has a contemporary ring to it. How do you see it?

The loss of identity that comes with migration in India speaks to obscurity – of not being counted, going missing from the official registers. In Batalvi’s poetry, it seems to me, there is a voluntary acceptance of gloom and alienation caused by unknown reasons. The poem resonates with the states of mind of several people who are about to leave, who are on the road and who have left for good and perhaps those who are deemed to be missing. The poem and the film meet on a suspension of time, location and identity.

Tell us about the reflection of a woman dressing up? Some could see it as a stereotype of a woman waiting for her partner…

She could be someone waiting for someone else, not necessarily her husband. She could be remembering the act of dressing. Without a word, she gets ready for something we can only imagine. It is an everyday act. She is beautiful. Fearless. Aware. Here I wish to move away from the classical representation of the woman waiting for her man, in fact, her presence is open for speculation in the film. Her expression can be interpreted in more ways than one. Once, during my research, a woman told me that the greatest ability of a woman is to forget.

One of the most moving scenes is the wails of women filling the atmosphere...How did it come about?

This comes from a personal experience. I witnessed in Bihar and mistook it for an animal. The women led me to a room where I saw a mother and daughter in a deep embrace wailing loudly. They told me every time a daughter visits her mother and when it is time for her to leave back to her husband's house, she embraces her mother and wails – to share that which cannot be articulated in words. This is the only time she is free to express what she feels.

What is the purpose of using the missing person’s voice to describe him? In a sense, it takes away the mystery and in another, it adds to it…

This was my voice, hoping desperately that the missing person I was looking for wishes to be found. It is also open for speculation and interpretation. Would a missing person want to be found? How would he or she reach out?

How was the response at the Berlinale?

It was overwhelming and humbling at the same time. A great opportunity for me to see the film on beautiful large screens. To see a packed house every day was rewarding. I was also delighted to be part of a programme that delved upon similar themes from different approaches and in different contexts.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yh3988/article31048353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gumnaam-Din-22,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ekta-mittals-new-film-looks-at-myriad-moods-of-migration/article31048355.ece

Less than 24 hours after Disney+ integrated with Hotstar, and popular shows like The Mandalorian, Marvel’s Hero Project and The World According to Jeff Goldblum were made available to users in India, now the Hotstar website and mobile apps have reverted back to their original state.

All Disney+ content has also been removed.

""A limited release of the beta version of the Disney+ Hotstar app is currently being tested with a small number of consumers, in preparation for the full-fledged app launch on 29th March"", clarified a Hotstar spokesperson.

The official Disney+ India launch on Hotstar is still scheduled for March 29.

Users were confused yesterday when a simple update of the app changed the logo and they had access to the wide catalogue of Disney titles, 18 days before the rebranding was supposed to happen, but they welcomed the surprise happily.

However, now, the rollback comes as a rude shock, and consumers who started watching some of the shows, are clearly not happy, judging by social media.

A new prompted update also reverts the Disney+ Hotstar logo to the updated Hotstar logo, that is blue in colour.

Indian viewers have been eagerly waiting for the content since Disney+ launched in November last year in the USA.

158,2020/03/12,"Tovino Thomas on 'Kilometers and Kilometers', an actor's need for fitness, and being a movie buff","The actor, whose ‘Kilometers and Kilometers’ will be out in theatres soon, talks about the kind of effort he puts in while juggling roles of various shades

From minor roles, Tovino Thomas has battled his way to the top in Malayalam cinema. His performances in movies such as Ennu Ninte Moideen, Guppy, Godha, Mayaanadhi, Theevandi and Lucifer have helped him make a mark. After last month’s Forensic, Tovino has Kilometers and Kilometers (of which he is one of the producers) that is releasing soon. The actor is currently shooting for the role of a super hero in Basil Joseph’s Minnal Murali.

Excerpts from an interview with the actor:

Why made you take up Forensic?

I heard the thread of Forensic during Lucifer’s shoot. The director duo of the film (Akhil Paul and Anas Khan) gave me updated drafts after each discussion. A lot of research has gone into the film as there are several scientific aspects to this story. It was the storyline that hooked me.

You do back-to-back movies. Is this part of a game plan?

Every time I listen to an exciting story, I want to be a part of it. You can’t guarantee that all the movies you do become hits even if you are really selective. I believe in following my instinct. I did take a break to spend time with my family before joining Forensic. As Minnal Murali needs about 120 days of shoot, I won’t be doing any other projects in between.

Does an image come in the way of exploring different characters?

Honestly, I don’t think I have such an image. I have done just a limited number of romances. I have been playing characters of all shades, that too of varying lengths.

Is social media a boon or a bane?

We could be different from what is depicted on our social media profiles! Moreover, we only post whatever we want others to see, like promotional material, interesting occasions and so on.

How easy is it to slip in and out of the skin of your characters, especially when you are doing so many in a row?

There is a lot of homework involved and pains taken to shape each character. I make it a point to make my characters different, not just in looks but in their mannerisms as well. All this is done after thorough discussions with the team. I became part of Minnal Murali soon after wrapping up Forensic. My get-up in both the movies is entirely different.

Pictures of your workout sessions for Minnal Murali went viral...

Minnal Murali discovers super powers after being struck by lightning. Although there are no ‘shirtless scenes’ in the movie, I felt I needed to look good even with a shirt on. I need to have a good physique to look convincing as a super hero. I will be continuing my workout as I have to look younger than my age in Muhsin Parari’s Thallumaala. The workout regime for Muhsin’s film will be more rigorous from now on and the diet will be different.

How important is physical fitness for an actor?

A certain level of awareness about fitness is essential for every human being. When it comes to an actor, the need for fitness and the kind of shape you need to be in depend on the characters you are doing. The exercise routine we do changes accordingly. If I am focusing on hypertrophy (putting on muscles) now, it was for the need to bulk up for Kalki. Earlier, I had to lose weight considerably for Theevandi as my character was of a man in his 20s. I used to run a lot and was on a crash diet during that period. I am someone who remains in the character that I am playing during the entire shoot. As I keep changing my looks for various roles, what I see in the mirror helps me get into the character easily.

Is there a sense of insecurity among actors as the fate of a couple of movies can decide his/her standing in the industry?

I can’t speak for others. I was a rank outsider when I entered this industry. I have reached where I am by doing minor roles and guest appearances before donning characters with shades of grey before moving on to lead roles. I believe that if I am good enough and have the talent, I will be a part of the industry for a long time.

You are a movie buff. What is the experience like when you watch your own movies?

Well, I can’t watch it objectively. I am the kind of actor who visits the film location even on days when I don’t have a shoot. So when I watch them later on screen, all those memories will be in my mind. While watching movies that I am not part of, I am totally immersed in the narrative, often not even focusing on the technical aspects.

What is your character in 'Kilometers and Kilometers'?

I play Josemon, a villager. He has to shoulder various responsibilities after the death of his father. The story is about his journey from Kerala to Khardung La, with an American lady.

Are there any new projects outside Mollywood, after 'Maari 2'?

159,2020/03/12,"Governments should spend more on education of women, says VIT Chancellor","International Women’s Day celebrations held in the Vellore campus of the institute on Thursday

Chancellor of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) G. Viswanathan urged the Central and State governments to spend more for the education of women. A woman autodriver from Vellore was honoured and women from self-help groups (SHGs) who completed the Jackfruit Value Addition Training Programme from VIT were given certificates during the International Women’s Day celebrations held in the campus on Thursday.

Delivering his presidential address, Mr. Viswanathan said women make up 49% of the population in India but they constitute only 27% of the workforce in the country.

“This is because not many women get access to higher education. We need to provide education to more girls to change this scenario. About 50% of women in foreign countries are working in various jobs,” he said.

Mr. Viswanathan reminded that the Women’s Reservation Bill is pending in Parliament for the past 24 years and the bill which was also passed in Rajya Sabha in 2010 was still pending.

“I request all political parties to come together in the empowerment of women and make this an Act in this session of the Parliament itself,” he added.

“We started Universal Higher Education Trust (UHET) eight years ago to help students from poor economic backgrounds in Vellore district to pursue higher education. As part of UHET, we have also been helping girl students as education will empower and uplift them. So far about 6,000 students have been benefited by this initiative. The education that you provide a girl will help her through life,” Mr. Viswanathan said. Programme Director of Doordarshan, Puducherry, Andal Priyadarshini, was the chief guest and she spoke about issues and hardships faced by women in the society. “We need to make International Women’s Day a meaningful occasion and not just a day for celebration. Only education will help a woman in her life as it will empower and provide support all through her life. Women should remember the reasons and sacrifices various women have made due to which International Women’s Day is celebrated across the globe,” she said.

‘Better multitaskers’

An eminent Advocate in Madras High Court, C. Sangamithirai pointed out that women face lot of issues and hardships in their life. “Women are better at multitasking than men. Women assume different roles in life,” she said.

Listing out achievements of 11 women who have changed their life, including Indian sportswomen like eminent Boxing champion Mary Kom, India’s first woman fire fighter Harshini Kanhekar, VIT vice-president Sankar Viswanathan said students should get inspired by the achievers and should chase their dreams till they come true.

VIT assistant vice-president Kadhambari S. Viswanathan said in the last few decades we have made great strides in closing the gender gap.

“VIT has done a lot of social welfare programmes for women in need. We have conducted training camps for SHGs so that they can develop a sustainable business. VIT and our contractors have come up to build toilets for girls in schools in Vellore and other parts of the district,” she said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6np602/article31053235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIT-International-Womens-Day,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/international-womens-day-celebrations-held-in-the-vellore-campus-of-vit-on-thursday/article31053236.ece

163,2020/03/12,Biodiversity park to come up on 85 acres in Gudiyatham,"Facility expected to help farmers and improve tourism in Vellore district

The State’s largest biodiversity park equipped with multiple facilities and attached to a horticulture farm will be set up over 85 acres of land in Gudiyatham taluk, allotted to the Horticulture Department.

Workers are currently working to level the ground in Agaramcheri village ahead of the construction of the biodiversity park. After the trifurcation of Vellore district into Vellore, Ranipet and Tirupattur last year, the Navlock Farm and Horticulture Garden near Ranipet became part of the newly-formed district.

Hence, it was decided a new biodiversity park would be set up in the Vellore district boundaries to ensure availability of quality seeds for farmers at subsidised rates and to safeguard native tree and plant species. The park will come up at Agaramcheri village in Gudiyatham and the preliminary work is under way to get a clear picture on the available land.

When it comes into existence, the park will be the biggest of its kind in the State, an official from the Horticulture Department said.

World class facilities have been planned for visitors and their stay at the park and it is being expected to improve tourism in the district, he said.

For indigenous species

The park will be filled with species of trees categorised according to climate and a section of the park will be dedicated to sthala vrikshas, monumental trees found in South Indian temples. The facility will also nurse indigenous species of plants.

Besides, endangered flora will be maintained through a germ plasm centre, which will also have a host of tourist-related activities. The proposed park will also raise nurseries for coconut and paddy in addition to lime, mango, guava, chikku, pomegranate, jackfruit and kodukapuli varieties, he added.

Flower varieties and herbal plants will be grown for research as well. To sustain availability of Siddha and Ayurveda-related plant species, the park will have a herbal garden where such herbs and plants will be grown.

The official added that a model of the park has been handed over to the Tamil Nadu Horticultural Development Agency (TANHODA) and once the proposal is accepted by the Finance Committee, the work of planting tree saplings and creating boundaries would start, the official concluded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5kjzhn/article31053147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THMARGUIDYATHAMBIODIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/biodiversity-park-to-come-up-on-85-acres-in-gudiyatham/article31053148.ece
164,2020/03/12,T.N. puts NPR revision on hold,"The State government has sought clarifications from the Centre over three specific questions pertaining to the mother tongue, details of the parents and spouse of the resident during enumeration.

The Tamil Nadu government has “put on hold” works towards updating the National Population Register (NPR) in the State, pending certain clarifications from the Centre.

“So far, the notification for updating of the NPR has not been issued. We will take it up only after we receive clarification from the Centre. Until then, NPR updation has been put on hold,” Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar told journalists in Chennai on March 12 evening.

The State government has sought clarifications from the Centre over three specific questions pertaining to the mother tongue, details of the parents and spouse of the resident during enumeration.

“Since the clarifications sought for have not been received as yet, works on updating of the NPR have not commenced,” he said, and pointed out that the notification issued in the State was only for conducting Census and not for NPR.

As for the claim of the DMK that residents have to produce documents to support their details during the enumeration, Mr. Udhayakumar reiterated that no documents were required to be submitted.

The NPR was not applicable to any specific religion, he pointed out and said the State government was taking steps so that the NPR could be updated as Muslims wished.

Mr. Udhayakumar said Muslims should not fall prey to the “instigation and conspiracy” of the DMK and added, “100%, the AIADMK government will stand with the minorities”.

To a query, the Minister said the State government has conveyed the apprehensions of the minorities to the Centre and “only in the hope that the Centre would take steps accordingly” the works towards NPR updation have not commenced.

As for the absence of festivals celebrated by Muslims in the NPR manual, Mr. Udhayakumar said the manual was just the same as it was followed in 2010. “As for Muslim festivals, since there are no fixed dates but depend on the sighting of crescent, those festivals were not mentioned. They could have objected then [2010]. In 2020 too, the same manual is to be followed.”

Asked why a resolution could not be passed against the legislation when several other States could do so, Mr. Udhayakumar pointed out that some States that passed the resolution have issued notifications.

Replying to a query on DMK president M.K. Stalin’s claim that the AIADMK government was hesitant to pass a resolution opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act, the NPR and the National Register of Citizens in the Assembly fearing imprisonment, Mr. Udhayakumar said it was a sensitive issue and had to be dealt with carefully, while other parties were playing politics over the issue.

167,2020/03/12,Plan to promote Kalvarayan hills as tourist destination,"“We are trying to develop a tourism circuit connecting the waterfalls, mountains, ancient cave temples by improving basic infrastructure and other amenities for tourists”

In an effort aimed at enhancing the tourism appeal of Kalvarayan hills in the Eastern Ghats and to bring it on a par with other hill stations in the State, the Kallakurichi district administration has proposed various tourism-related activities in and around the hills.

“We are trying to develop a tourism circuit connecting the waterfalls, mountains, ancient cave temples by improving basic infrastructure and other amenities for tourists. The committee has also proposed good roads from the foothills to Vellimalai, Kalvarayan hills and all its villages,” he said.

There is good scope for developing a biodiversity park and botanical garden in the hills. More recreation facilities have also been planned for tourists including guided tours to the waterfalls, trekking and eco-tourism activities organised by the Forest department.

168,2020/03/12,Aptel asks TNERC to expedite decision on CMRL’s power tariff plea,"The Chennai Metro Rail Limited pointed out that the Delhi and Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporations were being charged lower tariff under a seperate category

The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel) has directed State power regulator to decide on Chennai Metro Rail Limited’s plea to be categorised under special tariff category status as expeditiously as possible.

In its petition before Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission, Chennai Metro Rail (CMRL) had sought for railway traction tariff at a concessional rate by excluding the subsidy and cross subsidy charges for the period of trial operation from July 2013 to June 2015 as well as for the operational period.

The energy cost contributes to about one-third of operation and maintenance cost. The power supply requirement for the project was in the order of 30 million units in 2015 and is expected to be 200 million units in 2026, it had said.

From July 2013, the tariff fixed under HT (III) category by the Tangecdo was at the rate of ₹7/unit with a fixed demand charges of ₹300/KVA/month and subsequently revised and billed at ₹8 per unit and demand Charges at ₹350/kVA for the traction and utilities, the CMRL said.

It had pointed that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) were being charged lower tariff under a seperate category.

The TNERC had rejected the plea and had said the special category request would be considered in future tariff orders based on study from Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco). Against which, the CMRL moved Aptel.

Aptel noted that in spite of direction to Tangedco for a proposal, no steps have been taken till date towards that end either by the State utility or by the State regulator.

The decisions which concern the public at large, particularly the consumer whose interest is at the core of the legislative scheme of the Electricity Act, cannot be put off indefinitely. The call has to be taken expeditiously by the Commission on which the legislation places the responsibility, the Aptel said.

The parties are directed to appear before the State Commission on April 6, 2020. “We request the State Commission to decide the matter as expeditiously as possible, preferably within three months of the first date of hearing set by us,” Aptel said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6akma1/article31048218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CMRL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aptel-asks-tnerc-to-expedite-decision-on-cmrls-power-tariff-plea/article31048219.ece
169,2020/03/12,"Eight years after recruitment, part-time teachers struggle for wage hike","Teachers continue to flood School Education Department with appeal letters asking for regularisation and higher salary

Eight years after their recruitment as part-time teachers in schools , the struggle of around 12,000 teachers to increase their monthly salary continue.

These part time teachers were recruited for teaching subjects like physical education, music, tailoring and horticulture and are given a monthly salary of ₹7,700.

In their bid to pressurise the government to revise the salary and to regularise their employmenttime, the teachers are individually sending letters to the Chief Minister, School Education Minister and various officials highlighting their demand.

In March 2018, to comply with the provisions of Right to Information Act, Tamil Nadu government recruited 16,549 part-time teachers for a salary of ₹5,000 per month. Their salary was partly funded by the Central government.

The salary was revised to ₹7,000 in 2014 and later to ₹7,700 in 2017 without any benefits like provident fund or other allowances.

According to the teachers, though more than 16,000 were recruited, only 12,000 are working at present because of retirements after crossing 58 years of age, resignations and deaths.

“We are supposed to work for three days a week. However, apart from teaching our subjects, a lot of other office work and even teaching of other subjects are given to us,” said a teacher in a Chennai-based school, requesting anonymity.

During the strike by Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisation - Government Employees’ Organisations (JACTTO-GEO), it was us who helped in running the schools, he points out.

The part-time teachers expressed disappointment that even in the recruitment of special teachers for arts, tailoring and other subjects through Teachers Recruitment Board, they were not given any preference.

C. Senthil Kumar, State coordinator, Tamil Nadu All Part Time Teachers’ Association, said that teachers recruited under the same scheme in neighbouring States like Andhra Pradesh are paid more than ₹14,000 per month. “We have to be paid at least the minimum wage of ₹18,000 eligible for skilled workers,” he demanded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eight-years-after-recruitment-part-time-teachers-struggle-for-wage-hike/article31047997.ece

Actor Rajinikanth has once again put off announcing his entry into politics. In a press meet in Chennai on Thursday, after meeting the office bearers of his Rajini Makkal Mandram outfit, Mr. Rajinikanth said he wants to play “a small part” in bringing revolution in Tamil Nadu politics and never wanted to become the Chief Minister.

Mr. Rajinikanth said, following the demise of legendary politicians Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, there was a political vacuum in the State and he felt there weren’t tall leaders to fill the shoes of these former Chief Ministers.

“I began discussing with many people, the possibility of an alternative politics,” Mr. Rajinikanth said, elaborating his three-point vision.

The political party and the government “should not be headed by the same person”.

According to S.I. Sheik Zeelani, a member of Tiruppur Youth Federation, who was privy to the developments in Mangalam, the protest was called off following intervention from the local Jamaath leaders.

The indefinite protests were organised on the premises of a mosque located near the Four Way Junction in Mangalam.

172,2020/03/12,Suspected Maoist among two detained near Anaikatti,"A native of Karnataka, Srimathi faces nine cases

The ‘Q’ Branch of the Tamil Nadu police detained suspected Maoist Srimathi and another woman from a checkpost near Anaikatti along the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border on Wednesday.

Sources in the ‘Q’ Branch said Srimathi and the woman accompanying her were picked up from a Coimbatore-bound TNSTC bus around 5.30 a.m.

A native of Belagodu-Kudige in Sringeri taluk, Srimathi, 27, faces nine cases registered in Sringeri and other police stations across Chikkamagaluru district.

Born into an agricultural family, Srimathi studied up to Class IX. Sources said she left her family in 2008 and got involved in the activities of suspected Maoists. She has a sister and two brothers.

As per records available with the ‘Q’ Branch and the Special Task Force (STF), she was among several suspected Maoists attached to the Kabani and Bhavani Dalams of the CPI (Maoist), who are on the watch-list of anti-Naxal agencies in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

A source in the know said ‘Q’ Branch officials were questioning the two women at a location in Erode. Their arrests were not recorded till evening.

Kerala’s anti-Naxal squad ‘Thunderbolt’ had claimed that Srimathi was present in Agali forests near Attappadi in Palakkad when its commandos killed four Maoists in separate encounters on October 28 and 29 last year. She was allegedly part of among a few Maoists including top leader Deepak, the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the CPI (Maoist), who managed to escape from the squad. The Committee included top Maoist leader Deepak.

Deepak was arrested by the STF from a forest area near Anaikatti on November 9. No information about the whereabouts of the woman who accompanied Srimathi was made available.

173,2020/03/12,"Facelift for 1,000-pillar hall at Madurai Meenakshi temple","Work on encasing wooden paintings under way; museum renovation to be taken up next

A 10-year-plan to remodel the 1,000-pillar hall at the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple in Madurai is finally in motion.

Joint Commissioner of the temple N. Natarajan said that they have begun encasing wooden paintings said to be over 100 years old, depicting the Tiruvilayadal of Lord Siva to avoid vandalism. They will also be working on renovating the temple museum, which currently lacks information or signages on several artefacts.

According to a report on the reorganisation of the temple art gallery by the Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai circle published in 2005, the wooden panels were painted about 100 years ago and were kept alongside the potramarai kulam (golden lotus tank). When authorities decided to paint the temple walls with the same stories, the wooden paintings were moved to the 1,000 pillar hall.

“It is understood that there existed an earlier version of murals at the same spot and these paintings were covering them. The fate of the murals is not known. In this context, these wooden panels become important and need to be preserved with utmost care,” the report reads.

Since vandals for years have drawn over the painting using pencil and paint, the paintings need to be encased in glass covers, the Joint Commissioner said.

An official at the temple said they have been chemically preserving the temple panels, ensuring aeration and avoiding dust to settle. “We will also be ensuring better display arrangement after consulting an expert on how best we can showcase the stories,” he said.

In the next stage, the officials will begin the facelift for the museum which draws around 1,000 visitors every weekend. Apart from this, the Joint Commissioner said that they are working with consultants on minimising waiting time and queues for darshan by inculcating technology in the temple’s daily function. “This is still in the nascent stage though,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/k52hwo/article31045587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MarMASNJFaGKQ77SOD83jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/facelift-for-1000-pillar-hall-at-madurai-meenakshi-temple/article31044370.ece
174,2020/03/12,Governor’s signature mandatory to release Rajiv case convicts: HC,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday held that a recommendation made by the State Cabinet to the Governor on September 9, 2018, for releasing all seven life convicts involved in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case would come into effect only after the Governor affixes his signature and not otherwise.

Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan held so while dismissing a habeas corpus petition filed by one of the convicts S. Nalini to declare her detention since September 10, 2019, as illegal and consequently order her release forthwith on the ground that the Governor’s nod was sought only as a matter of constitutional courtesy.

The Bench said: “The mere advice tendered by the council of ministers will not entitle the petitioner to get released prematurely unless it was accepted or signed by the Governor. The signing of the order by the Governor is mandatory and in the absence of the same, the petitioner cannot get the benefit.”

The judges concurred with Additional Solicitor General (ASG) G. Rajagopalan and State Public Prosecutor A. Natarjan that the Cabinet’s recommendation per se would not entitle the convict to lay a claim of illegal detention when she and all other convicts had been put through a full fledged trial and were found guilty in the courts of law.

Further, the ASG also relied upon a 1988 judgment of the Supreme Court wherein it was held that the Governor’s nod for decisions taken by the State government was not a mere formality and that it was mandatory.

Deciding to follow the principle laid down in that verdict, the Bench led by Justice Subbiah said: “Thus, it is evident from the above decision that the order, though it may be formal, to be passed by the Governor of the State assumes significance and without the consent of the Governor or his signature on the proposal sent to him, such proposal shall not take effect.”

Insofar as the present case was concerned, the Cabinet had made a recommendation to release all seven convicts. However, “such advice has not been acted upon and it is pending consideration of the Governor. No order has been passed thereof as on date. While so, merely based on the advice of the council of ministers, her detention cannot be declared as illegal,” the Bench concluded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/governors-signature-mandatory-to-release-rajiv-case-convicts-hc/article31044309.ece
175,2020/03/12,RSS worker attacked in Coimbatore hours after DGP’s review meeting,"ACP removed from post for flaws in intelligence gathering

Hours after Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy held a high-level meeting to review the lingering communal tension in Coimbatore, unidentified persons allegedly assaulted Suryaprakash, 28, a local functionary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at Sundarapuram late on Wednesday.

Sources said that four men barged into a shop run by Mr. Suryaprakash and assaulted him. He suffered injuries on the head and shoulder but his condition was stable.

The police said that special teams were formed to trace the assailants involved in the alleged assault.

Mr. Tripathy held the meeting here on Wednesday evening, which lasted for over two hours, with ADGP Jayanth Murali (Law and Order), Coimbatore City Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan, West Zone IG K. Periaiah and other senior police officers.

The communal tension escalated with the attack on Hindu Munnani’s district secretary Madukarai Anand late on March 4 which was followed by hurling of petrol bomb at a mosque near Ganapthy in the early hours of March 5. At least seven vehicles belonging to Muslim and Hindu organisations were also damaged since March 4. On Tuesday, unidentified men allegedly assaulted Social Democratic Party of India's (SDPI) district secretary Mohammed Iqbal and Hindu Munnani claimed hurling of a petrol bomb at its office in the city.

Meanwhile, O. Vetriselvan, ACP, Special Intelligence Cell, Coimbatore city, was removed from the post on Wednesday, reportedly owing to flaws in intelligence gathering on issues that triggered communal tensions. He was replaced by ACP C. Chandrasekar.

SDPI Tamil Nadu president Nellai Mubarak on Wednesday petitioned Mr. Sharan seeking arrest of assailants who attacked Mr. Iqbal.

He alleged that members of right wing organisations were behind the assaults on Mr. Iqbal.

Meanwhile, Coimbatore Collector K. Rajamani held a peace meeting with leaders of Muslim centric parties and Islamic orgnisations, similar to the one held with leaders of Hindu organisations on Tuesday. The Collector asked both sections to avoid agitations in the coming days.

176,2020/03/12,High Court begins hearing cases for and against anti-CAA protests,"Emotions run high as lawyers engage in loud arguments

The Madras High Court on Wednesday began hearing a batch of cases filed for and against the ongoing anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests across the State. Emotions ran high on the first day of hearing, with a huge number of lawyers entering into loud arguments inside a packed court hall and the judges having to request them to calm down and assist the court in taking the right decision.

Appearing before Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy, senior counsel R. Vaigai raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate K. Gopinath of the Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam (HMK) against the protests being held in Tiruppur. She said the petitioner was facing as many as 15 criminal cases and had suppressed those details before the court.

“I really wonder how the Registry numbered his petition. He can’t take the legal system to ransom. What bonafide does the petitioner [have] to knock at the doors of this court. I am raising a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of this petition. This is a fraudulent PIL. It is going to give a very bad signal,” the senior counsel said and urged the court to permit all impleading petitioners to file their counter-affidavits.

On the other hand, advocate G. Karthikeyan said the anti-CAA protesters had no right to squat on public roads for days together and prevent free movement of traffic. “It should be nipped in the bud. If this is permitted, then they will also sit on the Beach Road, the Poonamallee High Road and everywhere,” he added.

Advocate N. Chandrasekhar echoed Mr. Karthikeyan’s view and claimed that 46 lives had been lost and properties worth several crores destroyed in Delhi [during the recent riots]. He said an identical situation may arise in Tamil Nadu if the police fail to take stringent action against the protesters and remove them from public roads. He alleged “total inaction” on the part of the State government and said anarchy was prevailing in Coimbatore, Pollachi and Tiruppur.

However, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan told the court that there had been no disturbance to law and order, and police had ensured protection to all.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w4qngw/article30966948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-begins-hearing-cases-for-and-against-anti-caa-protests/article31044207.ece
177,2020/03/12,"‘3 hydrocarbon projects sanctioned in T.N., Puducherry in 2019-20’","81 Petroleum Exploration Licences were awarded, says Union Minister

The Centre has awarded three hydrocarbon and petroleum exploration projects in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation during 2019-20, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan has said.

He disclosed this information while replying to DMK legislator Tiruchi N. Siva in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The latter had sought details on the number of hydrocarbon exploration projects cleared during 2018-2020 and the companies that had been granted clearances in Tamil Nadu. Mr. Pradhan said 81 Petroleum Exploration Licences (PELs) in 94 exploration blocks, covering an area of 1,36,790 sq km, had been awarded by the Central and State governments during the said period under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) and the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP). Similarly, 18 Petroleum Mining Leases had been granted under Discovered Small Field Bid Round-II during 2018-19 and 2019-20, the Union Minister said.

Mr. Pradhan said three blocks, covering 2,337.43 sq km in six districts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, had been awarded to IOC and ONGC under OALP during 2019-20. It included PELs for a 143.97-sq km area of offshore exploration.

While IOC would execute a project on 474.2 sq km in Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts, ONGC would implement two projects across Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts. Of the 2,337.43 sq km of permitted areas, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram account for 1,259.43 sq km. While the Centre had granted PELs for offshore areas, the same was yet to be granted by the Government of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Pradhan added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3-hydrocarbon-projects-sanctioned-in-tn-puducherry-in-2019-20/article31044192.ece

179,2020/03/12,Director Ambili has had an interesting journey in the Malayalam film industry,"Director, art director and photographer Ambili returns to his first love, painting, with an art show at David Hall Art Gallery

In his lifetime Ambili has been many things and donned many ‘roles’. He has directed close to 12 films, been make-up artiste, still photographer for films, art director, an artist with drama troupes, and designed posters in his career spanning 50 years. This diversity hinges on an identity he holds close to his heart — an artist’s. With his art show, on at David Hall Art Gallery, he returns to that original calling. “If not for art then I wouldn’t have worked in films,” says the 68-year-old.

Director Sreekumaran Thampi told Ambili, when invited for the show, that it was “very late”, implying it was long overdue.

“I am lazy,” Ambili offers as explanation. For someone ‘lazy’ the number of works — paintings and sketches — is a staggering 124. His last ‘exhibition’ was in 1971, as part of a competition when he was a student of the College of Fine Arts (then the Occupational Institute) in Thrissur. Competing with batch mates and seniors, he won the first prize. It was another 48 years before he painted again, for this show.

From the show The works are distinct and varied, a sum total ofAmbili’s experiences in different fields of art. In terms of palette and sensibility – they show an influence of cinema. He does not shy away from colour — bold reds, deep blues and burnt ochres. The diversity of inspirations frees him from the limitation of adhering to a single style. He pays a tribute to masters such as Raja Ravi Varma, MF Husain, Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo — their portraits backgrounded by some of their major works. Besides there are black and white sketches — ink and dot — of actresses.

Writer/actor Sreemoolanagaram Vijayan had asked him to draw the cover of a book, which Ambili didn’t. Vijayan commented, “You are a passenger who reaches the station after the train has left.” It could be true of him, he believes. “Perhaps that is why I haven’t able to make a feature film in the last 15 years. I find it difficult approaching people asking if we could make a film.” The film industry too changed a lot in the last 15 years. His last feature film was Chamante Kabini, made in 2003, but released in 2015. In the meanwhile Ambili has been making films for the Public Relations Department of the State Governent, and also made short films based on SK Pottekattu and Perumbadavam Sreedharan’s stories.

Ambili may not have painted for art shows, but he had been painting film posters for a while — “My poster for the Madhu-Sarada-Jayabharathi-starrer Asthamayam (1978) was noticed at a time when not many bothered with them. It had Madhu and Jayabharathi back-grounded by a setting sun.”

His tryst with painting, after he embarked on his film career, is about blank canvases, unused paints and broken promises, “Actor Sarada bought me paints and canvases for me to paint horses, actor/director Thikkurissi Sukumaran Nair did the same for a female nude, and writer Sreemoolanagaram Vijayan wanted me to do a book cover.” None of these got done – Sarada forgot, in Thikkurissi’s case the thespian remembered and joked about Ambili not doing the art work.

Curly haired, bearded and dressed in a white kurta and mundu, friends like director/scenarist Sathyan Anthikkad say he hasn’t changed much. Ambili has known Anthikkad since the days he was an art director and the latter an assistant director.

Cinema has been his everything. The most notable of the films he has directed is his first, Veena poovu (1983), the story of an itinerant musician. That film changed the course of his career and he became director; it is remembered for its songs especially ‘Nashta swargangale ningalennikoru...’ “Films like Pather Panchali and Bhuvan Shome; films by Ingmar Bergman and other classic inspired me to direct films,” he says. Some of his other films are Ashtapadi, Maunaragam, Samudhayam and Swantham Sarika.

He belongs to a different, difficult time for filmmakers. A time when friendships were forged for life, made through shared disappointments and supporting each other. His conversation is peppered with names such as those of directors Ramu Kariat, Balachandra Menon, Bharathan and PN Menon, and writer Vaikom Mohamed Basheer, among others. He has worked with these and other directors as art director, costume designer and at times, make-up artiste too.

A sketch of Vaikom Mohammed Basheer he made as a 16-year-old led Ambili to films. The writer was speaking at a programme held in Thrissur, Ambili drew the writer on a paper an acquaintance was carrying for an autograph. Basheer was impressed by what he saw and showed it to the National Award-winning director Ramu Kariat who also happened to attendthe event.

Ambili landed a job as artist at Kariat’s Uma Printers (Thrissur), one of Kerala’s few colour offset printers. He got to work on campaign material for Kariat, when the director contested an election. “Working for him opened many doors for me. He was no ordinary filmmaker, he had worked with some of the best in the industry; that he hired me said something about my talent as well.” He freelanced for Uma Printers as a student and later joined it. His first was the poster for Virunnukaari (1969). The ‘to-be-released’ poster, colloquially referred to as the ‘coming poster, of Kariat’s Nellu (1974) was the first he signed his name. “I signed my name on it, Bharathan and PN Menon signed their work so I did too.”

Art direction happened to him by chance when he was called for actor Madhu’s film Asthamayam. He later worked at the actor’s Uma Studio in Thiruvananthapuram. It is fascinating as he remembers ‘building’ the pay ward of the multi-storied Medical College Hospital (Thiruvananthapuram). Despite limitations of technology and material, he created a set out of wood and board, drew the backdrop of buildings as seen from the seventh floor complete with tops of coconut palms.

“I learnt this during my sojourn in Madras. Music director PS Vidyadharan and I went there, like all film aspirants, to try our luck. When we went to AVM studio and Prasad Film Studio, I checked to see how the sets were made, it was educative.” He stayed and worked at Cherian Brothers, a photo studio in Madras as artist, the exposure perhaps led him to still photography (films).

Ambili transformed actor Praveena into a yakshi in Kalliyankattu Neeli and made a mask for the villain; his experience in theatre and working with dancers like Kalamandalam Kshemavathy helped him. “I don’t know how that happened, but perhaps it has something to do with me being an artist. I was able to do all these different things,” he says.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/l7txas/article31049449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12KIMPAMBILI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/director-art-director-and-photographer-ambili-returns-to-his-first-love-painting-with-an-art-show-at-david-hall-art-gallery-in-kochi/article31049452.ece
180,2020/03/12,Jyoti Gaekwad: The little bird takes wing,"Jyoti Gaekwad’s paintings are a tribute to the power and poise of woman

Having toyed with the brush as a school student, she revived her ‘love’ for the canvas 40 years after marriage. For Jyoti Gaekwad, support from cricketer-husband Aunshuman, a noted opening batsman, mattered the most and she produced 101 paintings in the last two years, good enough to put up an exhibition, which was an overwhelming success in hometown Baroda, which has a culture for painting so stunningly preserved at the Laxmi Vilas Palace.

“I had never held a brush since school days,” said Jyoti. “It was my sister (Dipti) who rekindled my passion for painting when she visited my house (two years ago). She had more faith in me I guess. One fine day she presented me a canvas, colours and brush. I sort of took off with my desire to be a painter.”

Jyoti Gaekwad

Jyoti was always conscious of the fact that she had an innate talent to paint. “As a child I was very fond of colours. My bags and clothes would be very colourful. A collage of vibrant colours. The plastic bucket at home was full of colours, my drawings would be bright and floral. It was a wonderful world where I could do what I wanted to. My flowers would be green and leaves red. It was fun,” Jyoti took a trip into her childhood.

Marriage brought her painting to a halt. For 40 years, her life was devoted to looking after her husband and cricket-playing sons (Aniruddha and Shatrunjay). “It was this visit by my sister that I revived my painting talent. I was helping design clothes for her, advising on colour combinations. I am so glad I listened to her.”

The first painting was a “baby bird.” It came out well. Aunshuman was the first to appreciate. “That was a huge boost. I realised I could do it and took my work seriously. That was two years ago. And I just squeezed in time whenever I could. Painting when kids were away. Painting at night when everyone would be asleep. I found energy to paint because of the encouragement from the family.”

Jyoti would surprise Aunshuman with her speed to paint. “I had the time. I also loved it once I saw colours on the canvas. I have not followed anyone really. Yes, I would refer to someone’s work and give it my style and finish. I had my own little style. After a while I stopped referring to others’ work and depended on my imagination.”

The idea of holding an exhibition was promptly encouraged by Aunshuman. “I had 101 exhibits. From 10 inch frames to four-and a-half feet. The response to the exhibition was amazing and an exciting experience for me. It was so beautiful to give my reactions and share my journey. I know I have a long way to go but I am happy to have a platform to satisfy my colour palate. I am able to derive inspiration but change the end product to my taste. I also know I am just a drop in the ocean in my field of painting,” she says with humility.

Jyoti’s theme has been “women, spiritual ganapati, birds and animals. My paintings depict the power of a woman. Don’t mess with her.” Among her favourites is a portrait of Aunshuman, inspired from a 1976 black-and-white photo. Her personal favourites, which were not put on sale at the exhibition, were “the little bird, Aunshuman in action and the woman in a veil.”

Someday, Jyoti aspires to travel with her work to other cities, notably Delhi and Mumbai. “That’s my dream now.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/m3r2p7/article31048895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200306-WA0016,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/jyoti-gaekwad-the-little-bird-takes-wing/article31048897.ece
181,2020/03/12,Ramayana has lessons in leadership skills,"In his speech, Prof. Sivakumar drew from Tyagaraja and Valmiki

Prof. V. Sivakumar, from Washington, spoke about Values, Leadership, Communication and Ethics in Tyagaraja’s kritis, and explained how these qualities were evident in Rama — Tyagaraja’s ishta deivam. The event was in honour of Sivakumar’s parents — Saraswathi and Venkatrama Iyer. Sivakumar analysed how the saint composer presented Rama as leader, arbiter, just ruler, true friend, equanimous prince and a person who knew the value of detachment.

Sivakumar posed the question: What should be the focus of one’s meditation — Rama’s qualities or his name? Tyagaraja in ‘Evarikai Avataramu’ (Devamanohari), draws attention to the greatness of Rama’s name, he said. Two qualities of Rama stand out, namely satya and dharma, said Sivakumar. In the Ramayana, Lakshmana is unable to kill Indrajit, and he finally says, “ If Rama is one who keeps his promise, then let this arrow kill Indrajit.” And that is enough for the arrow to hit the target. Tyagaraja is lost in admiration of Rama, when he sings ‘Raama nee samaaanam evaru.’ (Who is equal to you, Rama?)

A good leader tries different ways like reconciliation, mediation, negotiation and arbitration, to resolve conflicts. In the Kapinarayani kriti ‘Sarasa sama dana,’ Tyagaraja says that Rama tried everything possible to get Ravana to mend his ways. He offered to gift Ayodhya to Ravana. He recognised Vibhishana as ruler of Lanka. But Ravana did not budge. With all possible avenues exhausted, Rama had no alternative but to kill Ravana, says Tyagaraja.

Not dictatorial

A good leader makes decisions only after conferring with others. When Vibhishana arrived from Lanka, Rama asked the monkeys what he should do: should he accept Vibhishana, or send him away. Rama had already made up his mind as to what he was going to do. And yet, he was not dictatorial, but allowed others to state their points of view. A good leader does what is right. He does not go by what would be a popular decision.

Had Rama abided by popular opinion in the case of Vibhishana, then the latter would not have been admitted into Rama’s camp. But when the consensus was against Vibhishana, Rama welcomed him, showing that while he was willing to lend his ears to the opinion of others, he would always abide by dharma. ‘Nagumomu’ (Abheri) is a cry for acceptance, and can be interpreted as Vibhishana’s words of anguish as he awaits Rama’s decision.

In ‘Emani Maataaditivo Rama’ (Thodi), Tyagaraja marvels at Rama’s ability to choose the right words, keeping in mind the listener’s bent of mind. This is in tune with the modern concept of designing an advertisement to convince the target audience.

Some glitches

There were, however, some errors in Dr. Sivakumar’s lecture. The Ramayana begins with a list of 16 qualities — not 13 as the speaker said — and a question from Valmiki to Narada about who has these qualities. It was not Vedanta Desika, who said ‘Ramo vigrahavaan dharmah.’ This is a popular quote from Valmiki Ramayana. Mareecha makes this observation about Rama, when he counsels Ravana.

Sivakumar got Kamban wrong when he said that the bard describes Rama’s face as resembling a sunflower, when he was told to go to the forest. Kamban, in fact, says that Rama’s face, when he was told of his coronation, was like a freshly bloomed lotus, but when he was told of his banishment, his face was even more beautiful than a lotus, which has just blossomed.

The Rama charama sloka “Sakrdeva prapannaya tava asmi iti ca yaachate” is another well-known verse, and it ends with the words “vratam mama,” and not “vratam maam.”

Sivakumar’s speech was followed by Prema Rangarajan’s concert, where she presented a few of the kritis Sivakumar spoke about.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/o5qs9b/article31048781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13FRSIVAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ramayana-has-lessons-in-leadership-skills/article31048782.ece
182,2020/03/12,Bowing to the beauty of Orchha,"The debut edition of ‘Namaste Orchha’ celebrated art and heritage in a quaint setting

Contemporary art is best appreciated in the context of our rich heritage. The Madhya Pradesh government took care to showcase several magnificent monuments and spots during its two-day extravaganza, Namaste Orchha.

The festival started with a commissioned contemporary dance drama by the Delhi-based Sadhya group. The story, they projected, was how Orchha came to be Lord Rama’s kingdom. The 30-minute beautifully choreographed piece narrated the story of the Orchha Queen, who insisted on going to Ayodhya to bring back Lord Rama to Orchha.

The depiction of Lord Rama was an ingenious conception, using a puppet to depict the Lord, with a masked face of gold. Aesthetically conceived, the image had a lasting impact. Another lovely touch was lighting up the entire fort wall, which was the backdrop, when Lord Rama is ensconced in the Rani Mahal.

The use of light and musical imagery (flute to remind one of Lord Krishna) was interesting; one wished the dance movements had a bit more variety as, towards the end, they tended to be repetitive. This beautiful introductory act, with elegant costumes, set the tone for the festival.

The next act was a brief audiovisual on the history of Orchha. It, again, brought out the story of Lord Rama in Orchha. Made by Delhi-based Springbox Films, the audiovisual touched upon the rich musical tradition of Madhya Pradesh, with the Gwalior Gharana (vocal) and Maihar Gharana (instrumental), reminding the audience of the state’s contribution to the classical tradition.

With graphics combined with paintings, old photos, newly shot visuals and powerful music, the audiovisual was a grand spectacle, screened on the huge walls of the Jahangir palace in the Orchha fort. One hopes it will be shown to tourists who visit the fort, as a one-time screening would be a waste.

Yasmin Kidwai, who conceived the project, said, “We hope MP Tourism uses this work in the future too.”

Shubha Mudgal in performance at the festival

The next evening’s cultural performances started with Shubha Mudgal accompanied, as always, by Aneesh Pradhan on the tabla and Sudhir Nayak on the harmonium. Disciple Shivangini Yeashu Yuvraj with her clear tuneful voice provided vocal accompaniment. With a time slot of only 30 minutes, which Shubha stuck to with her usual rectitude, the presentation was not one of her best, but one had to admire the perfection of her repertoire — the opening piece in Raga Aiman was dedicated to Lord Rama, the ruler of Orchha. The composition was of her Guru Pt. Ramashreya Jha, ‘Jab Hari dhanush dhare’. The next piece was as appropriate, as the concert was on the Betwa river ghat, a piece, ‘Laao nayeeya’ composed by 19th century Bharatendu Harishchandra, linking the story of the ‘kewat’ of Lord Rama with the softly flowing river behind. Tuned by Aneesh Pradhan, the piece was based on raga Madhukauns, a conscious effort by Shubha to try to sing thumris in ragas other than the commonly prevalent. The last piece was a Hori , ‘Aaj khelen Holi Kanhaiya ghar’.

Aditi Mangaldas and her troupe presented ‘Uncharted Seas’. The music was by Shubha Mudgal, interestingly all in raga Bageshwari. With Aditi’s excellent, muted coloured costumes, and her creative energy, the performance was high on aesthetics. Aditi’s solo act, moving only her ghungroos, in agitation, then in calm, to depict her search, was masterly.

The concluding performance was again by Sadhya. Titled ‘Maha Arti’, it simulated an aarti on the river. Using conches and bells, fire and movement, and the Bengali dhuna, all the three senses were invoked subtly in a memorable presentation; without resorting to the obvious. The piece in raga Des on the sitar by Suhel Sayed Khan was haunting.

The concluding entertainment acts were rock bands Mrigya, (Bhopal-based sitarist Smita Nagdev joined them), Indian Ocean (Shubha Mudgal and folk singers Kaluram Bamaniya joined them) and the French megastar Manu Chau. The diversity of the performances in the richly endowed Orchha, made the festival memorable.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/zdeqje/article31048435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13frNamasteOrchhajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/bowing-to-the-beauty-of-orchha/article31048437.ece
183,2020/03/12,Madhya Pradesh crisis | High drama at resort hosting M.P. MLAs,"A scuffle reportedly broke out when the father of one of the MLAs, who had come along with the visiting ministers, tried to meet his son

High drama ensued at a resort on the city’s outskirts, where rebel Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh are holed up, when two ministers from M.P. visited the resort on Thursday in a bid to meet the legislators but were stopped by the police.

A scuffle reportedly broke out when the father of one of the MLAs, who had come along with the visiting ministers, tried to meet his son. Police personnel rushed to the spot and prevented any meeting from taking place. Police officers asserted that they had acted on a request from the MLAs, who they claimed had written a letter to the State police chief seeking security and expressing their unwillingness to meet anyone.

Addressing a press conference, Ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav and Narayan Chowdhary, father of MLA Manoj Chowdhary, alleged that the police had “manhandled” them and not allowed the father to meet his son. “I had gone to the restaurant to meet my son,” said Mr. Chowdhary. “But the police soon came and separated us and did not allow us to meet,” he asserted.

Mr. Patwari claimed that several MLAs lodged in the resort were not there of their own will, adding that he had come to meet his cousin Manoj Chowdhary, only after he had called. “BJP has misused the police, who acted undemocratically, manhandled us and detained us,” he asserted, appealing to the conscience of the rebel Congress MLAs in the city’s resorts to honour their commitment to secular principles and the Congress party.

Local television stations showed visuals of police personnel dragging away Congress workers from the resort and bundling them along with the visiting M.P. ministers into a police van. “They were detained at Chikkajala Police Station and it was only after I intervened that they were let go,” said D. K. Shivakumar, KPCC President. Bhimashankar Guled, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East - Bengaluru), however, denied that any Congress leaders had been manhandled or detained.

Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao told The Hindu that they were bound to honour the request of the elected representatives in the resort, who in a fresh letter on Thursday, had not only sought protection but also made clear that they did not want to meet anyone. “The DCP at the scene has taken action to prevent it from developing into a law and order situation,” he said, defending the police action.

184,2020/03/12,RJD’s springs a surprise Rajya Sabha nominee,"Not many in Bihar’s political circles know Amarendra Dhari Singh

Bihar Opposition party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Thursday announced the names of the party’s nominees for two of the five Rajya Sabha seats from the State that would go to poll on March 26 — Prem Chand Gupta and Amarendra Dhari Singh — and the name of the latter surprised many in the State’s political circles.

RJD State president Jagdanand Singh announced names of the party nominees.

Mr. Gupta’s name was expected as he has been a party leader and long-time close aide of RJD chief Lalu Prasad. He is currently a member of the Rajya Sabha from the neighbouring State of Jharkhand, but his term expires on April 9.

Little-known

The little-known Mr. Singh is a landlord involved in several business enterprises. “Honestly, I had not heard his name either…but I today came to know that he is from Paliganj in the Patna district and a big businessman with hundreds of acres of agricultural land,” a senior RJD leader and former minister told The Hindu.

“He comes from the upper caste Bhumihar community…by nominating his name, the party chief may have some political calculation in view of the upcoming State Assembly poll in the State,” another RJD MLA said, adding that he had been unaware of anyone by the name of Amarendra Dhari Singh.

Later, after both the RJD nominees had filed their nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha seats, RJD leader and Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Tejashwi Yadav told mediapersons, “Amarendra Dhari Singh has been in the party and it is not necessary that everyone knows everyone…both our party candidates have filed their nomination papers today and will have smooth passage to the Rajya Sabha.”

‘Positive signal’

Political analysts are also of the view that, ahead of the State Assembly elections, the RJD seeks to send a positive signal to upper caste voters by nominating Mr. Singh, who is also said to be close to Congress leader Ahmed Patel.

On Wednesday, the ruling Janata Dal-United (JD-U) had announced the names of Harivansh Narayan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, and the Bharatiya Janata Party had announced name of Vivek Thakur, as Rajya Sabha nominees for three seats, which they could win comfortably in view of the National Democratic Alliance’s strength of legislators in the State Assembly of 243 seats — a Rajya Sabha nominee needs the support 42 MLAs to win.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rjds-springs-a-surprise-rajya-sabha-nominee/article31053000.ece
185,2020/03/12,"Jyotiraditya Scindia has embraced RSS ideology, says Rahul Gandhi","Scindia’s exit has triggered several Congress leaders to speak their mind on social media for the past two days

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said his former colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia got scared of his political future and joined hands with the ideology of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

The former Congress chief, who called himself a friend of Mr. Scindia, claimed that the latter would not get respect from the BJP.

“This is a fight of ideology. One of the one side, you have the ideology of the Congress party and on other side, you have the RSS-BJP ideology….Jyotiraditya Scindia ji got scared about his political future and that’s why he kept his ideology in his pocket and joined hands with the RSS,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters outside the Parliament complex.

“But the reality is that neither will he get respect there nor will he be satisfied because of the ideology that is in his heart. What is inside his heart and what he is speaking are two different things,” he added.

This is his first public statement after Mr. Scindia's exit that set off a chain reaction among younger Congress leaders who are restive and worried about their political future. With substantially reduced political clout after back to back electoral rout (2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls), several of them are reported to be weighing their options. Uncertainty over the presidentship of the party has only added to their dilemma.

Asked if younger leaders close to him would be accommodated in the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Gandhi said, “I am not the Congress president and don’t decide on Rajya Sabha tickets”.

Amid reports that the BJP could now target the Congress government in Rajasthan where Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot shares a frosty relationship with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Mr. Pilot sent a cryptic tweet on Wednesday. “Unfortunate to see @JM_Scindia parting ways with @INCIndia. I wish things could have been resolved collaboratively within the party,” he said in an indication that the ‘collaborative’ effort was missing.

Congress’s Harayana lawmaker Kuldeep Bishno too had tweeted that “the leadership should have done more to convince Mr. Scindia to stay” and asserted that “young leaders who have the capacity to work hard and resonate with the masses need to be empowered”.

“Ask not what your party can do for you, ask what you can do for your party.... It’s a defining moment for all of us in @INCIndia.

187,2020/03/12,COVID-19 vaccine will take at least two years to develop: health officials,"This is an evolving virus and we are still learning about it, say experts.

Senior health officials have said a COVID-19 vaccine will take at least two years to develop even with expedited clinical trials and approvals. The virus has affected 74 people in the country, including 17 foreign nationals (16 Italians and a Canadian).

Raman. R. Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I), Division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said Indian scientists have managed to “successfully isolate the COVID-19 virus. This is needed for making a vaccine. There are two ways of going for vaccine preparation — either you look at the sequences of the gene which then may lead to development of antibodies, or you actually have the strain and then you try to develop a vaccine which is always an easier option,” he said.

Dr. Gangakhedkar said the COVID-19 virus is difficult to isolate.

“But the efforts of Indian scientists have been successful and about 11 isolates are available which is a prime requisite for doing any kind of research related to viruses,” he said.

He cautioned that in certain viruses even if vaccines are given, when the infection tends to occur, there could be a flare-up and the severity of the infection is likely to increase. “This is an evolving virus and we are still learning about it. We would say right now we must try to prevent it as much as possible, contain it and wait for things to happen.’’

Asked if high temperature kills the virus, a senior health officials said there is no study or evidence to suggest that.

At the resounding reception for Jyotiraditya Scindia in Bhopal after he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former foes turned friends. Congressmen rallied behind him, and BJP workers from the Gwalior-Chambal region, his stronghold, flocked together in thousands to catch a glimpse of the “Maharaja” snuggling up to Shivraj Singh Chouhan for the first time.

“Mr. Chouhan is not just someone who dedicated everything to the State as its Chief Minister, but as its worker,” Mr. Scindia declared.

Mr. Scindia, who left the Congress Party after 18 years, said the day was emotional for him for two reasons: “The BJP opened doors for me, and then the organisation where I worked hard [the Congress] — I am leaving that to dedicate myself to you.”

Furthermore, he said there were two kinds of people in the country — those for whom the mission was politics and the medium was public service, and vice versa. “I proudly belong to the second kind that includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and my grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia for whom the mission is public service and the medium is politics,” Mr. Scindia said.

West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday wrote to State Election Commissioner Saurabh Kumar Das urging him “to take pre-emptive and timely call as regards seeking assistance of additional force/s other than police by invoking your authority” for the coming civic polls. Mr. Dhankhar assured him that the “same would receive highest priority and consideration as purity of elections is at the heart of democratic process”.

The Governor had met Mr. Das on February 27 and urged him to take all steps to ensure that there is “no violence and the kind of scenario noticed in the panchayat elections held in May 2018”.

The Governor urged it to “evolve a contingent plan to antidote a potentially disturbing scenario and take timely steps to ensure that unwholesome spectacle of past is not revisited”. He reminded Mr. Das that, “the earlier background in 2013 and 2018 had several worrisome aspects and polls then were marred by violence and democratic fabric was tainted”.

190,2020/03/12,Two doctors suspended for death of young lawyer in Tripura,"The accident victim was unattended to for considerable time in his hospital bed

The Tripura government has placed two medical officers under suspension on charges of improper medical care leading to the death of a young advocate here on Saturday last. The Health department order said Debashish Paul of the Trauma Centre and Ronit Das of the Emergency Unit of the GBP Hospital would remain suspended pending investigation.

Sanjay Mishra, OSD in the Chief Minister’s Office, on Thursday said Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb had instructed the Health department to initiate stern action against those found negligent after advocate Bhaskar Deb Roy was rushed to the hospital. Roy, 30, received injuries in a mysterious motorbike accident outside a school at Dhaleswar locality.

His colleagues and family members alleged utter medical negligence caused his death within a few hours of his admission at the hospital. A large number of lawyers staged protests in front of the police headquarters to press for a proper investigation into the death.

The protests preceded a candle-light vigil in the city.

Chief Minister Deb earlier ordered a magisterial enquiry to be headed by west Tripura district Magistrate Dr. Sandeep Mahatme. He also visited the deceased’s residence and assured the grieving family members of help from the State government.

The Health department also constituted a four-member committee to probe charges of medical negligence as Deb Roy was allegedly left unattended to for considerable time in his hospital bed.

191,2020/03/12,Assam decides tribunal member’s term on rate of declaring foreigners: Amnesty,"Global rights body cites State’s performance appraisal data from affidavit filed in HC

Assam’s government decides the tenure of a Foreigners’ Tribunal (FT) member, a designation similar to a judge in the case of this quasi-judicial body, based on how many foreigners he or she declares, Amnesty International said, basing its assertion on the performance appraisal data submitted by the State in an affidavit filed in court.

However, there appear to be aberrations in some cases to the policy of assessing the performance of a member by the percentage of disposal of cases and the rate of declaring alleged non-citizens as foreigners, as per the government data.

Assam currently has 100 FTs. The State has completed the process of setting up 200 more FTs, specifically to handle the cases of 19.06 lakh people left out of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) that was published on August 31, 2019.

In a report titled ‘Designed to Exclude’, the global human rights organisation had asserted that the Supreme Court and Gauhati High Court had enabled the FTs to create a statelessness crisis in Assam.

In a post on Twitter on Thursday, Aakar Patel, former honorary managing trustee of Amnesty India, asserted that the tribunals were far from fair. “For those who think NRC process is fair. Tribunals declaring people foreigner in Assam are run by employees on 2-year contracts. BJP only extends contracts of those who mark max people foreigner... World should intervene,” he tweeted.

In its report published in September, Amnesty had called for a review of the existing legislative regime governing the determination of nationality in India. “The FTs that determine the paramount right to citizenship in Assam are often dismissive, use derogatory language, control their own procedures and apply them in arbitrary ways,” the rights body had observed.

In an affidavit submitted to the Gauhati HC, the State government had provided a chart on the performance appraisal of newly-elected members as on April 30, 2017, at the end of their two-year tenure.

In the case of the 21 members of FTs based in four Muslim-dominated districts — Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Dhubri and Goalpara — eight, whose foreigner-declaring rate was less than 10% of total cases disposed of, faced a recommendation “may be terminated”. The best among the ‘under-performers’ managed 7.67%.

Retention was recommended for eight members whose performance ranged from 15.7% to 74.9%. The advise for the officials heading the remaining five FTs in these districts was “may be retained with warning”.

But there were aberrations in the case of two judges who declared 26.9% and 41.7% of the cases they handled as foreigners. They were placed in the retention ‘with warning’ category despite outdoing four judges with a “good” rating.

According to Assam’s Home Department, there were initially 11 Illegal Migrant Determination Tribunals (IMDT). These were converted in 2005 to FTs after the apex court scrapped the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983. The State government established another 21 FTs that year. Four more were added in 2009 and the remaining 64 were established in 2014 for expediting the disposal of cases that were piling up in the FTs.

Each FT member is appointed under the Foreigners Tribunal Act, 1941, and Foreigners Tribunal Order, 1984, as per the guidelines issued by the government from time to time. A member can be a retired judicial officer of the Assam Judicial Service, a retired civil servant not below the rank of secretary and additional secretary with judicial experience, or a practising advocate not below the age of 35 years and with at least seven years of practice.

A member is also required to have a fair knowledge of the official languages of Assam (Assamese, Bengali, Bodo and English) as well as be conversant with the historical background to the foreigners’ issue.

The Gauhati HC had on June 10 sought applications for preparing a panel of 221 FT members, saying that the appointment of each member for a year may be extended on a “need basis” subject to their attainment of 67 years.

A retired judge or civil servant appointed as member at an FT is entitled to a pay package similar to what he or she drew at the time of superannuation besides allowances, while the current salary for an advocate who may be selected for the job is ₹85,000 per month plus allowances.

The credibility of the FTs began to be questioned after a member of an FT in central Assam’s Morigaon district observed in August 2017 that foreigners’ cases had assumed the form of “an industry as each and every person involved” with such cases “trying to mint money by any means”.

The Morigaon FT also noted that the “unfair practices involved turn Indians into foreigners and foreigners into Indians on the basis of fake or duplicate documents”. Later, the All Assam Minority Students’ Union asserted that the Assam Police Border Organisation (APBO) and FTs were “foreigner-making factories” and alleged that “officials have orders to harass the religious and linguistic minorities”.

The APBO is a wing of the State police tasked with detecting foreigners. Officials of this wing feed the cases to the FTs for deciding who is a foreigner and who is not. The government allegedly gives the border police a monthly target for detecting people of suspect citizenship and the cases of such people are referred to the FTs.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-decides-tribunal-members-term-on-rate-of-declaring-foreigners-amnesty/article31051919.ece

193,2020/03/12,Assam: BJP to contest against ally in Bodoland council polls,"Bodoland People’s Front is facing anti-incumbency.

The BJP, believed to be torn between ally Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and its rival United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), has decided to go it alone in the upcoming Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) elections.

The elections to the 40-seat council are scheduled on April 4.

The BPF has three Ministers in the BJP-led Sarbananda Sonowal government in Assam. The BPF, led by Hagrama Mohilary, has also been ruling the BTC since 2003.

While the BPF is facing anti-incumbency, the UPPL is seen to have emerged as a strong alternative after the joining of Pramod Boro, former president of the influential All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU). Mr. Boro was a signatory to the Peace Accord signed in January among the Centre, the Assam government and four factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland.

“We have decided to contest the BTC polls on our own and not have a pre-poll alliance with BPF,” a senior BJP leader said. He said the decision followed a meeting between State BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass and party leaders of four districts under BTC on Wednesday.

Mr. Mohilary had a few days ago trashed speculation that his party and the BJP were drifting apart. He said the BPF would contest the council polls in alliance with the BJP and the Asom Gana Parishad, the third partner in the coalition government in Assam.

By Thursday, the BPF announced the names of 18 candidates and indicated it would field candidates for the remaining seats too.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xk67fy/article29262215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27NEWS1RANJEETWA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-bjp-to-contest-against-ally-in-bodoland-council-polls/article31051105.ece

A conglomerate of 15 major churches of Mizoram has asked its constituents to seek divine intervention to contain the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a church leader said on Thursday.

Member churches of the Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee were asked to seek God’s intervention so that the State remains safe from novel coronavirus attack and the global pandemic is contained, MKHC general secretary Rev Lalrinsanga said.

The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic, saying it has affected more than 1,18,000 people and claimed 4,290 lives worldwide.

“All the member churches across the State will hold congregational prayer during church services either on Saturday or Sunday night as per their convenience,” Lalrinsanga told the PTI.

“We have appealed to the people to follow and obey the dos and don’ts set by the government in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” the church leader said.

The church leader also said that the committee held a meeting in Aizawl on Wednesday during which it expressed concern about alleged hoarding of essential commodities.

“The church committee appeals to the people not to hoard commodities and hike prices at the time of global crisis,” he said.

To allay fears of people, officials of State Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department said there was enough stock of rice, cooking gas and oil to last for three months.

The State government has formally sealed State borders with neighbouring countries and States on Wednesday.

The Special Task Force of the Odisha police has seized 1.749 kg brown sugar on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar, biggest ever in its history.

Following a tip off about a transaction on Wednesday, the STF conducted a raid in the tri-junction area of Pipli, Jatni and Airfield police station and arrested three persons.

“The police have achieved a major success in its war against brown sugar trade. This is the biggest-ever seizure in the State,” said DGP Abhay here on Thursday.

The STF has so far has seized 4.027 kg brown sugar in 2020. The significance of the achievement can be gauged from the fact that in 2019, all other agencies of the Odisha police seized 2.56 kg.

The cumulative seizure in 2018 was 635 gm, 1.782 kg in 2017 and 541 gm in 2016.

“The consumption of brown sugar is steadily rising due to growing urbanisation. One gram consists of 10-15 small packets. Each packet is charged ₹300 to ₹400 in the local market. Major suppliers operate from Balasore district, considered as gateway of drug trafficking,” said Jai Narayan Pankaj, STF DIG.

The drug use in Odisha is, however, low compared to some other States. During the past three to four months, the STF has tightened the noose around drug-peddlers by strengthening its intelligence network. Based on inputs, raids are conducted immediately.

The STF personnel suspect the contraband is originating from Lalgola area in Murshidabad district of West Bengal and consignments are coming to Odisha through Balasore district which shares border with West Bengal. The State police also believe that drug supply from Murshidabad is also making its way to Jharkhand.

Authorities in Pune have warned that any person revealing names of individuals who tested positive for the COVID-19 over social media will face legal action.

Taking note of a complaint from a relative of a Pune-based patient, who tested positive for COVID-19, Pune Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said that the police authorities had been directed to monitor social media posts and take appropriate action in such cases.

Remarking that the afflicted persons and their kin could be subjected to social boycott if their names were revealed on social media and other platforms, Dr. Mhaisekar strongly exhorted people not to name any person.

“If the identity of a patient is revealed, that person and his family could needlessly be subjected to trauma in form of social boycott. There is a pressing need to be more sensitive. However, despite the fact that we have been issuing such appeals right from day one of the crisis, some people are spreading wrong and misleading information on social media,” he said, stating that the district administration had received such a complaint.

Dr. Mhaisekar said the cyber cell of the Pune police was closely monitoring rumour mongers as well as those revealing the identity of patients to curb the spread of such potentially damaging information.

A relative of one of the patients on Wednesday had written to the Divisional Commissioner, complaining that information about the infected person was allegedly revealed on social media which in turn led the person’s family to face unwarranted mental hardship. The complainant has also sought action against those who revealed the identity of the afflicted person on social media.

“As a result of such irresponsible actions, the family is facing a social boycott-like situation,” Dr. Mhaisekar said.

Till date, Maharashtra has recorded 11 positive COVID-19 cases which Pune recording the maximum number of eight cases, followed by two in Mumbai and one in Nagpur.

Earlier on Monday, a Pune couple, who were part of a 40-member tour group which recently travelled to Dubai, were the first in the State to test positive for the virus. Following that, the couple’s daughter, along with another co-passenger from Yavatmal, as well as the cab driver who ferried the couple from Mumbai airport to Pune on their return from Dubai on March 1, had tested positive.

201,2020/03/12,Cong. seeks disqualification of six Madhya Pradesh Ministers loyal to Scindia for anti-party activities,"In petition to Assembly Speaker, two Congress MLAs contend the rebels were hobnobbing with the BJP to bring down government, orchestrating defections

Two Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh have moved a petition before the Vidhan Sabha Speaker seeking disqualification of six rebel Ministers, supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia who moved to Bengaluru, for anti-party activities. Speaker N.P. Prajapati is yet to take a decision.

The petitioners, Govind Singh and Lakhan Singh Yadav, contended that the “grotesque conduct” of the Ministers in cahoots with the BJP to devise defections from within the State Congress legislature party was a “breach and abandonment” of the party discipline.

They requested the Speaker to disqualify Pradhuman Singh Tomar, Imarti Devi, Mahendra Singh Sisodiya, Govind Singh Rajput, Prabhuram Choudhary and Tulsiram Silawat for violating the the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, whose paragraph 2(1)(a) prescribes disqualification from the House if a member voluntarily gives up membership of a political party.

Flying away to Bengaluru during political distress in the State, remaining in constant touch with BJP members there, refusing to comply with a notice served on them by State party chief to return to Bhopal in the light of the upcoming Rajya Sabha election and blocking means of communication by keeping phones switched off, all showed they had voluntarily given up the party membership, the petitioners claimed.

State Congress media incharge Shobha Oza said, “Their disqualification is imminent, given their praise for Mr. Scindia, who joined the BJP, openly in videos released from Bengaluru. They have ignored party instructions.”

‘Political opportunism’

Stating that political propriety and morality was expected of the Ministers as they had won the election on Congress ticket, the petitioners claimed they had associated themselves with the BJP for “sheer personal gains” and “political opportunism” and orchestrated defections within the Congress in a bid to bring down the coalition government.

The petitioners further contended the respondents had been in Karnataka for two days, and been meeting BJP MLAs and MPs, and at the BJP’s insistence they stayed back at the hotel in Bengaluru.

204,2020/03/12,Rains may delay mass nesting of Olive Ridley turtles at Rushikulya rookery,"Wet and packed sand does not offer a conducive coast for nesting, but sunshine may improve matters in a few days

Rains over the past week are expected to delay mass nesting of Olive Ridley turtles at Odisha’s Rushikulya rookery coast this year.

Thousands of mother Olive Ridleys are now at sea near this coast, which is a major mass nesting site of the marine turtles in India. They are sporadically nesting in single numbers almost every night. According to forest officials, about a week ago, around 25 Olive Ridley turtles had come out to lay eggs, which suggested that mass nesting may have commenced in a few days.

Major obstacle

But the drizzling over the past one week, as well as a heavy shower three days ago, has reduced the conduciveness of the beach near Rushikulya rookery for mass nesting. “Rains packed up the loose sand of the beach, which is a major obstacle for mass nesting of Olive Ridleys,” said Dilip Kumar Martha, Khallikote Range Officer of the the Forest Department, who is monitoring the arrangements for the mass nesting. In the past, similar rains had delayed mass nesting at this coast.

According to Mr. Martha, on Wednesday, sand at this coast was still wet at depth of six to eight inches. Tightly packed wet sand makes it hard for mother turtles to dig it up to lay eggs.

Southward wind

Rains had also halted the southward wind that coincides with mass nesting. This southward wind starts after the end of winter, and is quite dry and warm. It reduces moisture in the sand and atmosphere, and increases the temperature of the sea and air near the coast, which in turn dries and loosens the sand at the nesting beach. “With the southward wind, some changes also occur in the sea, which alters its colour near the Rushikulya rookery,” said Mr. Martha.

According Bivash Pandav, Scientist, Wildlife Institute of India, who has been involved in studying Olive Ridleys for two decades, the turtles also wait for this wind as it diminishes the trail of smell from their bodies and eggs, which can attract predators.

The rains have stopped now and sun is out fully. The southward wind is expected to revive soon. A few sunny days accompanied by the southward wind will again make the coast conducive for mass nesting, said Mr. Pandav.

April nesting

Past records indicate mass nesting has at times occurred in April at the Rushikulya rookery, said Mr. Pandav.

But no one knows what the mother Olive Ridleys have in mind. In 2019, despite a large congregation of Olive Ridleys at sea, mass nesting did not occur at the Rishikulya rookery coast. But in 2018, double mass nesting occurred at this coast in February and April, with the total nesting figures rising over 4,73,000.

The Forest Department has made arrangements for the security of Olive Ridleys during their mass nesting, as well as the protection of the eggs till they hatch.

Arrangements made

A 5 km-long metal net fence has been erected from Gokharkuda to Bateswar, the most preferred mass nesting location, and it’s being regularly cleaned. The sea near the Rushikulya rookery is being patrolled with the help of two trawlers, two speed boats and a country boat to stop the entry of trawlers that can kill Olive Ridleys in the sea. The Forest Department has set up 11 on-shore camps at the mass nesting beach.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rains-may-delay-mass-nesting-of-olive-ridley-turtles-at-rushikulya-rookery/article31045001.ece

“That’s why the God took revenge against them,” Mr. Ghosh reportedly said.

In a statement released on Wednesday, the Consulate office noted that the comment is “erroneous.”

“We strongly condemn this ridiculous and irresponsible statement that is totally contrary to basic common sense,” the statement said.

“People in all countries are victims of COVID-19, and it is still unclear where the virus is originated. According to Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent scientist who is leading a government-appointed panel of experts to help control the coronavirus outbreak, even though the epidemic was first reported in China, it didn't necessarily originate there. At present, people from all over the world are working together to fight COVID-19 and the World Health Organization has repeatedly stated that stigma is more dangerous than the disease itself. At this critical moment, such irresponsible remarks to create gimmicks is really a despicable practice…”, the statement noted.

The statement updated about the latest position in the country and noted that on “March 10 alone, 1578 new cases were cured in mainland China.”

“Until March 10, a total of 61475 patients have been discharged from hospital after recovery...” the statement noted.

206,2020/03/12,"Pawar files RS nomination, Congress may be unhappy with 2 seats to NCP","Second candidate, Fauzia Khan, asked to wait another day before filing her nomination; decision from Delhi, says Minister

The second candidate from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for the Rajya Sabha, Fauzia Khan, was asked at the last minute to wait yet another day to file her nomination, raising suspicion over whether the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has developed differences over giving two seats to the NCP.

On Wednesday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar filed his nomination for the Rajya Sabha and Ms. Khan was to be the party’s second candidate. Sources said the Congress is not too happy with giving two seats to the NCP and as a result, the decision is kept pending till Thursday.

Mr. Pawar, however, denied any differences. “The coordination committee of the three parties will meet tomorrow and finalise the name of the candidate. After that, she will file her nomination,” he said.

Of the seven RS members retiring from Maharashtra, three seats will go to the Bharatiya Janata Party and four to the MVA. Of the four, the tenure of two NCP MPs, Mr. Pawar and Majid Memon and that of Husain Dalwai from the Congress and Rajkumar Dhoot of the Shiv Sena, is ending. The NCP is staking claim to two seats.

207,2020/03/12,"Tour operators stare at cancellations, massive losses","Companies say 90% customers scrapping foreign trip bookings

Tour operators in Pune and western Maharashtra are fearing losses of a whopping ₹150 crore with tourists scrambling to cancel their proposed foreign travel in summer against the backdrop of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Speaking to reporters here, representatives of tours and travels companies said a staggering 90% of the tourists in Pune who had booked trips with them for the summer season had either cancelled or were considering scrapping their bookings.

They urged tourists that instead of panicking it would be beneficial to carefully study and follow the health and travel advisory issued by the Central government.

“More than 30,000 tourists from the district embark on foreign tours or domestic travel during the summer months. As foreign bookings, including air tickets and hotels, are done well in advance, it is not always possible to refund the costs to tourists who are bent upon cancelling their trips in the wake of the novel coronavirus eruption,” said Santosh Khawale of the Enterprising Travel Agents Association.

He urged tourists to remain calm and plan for domestic travel if they feared going on foreign tours.

Other representatives spoke of “unpleasant incidents” at tour offices, with anxious passengers demanding refunds of their foreign tour bookings.

They urged tourists to be patient and reach a decision after carefully taking stock of the situation.

‘Postpone AMC polls’

Meanwhile, the virus stamped its imprint on local politics as well, with leaders from the Shiv Sena and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen urging that the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) elections due in April be postponed.

“In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, we will present our demand to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that the AMC polls be pushed forward by six months,” said Shiv Sena leader and Aurangabad Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele.

Meanwhile, to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the city, the Aurangabad police have denied permission to political parties, including the Sena and the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, to hold rallies on occasion of Shivjayanti on Thursday.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fmt249/article31044768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMPUNEPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tour-operators-stare-at-cancellations-massive-losses/article31044769.ece
208,2020/03/12,"Maharashtra curbs on public meetings, conferences","More testing facilities, isolation wards on the way, says health minister; CM speaks to Centre

The State government has cancelled all public gatherings, including political meetings, and conferences to curtail the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). All civic commissioners have been asked to refuse permission for any public gathering under their jurisdiction.

In a late night press conference on Wednesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the ongoing Budget session, scheduled till March 20, could end by Saturday. “This is not because of any scare, but it is important that officials and elected representatives be in their respective areas and constituencies to monitor arrangements. There is no need to panic but we need to take precautions,” said Mr. Thackeray. He said the infection has no origin within the State.

Only tourists who have come from abroad have been found affected.

Reiterating that the Budget session would be cut short only after sanction from both Houses on Thursday, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said the move is not to create panic but to make officials available in their respective departments.

Mr. Thackeray said of the 10 positive cases in the State, eight are in Pune and two in Mumbai. “However, they are not serious. Precautionary measures have been taken. We have tracked everyone with whom these patients came in contact with,” he said. He appealed to tourists coming from abroad to remain secluded for 14 days from arrival.

Asked about the IPL T20 tournament, Mr. Thackeray said the government has unofficially received word from the organisers that matches can be organised without selling tickets, and only broadcast on TV. “However there is no official proposal yet. But, we will do whatever is necessary to curb spread of coronavirus.”

Legends tournament hit

Meanwhile, four league games of the Road Safety World Series T20 matches, featuring cricket’s greats and ex-internationals from five countries, at Pune’s MCA stadium have been called off. Two matches to be played at DY Patil stadium in Navi Mumbai, may move behind closed doors.

Earlier, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the Cabinet discussed the issue and three special meetings were held through the day with all stakeholders, departments and even private players.

“The Cabinet discussed two scenarios — postponing the tournament entirely, or asking BCCI to not sell tickets but only broadcast the matches,” said Mr. Tope.

The government is also planning to create an isolation ward and set up testing laboratories in private hospitals, he said.

Representatives from Jaslok, Leelavati, Nanavati and Hinduja hospitals were called for a special meeting at Vidhan Bhavan after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Mr. Thackeray directed that Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must be followed by all establishments.

“The State government has decided to work on couple of fronts including setting up of some isolation wards in private hospitals in Mumbai, establishing private testing facilities at Mumbai-based hospitals and seeking accreditation for it from the Centre, improving screening facility at international airports, especially at Mumbai, and training doctors and nurses about SOPs to avoid patients getting any other infection,” said Mr. Tope.

“Setting up a testing facility is crucial to reduce the burden on Pune-based NIV. The State is planning to approach the Centre for allowing accreditation for carrying out COVID-19 infection determination tests,” he said. Mr. Thackeray said he had also spoken to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on the matter.

The ongoing screening facilities at international airports need to be modernised. The private hospital staff will also be trained on handling guidelines for COVID-19 infections and treatment of the patients, he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jtvh8y/article31044752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMSTATIONMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-curbs-on-public-meetings-conferences/article31044753.ece
209,2020/03/12,3 more test positive in Pune; five previous patients stable,"Some schools close for the week amid parents’ concerns

Three more people, who were part of a 40-member tour group to Dubai, have tested positive for COVID-19, divisional authorities said on Wednesday, taking the tally of positive cases in Pune district to eight.

“They were part of the same group that included the couple from Pune who were the first to test positive for COVID-19. We have sent a few more samples for testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) whose results are expected soon,” Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar.

He said the condition of the five people from Pune who had earlier tested positive was stable and they were responding well to treatment at Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital. On Tuesday, the daughter of the couple, their co-passenger from Yavatmal, and the Ola cab driver who ferried the couple from Mumbai airport to Pune on their return from Dubai on March 1, had tested positive.

Earlier, a woman from Pimpri-Chinchwad, who returned from Dubai on February 27, showed COVID-19-like symptoms and was referred to Naidu hospital. However, she tested negative on Wednesday afternoon. The results of the other quarantined patients are awaited, medical authorities said.

Eight people from Kolhapur district with a history of foreign travel, including two who were studying in Italy, have also tested negative for the infection. Two among them, who are residents of Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur, had returned from Dubai a week ago and had voluntary checked themselves into the district’s CPR Hospital.

Travel warning

Dr. Mhaisekar said, “District administrations have been conducting extensive awareness campaigns on novel coronavirus by putting up posters at public places including bus stations, schools and railway stations. There is an adequate stock of protective gear, including masks, to deal with the spread of the virus. We urge residents not to undertake travel unless absolutely necessary.”

The Pune district administration on Tuesday had imposed the Disaster Management Act to combat the virus.

Meanwhile, some schools in the city have decided to remain closed till Sunday as a precautionary measure. Nanded City School and Pawar Public School in Nanded City Township, and DSK School in Dhayari took the decision after worried parents insisted schools remain shut.

While directing schools and colleges across the district to take precautionary measures, Pune District Collector Naval Kishor Ram said no order has been issued so far to shut educational establishments.

Likewise, authorities at the Savitribai Phule Pune University refuted social media rumours that the university would remain closed between March 20 and 30, and warned of legal action against anyone spreading fake news.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ox2xtq/article31044728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMPUNESCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3-more-test-positive-in-pune-five-previous-patients-stable/article31044730.ece
210,2020/03/12,COVID-19: Maharashtra tally goes up to 11,"Three more cases reported in Pune, two in Mumbai, one in Nagpur

With six more people testing positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the number of cases in Maharashtra went up to 11 on Wednesday. Five people — including a senior couple aged 70 and 68 from Mumbai, and three from Pune district — were part of a 40-member group who travelled to Dubai, along with the Pune couple who were the first positive patients in the State. The sixth person is from Nagpur, with a travel history to the U.S.

Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said, “We have sent a few more samples for testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) whose results are expected soon.”

In Mumbai, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said six people from the group were isolated in Kasturba Hospital. “While four tested negative, two tested positive. Since the tests were carried out at the in house laboratory at Kasturba, the samples have been sent to National Institute of Virology for re-confirmation,” he said, and added, “both are on symptomatic treatment but we have kept ventilators ready in case they develop any respiratory distress.”

The group of 40 had returned to India on March 1. Civic officials are in the process of tracing contacts of the elderly couple to contain the spread of the virus. State health officials said that contact tracing was started aggressively as soon as the Pune couple tested positive. After landing in Mumbai, the group had dispersed to their residences in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Yavatmal, Ahmednagar, Beed and Nagpur.

Mr. Kakani said four others from the group who tested negative were discharged on Wednesday evening.

211,2020/03/12,"IT firms in Pune evacuate offices, urge staff to work from home","Employee of a Hinjewadi-based company undergoes test for novel coronavirus infection, another of a Magarpatta City firm quarantined following visit to Dubai

With five people testing positive for COVID-19 in Pune, two companies located in the city’s biggest IT hubs in Hinjewadi and Magarpatta evacuated and sealed some of their offices on Wednesday after a couple of their employees exhibited symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection.

The third floor office in a building (Tower A) of a multinational firm in Phase 1of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park in Hinjewadi was sealed after an employee showed COVID-19-like symptoms. A portion of Tower 7 in Magarpatta’s IT Park was evacuated and sealed after an employee with an IT firm with a travel history to Dubai showed similar symptoms.

A message sent by the Hinjewadi-based company to employees, said: “Because your safety and well-being remain our top priority, we want to share an important update relating to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. We have learned that one of our people who works on the third floor in Tower A has been tested for coronavirus and is awaiting those test results. We also want to make you aware that out of an abundance of caution, the third floor in Tower A will be extensively cleaned in a process that is based on cleaning recommendations from public health experts.”

It further said that the third floor would only reopen once the cleaning process was complete and that “common areas in Tower A will also be cleaned.”

Confirming the partial evacuation of Tower 7 in Magarpatta, Satish Magar, chairman and managing director of Magarpatta City, said the move was a precautionary measure given that the employee in question had returned from Dubai.

In a message to all the employees, the company said: “The employee has been quarantined and being provided medical [attention]. As a precautionary step, the office [in] Magarpatta City will remain closed. No employee should visit it. There will be deep cleaning there and we are in contact with concerned authorities to know if more employees need to undergo tests.” Mr. Magar said he has called a meeting with authorities from Noble Hospital to check if all precautions have been taken.

212,2020/03/12,Rukmini Vijayakumar tells how to care for your body as a dancer,"Rukmini Vijayakumar feels dancers should prepare themselves physically to take on the rigours of training and performance

Agreed there is no substitute to watching the performing arts, especially dance, live. The feel of the space, moves and expressions can be overwhelming. But we are talking about dance in the time of Instagram. Though this social media platform’s negative ramifications on art have been much discussed (writer Theresa Ruth Howard’s Dance Magazine piece raised the question: ‘Is Instagram Changing the Dance World’s Value System’?), there are artistes who have turned the app to their advantage. They have used their accounts to establish a creative interface — sharing their thoughts and experiences and posting videos explaining the nuances of dance compositions.

Bengaluru-based Bharatanatyam dancer and actor Rukmini Vijayakumar’s Instagram account could actually motivate one to watch her live. A combination of several elements, it shows how to make dance work in the digital format. The choice of costume (the traditional dance dress gets a contemporary tweak) and location (the corridors of ancient temples transform into stages) and her lithe body, fluid moves, charming face and perfect camera angles make her Insta feeds as aesthetic as her performances.

“With artistes, learners and enthusiasts sharing the platform, it makes art more accessible, and the approach, uninhibited. It’s heartwarming to see the posts garnering thousands of likes and views. And among my account’s followers are also those who might be watching classical dance for the first time,” says Rukmini, whose Raadha Kalpa Dance Company conducts both personal and online courses.

Besides her training in Bharatanatyam that began at age eight, she studied ballet and modern dance at the Boston Conservatory. Her understanding of the body also comes from her study of anatomy and physiology and practise of yoga.

“Like Graham said, ‘Dance is the song of the body. Either of joy or pain.’ And dancers have to ensure it is the song of joy. Hence they have to develop a special relationship with the body. Listen to it and tend to it,” says Rukmini on why the training at her company focusses on using the body efficiently as a unit.

She sees dancers as artistic athletes for whom conditioning, strengthening and fitness training are important for preventing injury, enhancing performance and increasing longevity of the technique. Modern-day choreography, she feels, expects dancers to have an unfettered outlook and prepare the body and the mind to engage with diverse styles.

“They should be made part of the training. My pedagogy is based on neutrality. A neutral mind allows artistes to lay bare any emotion while a neutral body lets them get into any character. For instance, I could be the sprightly Hanuman in one scene and a coy nayika in another. This is how you explore the full potential of the vocabulary, which includes a wide range of movements and expressions fraught with meaning.”

Rukmini, who has starred in a few Tamil and Kannada films, doesn’t think being 20 days on a film set can take away her 20 years training in Bharatanatyam. “Once the foundation is laid strong, nothing can uproot you. I don’t see anything wrong in doing films while being a dancer. As long as you are able to keep the two separate, without one influencing the other, it’s fine. But you need maturity and expertise to do that. I will definitely not advise a young learner to dabble simultaneously in two forms. When you are being initiated into an art, focus entirely on it. This is what I tell students at my company.”

With her exposure in Western performing arts, is she ever tempted to reinterpret the traditional repertoire for a broader reach? For instance, does she feel the nayaka-nayika portrayals are getting tedious and that dancers should come up with refreshing and relatable themes? “Nayaka-nayika compositions do not depict just the man-woman relationship and worldly love; they are deeper and intense. They are about the atma-paratma link — the search for divinity within oneself,” says Rukmini, pointing out how every time she dances her favourite ashtapadi, ‘Yahi Madhava’, she discovers newer facets in the lyrics.

In one of her recent videos on Instagram, you find Rukmini performing an extract of this Ashtapadi at the Darasuram temple. She beautifully depicts an upset Radha, who is hurt at Krishna’s indiscretions and says, ‘Your heart is darker than your body. How did you think of deceiving me, the one who has surrendered to you?’

Probing the narrative in these songs is an extremely fulfilling and exciting exercise, says Rukmini. “At the end of it, you realise the huge scope for interpretation. We may talk about contemporising the form, but I feel its essence and distinct appeal lie in these traditional works.”

Like most artistes, Rukmini too believes... ‘I dance, therefore I am’. Though she likes to remain cocooned in her own world, especially when choreographing new works, she acknowledges how much her parents have been an integral part of her journey. “Can you imagine, after finishing school they never raised the topic of my going to college. Instead, wanted me to focus on dance. Marriage hasn’t come in the way of my passion either. It is not only about having a spouse who is supportive, it is more about not being demanding and intrusive. Over the years, I have realised that among the many struggles of artistes is the challenge to master their lives as well as their art,” says Rukmini.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/xsq2e1/article31049225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13frraadha2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/rukmini-vijayakumar-tells-how-to-care-of-the-body-as-a-dancer/article31049228.ece
213,2020/03/12,Dialogue on the future of dance forms,"Conversations veered around preserving traditional art forms

Held at two of Chennai’s most aesthetic spaces, Kalakshetra Foundation and DaksinaChitra Heritage Museum, ‘Utsavam 2020’ served as a platform to discuss the evolution of traditional arts along with a series of performances.

This fifth edition of DakshinaChitra's annual music and dance festival was held, from March 6-8.

Discussing the future of Villupattu and Harikatha, Bharathi Thirumagan and Vishaka Hari highlighted the scope of social media platforms as performance spaces. This also meant that the artistes have to work on newer content, to avoid repetition. However, one must know the difference in the impact between number of views online and a regular live audience.

In another session, Hanne M. de Bruin (founder Kattaikkuttu Sangam and Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam) pointed out that traditional styles are facing a dwindling number of teachers, who could pass them on. . An interesting point Thirumagan made was that each individual interprets the art form in his/her own way, which is the first step towards sustaining the art. Both Bharathi Thirumagan and Vishaka Hari held an optimistic view regarding the future of their forms.

Need to innovate

Conversations on the future also brought up the necessity for innovation and reorienting perspectives. Anita Ratnam and Gita Wolf (Tara Books) threw light on their initiatives to break homogeneity and bring a sense of variety to art and books. “We have a very romantic idea of tradition as something in the past. It is crucial to innovate and experiment with formats of consumption and presentation,” expressed Wolf. Learning multiple art forms also serves as an initial scaffolding, different vocabularies upon which improvisation can be applied.

When innovation and tradition meet, community empowerment and artistic identity emerge. Black Boys, a dynamic 19 member Gaana singers and Tamil rappers from North Madras created an impact. With poignant songs such as ‘Do something, edhachum pannu’ and ‘Vyasarpadi, nanga anba vandu anaipom,’ this group creates music based on their experiences to voice thought-provoking social messages.

The young storytellers presented The Magic Horse aka Maayakkutirai, performed and directed by Kattaikkuttu artistes of Kattaikuttu Sangam from Kanchipuram. A noteworthy segment of this performance was the artistic identity borne by young performers.

The importance of adapting to one's environment comes with practice and experience. How does one future-proof the voice in light of this? Dr. Prakash Boominathan elaborated on the uniqueness of the singing voice and vocal health.

In an engaging and informative session, he discussed developing a fitness and health regimen that has the capacity to adapt and perceive changing biological, emotional and social needs of a person in his/her chosen vocation. He stressed upon hydration, ample sleep, diet, physical and mental fitness and sensitivity to overcome general and vocal fatigue.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/dialogue-on-the-future-of-dance-reforms/article31049159.ece
214,2020/03/12,Shambhauvi Shukla is staying true to tradition,"Shambhauvi Shukla presented a rare repertoire piece “Talvar ki Gat” which reflected the elements of the Jaipur style of Kathak

Kathak is the dance of vigour and much rigour. Add on to that the valour of Jaipur style and one comes across a very physically demanding and potent mixture. Sailing through et al, one witnessed Shambhauvi Shukla pirouetting her way through with little effort. The event at New Delhi’s Triveni Kala Sangam was organised by Nateshwar Kala Mandir on the occasion of Pt. Tirath Ram Azad’s 86th birth anniversary.

Dr. Shambhauvi Shukla has received training from Pt Prem Narayan of the Banaras Gharana and the doyen of Jaipur style of Kathak Pt. Rajendra Gangani and encompasses a certain rustic feel to her dance with all the elements of her Gharana vividly represented. On this particular evening, she commenced her recital with “Vedsar Shiv Stavah”, a Sanskrit text, written by Adi Shankracharya as an ode to the supreme deity Lord Shiva.

Essentially presented as an invocatory piece, the dancer rendered it as a stuti to Lord Shiva who is the adi-anant of this universe. Clad in tiger skin, smeared with ash, the husband of Goddess Parvati is addressed as the Mahadeva. The text goes on to describe him as the one who takes away the obstacles of all including Gods. He is the one from whom the world begins and into who even the vacuum collapses. Composed beautifully by U.P. SNA awardee Pt. Surendra Mohan Mishra of Banaras Gharana, the dance choreography was by the exponent herself.

Proceeding, Shambhauvi took the audience through the much treaded path of the traditional Kathak format replete with That, Uthan, Paran, Tore, Tukre and Tatkar, exploring myriad laya patterns while tracing and discovering the interrelationship between raas and Kathak. Laden with intricately nuanced traditional bandishes of the Jaipur Gharana, she presented another self- composed piece Panchamriti Tihai consisting of all the five jatis, making the piece special as one hardly gets to see jatis explored in the current gamut of Kathak presentations.

Adding on to the delight of the rasikas, the danseuse presented a rare traditional repertoire piece Talvar ki Gat which dripped of the valour and graceful anga, Jaipuri Kathak is famous for. The swift pirouettes and equally deft tatkar patterns by the dancer added on to the charm of the piece.

As a concluding piece to her well-rendered repertoire, Shambhauvi chose to delve into the Bhav Paksh or the abhinaya segment with a Surdas bhajan in raga Gavti. Composed by Brijesh Mishra, it carried with it a signature style of the Banarasi anga, both in terms of music and dance. With this fell curtains on yet another applause-worthy recital in the Capital.

215,2020/03/12,"Of copyright, choreography and the way forward","Domain experts deal with the topics at Dakshina Chitra’s Utsavam festival

Deliberations on Day Two of Dakshinachitra’s Utsavam 2020 covered topics spread over three sessions. There was an interesting divergence in perception between the panellists on ‘Sustainable Futures in Dance and Dance Theatre;’ while for Revathi Ramachandran it meant the challenge of sustaining the spirit and aesthetics of Kalakshetra's founder Rukmini Devi despite its institutionalisation, for Hanne De Bruin of Kattaikkuttu Sangam, Kanchipuram, it was a question of visibility outside rural India, accessibility to training and to audiences, lifting the stigma attached to the dance-theatre form as belonging to the lower castes, the recognition of its literary value, and the bread and butter question of economic sustainability, amongst others. The issue of educating sponsors so that they are better informed to evaluate proposals was also discussed. Sangeeta Isvaran, a Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar awardee, who uses art for community development, spoke from an autobiographical angle to the Kalakshetra students about the need for curiosity, inclusivity or community, communication, compassion and change. The session was anchored by Devina Dutt.

The session on ‘Art and Law’ with Prabha Sridevan, former Judge, and senior Intellectual Property lawyer M.S. Bharath explained the laws protecting an artiste’s right not to be copied. The fundamental clause being, ‘The person who creates it, owns it,’ they advised registration of the copyright. There is a moral right, right to be recognised as owner, and an economic right, a right to royalty or a right to sell. Copyright laws can protect your work for your lifetime and for 60 years after. If it is a joint production, each owns their individual contribution; the period of copyright will be 60 years from the date of release. As per the Berne Convention, if it is uploaded on the net, it is protected for the same period without registration. But for uploading, permission needs to be sought from artistes, else it will be a criminal offence. And in the case of a violation, the onus to enforce his rights rests on the owner of the copyright. The case of Lalgudi G. Jayaraman and Others vs Cleveland Cultural Alliance was cited as an example of the Copyright Act that protects the creator.

Creative journeys

The third session on ‘Shaping the Future — Emerging Dance Choreography’ presented by Thilagavathi Palani (Kattaikoothu), Veena Basavarajaiah (contemporary dance theatre) and Masoom Pamar (Bharatanatyam), featured their creative journeys. Thilagavathi, the first female Kattaikkoothu dance-theatre artiste spoke about how she reframes performances to fit into tight urban schedules, promotes the concept of co-ordinated group dances and adds relevant social messages within presentations. Masoom’s journey on the other hand was autobiographical — how he had to own up his identity, of Islam-Zoroastrian descent performing an essentially Hindu temple dance, Bharatanatyam. He spoke of his production ‘Aaj ke Naam’ in which he re-created the Tisra Alarippu with symbolism from Islam, layering the presentation of traditional sollus with the namaz, after synchronising the tisra sollus and chatusra namaz. He found similarities in the three levels of Alarippu — sama pada, araimandi and muzhumandi with levels of standing straight, bending forward and kneeling during prayer. An audio-visual excerpt was presented to enhance his points.

Veena’s artistic journey began with Bharatanatyam but she found the tradition binding and could not deal with the ‘baggage in its history’; she moved on to train in contemporary movement art, Kalari, ballet, and worked with Jayachandran Palazhy's Attakkalari, Bangalore, and Shobana Jeyasingh, London. She presented some of her research work on re-creating the Indian sculptures exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum as she ‘asked questions about Indian culture from a distance.’ She did her Master’s in South Asian Studies under Avanti Meduri and subsequently moved into dance theatre with non-dancers. This meant she had to throw “fifteen years of training out of the window.”

The panel urged young dancers to expose themselves and to experiment without fear of failure and to break the rule only on a ‘need to’ basis. The illuminating discussion was moderated by Utsavam 2020 curator Shreya Nagarajan Singh.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/939u14/article31048975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13frSustainablefuturesindanceanddancetheatreJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/of-copyright-choreography-and-the-way-forward/article31048976.ece
216,2020/03/12,Sattriya: Past forward,"The Pragjyoti International Dance Festival screened rare footage of Sattriya dance that opens pathways to the past and also calls for a more careful transition of the form in the future

The audience sat in devoted silence, as images from a bygone era appeared on the screen. While one could see the energetic dance movements of the figures on film, with fleeting shots of percussion instruments, one had to devise the rhythm in one’s mind. When someone eagerly requested to playback the film from the beginning with sound, they were quietly informed that the original version was silent. Piecing together the precious puzzle of the history of Sattriya dance, this was one of the earliest documentations of the form, presented to the public for the first time, at the Pragjyoti International Dance Festival, Guwahati.

Down memory lane

A still from the 1956 footage of Sattriya featuring Guru Maniram Dutta Muktiyar

Just like many masters in the film, the earliest Kamalabari Sattra, a monastery in the island town of Assam – Majuli, had faded from the world. Displaced due to soil erosion, the sattra is one of the oldest, and known for being the home ground of Sattriya ritual dance. The film features some known, and many unknown faces, primarily from this particular sattra. In quick cuts, the camera follows them going about their daily rituals, and demonstrating some key stances and sequences from the traditional Sattriya repertoire. Shared with the public through the efforts of dance scholars — Arshiya Sethi and Sunil Kothari, the documentation dates back to 1956.

The film has no subtitles, sound or title. The people behind the camera also remain anonymous and curiously hidden. Yet, recognising some of the older master-monks of the 1950s, present-day stalwarts of Sattriya broke into tears of nostalgia and memories. For Bayanacharya Ghanakanta Bora, it was an emotional trip down the memory lane. He can be spotted fleetingly in the film as a young boy performing parts of the Jhumura Ramdani of the Sattriya repertoire. Wide shots of a group of monks performing for the camera are interspersed with close-ups of his guru and the first Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee for Sattriya — late Guru Maniram Dutta Muktiyar, as he demonstrates various aspects of the form with elegant ease. Yesteryear masters featured in the film include late Raseswar Saikia Barbayan and Haricharan Saikia. There are many more, who remain unidentified, frozen in frames, yet forgotten from the annals of history.

“As I grow older, I remember my time as a boy in the Sattra, at the feet of my gurus, even more fondly,” recounted Bora. Overwhelmed at seeing his guru on screen, he reflected on the journey of Sattriya from a ritual tradition to stage art. “For many centuries, the dance form was practised as a ritual and it is not audience-centric in the namghar (dance community hall in the monastery). When we see the dance form today on stage, there is a difference in the choreographic pattern, for instance the repetitions have been cut down. The way we were taught, we first made the offering to the sanctum sanctorum and repeated the movements on the other three side where the audience would be sitting. Now, it is a unidimensional setting in the proscenium.” The hand gestures used by the masters in the film are specific to the traditional dance compositions of Sattriya. These are used even today on the stage but keeping in view the frontal stage setting.

Speaking about the changing practices, Nrityacharya Jatin Goswami commented, “We must make sure that the basic philosophical context of the tradition is not lost in transition.” He pointed out that the number of monks has been reducing steadily and the form faces the danger of becoming uprooted from its actual essence.

Challenges ahead

Presenting the film on behalf of Kri Foundation, Arshiya Sethi pointed out, “The film is from a time when Sattriya as a form was in a way unadulterated, and had not seen or been influenced by any other dance forms.” After being recognised in the list of classical dance forms of India, in 2000, the dance repertoire has been adapted to the modern stage setting in terms of repertoire, aesthetics and costumes. “It is a lived tradition, and apart from stage life, it must have an alternative life that resonates with its heritage.”

Anwesa Mahanta

Sattriya dancer and Festival Director, Anwesa Mahanta shared her own journey of working with the form in new ways. “The choreographic change has been immense today when we see Sattriya on the modern proscenium stage — in terms of costume, music, and also the repertoire. Apart from the traditional compositions, lot of choreographic presentations have been added. For instance, I have taken those compositions based on the oeuvre of Sankardeva and Madhabdeva. Though it is an addition to the existing repertoire, it is not entirely out of link with the traditional repertoire.”

The film opens up pathways to the past and also calls for a more careful transition of the form in the future. Sattriya is still a living dance tradition of the sattras in Assam, and the challenge for present day performers would be to balance the traditional repertoire with new impulses.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/ctpi6v/article31048581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/L-RNrityacharya-Jatin-GoswamiProf-Pradipjyoti-MahantaBayanacharya-Ghanakanta,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/sattriya-past-forward/article31048585.ece

The demands remained the same: that the Corporation should regularise the services over 2,000 contract conservancy workers, a few of whom had served for around 15 years.

220,2020/03/12,"Desilting of Vellakinar pond by volunteers, residents nearing completion","Members of a volunteer organisation based in Vellakinar, who have been involved in desilting the local pond for nearly six months, said that the works are nearing completion.

V.K. Vasanth Kumar, one of the members, said that the works will be completed by the middle of March. The organisation, Vellakinar Water and Greenery Protection Committee, began the process in August 2019.

“We started by clearing the bushes in the pond,” Mr. Kumar said. The pond had run dry about 15 years ago, leading to the growth of thorny bushes and seemai karuvelam (Prosopis juliflora) in the dried-up pond, he said. The work was undertaken in two phases: cleaning and desilting.

After cleaning, the desilting works began on January 26 this year. Apart from nearly 20 members from the Committee, the residents of Vellakinar were also involved in the works for the past six months, which involved strengthening of bunds and increasing the pond's depth, Mr. Kumar said. The pond is expected to attain full capacity in the upcoming monsoon season, which in turn would increase the groundwater table, he said.

Following the completion of desilting works, the volunteers from the organisation will set up paths for walking and cycling and a playground around the pond, Mr. Kumar said. “These works might cost up to ₹ 40 lakh,” he claimed, which the organisation expects to collect via funds from corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The cleaning phase cost around ₹ 1 lakh while desilting cost about ₹ 15 lakh, he said.

The district administration has urged potential tourists to stay away from Hogenakkal, and put their tourism plans in abeyance in the light of COVID-19 outbreak in the country.

Appeal

The appeal was made at a special awareness programme was organised for the coracle operators, masseurs, and cooks, who are all integral to the tourism business in Hogenakkal, here on Tuesday.

The remaining two one-dayers between India and South Africa are likely to be played in empty stadiums in Lucknow and Kolkata due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The matches are scheduled to be held in March 15 (Lucknow) and March 18 (Kolkata).

The Sports Ministry has issued an advisory that in case it’s unavoidable to postpone a sporting event, then it is preferable that it be conducted without a large public gathering.

“The BCCI is in receipt of the Sports Ministry’s advisory. Obviously, if we are advised to avoid large gatherings, we will have to abide by it,” a soruce from the BCCI told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided to put ticket sales on hold, informed president Avishek Dalmiya, who also met Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the State Secretariat in Kolkata to discuss the prevailing situation.

“I met our honourable Chief Minister at the Secretariat. We would like to adhere to the government directive that has been issued today and we are stopping all ticket sales with immediate effect. We will wait till further directive,” Mr. Dalmiya told PTI from Kolkata.

When asked if the matches would be played in empty stadiums, Mr. Dalmiya said, “I wouldn’t like to make any premature comment. As of now, we will stop ticket sales till further directive. That’s how it stands as of now.”

227,2020/03/12,Ranji Trophy final | Collective resilience gives Bengal sniff at lead,"The home team was guilty of poor fielding and allowing easy runs to Bengal in the final session where 90 runs were scored.

Bengal’s resilience as a unit came to the fore again as it banked on half-centuries from Sudip Chatterjee, Wriddhiman Saha and Anustup Majumdar to give itself a realistic chance of overhauling Saurashtra’s first innings total of 425 in the Ranji Trophy final at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot on Thursday.

Also read: Ranji Trophy: The return of Anustup Majumdar

It was a long haul for Bengal, which resuming on 134 for three, approached the tough task with patience and finished the penultimate day at 354 for six, 72 runs shy of taking the lead.

After Saurashtra reduced Bengal to 263 for six, the tourists rose to the occasion to gather 90 runs in the final session and leave the match evenly-balanced.

Right template

It began with a great act of survival in an eventful opening period. Saha (64, 184b, 10x4, 1x6) and Chatterjee (81, 241b, 7x4) chose the right template to bat on a slow track that occasionally offered low bounce. Chatterjee, 47 overnight, stood like a rock, while Saha hung in resolutely despite being short of match practice.

Saha drove beautifully and cut with control, barring once when he was dropped on 50 off Jaydev Unadkat. Good running between wickets was another feature of their 101-run stand, lasting nearly four hours. Besides, Saha survived thrice, including two close shaves, when DRS came into play.

Also read: 'Partnerships with Shahbaz and Akash were the turning points' - Majumdar

Unadkat, who bowled with pin-point accuracy to trouble the wicketkeeper-batsman, succeeded in having Saha, on 6, lbw, but the television umpire overturned the decision as the ball hit the bat first. Saha escaped another lbw shout off the home skipper.

Perseverance pays

Saurashtra bowlers’ perseverance paid off when Chatterjee, who picked up some boundaries confidently, was caught off Dharmendrasinh Jadeja at forward short-leg 40 minutes after lunch.

Saha inside-edged Prerak Menkad onto his stumps and Shahbaz Ahmed was bowled by Chetan Sakariya before tea, as Bengal lost three wickets to invite pressure in the middle session.

Vital knock

Majumdar, Bengal’s rescuer of the season, again, played a vital knock (58 batting, 134b, 8x4) to form a 91-run unbriken association with Arnab Nandi (28 batting, 82b, 3x4, 1x6). They blocked with a straight bat and didn’t waste any scoring opportunity.

Majumdar, dropped on 10, got some boundaries on both sides.

Saurashtra’s strategy to post the wicketkeeper close to the stumps backfired. It leaked too many easy runs, including 16 byes and five penalty, as the momentum shifted towards Bengal in quick time.

The scores:

Saurashtra — 1st innings: 425.

Bengal — 1st innings: Sudip Gharami c Vishvarajsinh b Dharmendrasinh 26, Abhimanyu Easwaran lbw b Mankad 9, Sudip Chatterjee c Vishvarajsinh b Dharmendrasinh 81, Manoj Tiwary lbw b Jani 35, Wriddhiman Saha b Mankad 64, Anustup Majumdar (batting) 58, Shahbaz Ahmed b Sakariya 16, Arnab Nandi (batting) 28; Extras (b-16, lb-14, nb-1, w-1, pen-5): 37; Total (for six wkts. in 147 overs): 354.

IPL in empty stadiums would be up for discussion at the event’s Governing Council meeting on Saturday and the BCCI has decided to adopt a wait and watch policy till then. The T20 tournament is due to start on March 29 in Mumbai.

However, the Sports ministry has asked all national federations, including the cricket board, to follow the Health Ministry’s advisory and avoid large gatherings in sports events.

Sports Secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya told PTI that tournaments can continue but without the crowds.

“We have asked all the NSFs, including the BCCI, to follow the Health Ministry’s latest advisory, which says public gatherings should be avoided in all events, including sporting activities,” Julaniya said.

“The sporting events can go on but the advisory needs to be followed,” he added.

The government on Wednesday suspended all visas, barring a few categories like diplomatic and employment, in an attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across India rose to more than 70.

No foreign player will be available in the league due to the restrictions.

A closed-door IPL seems like a real possibility now but even a postponement cannot be ruled out given that the 60-odd overseas recruits won’t be available to ply their trade, at least in the initial stages of the event starting March 29 in Mumbai.

“The foreign players who play in the IPL come under the Business Visa category. As per the government’s directive, they can’t come till April 15,” a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

The Maharashtra and Karnataka governments are already wary of organising the home games of Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

The outbreak, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday, has led to more than 4,000 deaths globally.

Earlier, the shooting World Cup and the Indian Open golf tournament were postponed while badminton’s India Open will be played without any spectators.

230,2020/03/12,India vs SA 1st ODI | Rain has the final say,"It rained heavily on Wednesday night, lashing the picturesque HPCA stadium.

As anticipated, continual drizzle ensured there was no play in the first India-South Africa One-Day International here on Thursday. Much before the match was officially abandoned at 5.20 p.m., the forecast of moderate to heavy rain had cast a cloud of uncertainty around the series opener.

Also read: Coronavirus | Sports Ministry tells sports bodies, including BCCI, to keep away crowds

Wet ground conditions, owing to heavy rain that commenced on Wednesday night and lasted until 3 a.m. on Thursday, delayed the toss meant to be taken at 1 p.m. Thereafter, following spells of drizzles, a downpour that lashed the ground around 3 p.m. effectively dealt the final blow to the possibility of a rain-shortened match.

Too much to deal with

The cut-off time for a 20-over contest was 6.30 p.m. But the downpour that ended around 3.45 p.m. left the three Super Soppers with too much to deal with. Though the dedicated 20-odd members of the ground-staff worked relentlessly for the better part of the day, rain had the final say.

For the first time, after four matches at this venue, an ODI was washed out here.

This was also the second successive India-South Africa match called off owing to rain here. In September, the opener of the three-match T20 series suffered a similar fate.

Later, South Africa batsman Rassie van der Dussen echoed his team’s sentiments. “We travelled here last year and the same happened. We ran out and didn’t get a bowl. It’s a very scenic ground and, you know, that sets the view of the mountains, second only to Newlands. So it’s very disappointing, as a player to come here, see the beautiful ground, the passionate fans and not being able to get onto the block.”

But looking at the brighter side, he said, “I think it’s actually not a bad thing for us. We did a lot of travelling and took about three days to get to Dharamshala. So now, we get a few more days to prepare. We only had one practice session before this match, which probably wasn’t ideal. So now we’ll have one or two more sessions.”

Looking ahead, Dussen said, “We will be looking to keep that momentum going, obviously after the Australia series. We got to work hard, we got to really prepare ourselves as best as we can for the conditions that we’re going to face now.”

231,2020/03/12,Coronavirus: Foreign players not available for IPL till April 15 due to fresh visa restrictions,"The fate of the IPL itself will be decided on March 14 at the event’s Governing Council meeting in Mumbai.

No foreign player will be available for this year’s IPL till April 15 due to visa restrictions imposed by the government to contain the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak, a top BCCI source told PTI on Thursday, casting fresh doubts on the fate of the event.

A closed-door IPL seems like a real possibility now but even a postponement cannot be ruled out given that 60-odd overseas recruits won’t be available to ply their trade, at least in the initial stages of the event starting March 29 in Mumbai.

“The foreign players who play in the IPL come under the Business Visa category. As per the government’s directive, they can’t come till April 15,” a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

The fate of the IPL itself will be decided on March 14 at the event’s Governing Council meeting in Mumbai.

“All decisions will be taken by the GC in Mumbai,” the source said.

The government issued a fresh advisory with a ban on all existing foreign visas, except a few categories like diplomatic and employment, till April 15 in the wake of new positive cases of novel coronavirus in the country.

India has reported 60 positive cases in the outbreak which has led to over 4,000 deaths globally.

The “Details of Visas Granted by India” manual of the Ministry of Home Affairs states: “Foreign nationals who are engaged in commercial sports events in India on contract (including coaches) like Indian Premier League, Indian Soccer League, etc. with remuneration.

“They may be granted ‘B-Sports’ Visa with multiple entry facility for 13 appropriate period. Such a foreign national shall comply with all the statutory obligations like payment of taxes, etc.”

The BCCI source said that the government’s directive doesn’t specifically exempt those with Business Visas.

“There is a clear distinction between employment Visa which has been granted exemption and the business visa. So it’s better we dont take the risk.”

Having the IPL played in empty stadiums is an option being explored but without foreign players, it will certainly lack the zing which makes it the most successful T20 event in the world.

“The Future Tours Program is such that if the IPL is postponed, most of the marquee foreign players might not be available as after this April-May, there isn’t any window available. All other teams have bilateral commitments. At best, we can have it closed doors,” the source said.

The Road Safety Legends T20 meet from Thursday will be held behind closed doors with matches in Pune cancelled due to eight COVID-19 cases being reported in the city.

232,2020/03/12,Coronavirus: Foreign players’ participation in IPL in doubt after fresh visa restrictions,"India has reported 60 positive cases in the outbreak which has led to over 4,000 deaths globally.

The participation of foreign players at this year’s IPL came under severe doubt after the government ordered fresh visa restrictions to contain the spread of novel coronavirus even as the BCCI decided to adopt a wait and watch policy for now.

The BCCI will wait for the next couple of days to decide its next course of action after the government issued fresh advisory with a ban on all existing foreign visas, except a few categories like diplomatic and employment, till April 15 in the wake of new positive cases of novel coronavirus in the country.

“Please give us two days. It’s not possible to give you concrete details at the moment,” a senior Board office bearer told PTI on Wednesday.

India has reported 60 positive cases in the outbreak which has led to over 4,000 deaths globally.

Having the IPL, starting March 29, played in empty stadiums is an option but a decision will only be taken at the league’s Governing Council meeting in Mumbai on March 14.

The BCCI seems jittery about the 60-odd foreign cricketers, who travel to India for the IPL.

The Board said it is not yet clear on whether visas to these players also stand cancelled.

“All existing visas, except diplomatic, official, UN/International organisations, employment and project visas, stand suspended till 15th April 2020. This will come into effect from 1200GMT on 13th March 2020 at the port of departure,” the statement from the government said.

The pressure has increased manifold after the Legends T20 meet games in Pune, featuring the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara were cancelled.

The fate of the PIL is set to be heard in Madras High Court on Thursday.

And amid a possibility that the Maharashtra government might bar IPL games in the state, the only feasible solution is having matches inside empty stadiums.

233,2020/03/12,Delhi violence | 2 brothers held for killing 85-year-old woman by setting her house on fire,"The two accused were arrested by the Delhi police on March 11

Two brothers have been arrested for allegedly killing an 85-year-old woman by setting her house on fire in northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura area during last month’s riots, police said on Thursday.

The two accused, Arun, 26, and Varun, 22, who lived in the victim’s neighbourhood in Gamri village, were arrested by the Crime Branch of the Delhi police on March 11. They were identified on the basis of video clippings as well as with the help of locals and eyewitnesses, officials said.

The woman, Akbari, was trapped inside her home when a mob set it ablaze on February 25. Her body was retrieved around 10 hours later when the fire brigade managed to bring the blaze under control, police said.

Akbari died of suffocation. While her family members managed to reach the top floor of the house in time, she was not able to do so, they said.

According to the woman’s son, the complainant, he had gone to get milk from a nearby shop around 11 a.m. on February 25, when he received a call from his son Asif informing him that a huge crowd had assembled near his house.

The complainant ran a garment workshop on the ground and the first floor of the four-storey building, while his family lived on the other floors.

The crowd barged into the house and set it on fire. The complainant’s family members and 10 other employees rushed to the top floor of the house, but his 85-year-old mother, who was on the second floor could not, a senior police official said.

He said the other family members and workers of the complainant were rescued from the roof following a rescue operation by the police with the help of locals.

Around ₹8 lakh in cash, a box of gold and silver ornaments and other valuable articles were also looted by the mob, the police official said.

During the investigation, two mobile phones, including one of complainant, were seized as technical evidence. The accused were produced before the court, which sent them to police remand for two days, police said. They were being interrogated in order to nab the other accused, they added.

234,2020/03/12,CBI seeks maximum punishment for Sengar,"""Hang me, pour acid in my eyes if I’ve done anything wrong,"" BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar tells Delhi court

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday sought maximum punishment for expelled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and others, who have been held guilty in the two cases linked to the death of the Unnao rape victim’s father in 2018. The quantum of sentence is scheduled to be announced on Friday.

During the arguments on the quantum of sentence, the agency also sought maximum imprisonment for the convicted police officials — the then Makhi Police Station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria and then Sub-Inspector K. P. Singh. They did not fulfil their duties, nor did they provide timely medical treatment to the victim's father.

Claims innocence

Sengar argued for himself, claiming innocence. Seeking justice, he said he should be hanged and acid poured into his eyes if he had done anything wrong. The Judge observed that he had already been held guilty based on evidence.

Sengar pleaded stating that he had two daughters, at which the court said he should have thought about it before he committed the crime.

On March 4, the court convicted seven persons, including Sengar. Four other accused persons were acquitted. Sengar was found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The other offences invoked are under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 167 (public servant framing incorrect document to cause injury), 193 (punishment for false evidence), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record to save person from punishment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the IPC.

The CBI had registered the cases on the request of the State government. One case pertained to the death of the victim’s father on April 9, 2018, while the other was against him for alleged possession of illegal arms.

It was alleged that the girl’s father was assaulted following a tiff with some of the accused on April 3. He was taken to the area Police Station and framed for allegedly possessing an illegal firearm and then sent to judicial custody, during which he died.

On December 20, 2019, the court sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment for raping the girl in 2017.

235,2020/03/12,Delhi HC defers hearing petitions related to riots till March 20,"The Bench adjourned the hearing after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought time to submit the detailed reply of the government

The Delhi High Court on Thursday deferred till March 20 the hearing on a batch of petitions related to recent riots that broke out in the capital's northeast area.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar adjourned the hearing after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought time to submit the detailed reply of the government.

The Bench directed the Centre to submit its reply on or before March 16.

During the brief proceeding, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for petitioner Harsh Mander, urged that he be allowed to argue his case in the afternoon session. Mr. Mander has sought lodging of FIRs against three BJP leaders — Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra — over their alleged hate speeches.

The Bench also issued notice to the police and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government on a petition alleging that hate speeches were made by Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Salman Khurshid and the BJP’s Thakur and Mishra.

The Supreme Court had earlier this month remarked that it was “unjustified” on the part of the Delhi High Court to delay hearing the pleas for arrest and prosecution of leaders, who instigated the communal rampage.

Following this, on March 6, the Bench headed by Chief Justice Patel took up the bunch of pleas related to the issue and posted them for detailed hearing together on March 12.

One of the petitions in the matter include a plea filed by CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat to make public the list of persons arrested in connection with the recent violence in northeast Delhi. Ms. Karat has urged the High Court to direct the police to follow due process of listing of names of arrested persons outside the Police Control Room or Police Station, and updating them on a case-by-case basis.

Another petition has also sought lodging of FIRs against the Congress leaders as well as Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan, AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and former AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan for allegedly making hate speeches.

Ms. Karat in her second petition, filed through advocate Tara Narula, said she has been actively working in the riot-affected areas in northeast Delhi in her personal capacity as well as a member of the Delhi Relief and Solidarity Committee. In her petition, she has called for “a status report disclosing the names and numbers of persons detained and arrested by the Delhi Police in relation to the pogrom between February 23, 2020 and now”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qjnzhz/article31049572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-CITIZENSHIPPROTESTS-SURVIVOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-defers-hearing-petitions-related-to-riots-till-march-20/article31049574.ece

The Delhi High Court on Thursday issued notice to the police and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government on a petition which has alleged that hate speeches were made by Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Salman Khurshid and the BJP’s Anurag Thakur and Kapil Mishra.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar gave the direction on the plea, filed by one Deepak Madan, who also has sought registration of cases against those allegedly making hate speeches and setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to assess property damage in last month’s riots in northeast Delhi.

Also Read Plea in HC to remove hate speech from social media

The petition has also sought the attachment of properties of people allegedly involved in making hate speeches and suggested selling them off to compensate victims of the communal violence in the national capital.

Mr. Madan has also sought direction to the government “to restrain any political party or person from giving any speech and organise any rally until the peace and situation within Delhi is under control and normal”.

The plea said the alleged hate speeches by the political figures were not only defamatory but also provocative in nature and led to the recent riots.

“Due to this Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), various Muslim groups were protesting against this Act at various places in Delhi. That since the very inception of passing of the amendment, leaders of various political parties started raised slogans against the amendment and gave hate speeches which have instigated the people, who started raising anti-CAA slogans,” it said.

The plea has sought booking of these leaders under the National Security Act for allegedly continuously posting hate speeches and disturbing the country’s integrity as their speeches led to destruction of properties in different areas of northeast Delhi.

The plea claimed that no action has been taken against the politicians who allegedly delivered hate speeches, even though “impact of these hate and provocative speeches have been seen in North East, East Delhi and Shahdara district of Delhi where instances of multiple riots and mob attacks has caused deaths, loss of properties and severe injuries in many cases“.

The petition went on to claim that the police, instead of taking steps to stop rioters, merely stood as spectators.

“Delhi Police did not exercise due diligence against the political persons when hate speeches were delivered by them on public platform. The State Police did not take action against the political persons on time so as to control them from making any further hate speeches and provoke the public which has lead to such a big massacre,” the petition alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/broz1/article31048285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAPILPTI2292020000065B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-issues-notice-to-aap-govt-delhi-police-on-hate-speeches-by-sonia-khurshid-bjp-leaders/article31048286.ece

239,2020/03/12,Detentions spark fear among Chand Bagh residents,"At least nine persons have been picked up by Crime Branch officers since Monday

“My brother was thrashed for hours before he was let off,” alleged Haji Bhure, standing at his grocery store in the Chand Bagh area in north-east Delhi. Released on Wednesday morning, Mushahid’s family sent him off immediately to their home town, Budaun in Uttar Pradesh.

The 35-year-old was picked up by police around 12 noon on Monday from the same store where his brother was attending to customers on Wednesday. “They came and picked up Mushahid without giving any reason. When we asked, they said they will release him after questioning about riots,” Mr. Bhure said. On Tuesday, another brother went to the Crime Branch office in Chanakyapuri and tried to reason with the officers that Mushahid was not in Delhi when the riots broke out (on February 23). “We made them talk to a relative in Budaun with whom Mushahid works. They finally released him,” said Mr. Bhure.

When contacted, senior officers of Crime Branch remained unavailable for comment on the incident.

‘Beaten up in custody’

Mr. Bhure alleged that his brother was beaten up in custody. “He told us that they continuously slapped him and asked him if he knew who all were involved in the rioting. They showed photographs and asked him to identify the rioters,” he said.

Mr. Mushahid is not the only one who has been detained by the police from Chand Bagh in the last three days. At least nine persons have been picked up by Crime Branch officers since Monday from different streets of Chand Bagh. The Hindu spoke to the families of five of them.

Among the detainees is a 50-year-old tailor, Abdul Kadir, who was picked up around 11 a.m. on Wednesday. His daughter Rukhsar said the police were looking for her brother Shahnawaz. “They came and asked for Shahnawaz. We told them Shahnawaz wasn’t at home. They took my father instead,” she said.

A neighbour, Shakeel Ahmed, said he had gone to meet the officers at the Crime Branch’s makeshift office nearby and was told that they should bring Shahnawaz for his father to be released.

“People here are living in tremendous fear, don’t know whose door the policemen will knock next,” said Mr. Ahmed.

In F Block’s street no. 8, policemen picked up Mohammed Yunus on Tuesday around 5 p.m. They had already detained his brother Mohammed Ayub by then.

‘Not released yet’

A relative of the brothers said their mother is inconsolable. “The policemen came looking for Yunus but he wasn’t home. When he came back, his mother gave him the number the officers had given. He called them and went out. He hasn’t returned since then and so hasn’t Ayub,” the relative said. “They say they’ll release them after questioning but they haven’t.”

Right opposite is street no. 8 of E-Block from where Aslam, 23, was picked up on Tuesday around 8 p.m. “Aslam sells vegetables in Azadpur Mandi. He was sleeping when the police came for him. At least they should tell the family what his crime is,” said his paternal uncle Haji Shah Jahan.

In the early hours of Monday, the police picked up three men — Habib, Usman and Yameen — from Nehru Vihar while they were guarding their locality, their families alleged. Their lawyer, Abdul Gaffar, said the police have slapped sections of rioting, obstruction of duty and “mischief by fire with intent to destroy house” against them and they have been sent to judicial custody.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sha68i/article31044835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12CHANDBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/detentions-spark-fear-among-chand-bagh-residents/article31044836.ece

“Social media platform cannot become a tool for rioting, even as they claim freedom of speech and expression,” the petition contended. It has further alleged that such platforms “have been misusing the idea of free speech and have not been complying with Indian laws”.

242,2020/03/12,Kin of deceased law student protest outside school over its de-sealing,"‘Will kill myself, but won’t let exams be conducted here’

Hours after it was allowed to reopen, Hari Singh Solanki, whose son Rahul died in an attack allegedly mounted from the terrace of the Rajdhani Senior Secondary Public School in Shiv Vihar, sat on a protest outside its gates alleging that it had been de-sealed illegally and was “a den of death”.

Mr. Solanki’s son, a law student, suffered a fatal gun shot which allegedly originated from the terrace of the school on February 24 when he had stepped out to purchase milk as violence ripped across the area. He argued that the school should remain locked.

“I will kill myself but won’t let exams be conducted here. I’ve complained to the local police [about the reopening of the school] but there has been no action on it. I will give up my life but not let this happen. The local police misled me and told me that the school won’t open till investigation is done,” Mr. Solanki, who reached the school with local residents on Wednesday evening, said.

“If our homes and shops can be sealed why can’t the school remain sealed? This school had weapons, a slingshot, petrol bombs...I will not let it open...it is a den of death that doesn’t deserve the presence of innocent children,” he alleged.

According to the police and school authorities, the school had been de-sealed as per the requisite legal formalities and provisions. “We have collected the required evidence and there is no reason for the school to be shut given that hundreds of children scheduled to appear for exams are involved,” said Alok Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Police [eastern range].

“The school can open and we will provide necessary arrangement to ensure the security of the children and its staff as and when required,” Mr. Kumar added.

Sadaf Faisal, school’s principal, said she and her staff could make the necessary arrangements for the exams within a day but it seemed difficult given the circumstances. “The safety and security of the children and the staff is important to me. All we need is a day to prepare the date sheet and exam schedule. But given the circumstances, I don't think we will go down that road at least for the time being and especially tomorrow [Thursday],” Ms. Faisal said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ldtw4k/article31044600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL12-SCHOOL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kin-of-deceased-law-student-protest-outside-school-over-its-de-sealing/article31044601.ece

“DMC has constituted a ten-member fact finding committee to probe the violence which erupted from late night on February 23 and continued for the next few days during which hundreds of homes, shops, workshops, offices, vehicles and even a number of schools, madrasas, dargahs and mosques were attacked, looted and torched, in some cases blasted using gas cylinders,” the statement issued by the panel read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fact-finding-panel-formed-to-probe-violence/article31044579.ece
244,2020/03/12,Don’t harass innocent people: Rai,"Labour Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday evening met senior police officials of riots-affected north-east Delhi and urged them to take action against the guilty and not to harass innocent people based on “misleading information”.

“After the riots, we have been getting complaints from different constituencies that cases have been filed against people who were not involved in it. We had held a meeting with the police officers earlier on the situation and found that the lower level officers are filing the cases.”

The Minister met Joint Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar and Deputy Commissioner of Police Ved Prakash Surya of north-east Delhi and later said that they deliberated on how the police officers must be careful in reporting cases so that innocent people are not arrested or wrongly framed.

“Strict action must be taken against those who have strong evidence against them. No action on behalf of the police must be taken under any provocation or if it is misleading. The police have assured that no wrong action will be taken and the senior officers will also take cognisance of such a complaint,” Mr. Rai said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dont-harass-innocent-people-rai/article31044555.ece
245,2020/03/12,"Riot victims rebuild their lives byday, escape to safety after dusk","Residents unable to overcome the fear that violence left behind

Residents of Shiv Vihar race against time to rebuild their lives as much as possible till dusk everyday. But after sunset, all of them leave the locality and move to safer places as a collective sense of fear accompanies each evening since the violence ripped across the locality on February 25.

Outside the vandalised or burnt remains of their houses and shops in gali number 20 here on Wednesday, neighbours — both Hindus and Muslims — are encouraging each other to ready the requisite documents for paperwork related to claims for compensation, exchanging tips on quick repair work which could, at least, allow the partial utilisation of their property and sharing accounts of their escape to safety a fortnight ago.

Recalling past

“I came to my clinic around 9 a.m. that Tuesday and, thankfully, left for my relatives’ place in Shanti Nagar, where I am still put up with my family. A few hours later, they [rioters] entered the locality from two sides and did what they wanted. It has been over a fortnight since the incident took place but people are still scared. Streets are empty as soon as it gets dark,” said Dr. Amar Pal Singh, a resident.

Rambaran Singh Baghel, who owned a provisional store in the area, said. “We have been depending on aid from outsiders – whether NGOs or individual donors – since the afternoon of February 25 when I escaped to a relatives’ house with my family fearing the worst. I come here every morning and stay for the paperwork till dark. There is still a sense of fear...anything can happen.”

Jannat Khatoon, 70, said, she was thankful that her 77-year-old husband Abdul Aziz Khan made it home well on time despite being late for the afternoon prayers at the Madina Masjid, which was later vandalised.

“Stone pelting by a mob wearing helmets began just metres away on the main road near Shiv Vihar drain. We took refuge behind the cremation ground for hours before escaping to Chaman Park . We will go back where we have sought shelter,” she said as she stood at the gate of her ransacked home.

Ali Ahmed, whose religious book store, Alim Books, that stood next to Dr. Singh’s clinic, said he had shifted to a rented accommodation in Mustafabad. “Our house was in the middle of the area with Hindu homes [that were left untouched] on both sides in phase 5, gali number 7. Abhi bhi kuch pata nahin; kabhi bhi kuch bhi ho sakta hai [One still doesn’t know; anything may happen any time].”

Sense of pain

Nasima Khatoon, whose provisional store was destroyed in the violence, said “Everyone is feeling the same pain — some more, some less. There is so much rubble here that one doesn’t know what it used to be before.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/oqbsfd/article31044549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL12-SHIV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riot-victims-rebuild-their-lives-byday-escape-to-safety-after-dusk/article31044550.ece
246,2020/03/12,"1,100 rioters identified using facial recognition technology: Amit Shah","Nearly 300 of them came from Uttar Pradesh, says Union Home Minister

Home Minister Amit Shah said on Wednesday said that police are using facial recognition software to track down the suspects involved in the Delhi riots that killed 53 people

Mr. Shah said officers had fed Voter ID, driving licence and other details into the software to identify the suspects involved in serious crimes like murder and arson.

“Police have identified 1,100 people through the facial recognition technology. Nearly 300 people came from Uttar Pradesh. It was a planned conspiracy,” said Mr. Shah while replying to a short duration discussion on Delhi riots in Lok Sabha.

He said the footage procured from Close Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) and other mediums was being scientifically analysed. “CCTV footage is being analysed on 25 computers. The software does not recognise religion. Action will be taken against anyone found indulging in the act, no one will be spared,” Mr. Shah said.

Earlier, Delhi Police had used the technology during various anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in the city. This is the first time the government has admitted using the software that also has privacy concerns.

A senior Delhi Police officer told The Hindu that the footage procured from CCTV, media persons and the public was matched with photographs stored in the database of Election Commission and e-Vahan, a pan-India database of vehicle registration maintained by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.

Matching of photos

“Our personnel were also recording videos when the riots were on. Once we had clear video footage, the software was used to match the photographs with that in the database of EC and e-Vahan to identify the suspects. Basically, even if someone changes his appearance, the chin and the eye do not change. These are the two key facial features that will help us nab the suspects,” said the police officer.

The officer added that most of the 300 suspects who came from Uttar Pradesh to carry out the violence had criminal records against them and their culpability was established through the facial recognition software.

Delhi Police has been taking the help of private software companies to use the technology in aiding the investigations. “We have the photographs and the database. All we have to do is to key in a particular geographical area and the software matches the two set of photographs,” the officer said.

Social media accounts

He said the police had identified 60 social media accounts that were created on February 22 to create unrest and were deactivated on February 26.

“Twenty five cases have been registered under the Information Technology Act. The riots were engineered and the social media accounts were used to organise protests when [U.S. President] Donald Trump was here. They think they will escape the law if they deactivate the accounts, nobody will be spared, they will be fished out,” Mr. Shah said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bwsdm6/article31044547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DERIOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1100-rioters-identified-using-facial-recognition-technology-amit-shah/article31044548.ece
247,2020/03/12,Jamia reopens library nearly three months after vandalism,"Police had entered campus ‘in pursuit of anti-CAA protesters’

The main library of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), which was vandalised on December 15, 2019, after the police entered it following anti-CAA protests, was reopened after renovation on Wednesday.

Dr. Zakir Husain Library has undergone extensive renovation and efforts have been made to provide better facilities to students by installing LED lights as well as new and comfortable chairs, the university said in a statement.

“With a capacity to seat 800 students, and comprising a reading hall, research floor, reference and periodical sections, and a digital resource centre with 150 computers, the library resumed all its services on Wednesday. The textbook and research sections of the library are open till midnight,” a JMI official said.

The library proposes to strengthen its user services in coming days by extensively leveraging information and communication technologies. “It is a matter of great satisfaction that despite heavy odds, the library has been able to utilise its budgetary allocation completely and renew its subscription to electronic databases,” the university stated.

During the three months that the library remained closed, efforts were made to improve the functioning of a number of faculty and departmental libraries by deputing the staff of the central library. “The time was also utilised to migrate library management software to an open source software for more effective integration and discovery of resources,” the university added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kt53td/article31044306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DEJMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jamia-reopens-library-nearly-three-months-after-vandalism/article31044308.ece
248,2020/03/12,Kin of couple held for ‘IS links’ swear by their innocence,"Prolonged Internet shutdown behind the duo shifting to Delhi, they claim

The family in Srinagar’s posh Shiv Pora locality of the couple arrested by the Delhi police for alleged links to the Khorasan module of the Islamic State (IS) links swear by their innocence.

“They got married five months ago. Both are professionals. My brother was associated with a United Kingdom-based information technology company. The reason behind shifting to Delhi was the prolonged Internet shutdown. The allegations of their links (with IS) are fictitious,” said Sehrish Sami, sister of Jahanzaib Sami Wani, who along with his wife Hina Bashir Beig were arrested from Delhi’s Jamia Nagar on March 8.

Jahanzaib, who passed out from a missionary school in Srinagar, has been studying and working in many parts of the country, said his sister.

After finishing a bachelor’s degree in electronics and communication from Punjab’s Ferozepur, he went on to pursue his MBA degree from Bengaluru.

His dream start-up project, Walursol, fell victim to the prolonged shutdown of 2016 in the wake of militant Burhan Wani’s killing in an operation by security forces. “Unhappy with the situation at home, my brother moved to Delhi in August 2019,” said Ms. Sami, surrounded by consoling relatives.

While arresting the couple, Delhi Police’s Special Cell had said they were involved in inciting protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and were in possession of “objectionable material”. DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said the couple had moved to Delhi from Srinagar in August 2019.

The family claimed Jahanzaib’s is a case of mistaken identity and the Delhi police did not bother to inform the family “as per law”.

Ms. Sami said her brother returned to Kashmir for his wedding on October 6, 2019 and returned to the Capital with his wife on October 26.

“We were told by neighbours that the police came looking for another person in the Delhi apartment. In fact, my sister-in-law volunteered to accompany her husband. Why would she accompany him if she was involved?” said another relative.

Ms. Beig, 36, also a professional with a degree in finance management, has been questioned by the police about her sudden decision to “use purdah”, the family claimed.

She used to wear Western clothes not long ago when she worked in a private company. The police have even traced her pictures on Facebook in Western outfits, claimed the family.

Another family member said both of them are “religious” and abide by Islamic tenets such as reading the Koran and offering prayers. “How is that a crime?” the family member said.

“They were planning to return home following the restoration of Internet. All allegations are a farce,” said Jahanzaib’s sister.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/60jzlb/article31044292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09HINDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kin-of-couple-held-for-is-links-swear-by-their-innocence/article31044294.ece
249,2020/03/12,Online portal told to pay ₹11K for defective mobile phone,"Portal failed to redress the grievance of the buyer

A district consumer disputes redressal forum here has directed e-commerce platform Flipkart to compensate a complainant by paying over ₹11,000 for delivering a defective mobile handset and failing to redress the grievance.

Holding the online portal deficient in services, the consumer panel said, “We hold the opposite party [Flipkart] guilty of deficiency in service as it has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that it had indeed taken any concrete steps for reverse pickup of the subject mobile phone from the complainant or took any measures or resolutions or steps to redress the grievance of the complainant except filing a cryptic written statement to wriggle out of liability.”

The directions came when the forum was hearing a complaint moved by city resident Deepansh Aggarwal who contended that a handset bought by him for his uncle turned out to be defective. It was also alleged that the online portal failed to get the handset picked up despite the complainant generating a request for return or replacement.

While noting that the portal had accepted the fact that an alternative number was provided to it by the complainant, the consumer panel observed, “The opposite party has failed to place any cogent evidence by way of e-mail correspondence or otherwise of alleged four attempts made by it for having the subject mobile picked up since there is no such to this effect.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/online-portal-told-to-pay-11k-for-defective-mobile-phone/article31044285.ece
250,2020/03/12,Over 50% decline in PCR calls this Holi,"Dip is likely due to people staying at home in view of rise in COVID-19 cases: police

The Delhi Police received over 50% less Police Control Room (PCR) calls this Holi as compared to 2019.

“The calls to PCR drastically reduced to 8,667 in comparison to 18,798 last year. The Delhi Police appreciates the cooperation of residents for a peaceful Holi,” the police said.

They added that a total of 647 challans were issued for drunken driving, 181 for triple riding, 1,192 for not wearing helmets and 156 for dangerous driving on Tuesday. Last year, the police had issued 1,736 challans for drunken driving, 416 for using the wrong carriageway, 326 for dangerous driving, 409 for overspeeding, 1,446 for triple riding and 5,092 for without helmet

A senior officer said that that the reason for the deccrease in number of PCR calls is due to rise in COVID-19 cases. “Many people decided against playing the festival or played at their homes,” he added.

Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava also inspected the deployment of the force across the Capital and greeted them on the occasion of Holi. In a statement, the police said Mr. Shrivastava met members of the Aman committee in North East district where the riots broke out last month and extended Holi greetings.

Three accidents

Three persons died in three separate accidents on Tuesday. While one incident was reported from north Delhi’s Civil Lines area, others were reported from south-west Delhi’s Kapashera and Rohini’s Kanjhawala area.

At Civil Lines, the victim has been identified as Sumit. He was going with his friend Sonu Shrivastav to Badarpur to celebrate Holi at his (Sonu’s) in-laws’ house on the victim’s bike. The two were drunk and Sumit was allegedly driving rash when they bike hit a divider and the two got injured. Sumit later succumbed to his injuries at AIIMS Trauma Centre, the police said.

In the second incident, one person died while another — both students — were injured when their car rammed a pole in Kapashera area. The accident happened on Tuesday afternoon.

251,2020/03/12,Young faces take lead in Delhi Cong.,"Former MLA Anil Chaudhary appointed DPCC chief

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday appointed former Patparganj MLA Anil Chaudhary as president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC).

The post was lying vacant after Subhash Chopra resigned after the party’s dismal performance in the Delhi Assembly elections. Ms. Gandhi also appointed Abhishek Dutt, Shivani Chopra, Jaikishan, Mudit Agarwal and Ali Hassan as vice-presidents of the DPCC.

Mr. Chaudhary, 44, was the MLA from Patparganj between 2008 and 2013. He was was defeated by Aam Aadmi Party’s Manish Sisodia in 2013 and 2015 Assembly elections. He is also a former councillor, former president of the Delhi Youth Congress, and a student leader heading the Delhi unit of the National Students’ Union of India.

After being appointed as DPCC chief, Mr. Chaudhary thanked Ms. Gandhi for giving him the responsibility and said that he would work hard to strengthen the Congress in Delhi. With this appointment, sources within the Delhi Congress said that the party has gone for a number of young faces to revamp the party after it failed to win a single seat in two consecutive Assembly elections in 2015 and 2020, and saw its vote share dip from 9.7% in 2015 to 4.27%.

“It seems like the party high command has replaced its senior guard to bring in people who can revamp the party. After looking at the developments in Madhya Pradesh with Jyotiraditya Scindia, the high command has perhaps taken a cue and brought the next generation of leaders to the forefront,” a senior Delhi Congress leader said.

Three of the new vice-presidents are children of senior Delhi Congress leaders. Shivani Chopra is the daughter of Subhash Chopra; Mudit Agarwal is J.P. Agarwal’s son; and Ali Hassan is Hasan Ahmed’s son. Abhishek Dutt is a two-time councillor and was the party’s candidate from the Kasturba Nagar Assembly constituency.

Along with Mr. Chopra, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Delhi P.C. Chacko had also resigned.

253,2020/03/12,"Assembly to discuss NPR, NRC, COVID-19 tomorrow","‘House may pass resolution to adopt NPR in old format’

The Delhi Assembly will hold a one-day special session on Friday to discuss the National Population Register (NPR), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and COVID-19. Party leaders said that AAP may push for a stand against the NPR in the current format during the session.

“The Assembly is likely to pass a resolution to implement NPR in its older format without the new questions which have created a dispute,” an AAP leader told The Hindu. With 62 MLAs, AAP has a brute majority in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

“About eight States have already passed some form of a resolution against the NPR or NRC in the current format. The Chief Minister has been critical of the NPR and NRC in multiple interviews and he will further clarify his stand in the Assembly,” another AAP leader said.

The decision to hold the Assembly session was taken in a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. AAP did not officially comment on what will be their stand on the NPR and NRC in the Assembly session.

BJP attacks move

Attacking the decision to hold the Assembly session, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri alleged the move was in line with the AAP government’s bid to “politicise” the issue of the amended citizenship law and the NRC.

The political opposition across the country, he alleged, was indulging in propaganda against CAA and NRC to mislead citizens, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “clarification” that the Act was not against any Indian citizen.

Similarly, he argued, the NRC was formulated during the tenure of the Congress-led UPA government and it “would not be implemented anywhere in the country” except in Assam as per Supreme Court directions.

“There is no other objective behind the session... If this government is really serious about Delhi then it should discuss issues such as controlling pollution, improving its crumbling public transportation infrastructure, and making clean potable water available to its citizens because even the Supreme Court has observed that Delhi has become a gas chamber,” Mr. Bidhuri said.

Meanwhile, Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel said that AAP MLA Dilip Pandey has been appointed as the chief whip of the ruling party in the Assembly.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/assembly-to-discuss-npr-nrc-covid-19-tomorrow/article31044269.ece
254,2020/03/12,Man held for setting religious books on fire,"Accused also confessed to his involvement in a similar incident in May last year

Some religious books left covered on a wooden bed outside Jama Masjid in Old Gurugram here were set alight along with three pushcarts in the early hours of Tuesday. A Delhi Transport Corporation bus conductor has been arrested in connection with the incident.

Gurugram Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said the accused Vikas (40), a resident of Dabas village in Delhi, has also confessed to his involvement in a similar incident in May last year wherein a Muslim tailor in Jackubpura was beaten up and told to chant “Jai Shri Ram” when he was returning from a mosque after offering namaz.

Mr. Boken said the accused was not associated with any organisation and was under the influence of alcohol at the time of committing the recent crime.

Complainant Hafiz Haroon said he was sleeping in his room when he heard a commotion around 2 a.m. and stepped outside to find his belongings, some religious books and clothes, on fire. Another set of religious books and clothes belonging to Jan Mohammad, and three pushcarts at a nearby meat market, were also set alight, said the complainant. The FIR further said the police personnel checked the CCTV footage installed at the mosque to find that a man in a black coat and blue shirt had lit the fire. A case was registered on charges of causing mischief with fire of the Indian Penal Code. The police later added the charge of defiling the place of worship to it.

Mr. Boken said the accused was arrested on Tuesday and sent to jail after the court remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days on Wednesday.

255,2020/03/12,Lovely man-lion form,"It is often assumed that Narasimha avatara was taken for the purpose of killing Hiranyakasipu. But, in fact, the Lord took His half-lion, half-man form to protect His devotee Prahlada, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. Because protecting Prahlada required the killing of the demon, the Lord killed Hiranyakasipu.

In the Vishnu Sahasranama, Narasimha avatara is extolled. The twenty-first name Narasimha vapuh is explained by Parasara Bhatta thus: in order to protect His devotee, He assumed the Narasimha form at His will. If we worship Him, He gets rid of the hurdles in our path. The next nama is Srimaan, and this means that the Narasimha form was lovely. It was a unique form with a combination of different species of living things — man and lion. And yet, it did not look odd. The combination of the two forms was perfect. In fact, it was so beautiful that anyone who had seen this form of the Lord would henceforth not find an individual man or lion good looking. Independently, they would not have the charm of the combination of the two forms in Narasimha.

Kesava is a reference to Narasimha’s beautiful hair. In a lion, it is its mane which gives its majestic look. Andal celebrates Narasimha’s mane with the words Veri mayir. Amrtyuh, the 200th name, means that He is an enemy of death itself, since He is death for the god of death. Narasimha is sarvadrik, because He gives to friend, foe and a neutral person what each one deserves. Prahlada is His bhakta, and so He gets Narasimha’s blessings in full. Hiranyakasipu is an enemy, and is killed. The celestials are neutral. They do not take sides in the fight between the Lord and the demon. They just make sure that they applaud the winning side. To them, the Lord gives back their territory, namely devaloka.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/lovely-man-lion-form/article31052419.ece
256,2020/03/12,Musical homage offered to Sri Raghavendra,"Concerts and Namasankirtanam marked the aradhana of Sri Raghavendra Swami held at Mantralayam

‘Naadhahaara Samarpanam,’ a musical tribute was offered to Sri Raghavendra at Mantralayam, for the 16th consecutive year by Shri Raghavendra Swamy Naadhahaara Seva Trust for three days from March 1-3. Around 300 musicians from across South India, mainly from Chennai, took part in the event.

The programme on March 1 began at 5 p.m. with the Nagaswaram recital of Tiruvisainallur Selvarathnam and party. The tani avartanam led by thavil vidwan Thirupungur Muthukumaraswamy stood out.

On Day two (March 2), the Vardanti of the Saint, the celebrations began at 9 a.m. with Namasankirtanam. Around 200 musicians participated. The idol of Sri Raghavendra was taken out on a procession on the Navaratna chariot.

Sri Subudhendra Tirtha Swamiji, the current pontiff of Sri Raghavendra Swamy Math, in his Anugraha Bhashanam mentioned that Raghavendra Swami is a gift from Tamil Nadu to the entire Universe. The bhashanam was followed by the flute recital of Prapancham S. Balachandran and team. His rendition of the Tyagaraja kriti ‘Chethulara,’ was rich in melody. Senior and young musicians, led by Thoppur Sairam, rendered the Pancharathna kritis of the saint-composer.

The group rendition concluded with ‘Indhu enage Govinda’, the only available kriti written by Sri Raghavendrar and the evergreen ‘Bhaagyaatha Lakshmi Baaramma.’

The evening session at 6 p.m. featured senior musicians, who rendered the Ashtadasa kritis individually. Namasankirtanam and Nrithya Seva (1.30 p.m.) by senior musicians and devotees brought the day’s events to a close.

257,2020/03/12,Temple where Sundareswara is a cradle baby,"Hold Him and rock Him at the temple in Kothangudi village

There may be several temples for Sri Meenakshi-Sundareswarar but the one in Kothangudi village, Thanjavur district, is different. The ancient temple, 1,300-years old, praised by Tirugnanasambandar in his Kshetra Kovai Pathigam, was a vibrant place of worship, where festivals were celebrated with great fanfare. It lost its sheen over a period of time and fell into ruins. It was restored, consecration performed and daily pujas were revived after a gap of 100 years.

Kothangudi is indeed special in many ways. First is the hymn rendered by Sambandar. “Kuthangudi Vedikudi Punalsoozh Kurundankudi...” goes the Thevaram. The Lingam is in the rare Chaturasra Vrutham shape. For four days, from the Full Moon of Panguni (March-April) the Lingam is bathed in the rays of the rising sun. The slightly tilted position perhaps indicates that He is listening to the appeal of the devotee. “Meenakshi is our mother, who conveys our messages to Her Consort. A lamp lit in her shrine will drive away our worries,” say women, who throng the temple.

Sri Krishna’s upadesam

Seated in the verdant surroundings of Kothangudi, Sri Krishna is said to have revealed to Arjuna a high philosophy. Krishna and Arjuna are in conversation when cartloads of flowers pass them towards the Siva temple. “Who, but I, can offer a floral puja of this magnitude to the deity,” wonders Arjuna, not without a trace of conceit. Reading his mind, Krishna turns his head and looking in that direction, Arjuna finds Bhima meditating, eyes closed, under a tree. Bhima is visualising a grand offering of flowers to Sundareswara. The power of his thoughts has made the celestials harvest all the blossoms in the vicinity and shower them on Iswara. “This is Bhima’s Mental offering (Manasika puja), Arjuna,” conveys Gitacharya, who goes on to underline the power of mind and devotion devoid of arrogance. The place, therefore, is also referred to as Bhimeswaram. And for this reason, offering of loose blossoms is preferred to strings of flowers.

Kothangudi is the destination for couples, who yearn for progeny. Couples praying for a child, place an idol of infant Sundareswara, called Santhana Sundareswara, in a cradle and gently rock it before the priest returns it to the sanctum. “Their prayers are always answered,” says the priest. “After the child is born, the parents come back with the baby and place it in the cradle and perform puja,” he explains. Records have it that scholars Sri Mahadeva Sastri and Sri Krishna Sastri — both ardent followers of the Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam — lived in Kothangudi and worshipped Sri Meenakshi-Sundareswarar. Sri Krishna Sastri is said to have performed hundreds of Santhana Bhagya homam.

258,2020/03/12,Dinosaurs and space archaeology at Chennai’s next TEDx,"Space archaeologists, historians and podcasters share the spotlight at the next TEDxNapierBridgeSalon

History offers a lot to learn from, there is no denying that. But how often do we proactively try? How often, in fact, do we even look back, or make history part of our everyday conversations?

The team behind TEDxNapier Bridge seems to have been musing along similar lines, for its next salon edition is based entirely on topics of history — both natural and human, and how the latter looks different from multiple perspectives.

Like at any other TEDx salon session, this one will have pre-curated talks, instead of local personalities speaking live on stage. This, broadens the scope of the event, giving organisers the pick of experts and speakers from around the world. Which is exactly what Shyam Sundar, curator, TEDx NapierBridge, has done.

“In the past, we have explored topics like Art, Cinema and even taboo topics like sexuality and gender. This time, the theme is ‘Chronicles — A rendezvous with time’, a word we use often when talking about history. The talks will be from a global point of view, but through conversations after, we also plan to derive an Indian context,” he says.

For example: dinosaurs. As Shyam points out, palaeontology is a subject rarely thought of in an Indian setting. “People assume that dinosaur fossils are not found in India, but there are so many sites, including many in Tamil Nadu, where dinosaur fossils have been found and palaeontologists are still exploring.” To that end, TEDxNapierBridge is bringing in journalist and podcaster Anupama Chandrasekaran to talk about the field in India.

Another idea the event will explore is “how we, as laymen, can contribute to the telling of history. There is a talk we will be playing by a space archaeologist, about a global platform called Global Explorer, where citizens use remote sensing to identify and mark a lot of ancient sites, just by sitting at their computers.” The project, adds Shyam, is also being picked up by the Archaeological Survey of India to carry forward in this country.

The rest of the speakers, and their topics of choice, are still under wraps and can only be seen by the 60 people who register and show up for this limited-seating event. However, there are certain other details that the team is willing to reveal. Such as the topical artefacts and objects that will be on display on the sidelines.

“We have got in touch with students of Archaeology, whose curriculum requires a lot of field work and visits to sites and digs,” he says. Often, these digs unearth minor artefacts, either of lesser significance or in multiple pieces, and students are allowed to keep them for personal study if both their institution and the ASI find no use for them. That doesn’t make them any less ancient, however, or any less intriguing to laymen like you and I. “A couple of such students have agreed to put up some of their personal pieces, discovered at archaeological sites, for display. They will also be present there to explain about each piece,” says Shyam.

And then there are a number of rare and acclaimed books, both on natural and human history, collected by the organisers. “We will be keeping them on display, and if people are interested in buying their own copies, we can help them source it,” he says. Another highlight of the main event is a guest lecture by novelist, historian and columnist Venkatesh Ramakrishnan who will focus on the history of Madras. All in all, quite a treat for history buffs.

Chronicles — A Rendezvous With Time by TEDxNapierBridge will be held at Curioplay, Alwarpet on March 15 at 2.45 pm.

259,2020/03/12,Festival returns to Anbil,"The Tamil New Year will usher in Brahmotsavam at Sri Sundararaja Perumal temple

Devotees are expected to throng Anbil, a village near Tiruchi, on Vaikasi Visakham to witness the annual Brahmotsavam festival of Sri Sundararaja Perumal temple, hailed by Thirumazhisai Azhwar.

The eastern gopuram of Sri Sundararaja perumal temple, Anbil

The highlight will be the temple chariot that will run for the first time in several centuries with the revival of the festival, thanks to Aravamudhan Bhattar, who took the initiative.

Aravamudhan Bhattar

Aravamudhan, took charge of the temple five years ago, after the demise of his father, who had been serving the temple close to two decades.The constant query posed to his father by the inhabitants on the absence of the Brahmotsavam and the chariot festival inspired him to revive both. He approached Pon Jayaraman, the Joint Commissioner of HR and CE department at the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple, which administers the Anbil Divya Desam, and got the green signal.

Challenging tasks

Though conducting the daily rituals at the temple along with preparing for Brahmotsavam were challenging tasks, Aravamudhan has managed with élan. He thanks the local community for making this happen. This includes the descendants of the original inhabitants of Anbil, many of whom are now residing in different parts of the world.

The new chariot to be used during the Vaikasi Visakam Brahmotsavam of Sri Sundara Raja Perumal temple, Anbil, Tiruchi

Says the 30-year-old Aravamudhan Bhattar, “The JC of Srirangam has constantly encouraged me to bring back the lost glory of this Divya Desam. Almost all the new Vahanas that will carry Sundara Raja Perumal are now in place. The new chariot, which has exquisite sculptures depicting historical stories, is ready for the trial run around the outer prakaram.”

Hanumuntha Vahanam, Kalpaka Vriksham and Elephant Vahanam are wearing a fresh look at the temple.

The Serthi Mandapam, where the deity will make His way on the seventh day of the Brahmotsvam and on Panguni Uthiram, has been reconstructed.

Aravamudhan Bhattar’s efforts got a boost with the appointment of a young paricharakar (cook) at Anbil temple. The incumbent was earlier with the Madapalli at the Srirangam temple, the remuneration coming from the TVS Trust. The daily offering to Lord Vadivazhagiya Nambi is also taking a turn to the old times.

Besides expressing their interest in pulling the chariot during Brahmotsavam, the local community and the natives of Anbil have also volunteered to bear the entire Brahmotsavam expenses.

Some lands belonging to the temple have also been recovered in the recent past making the temple financially stronger. Inscriptions at the temple refer to the use of the Chariot in the 11th Century AD during the Chola rule, when lands were donated for the conduct of Brahmotsavam.

Once the Brahmotsavam and the chariot festival are revived, Aravamudhan Bhattar is hopeful of reviving festivals such as pavitrotsavam and dolotsavam.

With the efforts of Aravamudhan Bhattar and the strong support from the local community, people hope that soon the Divyadesam will regain its lost glory.

How to reach: Anbil is located 15 km from Srirangam, near Lalgudi. Express trains bound from Chennai will stop at Lalgudi. Express buses to Lalgudi are available every 15 minutes from Chatram bus stand, Tiruchi.

From Lalgudi, there are frequent mini bus services to Anbil (6 km). In times gone by, devotees used to cross the Coloroon to reach Koviladi Appakudathaan Divyadesam on the Southern side of the river. The temple is open from 7.30 a.m.-12.30 p.m. and 4 p.m.-8 p.m.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/festival-returns-to-anbil/article31049050.ece
260,2020/03/12,Oil palm cultivation to be taken up in 2.78 lakh ha,"The State government has announced its resolve to promote oil palm cultivation in different parts of the State.

The government, after study by experts, has identified 2.78 lakh hectares potential area for oil palm cultivation in 249 mandals spread across 23 districts. Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy told the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. Replying to queries during the Question Hour, the Minister said given the drought situation that was prevailing in the erstwhile united State, oil palm cultivation was considered unfeasible.

But the situation changed significantly since the formation of separate State and a team of experts deputed by the Central government had confirmed that 2.78 lakh hectares land spread in different districts was suitable for taking up oil palm cultivation. The national requirement for edible oil was estimated at 21 million tonne every year while the domestic production was to the tune of around 7 million tonne.

As a result, the country was forced to import the remaining quantum of edible oil that imposed huge costs, approximately ₹75,000 crore, on the ex-chequer. The government had accordingly decided to promote oil palm cultivation as it would ensure returns to farmers.

Farmers would be in a position to secure at least ₹ 16,000 a tonne of oil palm which registered yield of over 20 tonne in every acre. Oil palm was no doubt a long gestation crop, but farmers could opt for intermediate crops that would fetch them income in addition to the assured returns from the main crop.

Going by the potential for oil palm cultivation in Telangana, the Central government had permitted to take up expansion of oil palm in 18,100 ha in the new districts on a pilot basis. In addition to its resistance to pests and other natural calamities like hail storm, oil palm had environmental benefits too because of its high carbon dioxide absorbing nature. The crop would require less water as compared to the water-intensive paddy and it could be cultivated through drip irrigation.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/d0tgpj/article31053418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13OILPALM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/oil-palm-cultivation-to-be-taken-up-in-278-lakh-ha/article31053419.ece
261,2020/03/12,Power engineers oppose add-on report of Dharmadhikari Committee,"The report is completely one-sided and in favour of AP employees, they say

Telangana State Power Engineers Association (TSPEA) has strongly opposed the supplementary report of the Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari Committee to its “final report” on the allocation of State-cadre employees between the power utilities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and said it is “not acceptable” to them under any circumstances.

A meeting of the association chaired by its president P. Ratnakar Rao and secretary P. Sadanandam was held here on Thursday and resolved that they would not allow implementation of the supplementary report stating that it would bring back gross injustice to Telangana employees who were discriminated all through in combined AP. The meeting alleged that the supplementary report of the one-man committee was completely one-sided in favour of AP employees.

Stating that the supplementary report of the one-man committee had once again heaped huge injustice on the Telangana employees, they requested the managements of the power utilities, particularly Chairman and Managing Director of TSGenco and TSTransco D. Prabhakar Rao to take every possible step to do justice them.

The TSPEA engineers pointed out that the “final report” and the “supplementary report” of the one-man committee were in total contradiction and appealed to the managements to take the matter to the notice of the State government. In the event, the AP utilities go ahead and allot the 655 employees back to Telangana, they would obstruct such employees from joining the duties in Telangana, they made it clear.

By allocating all the AP-native employees (1,157) back to Telangana, the Dharmadhikari Committee was forcing the Telangana power utilities into the hands of AP once again as they would hold all key positions if they were allowed to join here, the TSPEA meeting alleged. Besides, it would be a huge financial burden on the Telangana utilities, they said.

Although the one-man committee had allocated 502 employees to Telangana and 655 to AP out of the total of 1,157 AP-native employees, they had kept quiet only with a view to settle issue amicably, the office-bearers said. In addition, the Telangana utilities had also allowed 229 Telangana-native employees allotted to AP without any fuss, they noted.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/r1h8qh/article31053388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12TSPEA-Meeting,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/power-engineers-oppose-add-on-report-of-dharmadhikari-committee/article31053389.ece

Speaking to reporters at the Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Reddy took objection to the language being used against Congress leaders to portray Mr. Revanth in a positive light, and said they too have the wherewithal to counter that.

He said utter lies on some leaders joining the TRS were being circulated on social media platforms by Revanth’s supporters and added that this culture was never seen in Congress. The high command should send a stern warning to contain floating of such information. He said all senior Congress leaders were capable of proving their mettle if a chance to lead the party in Telangana was given but no leader resorts to such practices of defaming others on social media, he said.

263,2020/03/12,Komatireddy meets Sonia Gandhi,"Leads to speculation on TPCC president post

Parliament member from Bhongir and senior Congress leader Komatireddy Venkata Reddy met AICC chief Sonia Gandhi on Thursday even as rumours were rife that the party will soon appoint a new Congress chief for Telangana.

Mr. Venkata Reddy, a veteran Congressman with his roots in the NSUI, is said to have discussed on the present political situation in Telangana and assured the leader that Congress would come back to power in 2023. Mr. Reddy is one of the serious contenders for the PCC chief position whenever the AICC is planning to change the leadership.

His meeting a day after the party appointed new chiefs for the Karnataka and Delhi units assumed significance leading to speculation that his name is being cleared.

During the half-an-hour long meeting, Ms. Gandhi is said to have heard his argument with patience and assured positively to his claim on the top post, according to a close confidant of Mr. Venkata Reddy. He explained his contribution to the party as a NSUI activist and later as Youth Congress leader and finally as MLA and Minister.

“Winning the Bhongir seat after the party lost badly in the Assembly elections showed his strength, character and popularity and that too fighting a tough opponent like the Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekar Rao,” his aide claimed and Ms. Gandhi was well aware of the circumstances in which he won.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/u3ltrz/article31053339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13KOMVEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/komatireddy-meets-sonia-gandhi/article31053340.ece

266,2020/03/12,RTC cargo services by month-end,"Post strike, daily revenue has gone up by ₹1.5 crore: Puvvada Ajay Kumar

Telangana State Road Transport Corporation will be starting cargo services with about 100 bus fleet by March-end, said Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar.

It was one of the several measures proposed to improve the non-traffic revenue and overcome the losses keeping in view the RTC’s fleet and reachability. The number of cargo vehicles would be increased based on demand. They hoped to earn ₹300 crore to ₹400 crore per year through the cargo and parcel services.

Pre-launching works have been initiated to commence the cargo and parcel transport service by the TSRTC, he said responding to questions raised by B Venkateswarulu, Balasani Laxminarayana and V. Gandhadha Goud in the Legislative Council here on Thursday.

He said about 700 to 800 aged buses instead of being condemned would be converted to cargo vehicles by fabricating them suitably. The carrying capacity of each cargo vehicle would be around six to eight tonnes and the number of vehicles would be increased gradually. About 112 RTC employees with degree and post-graduate degrees were selected as marketing executives at the Regional and Depot level for the Cargo and Parcel Transport service and were trained on marketing.

He also told the members that post the 52-day strike by the RTC workers and Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao’s assurance to the employees that government was interested in protecting and making the corporation profitable through reforms and worker friendly service conditions, the employees were working with enthusiasm and their productivity improved. The daily revenue of RTC increased by ₹1.5 crore touching ₹12.5 crore per day and their aim was to touch ₹13 crore. Despite increase in ticket tariff, the occupancy ratio did not come down from 70%. More importantly in the last two months, RTC has been paying salaries to its employees with its own revenue. Chief Minister approved government guarantee for ₹600 crore to pay the employees dues under PF and CCS. He also approved ₹230 crore towards wages for the strike period and it would be disbursed in two to three days.

The Minister said it would take some time to bring the RTC on to a profitable path and requested Members to release amounts from their Constituency Development Funds to improve basic amenities like toilets in bus stands.

267,2020/03/12,1.5 lakh 2 BHK houses to be ready in two months,"The construction of about 1.5 lakh double bedroom houses will be completed in the next two months, said Housing Minister Prashant Reddy.

Telangana government launched the 2BHK houses programme in 2015 and sanctioned 2.83 lakh houses. Of that, tenders were called for two lakh houses and work started for 1.8 lakh houses. So far 40,000 units were completed and 1.5 lakh houses are nearing completion.

Responding to a query raised by Congress member T. Jeevan Reddy in the Legislative Council here on Thursday, Mr. Prashant Reddy said construction of houses was taken up wherever land was available. The houses would be given free of cost to the poor. The Centre’s Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana was linked to the State government’s programme but the guidelines for selection of beneficiaries were different under the Centre’s scheme.

While the State had spent ₹7,800 crore so far on 2BHK houses, Centre sanctioned only ₹1,311 crore. Over 17 per cent of the money was spent while the State share was ₹6,500 crore. The unit cost of 2BHK house was ₹5.04 lakh in rural areas, ₹5.3 lakh in municipalities and ₹7 lakh in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area and the share of Centre for these was 14 per cent, 28 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.

He said the construction of 2BHK houses in rural areas would be speeded up by giving incentives to contractors and an amount of ₹10,500 crore was allocated for the programme in the budget for2020-21. The government would also give financial assistance for one lakh houses if people have their own house sites.

The Minister said that incomplete Indiramma houses in the united State were verified by the Revenue department and two lakh houses were found to be belonging to genuine beneficiaries and funds would be released for their completion.

Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy has asserted that the State had emerged as “seed bowl” of the country contributing a major chunk of national seed requirement every year.

As against the total seed requirement of around 35 lakh tonne annually, Telangana was contributing over 60%, about 22 lakh to 24 lakh tonne, of seed to meet the national requirements. Over 400 national and multinational companies established their bases here setting up processing plants as well as warehouses to store the seed produced here.

Replying to a question during the Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, the Minister said more than 3 lakh farmers were engaged in seed production in over 7 lakh acres in different parts of the State. The work force comprised of 50,000 skilled workers, 2 lakh unskilled and another 50,000 who were working in the allied sectors.

The State had 6 million square feet of warehouses and another 20 million sq.ft of cold storages in addition to Seed Development Corporation and Seed Certification Agency. The State agriculture university was working in active coordination with the national and international research institutions in the cultivation of quality seed that was being exported to other States within the country as well as abroad.

Over 7 lakh tonne of quality paddy seeds worth ₹ 3,200 crore and 8,000 tonne groundnut seed worth ₹ 200 crore were among the chief products that were being exported from the State. The Sona rice produced in the State had earned reputation for its low sugar content and the cotton seed produced in the erstwhile united Mahbubnagar district contributed to one third of the country’s production.

Moreover, all the seed varieties produced in Telangana received OECD certification and the State would soon have a state-of-the-art seed laboratory that was being set up by the ISTA (International Seed Testing Association) at a cost of ₹ 7 crore. Major portion of works on the laboratory were completed and it would be inaugurated soon, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/r15z9m/article31052824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12KRAREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/telangana-is-indias-seed-bowl-minister/article31052825.ece

The State government will soon start the process for recruiting the required number of nurses and technical staff for effective maintenance of intensive care units set up in different parts of the State.

Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the government had resolved to ensure effective healthcare service delivery from the existing hospitals before taking up works on their expansion. He was responding to the requests made by members for enhancement of beds in the ICUs and upgradation of hospitals in their respective districts when the issue came up during the Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.

“The government’s focus will be on strengthening the existing hospitals so that they deliver services more effectively to the needy,” he said. Accordingly, it was decided to put in place necessary infrastructure and facilities in these hospitals and avoid scope for any inconvenience to patients.

The government had set up 22 ICUs in government hospitals since the formation of the State with a one-time expenditure of ₹ 41.12 crore. Of these, six ICUs were set up in tertiary care hospitals at a cost of ₹ 14.4 crore and the remaining 16 ICUs were set up in secondary care hospitals spending ₹ 26.72 crore. The Minister asserted that the government would concentrate on setting up new centres in the areas that had not been covered so far and then take up expansion of the existing hospitals.

To another question, the Minister said 45 dialysis centres were functioning in different parts of the State and 20 of these had been set up in the district hospitals under the control of Telangana Vaidya Vidhana Parishad.

270,2020/03/12,Retired employees want a say in new Revenue Act,"Govt. urged to consult the experienced employees before bringing in the legislation

Telangana State Retired Revenue Employees Welfare Association has urged the State government to consult the members over its proposal to amend the existing Revenue Act and introduce the new Revenue Code.

The core committee of Association met here under the chairmanship of K. Lakshmaiah and resolved that the government should not take any hasty decision without consulting the experienced retired Revenue employees as there were many issues related to tenancy, Inam, assigned, endowment , land ceiling and Bhoodan lands. Several cases were pending in the courts. Thus government should set up Revenue Tribunals first for resolving them.

Even the issues related to pattadar passbooks uploaded in ‘Dharani’ website were not resolved. At least 15 per cent of people were still awaiting resolution of disputed data in their passbooks.

The committee said that as the State government had taken up land record updation programme without taking up re-survey of lands that had not been taken up for the last 75 years. Thus the same land issues and disputes continued to persist. It also said the proposal of the government to do away with government surveyors and give licences to private surveyors was not justifiable. It was not proper to do away with the surveyors set-up in the government because of some erring persons. Instead action should be taken against the corrupt by gathering data related to them.

The committee said they had been reading in newspapers that the government proposed to bring the existing 145 land related laws under the Revenue Code but it was not clear who were examining them and what was their competence. Government should examine all the above issues and take decisions that would be fair and acceptable to the general public.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/retired-employees-want-a-say-in-new-revenue-act/article31052510.ece

TRS Parliamentary Party leader K. Keshav Rao has been renominated to the Rajya Sabha as TRS candidate and it has also named former Speaker of the Assembly in the combined Andhra Pradesh K.R. Suresh Reddy for the second seat to be vacated.

Both candidates will file their nomination papers on Friday and will, in all likelihood, be elected given the strength of the TRS members in the Assembly.

For Mr. Suresh Reddy, it was a promise fulfilled by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, when the latter joined the TRS just before the Assembly elections, giving a shock to the Congress.

It was expected then that he would be given the TRS ticket from Armoor in Nizamabad district. However, KCR had decided to renominate all the sitting MLAs except a few, thus denying a chance to Mr. Suresh Reddy.

Sources said what clinched the decision in favour of Mr. Suresh Reddy was his reluctance for a nomination to the Legislative Council as he was a Speaker of the Assembly earlier. Support for him from all the MLAs from Nizamabad district, including Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, also seemed to have cleared his case.

KCR, along with Nizamabad MLAs, met the Speaker in his chambers, apparently to inform the decision to nominate Mr. Suresh Reddy. The two candidates were later called to the Pragati Bhavan where they met the Chief Minister and the names were officially revealed. Both nominees thanked the Chief Minister for the opportunity.

Interestingly, only the names of Mr. Keshav Rao and Mr Damodar Rao were doing the rounds till afternoon when the Chief Minister was in the Assembly. Several senior leaders and hopefuls came to the Assembly to impress upon the Chief Minister to consider their names as well in a last-ditch effort.

Former Mahabubabad MP Seetaram Naik was hopeful to be considered, stating that the CM had always considered him a family member. Another name that was in circulation till the last minute was former Khammam MP, Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy. He was denied ticket in the Lok Sabha elections and apparently was assured of better opportunities.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trs-nominates-suresh-reddy-to-rs/article31052219.ece
272,2020/03/12,"HC seeks report on hoarding of sanitisers, masks","Govt. machinery geared to contain the spread of the virus: AG

The Telangana High Court on Thursday asked the State government to file a report on persons hoarding sanitisers and face masks in the State in the backdrop of COVID-19 scare.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing a PIL plea on the spread of coronavirus in the State, also sought to know what action the government had taken against such persons. Referring to earlier suggestions to emulate the Kerala government model in tackling COVID-19, the bench asked the government what best practices of Kerala government were being duplicated here in Telangana.

Assistant Solicitor General N. Rajeshwar Rao informed the court that 44 cases of COVID-19 positive had been reported in different parts of the country by March 11. The Centre had already invoked the Disaster Management Act that empowered the State governments to take assistance of private and independent laboratories to check coronavirus.

Advocate General B.S. Prasad told the court that more centres to test samples of persons suspected to have contacted the virus were being set up in the State. The one established in Osmania General Hospital would commence on Friday. The other two being opened at MGH hospital in Warangal and Fever hospital in Hyderabad would begin working from March 20.

Dr. Shankar, Director of Institute of Preventive Medicine, informed the bench that, all the new testing centres put together, 500 samples could be tested in a single day. Presenting a note on the measures taken by the Telangana government to check COVID-19, the AG said the government machinery was geared to contain further spread of the virus. Expressing satisfaction over the government’s action plan, the bench hoped the government would continue the efforts.

Stressing the need to take all possible preventive measures to control COVID-19, the bench pointed out that World Health Organisation had already declared that coronavirus had spread to 73 countries. Even panic situation was prevailing in USA, the bench said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-seeks-report-on-hoarding-of-sanitisers-masks/article31051670.ece
273,2020/03/12,IOC launches work on terminal in Malkapur,"The ₹611-cr facility is a crucial component of Paradip-Hyderabad pipeline project

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has launched work on a new petroleum product terminal in Malkapur, near here, that, on commissioning, will help it pump more products into the Telangana market.

A crucial component of the ₹3,800-crore cross-country Paradip-Hyderabad pipeline project that the oil company is implementing, the terminal at Malkapur, in Nalgonda district, will have a storage capacity of 180,000 kilo litres. It is estimated to entail an investment of ₹611 crore.

“We are through with all approvals, licences,” Executive Director and State Head of Indian Oil Corporation for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh R. Sravan S.Rao said in response to a query on whether land conversion approval that was taking time had been received for the terminal. He expected work on the terminal to get over in 18-24 months.

For the over 1,200-km pipeline, this, however, would mean a wait until such time to become operational in Telangana, a State where it will run for around 150 km. The product terminal in Malkapur will be the terminating point of the pipeline.

Mr. Rao, who addressed media here on Wednesday, said the Paradip-Hyderabad pipeline was nearing completion.

“Most of the pipeline has been constructed, except a few metres here and there,” he said, adding the plan for now was to bring products up to Vijayawada.

From Paradip, where IOC has a 15-million-tonne refinery, to Hyderabad, the pipeline will connect Berhampur in Odisha, Achyutapuram near Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry and Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, before reaching Malkapur.

The pipeline, with a capacity to handle 4.5 million tonnes, will traverse through 16 districts in the three States.

At present, the major product input for IOC in Telangana is through the Vizag-Vijayawada- Secunderabad Pipeline (VVSPL) for white oil products – petrol, diesel, kerosene and Aviation Turbine Fuel.

The company caters to the Telangana market through a terminal in Cherlapally, a bulk depot in Ramagundam and a network of over 1,100 petrol pumps.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ioc-launches-work-on-terminal-in-malkapur/article31050266.ece
274,2020/03/12,Revanth emerges target of Congress leaders,"Race for PCC president post hots up in Telangana

Change in the Telangana Congress leadership issue has gained steam with the appointment of D.K. Shiva Kumar as Karnataka PCC president and also its popular leader Jyothiraditya Scindia leaving the party to join the BJP.

Expecting change in Telangana as well in the near future, those in the race are trying to outsmart each other. Interestingly, Malkajgiri MP, A. Revanth Reddy, who has been in the forefront along with a few others for the top post seem to be emerging as the target.

The Parliament member is in jail now on charges of using drone to take visuals of IT Minister and TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao’s farm house in Janwada in alleged violation of GO 111. He was arrested after he took media personnel alleging that the construction was in violation of GO 111.

Despite being in jail for the last few days, no Congress leader has visited him and in fact have accused him of settling ‘personal’ scores with KTR. All top leaders remained silent except issuing statements against his arrest on the first day.

Former Rajya Sabha MP, V. Hanmantha Rao went further ahead alleging Revanth Reddy was using the party to target KTR’s farm house rather than responding to allegations against him in a land case in Gopanpally. How can he accuse only KTR of violating the norms, he asked and He claimed that there are several Congress leaders as well who have constructed farm houses in the catchment area of Gandipet lake.

Sangareddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy, found fault with followers of Revanth Reddy projecting him as the PCC chief linking his fight against the GO 111. He demanded that any agitation on State level issues by the Congress leaders should be discussed in the core committee first.

In fact, he wanted the TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and AICC in-charge for Telangana, R.K. Khuntia to call for the core committee meeting immediately to discuss not only the GO 111 but also leadership issue. No one is above the party in Congress and the ‘nuisance’ created by Revanth’s followers on social media was in fact, harming the party.

Followers of Revanth Reddy, however, say some leaders who were afraid of the growing popularity of their leader were nervous and unnecessarily targeting him.

A senior leader and staunch supporter of Revanth Reddy said criticism was unfair. He had taken up a burning issue and it should have been widely used to target the government but unfortunately differences within Congress had put the real issue on the back burner.

The Malakajgiri MP had also taken up a massive contact programme in his constituency to highlight the government’s failure to allot the promised double bedroom houses even after six years. It was a parallel programme to ‘Pattana Pragathi’ of the government that wanted to reach out to all the towns and cities after the ‘Palle Pragathi’ programme.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tu5am3/article31044573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY12REVANTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/revanth-emerges-target-of-congress-leaders/article31044574.ece
275,2020/03/12,Bandi Sanjay is new Telangana BJP president,"Communication received from JP Nadda

Karimanagar MP Bandi Sanjay, elected for first time, has been appointed as the new president of Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday. A communication to this effect was received by the party here from the national president J.P. Nadda, conveyed through the national general secretary Arun Singh.

Incumbent president K. Laxman, who was widely tipped to get a second term, was quick to congratulate his successor and wished that the party will emerge stronger and counter the TRS government. Union Minister of State for Home and Secunderabad MP G. Kishan Reddy too congratulated Mr. Sanjay on his appointment.

Although several names were being floated around in the last couple of months over the new chief for TS, the choice had narrowed down to Mr. Laxman and Mr. Sanjay, incidentally both belong to the same backward caste of Munnuru Kapus.

The Karimnagar MP’s strong link to the Rastriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and his decisive victory in the parliamentary polls in a region considered a stronghold of the Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS) brought him into immediate limelight. Another party veteran Ch. Vidyasagar Rao had earlier won from this constituency but it was in alliance with the Telugu Desam.

Other newly elected MP from Nizamabad D. Aravind too catapulted to fame for having defeated Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s daughter K. Kavita but he was a relative newcomer into the party. Mr. Sanjay’s candidature was more or less firmed up during the recent meeting of the party leaders at a private function of a top party functionary in Delhi recently, according to party sources.

Traditionally, BJP has seen city bred leaders like Bandaru Dattatreya, G. Kishan Reddy, K. Laxman and others holding the top office. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how a person, who has been generally confined to Karimnagar where he has been a corporator and lost narrowly during the Legislative Assembly polls, will measure up to the challenges ahead considering that the party claims to be the ‘natural alternative’ to TRS.

Rising from the ranks

Mr Bandi Sanjay Kumar was thrice municipal corporator from Karimnagar and contested for the Karimnagar Assembly segment in 2014 and 2018 elections and lost to the TRS candidate Gangula Kamalakar. In 2018 Assembly elections, Sanjay secured 66,009 votes from Karimnagar Assembly segment, which was the highest vote secured by BJP contestants in entire the state.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ophuhq/article31044520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11BANDISANJAY-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bandi-sanjay-is-new-telangana-bjp-president/article31044521.ece
276,2020/03/12,Focus on cultivation of paddy with less water,"The State government is focused on various technological interventions in water management for paddy cultivation and reduce water input, enhance water productivity and gain yield, said Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy. Responding to a query by T. Chinnapa Reddy in the Legislative Council here on Wednesday, Mr. Niranjan Reddy said that the Agriculture University and department were exploring better ways to produce more paddy with less utilisation of irrigated water. He said every year the extent of cultivation of paddy was increasing with 48 lakh acres in Kharif and 38 lakh acres now under Rabi season. After formation of Telangana, the Agriculture university promoted paddy varieties with 120-day crop duration instead of 150 days. The saving of one month in paddy cultivation resulted in saving of water and mandays, thus bringing down investment.

Once Kaleswaram and other irrigation projects were completed, the government’s aim was to utilise surface water, keeping the groundwater table intact. Further varieties suitable to less irrigation input and drought tolerant with reasonable yield potential were also in evolving stage. Research in developing high yield potential rice hybrids suitable to the State was undergoing, he said.

He said that alternate wetting and drying water management in rice was being promoted in ground water and canal commands of erstwhile districts of Telangana — Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Warangal, Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda, Khammam, Ranga Reddy and Medak which saved nearly 35 per cent of water input in rice compared to low land flood irrigation.

Mr. Reddy said with climate smart and water resilient production practice, the water usage to produce one kg of paddy with State’s average productivity of seven tonnes per hectare now ranged between 1,200 to 2,500 litres under different production systems as per the recent studies. He also said in China the water usage was 1,321 litres per kg of paddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/asc4cs/article31044500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY12PYDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/focus-on-cultivation-of-paddy-with-less-water/article31044501.ece
277,2020/03/12,State govt. to launch Health Profile soon,"Telangana has a proposal to launch State Health Profile during the financial year 2020-21 and the modalities are being worked out, said Health Minister Eatala Rajender.

Responding to a query in the Legislative Council here on Wednesday, Mr. Rajender said that there was a proposal to start in Chintamadaka, Gajwel and expand it to the entire State. The department was collecting information from other countries and implement it in the best possible manner. He said the government had already screened 1.54 crore people for vision defects under ‘Kanti Velugu’ programme and 40 lakh were given eyeglasses. Emphasising the importance of State Health Profile at a time when 60 per cent of deaths were due to non-communicable diseases triggered by hypertension, diabetes like cardiovascular and kidney diseases, the Health Minister said the State was focused on taking up promotional, preventive and curative health activities in rural areas. He also said that government hospitals would be strengthened to cater to poor people along with increasing Basti Dawakhanas. Health screening programmes would reduce medical expenditure for the government and people.

Members B. Venkateswarulu, Gangadhara Goud, Pochampally Srinivas Reddy, Balasani Laxminarayana and Narisi Reddy said the State Health Profile programme should be taken up at the earliest for a healthy Telangana. Responding to another query, Mr. Rajender said more dialysis centres and machines would be provided so that people need not wait for hours for dialysis. The government was spending ₹1.8 lakh on dialysis every year and 10,000 patients were availing the facility. More nephrologists would also be appointed, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-govt-to-launch-health-profile-soon/article31044491.ece
278,2020/03/12,"₹ 1.82 lakh crore budget outlay is delusional, says BJP","State not able to spend 75 to 80% of estimated budget expenditure in last few years: Ramachandra Rao

The State budget for 2020-21 with an outlay of ₹1.82 lakh crore without showing the sources of revenue fails to convince and appears to be an attempt to keep people in delusion, BJP member N. Ramachandra Rao said in the Legislative Council.

Initiating the general discussion on the Budget for 2020-21 in the Council, Mr. Rao said despite the general slowdown in the economy, the State government increased the budget for the next year by ₹40,000 crore over that of current fiscal. Moreover, when the State was not able to spend between 75 to 80 per cent of the estimated budget expenditure in the last three to four years, projecting a huge budget outlay only indicated fudging. In comparison, the Union government spent 100 per cent and even more of the estimated expenditure, he claimed.

The Budget statement did not spell out how the deficit would be made good. Of ₹1.82 lakh crore outlay, revenue resources were shown only for ₹1.4 lakh crore and the remaining ₹40,000 crore would have to be raised from outside, he said.

While the Finance Minister said that the per capita income in the State was over ₹2 lakh and increased almost four times over that of 2014, it was a fact that the per capita debt was also increasing steeply, touching about ₹90,000. “We are not convinced about the per capita income and allocations for various sectors,” he added.

He also pointed out that of the estimated ₹40,000 crore for capital expenditure and development works, ₹10,000 crore would be for Mission Bhagiratha alone. “We have our own doubts how the government would take up remaining infrastructure works like roads, bridges etc., with mere ₹30,000 crore.

While the revenue receipts were shown as ₹ 89,000 crore, it will have to pay interest from this on borrowings of ₹22,000 crore. There was a need to balance the expenditure on welfare and development spend.

Mr. Ramachandra Rao said ₹10,000 crore for Hyderabad infrastructure including Musi waterfront development was barely adequate. There was no mention on work done on Musi project so far while lakes in the city were in total neglect. It was some NGOs who were doing their bit to conserve some lakes. Metro, MMTS, SRDP projects needed to be speeded up to ease traffic congestion. State failed to allot its share of funds to take up MMTS used by many people for local travel. The allocations for education and health sectors were poor, particularly to fill vacancies in schools, colleges and universities and improve facilities in existing government hospitals. The government did not announce the schedule for filling the promised 1.07 lakh vacant government jobs six years ago.

Eatala refutes claim

Health Minister Eatala Rajender who was Finance Minister in the last term of TRS government refuted the allegation of the BJP member N. Ramachandra Rao that the State was only spending 75 to 80 per cent of estimated budget expenditure.

Intervening in the general discussion on Budget in the Legislative Council here on Wednesday, Mr. Rajender said the government spent 95 per cent of estimated expenditure in 2019-20 as the Chief Minister insisted on practical budget. The government would have spent 100 per cent, but for the cut in tax devolution to the State by the Centre, he said.

The Union government had released ₹2,000 crore less than the indicated amount and tax devolution was brought down to the State from 2.347 per cent to 2.113 per cent, he said.

On employment opportunities, he said IT sector itself generated seven lakh jobs and its software exports had doubled. In agriculture sector, there was shortage of workers as people found jobs in the service sector.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/182-lakh-crore-budget-outlay-is-delusional-says-bjp/article31044467.ece

The State government has asserted that steps had been initiated to fill posts in the residential schools opened for catering to underprivileged sections and minorities across the State.

Social Welfare Minister Koppula Eshwar said the residential schools were equipped with all facilities and measures had been put in place to see that there were no shortcomings in the management of these institutions. In addition to ensuring significant increase in the budgetary allocations to these institutions, the government had taken steps for the healthcare of more than 4 lakh students enrolled in these schools. Steps are underway to prepare health profile of students in the residential schools. The Minister was replying to queries during Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. He said the government had set up 602 residential institutions catering to the needs of backward classes, scheduled castes and tribes and minorities since it took over the reins. The government was and incurring an average of ₹ 50,686 on each student studying in the residential institutions every year and teaching and non-teaching staff had been recruited on a large scale to impart education to these students.

As a result of the government’s efforts, the residential institutions were providing quality education to students on a par with the corporate schools and this could be seen from the achievements made by the students in different fields. When asked about the variation in the costs incurred for each students in some areas, he said the difference was on account of the schools that were operating from rental premises.

₹ 4,572 cr spent

BC Welfare Minister Gangula Kamalakar informed the Assembly that the government had spent ₹ 4,572.97 crore towards Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak schemes in the past six years and over In all, over 6.1 lakh families were benefited from the schemes.under the scheme so far with the 2.41 lakh families hailing from the BC communities topping the list.

TRS member Ajmeera Rekha Naik expressed concern that there were complaints on delayed release of funds earmarked under Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak schemes and urged the government to ensure timely release of funds.

Development of roads

Roads and Buildings Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy said the State government has started works on strengthening road network of over 7,450 km in the past few years with an estimated ₹ 11,257 crore. Works on 5,453 km road stretches had been completed with an expenditure of around ₹ 10,000 crore so far and works on the remaining stretches were fast-tracked for early completion.

Cases relating to illegally constructed buildings, pending in civil courts and the High Court, would be designated as special category for quicker disposal, the Telangana High Court said on Wednesday.

A Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing a couple of PIL petitions on illegal buildings in the city, directed the HC Registrar General to notify to all lower courts about the Bench’s resolve to adjudicate such cases earlier.

GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar, who appeared before the Bench about a PIL plea relating to polluting industries at Shastripuram, was asked by the Bench to stay back for the hearing of petitions on illegal buildings.

Out of the 10,600 buildings, the GHMC had demolished 3,400 buildings. But the authorities were helpless with regard to 2,200 structures as their owners approached civil courts and secured orders against demolition. In case of 2,400 more buildings, the owners approached the High Court and got restraint orders.

The index (first) case got admitted to Gandhi Hospital on March 1 where he was diagnosed with viral pneumonia and his sample tested positive for COVID-19 the following day. After six days of treatment, he tested negative for the virus.

As per guidelines, a patient can be discharged only if he/she tests negative for the virus in two consecutive tests. “He has tested negative twice. We will discharge him depending on his situation.

289,2020/03/12,Cultural treat at Lamakaan as it turns 10,"Talks, plays, music concerts and qawwali lined up to celebrate the milestone

The artsy Hyderabadi café that has redefined cultural spaces in the city has completed a decade of its existence. Lamakaan, just off Road No. 1 Banjara Hills, with its two-levels of seating space, a balcony, an alcove under a rock, a fixed stage, and a customisable seating arrangement is celebrating its 10th anniversary.

To mark the milestone, the line-up of talks, plays, music concerts, mime artistry and qawwali shows planning as well as serendipity going for it. “We have been in talks with T.M. Krishna (Carnatic vocalist) for performing here and he agreed. Luckily, Irshad Panjatan (mime artiste) was travelling from Germany to India for a shoot in Mumbai and he is going to perform. Sachin Pilgaonkar and Javed Jaffery (actors) confirmed their participation just two weeks ago after which we sent out the posters,” says Farhan Ashhar, founder of Lamakaan.

It is Mr. Ashhar with his wife Humeira; and friends Biju Matthew and Elahe Hiptoola who have turned a house on a rock into a free cultural space that rocks.

While some swear by the samosas, others swear by the chai or the Hyderabadi khatti dal, while for others it is the space to get a quick bite that’s easy on the pocket. In the process, Lamakaan has become a hub for cultural activities. “The intersection that we were expecting has not happened. Music, theatre, culture and heritage events take place but they remain in their silos. They have not spilled over or triggered a wider resonance in society,” says Mr. Ashhar as he reminisces the kind of niche the space has created.

But the 10-year journey has not been all hunky dory. There have been police complaints, complaints about parking and about youngsters walking on the roads. One GHMC official served a closure notice as well.

“We have had an existential challenge. Neighbours complained about the Queer Fest, police had to send reinforcements when two girls came to speak here, there have been complaints about anti-national activities from conservative quarters,” says Mr. Ashhar adding that they are open to ideas about reinventing itself for another era.

290,2020/03/12,Kanyakumari goes by rasikas’ choice,"Kanyakumari bowed to the wishes of the audience to present a concert with a touch of novelty

The violin concert of A. Kanyakumari for Nayaki at Abhirami Hall, Kotturpuram, had all the necessary features to make a concert engaging, entertaining and also exciting.

Kanyakumari to a great extent presented this concert as Listeners’ Choice. After the Sriraga varnam, she asked the audience to choose a raga from among a few she suggested. The rasikas fell in favour of Tilang. Kanyakumari came up with an exquisite sketch of the raga before taking up ‘Sri Ganesha Charanam’ by Papanasam Sivan, appending it with a lively swara exchange with her disciple L. Ramakrishna. Charukesi, that fluid and melodious raga known for its poignant overtones, was detailed with the focus on all these qualities, creating a serene ambience.

Obliging the audience, she played Swati Tirunal’s ‘Krupaya Palaya,’ which came with gimmick-free swarakalpana.

The alapana and tanam of Bhairavi — again audience choice — carried the bright and sober shades of Bhairavi. Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Balagopala’ was the composition. The energetic swaraprasthara gained extraordinary momentum as Kanyakumari set to create an upsurge of ragas as ragamalika swaras. So there were Sahana, Chakravaham, Kapi, Hindolam and Kalyani. The swara exercises came as a deluge of swaras in the form of a musical medley with panache. Kanyakumari gave each raga a substantial slice and returning to Bhairavi after each raga both in the ascending and descending order.

The concert was exciting because Kanyakumari played rare kritis in colourful ragas — ‘Rara Mayintidhaaka’ in Asaveri (Tyagaraja), ‘Jagajjanani’ in Ratipatipriya (Ghanam Krishna Iyer), ‘Annapoorne’ in Sama (Dikshitar), ‘Mara Vairi Ramani’ in Nasikabhooshani (Tyagaraja), ‘Raakaa Sashivadhana’ in Takka (Tyagaraja). The novelty of this concert was also on the rhythmic side, it was K. Sekhar on thavil in place of mridangam and B.S. Purushotham on the ganjira. The thavil did overpower the violin initially, but Sekhar sobered down as the concert progressed. The crisp and rhythmic finale he provided to each kriti was a novel touch. Veteran Purushotham with his low-key ganjira was an apt foil to Sekar during thani avarthanam.

L. Ramakrishna toed the line of his guru with reverence but added charm in the raga essays and swaraprastharas with his ingenuity.

The tail-end pieces included ‘Krishna Ni Begane’ in Yamunakalyani (Vyasaraya), ‘Koovi Azhaithal’ in Valaji (Valee) and a composition of Annamacharya set in the raga Seshadri, conceived by Kanyakumari.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hpb6kv/article31049396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13FRKANYA3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kanyakumari-goes-by-rasikas-choice/article31049397.ece

292,2020/03/12,"Most of my songs talk about relationships, says artiste Sanoli Chowdhury","The singer-songwriter-producer released her third EP, ‘It’s All a Monotonous Game’, recently

It was while listening to her father’s collection of rock ‘n’ roll as a child, that singer-songwriter-producer Sanoli Chowdhury knew she wanted to play the guitar. Even though her instructor suggested she learn piano first, she stuck to her guns and at seven years old, started learning the instrument of her choice.

“Then, when I was around 18 or 19, I started using Logic Pro X software (digital audio workstation). Just experimenting with it and seeing what I could do. The more you get used to it, you understand how it works. It was a natural thing to start writing songs as well and I started posting the songs on SoundCloud,” says the soft-spoken Sanoli.

Around a year-and-a-half-ago, Sanoli, who is based in Bengaluru, was discovered by Rana Ghose, founder of REProduce Artists and is now signed to London-based management agency, United Sound Entertainment.

Cut to 2020 and the 21-one-year-old, who is studying in Christ University, already has three EPs under her belt. The first one was titled The Futile Search for Elegance, the second Impermanent Warmth and the latest EP, It’s All a Monotonous Game, which was mastered at Black Saloon Studios in London. If the titles seem a little pessimistic (she supplies the word), it is because they are. “I am kind of a pessimistic person. But I don’t really think about the titles; I just go with the flow. Even with the third EP, I was talking to one of my friends about relationships and people and I just happened to say it’s all a monotonous game and then I thought ‘okay, I can use this’.”

As for the five songs on the latest EP, Sanoli says that she chose the ones that she thought were her best work.

“It so happened that they talked about similar things. I feel like most of my songs talk about people and relationships of any sort, whether partner or friend. The more experiences I have with people, good or bad, the more I have to write about. I’m not the kind of person who interacts with people a lot. When I do have an interaction or if I become close to someone, it becomes a spectacular thing, regardless of what kind of relationship it is. So, when it goes downhill from there, I think it’s just easier for me to express it through music.”

Of the tracks, ‘Voice Notes Sent By You’ has an experimental sound, consisting of actual voice notes she has received.

“I was listening to a lot of lo-fi music at that point and I wanted to create something like that. A lot of lo-fi has the element of people talking. My friends and I exchange voice notes so I clipped out random things they have sent me over the years and put it in the song.”

Though, of course, she sings, Sanoli, whose speaking and singing voices are markedly different, says: “Usually, the first compliment I receive is something to do with my singing and everything else is ignored. It used to bother me at one point.”

She adds, “Every time I think about playing live shows, which I assume I have to do it at some point, it sort of freaks me out because I’m not sure how I’m going to do it. It’s always been easier to sit in front of your laptop screen and not be conscious of these things.”

293,2020/03/12,Return of the Intronaut,"The progressive metal band’s concert for Bangalore Open Air is rescheduled

It is about a 20-hour sojourn in the air from Los Angeles to Bengaluru and it trips out guitarist and vocalist Sacha Dunable that they have travelled to “the other side of the planet” a couple of times already. Leading progressive metal band Intronaut, who were supposed to perform at Bangalore Open Air on March 21 at Yelahanka.

But, Bangalore Open Air announced on Wednesday afternoon that it was postponing the festival to sometime in the summer of 2020 owing to “concerns over the spread of Covid-19”. Bands including Intronaut, Kalmah and The Down Troddence were on the line-up. Owing to directives from the Bureau of Immigration, visas were suspended for two of the artistes scheduled to perform at the metal festival on March 21 — headliners Marduk (since their drummer is a German citizen) and German metal band Beyond the Black. A statement released on social media by the organisers added, “This is not a cancellation but a re-scheduling of the festival. All existing tickets will be valid for the new festival date in 2020 that will be announced as per the government’s directive and post consultation (sic) with the relevant authorities”.

About their concert here, Dunable says, “It is always a real trip going there. Every time we go, we hang out with so many nice people and it does not feel that foreign. We are walking around and see a cow in the street. I think that is pretty interesting.”

The band – known for its highly technical brand of metal that is layered with psychedelic intent – first visited India in 2009 for a couple of shows. This was followed by a more recent performance in Bengaluru itself in 2017. It was a treat to the ears of anyone who digs heavy music to see Intronaut launch explosive songs such as ‘Fast Worms’ in 2017, but their show at a college festival was momentarily disrupted by a busted guitar amplifier. Dunable recounts the issue when reminded, but says that malfunctioning gear is an issue all over the world. “It is not like, ‘Oh India with their broken guitar amps!’ I mean, that has happened in Mexico, and in America. That is not that big a deal.”

Intronaut is coming down all the way just for one show – which allows Dunable to joke about the situation, “It is like we are in the air. We are in the air for longer than we are in the country.” But they are arriving with their latest record Fluid Existential Inversions, released on February 28 via America’s longstanding label Metal Blade. It features crushing rhythmic patterns and near-unpredictable guitar work, along with vocals that range from growls to fervent pleas. The song titles (‘Pangloss’, ‘Cubensis’, ‘Contrapasso’) itself carry forward Intronaut’s verbosity, which Dunable says comes from fellow guitarist David Timnick. “Dave writes most of the lyrics and comes up with just the overall written content. And he and Joe (Lester, bassist) are really well-read. Plus, we are all well-travelled, so I think that he picks up a lot of stuff from books he reads or stuff like that.”

Fluid Existential Inversions marked their first release since 2015’s The Direction of Last Things. By the time Intronaut were three years into promoting their previous album, Dunable says it was time to step off the cycle, even if just to rest. He says about the time the decade that Intronaut spent pushing themselves into writing, recording and releasing material, followed by regular touring, “It is fun, we still enjoy it but then you finish these tours and come back and people are like, ‘Can you make your next record?’ We say, yes, because we want to make another record. It is not like we are slaves to the record company or something. But we were kind of going super hard for over 10 years.”

Even now, Dunable says they are coming back into it – in the midst of their first US tour before they fly to Bengaluru, but with enough caution to not repeat exhaustion. “We are not really committing to too much travelling and performing and stuff. There is just no reason to burn ourselves out again,” the guitarist adds.

The last time they were here, they did get to spend a full day in the city, but Dunable’s not so sure of the plan this time. “I would love to have an excuse to stay longer,” he says. As for their set-list at Bangalore Open Air, Dunable promises new material as well as the charged up well-known songs. “We’ll bring it for you and we’ll play as much as we can.”

294,2020/03/12,Lively performance,"While renowned violinists Parur M.A. Sundareshwaran and Parur M.A. Krishnaswamy showed their class, young vocalist Bhavya Hari impressed with her training at different Carnatic concerts in Delhi

On the second day of the two-day event “Swar Sangam”, organised by the Gurukulam Foundation at the auditorium of the Delhi Tamil Sangam, renowned violinists Parur M.A. Sundareshwaran and Parur M.A. Krishnaswamy were featured in a violin duet concert.

Sundareshwaran and Krishnaswamy started their concert by rendering the Navaragamalika varnam in a delightful manner. Mysore Vasudevachar’s “Pranamamyaham Shree” in Gowla that the brothers took up subsequently with Kalpanaswaras kept their rendering lively. Tyagaraja’s “Chinna nade na” in Kalanidhi underwent fine treatment in the hands of the siblings.

The brothers took up Muthuswami Dikshidar’s “Seshachalanayakam” in Varali, Tyagaraja’s “Chaala kallaladu” (Arabhi) and “O Ragasayee” (Khambhoji) for detailed renditions. The siblings delineated these ragas in turns in a delightful manner. They also took up a phrase in the Varali song for neraval. This and the kalpanaswaras for all the three songs were equally delightful.

Thiruvarur Bhakthavathsalam, the veteran mridangam artiste, who has decades of experience in this field, including lending mridangam support to legendary musicians of yesteryears, provided spirited and riveting percussion support alongside Suresh Vaidyanathan on the ghatam. Suresh, also an experienced artiste, combined his skills elegantly with that of the veteran. The percussion duo’s accompaniment, including their enthralling tani avartanam (in adi tala) was a rewarding experience. However, the high amplification provided to the percussion instruments could have been reduced for a better listening pleasure.

In another concert organised recently by the India International Centre and the Ramakrishnapuram South Indian Society at the former’s premises, the Chennai-based youngster Bhavya Hari put her best foot forward and gave an impressive vocal recital on the first day of the two-day Purandaradasa Tyagaraja Music Festival. This was Bhavya’s maiden concert in the Capital.

Except for the opening varnam (a neatly presented one which was indicative of the musical talents of the vocalist even at that initial stage) and the concluding pieces in the miscellaneous session, Bhavya structured her vocal concert based on the compositions of Purandara Dasa and Tyagaraja. Endowed with a good voice and traversing quite comfortably in lower as well as higher octaves, Bhavya’s recital was tilted towards the latter composer. Though she interwove her creative talent in both the compositions of Purandara Dasa, namely “Innu daya Bharathe” in Kalyana Vasantham and “Yare Rangana” in Hindolam, the scintillating raga alpana that preceded the former song stood out than the Kalpanaswaras that she suffixed for the latter song. While rendering these songs, she brought out the emotive contents of the lyrics to the fore.

As regards Tyagaraja’s compositions, Bhavya not only selected them intelligently but also sang aesthetically to the delight of the music lovers. Of them, she took up “Shambho Mahadeva” in Pantuvarali, “Adamodi galade” in Charukesi and “O Rangasayee” in Khambhoji for detailed presentations.

295,2020/03/12,Coronavirus | Homestays gear up for hard times,"COVID-19 scaring away tourists

Homestays in the district are staring at a bleak prospect with the outbreak of COVID-19 taking a toll on the tourism and hospitality industries.

The pandemic could not have run roughshod over the homestay business at a more inopportune time as they had only just about recovered from the serious blows dealt in quick succession since 2018 by the deluge followed by the outbreak of Nipah and another flood last August.

“The future hardly looks bright though mixed fortunes appear to be in store for homestays in the district. Usually, homestays record 70% occupancy during March. But this time it has gone down for majority of homestays with the future bookings not looking that bright either though it is not as bleak as during the 2018 deluge,” said M.P. Sivadattan, director, Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society.

Bookings suspended

With bookings online and through travel agencies remaining largely suspended till the month-end, the over 100 classified homestays, out of which 60-odd were in Fort Kochi, and over 300 unclassified homestays, catering mostly to Europeans, may have more bad news in the store.

“Our business is now largely restricted to a four-month window between December and March. Usually, the rooms are full till the end of March. However, this time the business started affecting since February with the outbreak of COVID-19 and March seems as good as lost now,” said Johnson Cletus who runs a homestay at Fort Kochi where only two out of the six rooms are occupied now.

Revenues hit

He claimed that the revenues have been so seriously hurt that it would be hard to pay the staff and utility bills.

Sunil Babu, another homestay operator at Fort Kochi, said that to be on the safer side he voluntarily chose to block all bookings till May 31.

“I don’t want to needlessly subject my family to risk with the disease fast spreading,” said Mr. Babu who started the homestay at Fort Kochi three years back to supplement his income from his workshop.

Ashley Edwin Philip sounded an exception among the homestay operators as he didn’t notice any perceptible dip in business even as all his six rooms in offer remain occupied.

The two rituals will be held without much fanfare. Devotees will be allowed to offer prayers, but there will be no ‘Annadanam’ (food offering), he said. Major poorams, including Arattupuzha and Thrissur poorams, are scheduled to be held in April and May.

A decision on organising them will be taken after reviewing the emerging situation, Mr. Mohanan added.

Though the Arattupuzha Pooram is held on April 5, festivals at 23 temples under the Devaswom were slated to begin from March 28. Here too, rituals will be held in accordance with the customary practices.

The expenses of each festival range between ₹3 lakh and ₹9 lakh, he said.

Flood appeals

Meanwhile, the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) has suspended filing of flood-related appeals at its office till March 31. The appeals will be collected during the working days of April. The authority has also postponed its adalats.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/4qu3mk/article31044649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-POORAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/temple-festivals-adalats-suspended/article31044650.ece
298,2020/03/12,COVID-19: healthcare team in need of reinforcement,"Authorities considering requesting services of staffers from other districts

The number of healthcare personnel in the district may fall short of requirement in case of a spike in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Accordingly, the authorities are considering requesting services of staffers from other districts, said sources in the Health Department.

The 1,000-plus-strong health team, including junior health inspectors, junior public health nurses, health inspectors, supervisors, and public health nurses, constitutes the backbone of the department.

Technical staff and doctors in charge of public health, constituting around 350 persons, in the district ensure that they do not miss out on anyone who needs help. Speaking to people, managing the logistics of arranging ambulances to ferry COVID-19 suspects to the Ernakulam Medical College and other hospitals, sending body fluid samples to the National Institute of Virology in Alappuzha, ensuring that ambulances are sanitised, attending daily meetings, making calls to quarantined patients, and keeping reports ready, apart from attending to at least 100 telephone calls a day, constitute the services offered by the healthcare team.

Overworked for nearly a month ever since the first COVID-19 case was reported in the State, the Health Department has now started with training people to equip themselves in case of an emergency.

On an average, around 20 field staffers, besides other officials of the department, are deployed at the airport everyday to assist the airport healthcare team.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/2rozh1/article31044642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-COVID-HEALTHCARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-19-healthcare-team-in-need-of-reinforcement/article31044643.ece
299,2020/03/12,Steps on to tackle crisis as passenger flow from Italy spikes,"56 persons brought under Health Department surveillance in district

The Health Department brought 56 persons under surveillance in the district on Wednesday for COVID-19. Of them, eight were shifted to the isolation ward at Government Medical College, Ernakulam, while 48 were put under home quarantine.

With the discharge of six patients from the medical college, the number of those under isolation has touched 24. Three cases, including a three-year old boy and his parents, were reported positive earlier.

As many as 52 passengers who arrived from Italy at the Cochin international airport in three flights in the early hours of Wednesday were shifted to the Aluva District Hospital. While 35 of them who showed no symptoms were sent for home quarantine, the remaining 17 were admitted to the medical college. A few of them, depending on the symptoms, were sent for home quarantine later.

Eight-four body fluid samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology at Alappuzha for testing.

Meanwhile, the Health authorities have stepped up preparedness by chalking out plans B, C and D to put more patients under isolation. Accordingly, District Hospital, Aluva; General Hospital, Muvattupuzha; Governement Ayurveda Medical College, Thripunithura, and other State-run facilities have been directed to open isolation wards.

Earlier, special ambulances of the Health Department took Covid-19 suspects for home quarantine. They will be under the care of the respective primary health centres for the next 28 days.

The department has also shared details of the patients with the nearest police stations.

Action will be initiated against those who fail to comply with norms.

District Collector S. Suhas said food packets would be provided to those under home quarantine. As many as 417 persons are under home quarantine in the district. According to the Collector, except for a few, all have cooperated with the Health Department.

The Control Room (Phone: 0484-2368802) received 138 calls on Wednesday, and 63 callers were given counselling.

The department is conducting awareness sessions for healthcare workers, ambulance drivers, officials of local government institutions, self-help groups, ASHAs, and members of residents’ associations.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/jqljgi/article31044635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-COVID-PASSENGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/steps-on-to-tackle-crisis-as-passenger-flow-from-italy-spikes/article31044636.ece
300,2020/03/12,Faulty windrow composting led to Brahmapuram crisis: PCB,"‘Waste management facility not functioning scientifically owing to improper management’

The rectification of the now defunct windrow composting plant will provide the Kochi Corporation with a solution with regard to the treatment of biodegradable waste at its Brahmapuram yard till the proposed waste-to-energy plant becomes a reality, according to the State Pollution Control Board (PCB).

A report submitted by the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the sorry state of affairs at Brahmapuram revealed the present condition of the windrow composting plant at the dumping site. “Basically, the solid waste processing plant at Brahamapuram is a windrow composting plant, housed in paved floor having roofed structure with open sides. This structure itself has partly collapsed and represents a safety hazard,” it said.

Board officials who visited the plant in February pointed out that all the windrow sheds were in a dilapidated condition. “The drains provided were found to be blocked with hard slurry flowing from the windrow compost yards and the primary biodegradable dumping area. Though corporation officials had reported that the work on drains around the facility was almost complete, it was found that the drains were partially open, and that there was every chance of slurry oozing out from the open dumping sites as well as stormwater intrusion into the drains,” they said.

The report said the solid waste management facility at Brahmapuram was granted with conditional authorisation (valid up to April 30, 2010). Thereafter, the facility has not been functioning scientifically thanks to improper management. Moreover, it is in a deplorable condition.

“At present, there are 23 windrow heaps instead of 40 windrows essentially required. No satisfactory shuffling for their aeration was done, and the sheds were seen collapsed. Almost all the windrow sheds were found to be in a dilapidated condition due to uneven settlement of foundations/constructional failures,” the report said.

According to the Solid Waste Management Rules, the windrow compost plant should be properly enclosed and protected with sufficient roofing. Inspections by the PCB revealed that there was no windrow formation plan. Windrow size is not being followed. It is impossible to follow a scientific windrow pattern or windrow turning pattern as the entire site premise has been overfilled with legacy waste, it observed.

Trommel screens (used to separate materials) are not working. The shortage of trommel units has resulted in reduced production of compost compared to the quantity of waste brought to the yard, according to the report.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/2ydu93/article31044625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12KIBRAHMAPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/faulty-windrow-composting-led-to-brahmapuram-crisis-pcb/article31044626.ece
301,2020/03/12,COVID-19 scare takes its toll on public transport network,"Occupancy in private buses down by 40%; KSRTC curtails services; autorickshaw operators hit hard; Kochi metro retains average ridership

The spurt in COVID-19 cases and the State government’s decision to declare partial lockdown seem to have taken its toll on public transport network in the city, except perhaps for the Kochi metro, which claims to retain its ridership.

Private bus operators claimed that occupancy had fallen by nearly 40% on Tuesday evening, shortly after the Chief Minister declared partial lockdown. As many as 530 private buses operate within the city limits, a number that rises to around 1,047 if mofussil services were to be counted.

“There were just enough passengers to occupy seats during peak hours on Wednesday morning unlike during similar hours on normal days when buses are usually crowded. Revenues have dropped considerably and are likely to turn worse if the situation was to extend beyond this month,” said M.B. Sathyan, president, Kerala State Private Bus Operators’ Federation.

He, however, said curtailment of trips was not an option. “Thankfully, bus workers are still turning up for duty without fail,” he added.

Things were not much different in the case of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), with inter-State services to destinations like Bengaluru and Coimbatore witnessing drastic drop in occupancy, forcing the authorities to either rearrange or even suspend services. “Similarly, there were far too few passengers on routes like Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, and Ranni. Since cancelling services is not an option, we are rearranging and even clubbing services together depending on the number of passengers,” said V.M. Thajudheen, city transport officer. The KSRTC operates up to 85 services a day from its Ernakulam depot and around 50 from Thevara.

Shortage of masks

Meanwhile, KSRTC staff are experiencing shortage of masks and protective gear like gloves and have blamed the Health Department for not responding to the communication drawing attention to the matter.

Autorickshaw operators are also feeling the pinch of drop in revenues. “With tourist centres no longer drawing visitors, families staying away from outings, and the drop in the number of passengers at railway and bus stations, auto drivers are not getting regular trips, which have almost halved,” said V.V. Praveen, district vice president, Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union (CITU). The association claimed that out of the 6,000-odd autorickshaw operators within the corporation limits, around 4,300 were its members.

The situation is no different for the 3,000-odd online cab operators in the city. “There has been considerable drop in trips, resulting in a corresponding fall in revenue,” said T.R.S. Kumar, president, Online Taxi Drivers’ Union.

The Kochi metro, however, claimed to have retained its average daily ridership of around 55,000 despite the COVID-19 scare and attributed it to the sanitised travelling environment.

The epidemic scare has proved a blow to the State Water Transport Department (SWTD), which operates nearly 65 trips a day on the Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Vypeen routes. “Usually, we experience increased passenger flow during vacations, which is not the case now. Occupancy has fallen even during peak hours, though cancellation of services is not an option for us,” said M. Sujith, traffic superintendent, SWTD, Ernakulam Region.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/f0cc7a/article31044580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-COVID-TRANSPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-19-scare-takes-its-toll-on-public-transport-network/article31044581.ece
302,2020/03/12,Station House Officer suspended for dereliction of duty,"Alleged failure to take up timely inquest proceedings of a man who was found dead

V.S. Navas, Station House Officer, Aluva East, was on Wednesday placed under suspension for alleged dereliction of duty in the timely conduct of inquest proceedings of a man found dead hanging at his house.

Harshitha Attaluri, Inspector General, Thiruvananthapuram Range, issued the order based on a report submitted by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik.

The body of the 67-year-old was reportedly left as it was after the wife found him hanging when she returned from work on Monday evening.

Police officers allegedly declined to bring down the body citing restrictions in conducting inquest proceedings after sundown, following which the body was left hanging till next morning around 9 a.m.

Mr. Navas was suspended for his alleged mismanagement of the situation, sources said. They added that while the inquest proceedings were supposed to be carried out during the day, there was still scope for carrying them out on humanitarian grounds if there was sufficient light.

Delay in proceedings

However, what aggravated the situation was the further delay in conducting the inquest even the next morning. The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti-Narcotic Cell, Ernakulam Rural, has been asked to conduct an inquiry and submit report within 14 days, sources said.

304,2020/03/12,Crackdown on garbage dumping near Vaduthala overbridge,"Cheranalloor panchayat to strengthen drive against violators

The Cheranalloor panchayat has strengthened the drive against eateries and other establishments that dump garbage near the Vaduthala overbridge in the wake of alleged attempts to demoralise officials of the panchayat who maintain vigil against the practice.

“Different methods are being used to demoralise us including Sunday’s incident in which a man used abusive words and indulged in moral policing to deter panchayat officials and local residents who were maintaining night vigil near the bridge,” said Mallika V.R., secretary of Cheranalloor panchayat. “That this was done on International Women’s Day was even more abhorring than the act of dumping waste. We have identified a few people who dump garbage here.”

We had nabbed many people on the basis of CCTV footage and information provided by local residents. They were fined ₹2,000, while those who dump garbage into waterbodies could be fined ₹10,000. Such grave violations are being done although workers deployed by the panchayat are collecting garbage from households and shops on a daily basis. There were also instances of miscreants damaging the CCTV system.

“The premises of the bridge are strewn with layers of garbage, although we had cleaned up the area a fortnight ago,” Ms. Mallika said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/crackdown-on-garbage-dumping-near-vaduthala-overbridge/article31044355.ece
305,2020/03/12,Focus on ‘green corridor’ project,"Pedestrian-friendly walkway between railway stations

With development of Thammanam-Pullepady road as an arterial road caught in red tape and the inordinate delay by the Public Works Department (PWD) in taking it over from the Kochi Corporation, the civic body has turned its attention on the 2.5-km-long ‘green corridor’ proposed between Ernakulam Town (North) and Junction (South) railway stations.

Sources in the civic body said that its council passed a second resolution expressing willingness to hand over the road to PWD, in 2019. The PWD was reluctant to take over the road and widen it, possibly due to shortage of funds for the over ₹200-crore project.

Entrapped between the busy road and whatever remains in their possession are a few dozen people who surrendered their land free of cost to the corporation to convert the road into four-lane road.

French aid

“With the PWD and the government dilly-dallying on taking over the road, we have prioritised the ‘green corridor’ proposed between the two railway stations, for which French financial assistance can be availed,” sources said. The 2.50-km-long corridor that has been mooted parallel to the tracks that link the two railway stations has been envisaged as a pedestrian-friendly walkway, where only electric buggies and bicycles will be permitted. This will halve the 4.8-km road distance between the two railway stations.

Land acquisition will be minimal since land owned by the Railway and the Kochi Corporation is available, except for a small stretch in Kaloor.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/focus-on-green-corridor-project/article31044341.ece
306,2020/03/12,Upgraded sub-station getting ready,"Facility at Kaloor likely to be commissioned in May

The 220-kV power station at Kaloor is getting ready to be commissioned in May as an answer to the growing power requirements of the city. Work on the high-power sub-station is also linked to creating underground cables for meeting the supply needs of all high-tension power consumers.

KSEB sources said the completion of the work to upgrade the 110-kV sub-station would ensure uninterrupted power supply to areas in the city such as M.G. Road, Thevara, Vaduthala, Chittoor, areas near the Kerala High Court, Edappally and Kaloor.

A KSEB official said that the present 110-kV sub-station at Kaloor just managed to meet the present power demand and establishment of facilities like the Kochi metro had increased the demand for power supply.

The newly upgraded Kaloor sub-station will add to the enhanced services being offered by KSEB in the city.

307,2020/03/12,Brahmapuram and the sorry tale of seven local bodies,"Five municipalities and two panchayats are transporting their biodegradable waste to corporation’s plant that has no effective system for proper refuse management

A corporation, five municipalities, two panchayats and a single waste dump! The failure of the Kochi Corporation in effectively managing the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram has brought to light the enormity of waste management issues in the district.

Aluva, Angamaly, Kalamassery, Thrikkakara and Thripunitura municipalities, and Cheranalloor and Vadavucode-Puthencruz panchayats are dependent on the Kochi Corporation for the disposal of their biodegradable waste.

The State Pollution Control Board had issued notices to the municipalities in last October asking why environment compensation should not be levied on them for not complying with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. Kalamassery municipality was slapped a penalty of ₹2.47 crore as environment compensation in December last year.

The board is yet to fix the environment compensation on the remaining four municipalities.

Asked why the Aluva municipality failed to come up with its own mechanism to treat biodegradable waste, its chairperson Lissy Abraham said plans to set up a plant on the 2.5 acres owned by the municipality at Keezhmadu were yet to take off owing to protests by local residents.

“The municipality had earmarked ₹2 crore to set up a plant to treat food and other biodegradable waste at Keezhmadu. We are finding it difficult even to set up material collection facilities for the storage of non-biodegradable waste,” she said.

The municipality said that the dependence on Brahmapuram had impacted its coffers. “We have to pay nearly ₹1,350 per metric tonne of biodegradable waste load to the Kochi Corporation as fee for dumping it in Brahmapuram. We are able to meet the expenses from the Plan fund allocated by the government,” they said.

Biodegradable waste generated in the five municipalities and two panchayats is taken to the Kochi Corporation’s Brahmapuram plant as the civic bodies lacked any facility to ensure food waste processing as per the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules.

The provisions under the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, stated that local bodies should identify suitable sites for setting up solid waste processing facilities, besides procuring landfill facilities. As per the Rule 22 (5) of the Solid Waste Management Rules, door-to-door collection of segregated waste and its transportation in covered vehicles to processing or disposal facility should have been ensured by April, 2019.

The five municipalities had failed to set up their own facilities for the treatment of biodegradable waste generated under their jurisdiction. Inspections had found that waste got accumulated on road sides in violation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The civic bodies should have ensured bioremediation or capping of old and abandoned dump sites.

‘No land’

Stating that lack of adequate land was a major hurdle for setting up biomethanation plants, M.A. Gracy, chairperson of Angamaly municipality, said that the agreement with the Kochi Corporation was to transport waste generated in markets under its jurisdiction to Brahmapuram. “We have now included a project with the assistance of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board to set up a treatment plant,” she said.

K.T. Eldho, vice chairman of Thrikkakara municipality, echoed the same feeling as Ms. Gracy while saying that the civic body had no land under it to set up a biomethanation plant for treatment of food waste. “We had initiated tender proceedings for acquiring land for the project twice, but failed as there was no land available.

The civic body had also earmarked ₹2.5 crore for the initiative,” he said.

On why Thrikkakara could not emulate local bodies that had set up their own mechanisms to treat biodegradable waste, Mr. Eldho pointed out that about 1,000 households had now come forward to set up biogas and ring compost methods. “We are providing them the units free of cost. The target is to reach out to about 5,000 households,” he said.

Chandrika Devi, chairperson of Thripunitura municipality, said the civic body had no other option but to depend on Brahmapuram for disposal of its food waste. “We have no land for setting up our own facility as food waste from shops, hotels and other establishments are now taken to a central facility and taken to Brahmapuram,” she said.

Public blamed

On why the civic body had not encouraged decentralised treatment methods, Ms. Devi said the response of the public to biogas and ring compost methods was not satisfactory.

She admitted that the municipality was paying nearly ₹1,400 per metric tonne load of food waste to the Kochi Corporation for using the Brahmapuram facility.

Sony Cheeku, chairperson of Cheranalloor panchayat, cited the non-availability of land for setting up its own biomethanation plant. “We are a cash-strapped local body that lacks the funds to establish an expensive plant. There is no other alternative but to transport food waste to Brahmapuram. For non biodegradable waste, we have set up a plastic shredding unit,” she said.

Corpn. slammed

The case of the seven local bodies has been reported before the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi. In its report, the tribunal’s State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management said that the Kochi Corporation was repeatedly evading from doing any rectification measures at the solid waste management facility at Brahmapuram.

“Several meetings were convened by the State Level Monitoring Committee to get clarifications on certain actions initiated by the Kochi Corporation to ensure that immediate actions are being carried out there for the safe management of solid waste. It is the sole responsibility of the corporation to make sure that they are managing the entire waste brought to this plant while they are allowing other five municipalities and two grama panchayats to transfer their waste to Brahmapuram,” it said.

‘Unfortunate’

The State Level Monitoring Committee said it was unfortunate to note that the corporation had not taken any earnest effort to provide a suitable centralised facility to ensure proper management of waste till date though solid waste from the five municipalities and the two panchayats were being transported to the plant from 2012 onwards.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kgzaf4/article31044331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12KIKALAMASSERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/brahmapuram-and-the-sorry-tale-of-seven-local-bodies/article31044333.ece
308,2020/03/12,Lessons in palace intrigue,"Girish Karnad’s last play is an attempt to understand how the kingdom of Vijayanagara collapsed after a single battle

A theatre company from Bengaluru brings to Mumbai a sumptuous staging of Girish Karnad’s final opus, Crossing to Talikota. The play was first published in Kannada as Raakshasa Tangadi by publishers Total Kannada in 2018, and has seen multiple productions in Kannada since. The Oxford edition in English, translated by the playwright himself, was released in May last year, less than two weeks before his passing. In his preface, Karnad wrote of Arjun Sajnani’s planned world premiere of the play, taking pride on the collaborators who had come on board, signing off, “What more can a playwright ask for?”

In October last year, on Gandhi Jayanti, Sight and Sound Performing Arts flagged off the opening run of their production of Crossing to Talikota at Bengaluru’s Chowdiah Memorial Hall. Sajnani had earlier directed Karnad classics like Bali, Tughlaq and The Fire and the Rain, which he adapted for the big screen in 2002 as Agni Varsha, featuring Amitabh Bachchan as Indra. This final stab at a Karnad play is thus both a homecoming and a homage for the director. The play’s awaited Mumbai run comes at the heels of it being staged in Pune, at the Saarang Theatre Festival, in February.

Historical lessons

Set in 1565, the play deals with the downfall of the empire of Vijayanagara, as battalions of four Deccan sultanates tear away at its flanks. The blurb of the English edition reads, “The political contours of southern India [were] radically altered, [with] the rich and prosperous Vijayanagara, plundered, decimated, and abandoned. It would lie uninhabited for centuries, known thereafter only as ‘the ruins of Hampi’.” More than battleground set-pieces, the play focuses on political intrigues. At its centre is Vijayanagara statesman Aliya Ramaraya, who was not of royal blood, but was still the “absolute ruler of the empire without being accepted as its head.” Karnad was awakened to the “tragic dimensions of this exceptional figure” by the writings of Kirtinath Kurtkoti and Richard M Eaton.

The conflict of Talikota is often tarred with a communal brush by historians — Karnad makes it about a hunger for power, Ramaraya’s blind hubris, and geo-political strategy on the part of the Deccan sultans, a confederacy led by Ali Adil Shah I of Bijapur. In his preface, Karnad speaks of three events that stand out in the history of the Deccan in the past millennium. Of these, he has already written Tale-danda on the Lingayat revolution, and The Dreams of Tipu Sultan on the King of Mysore’s last standoff against the British. Crossing to Talikota was his attempt to understand the third — how Vijayanagara, “despite being one of the most powerful military edifices of its age, collapsed overnight after a single battle.”

Grand spectacle

Sajnani forgrounds his play against an impressive backdrop of vertical panels, on which opulent motifs — palace interiors, the ramparts of old forts, war formations — are projected. The design by Arun Sagar is part of a trend of Indian stage spectacles being reliant on sweeping digital panoramas that in many cases, where taste meets function by providence, allows the use of minimalist mise en scène without losing out on an immersive grandeur that is almost cinematic (although the results have often been hit-and-miss on the Mumbai stage).

The cast of thirty-odd actors includes Ashok Mandanna as Ramaraya, already an octogenarian at the time of the play’s events, Shashank Purushotham as the Sultan of Bijapur, and Viveck Jayant Shah (returning to the stage after a 14-year hiatus) as Hussain Nizam Shah, the Sultan of Ahmadnagar. It would be interesting to see whether the representation of Muslim characters in this play ‘others’ them in the manner historical epics (on screen, at least) have been doing of late. Karnad’s own middle-of-the-road approach in delineating the ethos of the play’s settings relies on a balance of rendition that does not kow-tow to a ‘them and us’ narrative.

309,2020/03/12,The man behind successful comedies,"Meherzad Patel loves to take risks and turn ideas around

Meherzad Patel is a producer, director and actor, but first he is a playwright and the creator of some of the craziest, most original and successful comedies on stage. His formula would not be easy for an aspiring writer to emulate and the magic words are ‘what if?’

What if the Queen of England was a Parsi? (The Buckingham Secret)?; What if the dark-skinned President of the U.S. was a Malayali? (The Devil Wears Bataa); What if a Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Parsi joined the same acting course? (The Class Act?); What if a girl draws up a list of conditions for her suitor (The Relationship Agreement). “I go about with a ‘what if’ bubble in my head. I take an idea and turn it on its head, automatically stories start coming.. You have to allow yourself that fictional moment in your mind. It takes a ‘keeda’ (mania) to write and a wicked thought process. If you are sold on the idea, then the audience enjoys it too. If they are not in a good mood, they might get annoyed too, but I like risky and edgy.”

His output over the last decade has been 10 English and 10 Gujarati plays, and some more that have not been staged. Meherzad started writing when he was in school, and found that it came easily to him. “My school, St. Mary’s, really promoted dramatics, and we took it very seriously. That was the era — between 2000 and 2008 — when spoofs were in, there was MTV Bakra and Bharat Dabholkar’s plays, in which everything was made funny in a slapstick version. I wrote a spoof on Sholay, which was rejected by the teachers, but the idea worked. So I wrote a spoof on Snow White in which the dwarfs were people like David Beckham and Sachin Tendulkar, who were popular then. I felt an affinity towards writing because it came naturally to me. Writing is a discipline, direction and acting are talents — Danesh Irani (part of the group’s core team) can wake up and just perform, and it is difficult for others to match him. I want to give people something that have not seen before. Take out all their political correctness for an hour, and it has worked.”

From ‘The Class Act’

Meherzad started directing, because he could not trust anyone else with his work. “I directed more creatively when I was younger. Being a producer is bad — when I am writing, I am already thinking, reduce the props, reduce the costumes. Then, as a director I am thinking, reduce movement, reduce anything complicated that would be too expensive to execute. After I have written a play, I detach myself from it. I think as a producer and director and cut anything that needs to be removed. I don’t get emotionally attached to a play.”

The productions done in school also helped him put together a team that went on to form a group called SillyPoint Productions; the friends work in an enviably cohesive, ego-free and democratic manner; and though they are all trained for other professional careers — Meherzad studied law — they make a living out of theatre.

“I am lucky I have actors who give me time. I am clear that I want actors who may be 70 per cent talented but will give me 100 per cent. I have a group that trusts me, they don’t even ask for the script, or what character they are playing. They trust my treatment of the play, which is very different from the written play. Twenty years later, if someone reads my script, they will see the difference between my theatrical pieces and my commercial-based work. I have realised that if I need to make money, to live comfortably, I need to find a balance. I want my plays to be funny, because humour is my strength. I can write serious plays too, but today if nobody wants to see them what’s the point in doing them. I am also looking for new ideas always, because I don’t want to work on other people’s scripts.”

His latest play Gender Bender, that aimed at people’s prejudices against the transgender community, had to be dropped just before it was due to open, when there were online protests over the ads. “I wanted to do this play to show that this is also something we are capable of. Like we did Gandhi The Musical (written and directed by Danesh Khambatta, from the team), which was such a well-executed production that respect for the group grew. This is not something you can get from a comedy, though if you tell people to try a comedy, they will realise how difficult it is. Some people say this group is working for money, and I say, yes, so are you, except that you are working individually for money. You get a film and you drop the play. That is not how we work.”

With the success of SillyPoint, Meherzad also realised that he had to take the ‘Parsiness’ out of his plays. “It bothered me when people introduced me as the guy who does Parsi plays. So, in The Relationship Agreement, I haven’t even given names to the characters, they can belong to any community. Similarly, with The Devil Wears Bataa, take away the Parsiness and it immediately gets a universal appeal. Our plays have been performed all over the country and have done brilliantly. Delhi is the only market I have not been able to crack, their mindset is very different.” He says that as he matures as a writer, he does want to appeal to an audience that is not out for just entertainment “Of course, a good script is a good script, regardless of its entertainment value or lack of it. I understand that today’s audience relates to certain things, and also that their communication channels are so vast, I don’t need to educate them. Gender Bender used dark humour to convey some hard-hitting moments. If it doesn’t happen because of these issues (protests), it’s okay. I invested time on it. Who knows, 20 years down the line, somebody will pick it up and do it…it exists. I did not want to do a production riding on negative publicity and make it famous for the wrong reasons. I believe a play needs to work for its content.”

Having said that, he admits that in today’s times, when people take offence at the slightest thing, it is difficult to write a satire. “I make sure I don’t take a dig at anyone personally. In The Devil Wears Bataa, we don’t call anybody by their real names, but people can guess who is who. For non-Indian audiences, there is a very funny Sardarji on stage. I can criticise anybody’s work, as they can criticise mine. But there’s a line of respect that must not be crossed in your humour. I also believe that the title should sell, and If audiences are talking about your play at the dinner table, it has worked,” says Meherzad.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/yqqwl6/article31049371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13frAmar-Akbar-Akoori1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/the-man-behind-successful-comedies/article31049373.ece
310,2020/03/12,Know your Ghalib from Danish Iqbal,"Danish Iqbal’s “Dastan-e-Ghalib” combines prose and poetry to highlight the multifaceted personality of the people’s poet

So prevalent and persuasive are his poems that not just literary figures but common man too quotes them frequently. While the issue of belief could elicit “Jab ke tujh bin nahin koi mojud, phir yeh hungama ay Khuda kya hai” (If no one exists except You then God, why do I hear this cacophony); romance prompts “Ishq ne Ghālib nikammā kar diyā, varna ham bhī aadmī the kaam ke.” Yes, that is Delhi’s very own Mirza Ghalib.

Even though popular, not many know about this legendary poet’s life and times, especially the millennials. Stepping in to fill this void is “Dastan-e-Ghalib”, a dastangoi (an Urdu story telling art form) written and directed by Danish Iqbal, featuring Fouzia Dastango and Firoz Khan. It was staged at the Ghalib Academy Auditorium on the occasion of the 51st Foundation Day of the Academy and 151st death anniversary of the poet. “Ghalib’s couplets on diverse issues are quoted so often without even realising that they are his. What makes him special is the fact that his poetry is easy to listen to,” observes Iqbal. He feels the production may trigger an interest in this legendary poet. On choosing the dastan format, Iqbal says: “It doesn’t require a set, lighting, costumes, etc. making it less expensive than staging a play. It needs research, stylised and rhythmic language and poetic flow, the last two being tough.”

Choosing apt incidents from the poet’s life, Iqbal comprehensively etches out this legendary character for the viewers. Written in a biographical format, it showcases Ghalib’s attributes well. Recalling how he lost his father and uncle early in life, it moves on to cover his childhood, youth and the later period. “I wanted to highlight how Ghalib with good tastes of life, struggled throughout due to financial difficulties caused by the suspension of his pension by the British,” says Iqbal.

Varied facets of personality

Doing well to highlight the diverse aspects of Ghalib, the production provides glimpses into the multi-faceted personality. As a philosopher, he turns his attention to life and what it means and goes on to question the concept of heaven as he says “Ham ko maalūm hai jannat kī haqīqat lekin, dil ke ḳhush rakhne ko Ghālib ye ḳhayāl achchhā hai. “Going beyond the set and prescribed norms, boundaries and rules, Ghalib, believed in questioning, reflecting the depth of his intellect,” explains Iqbal.

The story did well to bring out his wit and intelligence. After returning from prison, the poet stayed at Miyan Kale Sahib’s residence. On being congratulated on his release, he said, earlier I was in gore (white) Sahib’s prison, now I am in Kale’s Sahib’s. Likewise, accompanying Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, as part of his entourage, during a walk in the royal garden, Ghalib looked closely at the mangoes. When the King enquired, he promptly said, “Dane dane pe likha hai khane wale ka naam” (every morsel carries the name of the one to eat it). This prompted the Emperor to send him a basket of mangoes.

By including excerpts from the letters written by Ghalib before and after the First War of Independence in 1857, Iqbal underlined the poet’s historical perspective. Besides, expressing his grief, the correspondence also details the casualties, destruction of houses and property, during the upheaval.

Besides Ghalib’s couplets, Iqbal has included tributes paid to him by different old and contemporary poets. “The reason is to emphasise that how well respected and loved Ghalib was, and is, as a person and literary figure,” he explains. Thus one hears satirist Dilawar Figar’s lines, “Woh aadmī thā ḳhatā aadmī kī hai fitrat, ye kyuuñ kaheñ ki vo insāñ nahīñ farishta hai” ((He was a man so was not infallible; why to say he was an angel). Or “Hazar logoñ ne chāhā ki us ke saath chaleñ magar woh pahle bhī tanhā thā ab bhī tanhā hai” (So many people wanted to take the path he traversed; yet none could, so he was alone then as he is still). “Inclusion of poetry in dastan is aesthetic reiteration of what is being stated in the story and ensuring audience engagement,” avers Iqbal.

Both Fouzia and Firoz narrated the story and the poems effectively, bringing out the pathos, humour, wit and finer nuances through the right pauses and stress, facial expression and hand, body and eye movements. With the audience joining them in finishing some of the couplets, made the show interactive. While Fouzia plays an anchor, Firoz, with his facial and eye movements, made the performance energetic. “Having worked for more than five years, we both complement each other,” says Fouzia.

Iqbal feels Ghalib is more relevant today than before. “A product of syncretic society, he was a great humanist, liberal and free thinker. What is worth noting is that the elements were imbibed not through Western education but Indian culture.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/6wdk3s/article31048680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DFRMETROPLUSRADIOJOCKEYDANISHIQBAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/know-your-ghalib-from-danish-iqbal/article31048681.ece
311,2020/03/12,K.S. Rajendran’s ‘Ghosts’ explores human relations,"Directed by K.S. Rajendran, “Ghosts” explores the moral dilemmas of a dysfunctional family

We witnessed Henrik Ibsen’s “Ghosts” adapted into Hindi as “Peechha Karti Parichhayiyan” at the Bharat Rang Mahotsav 2020, with Ila Arun and K.K. Raina in lead roles. Now, Little Theatre Group Repertory has presented “Ghosts” at its auditorium. After plays by William Shakespeare and Moliere, Ibsen's plays are frequently seen on the Hindi stage, especially his “A Doll's House” and “An Enemy of the People” have striking relevance to contemporary Indian social situation.

Translated into Hindi by Astri Ghosh, the production paints a devastating picture of a doomed family plagued by adultery, morbidity of congenital syphilis and hypocrisy. All these thematic elements are revealed layer after layer through the interactions between Mrs. Helene Alving and Father Manders who brings the news of completion of the orphanage Mrs. Alving has constructed in memory of her husband, the late Captain Alving. Soon after their marriage Mrs. Alving discovered that her husband is a debauch. Emotionally shattered, it put her in a moral dilemma whether to get rid of her husband. She decides to break moral code perpetuated by conventional society and decides to leave her husband and goes to Father Manders, an old friend of her. He persuades her to go back to her husband.

And then another layer unfolds the relationship between Mrs. Alving and her son Oswald whom she has kept away from the home to protect him from the scandalous shadow of his father. He has come back home after spending his youth as a painter in Paris and in the company of artists who are having unconventional sexual relations, discarding the code of marriage. The father is shocked to listen to the young man who seems to be pale and suffering from a chronic malady. The young man is infatuated by the young maid Regina and expresses his determination to marry her. An angry Mrs Alving, vehemently opposes her son's marriage proposal.

The play opens with maid Regina frowning at a carpenter who addresses her as his own daughter in a voice that is mocking. The carpenter appears to be a rogue. He boasts of having earned enough money to open a hotel where sailors could stay and have a good time. He insists the maid to follow him and join his venture of entertaining lascivious sailors. But she rejects his proposal disdainfully.

Disturbing climax

The entire action unfolds in the drawing room of Mrs. Alving, illustrating unities of time, place and action. The web of the pathology of human relations inexorably reveals a shockingly disturbing climax. Though Captain Alving is dead but his ghost perpetually assails his family members, leaving them in a state of turmoil with no escape from the ghost's malignant influence. The most pathetic victim of Captain Alving is Oswald, his own son.

As a victim of congenital syphilis, his condition is gradually becoming critical and often suffers from epileptic fit, his whole body in terrible pain, writhing, beseeching his mother to give him morphine so that he may get relief from his tormented life. The young man has one more shock: his mother reveals that the maid is an illegitimate child of Captain Alving. Hence his sexual relationship with her and to marry her is an act of incest.

The play is directed by senior director K.S. Rajendran. His design is neat and realistically captures the drawing room of a well-to-do family. Mostly left space of the stage is used for exits and entries and right space creates the illusion of an interior room. Properties are placed at the right space aesthetically. The burning down of orphanage just before it is to be declared open by Father Manders is emotionally shattering. The scene is suggestively shown through dialogue. In fact, the scene could have been depicted with multi-media on a screen upstage. Of course, there is a screen placed left stage which projects the seduction scene between Captain Alving and the family maid. However, the tone needs variations.

This is a play which demands highly realistic style of acting and experienced performers. Some of the actors concentrated more on delivering their lines rather than revealing the inner world of their characters suffering from moral dilemma. The young actors need more training to make their characters convincing.

Jay Prakash Prakash as Father Manders brings to the fore the moral hypocrisy of his character. Nishi Paliwal has stage presence and clarity of accent but she needs to internalise the tormented world of Mrs. Helene Alving. Dileep Sharma as Oswald Alving brings alive partially the pain of his character.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/y949ih/article31048479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ghost1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/ks-rajendrans-ghosts-explores-human-relations/article31048480.ece
312,2020/03/12,Bhoomika theatre group in Hyderabad now brings entertainment to your doorstep,"The new initiative ‘Theatre at your doorstep’ is winning new types of audiences

“All we want people to provide is power point and some chairs. We will take care of everything else.” grins Krishna Prasad of Bhoomika theatre group whose new initiative, ‘Theatre at your doorstep’ or Mungitlo Natakam in Telugu is making a splash in the art circles of the city. The initiative literally brings theatre to a community space — free of cost and all it demands is a receptive audience. It takes care of all the logistics from mics, curtains and lights.

Interestingly this initiative was first started by the group in 2004 (when they performed more than 25 shows in various colonies of twin cities.) before disbanding it due to logistical reasons. Now, due to the increase in community dwellings and gated apartments, they have built on the original idea and are witnessing a surge in demand from art patrons. The idea received a fresh lease of life after many people complained that to attend a performance, they have to plan logistics and travel weeks in advance owing to the art spaces being located in inaccessible areas.

‘A win-win for everyone’

Udaya Bhanu Garikipati who started Bhoomika theatre group says that nurturing theatre is important as it is a powerful tool to discuss common concerns, to challenge social evils and to celebrate the joy of the society.

“Theatre today is diminishing and people have forgotten the charm of seeing stories come to life in front of them and experience the joy of watching a live performance.” he shares and adds, “To enlighten and spread happiness and awareness among people, the only effective and accessible tool we have is theatre.”

Krishna Prasad says it’s a win-win situation for everyone. “If we hold a show at Ravindra Bharati, it’s the same audience of art lovers at every event. However, through this initiative we reach out to diverse sets of people. For the artistes too, they learn from performing to varying groups of audiences.” The artistes train at Our Sacred Space in Secunderabad, and though they provided training initially free of cost, they are now charging a minimal fee for those interested.

Currently, the group has three plays in Telugu which they perform on a regular basis: Kundeti Kommu, Bullipette Boochodu and Charanadasu, ranging from an hour to two hours, which they perform as part of ‘Mungitlo Natakam’. Their latest folk production Charanadasu, is a Nandi award-winning play.

The actors range from young professionals from IT employees and art enthusiasts who are trained for three months prior to a performance. Though they don’t get paid, it helps them improve their craft and provides a platform to learn. Krishna Prasad says it’s a throwback to the old time when the stage was sacred and people used to travel by bullock carts to watch a play. “We hope that it brings attention to theatre. We hope to make it self-sustainable soon, but for now, we want to increase our presence and perform at a lot of venues.”

313,2020/03/12,"Any handcrafted work has energy, says fashion and travel illustrator Maria Chumak","‘Now, illustrators draw directly on the pad so there is no need to scan but there is no life in the line’

The travel bug bit St Petersburg-born fashion and travel illustrator Maria Chumak early in life. Accompanying her archaeologist father who worked on the Silk Route, she says, it was a peripatetic life with the maximum time she spent in one school being two years.

Maria, who is currently working on her PhD in Puducherry on Iconography of the Women in Eastern Art form, was in Bengaluru recently to conduct a workshop for the students of Vogue Institute of Art and Design, Doddaballapur. With over 17 years of experience in the field of fashion design, drawing and illustration, she has worked in many different capacities and as an illustrator for clients such as Vogue, Elle, and Men’s Health.

Says Maria, “I was interested in different cultures and landscapes. Some of the trips with my parents were in Tajikistan and what inspired me were the colours. I like colours and textures and think all of this influenced my future creative development.”

In what will be familiar to the Indian ear, Maria says that she too prepared to join a medical college before realising she was doing it for her mother, not herself.

“I then spent a year preparing for the Academy of Fine Arts . That was a shift. But I had been painting, drawing and doing crafts since childhood.”

Stating that she did not have a “passion for fashion” in the beginning, she considered different options before settling on fashion design. “There is shape and colour; something moving and changing all the time. There is texture and it is palpable. Also, I think maybe I was influenced by the expeditions with my father and seeing the ruins plus the silk garments and beads. The idea maybe of touching history also influenced me.”

On how she decides what to sketch while travelling, Maria says, “I like to come somewhere, sit and observe. While drawing, you become part of the place. For example, if you draw in the village, all the residents will come. You will know the names of all the children, they tell their stories and about the place. When you sit and draw in the same place, you will investigate and remember it better. It is like a long movie experience. If you place a camera and leave it for 12 hours, you will see everything.”

She adds that she is inspired by south Asia unlike Europe where she doesn’t find any creativity because of the climate and grey colours.

Stating that she prefers to go it old school, Maria says she draws by hand and then applies colours, whether watercolours, pencils or anything else. “As artists, we use everything we have. Then I scan, do the clean-up and then Photoshop. Very basic things. Now, illustrators draw directly on the pad so there is no need to scan but there is no life in the line. If you compare with old animation when it was drawn by hand, it was different right? Any handcrafted work, whether a stitched garment or jewellery, keeps the identity of the artist, and the energy of that person.”

314,2020/03/12,Sarovaram Biopark draws more visitors,"DTPC tightens security, sets up more CCTV cameras

The Kozhikode District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) has intensified its efforts to attract more visitors to Sarovaram Biopark. Besides tightening the security three months ago and preventing people from going deep into the mangrove forest, the council is now planning to set up more CCTV cameras in parts of the park to make it safer for the general public.

Recently, the DTPC organised ‘Utsav’, a seven-day festival of folk arts, at the biopark to attract visitors.

The park, set up more than a decade ago to protect the mangrove ecosystem of Kottooli wetland, which is one of the only five notified wetlands in the State, is a hub of biodiversity in the heart of the city. However, it had been under-utilised by the public as it had become a hub of anti-social activities over a period of time. The many efforts made by the DTPC to make it more approachable to the public had gone in vain over the years.

“We set up CCTV cameras in some parts of the park, with written messages about its existence. The security had been tightened and police officers used to visit the park regularly. But nothing seemed to deter the determination of the anti-social elements,” said DTPC Secretary C.P. Beena, adding that only increased patronage of people for good reasons could bring about change in the park.

She pointed out that the amphitheatre at the park too lacked proper patronage. “It is the best amphitheatre in the city, amidst all that greenery. But not many people turn up to use it, even though the rent is much lower compared to other auditoriums and halls,” Ms. Beena said.

However, the DTPC has joined hands with the morning walkers at the park to make it a better place and attract more visitors. There is also a proposal made in association with the Responsible Tourism Mission to set up live handicraft units there.

The renewed efforts have borne results. “Now the ticket collection is accurate. We have stopped issuing tickets to students who come in their uniforms. With more cameras in place and more people coming up to use facilities there, the biopark would be live again,” Ms. Beena added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fnt5y9/article31046818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12CTSAROVARAMBIOPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/sarovaram-biopark-draws-more-visitors/article31046819.ece
315,2020/03/12,Kerala High Court raps government for filing appeal,"When the appeal came up for hearing, the government pleader had submitted that half of the decree amount had been deposited before the trial court

The Kerala High Court on Wednesday took the State government to task for filing an appeal against a sub-court order awarding a compensation of ₹1.50 lakh to the husband and five children of a woman who died due to medical negligence of doctors and forcing them to wait for an agonising 25 years in their quest for legitimate justice.

Justice Devan Ramachadnran observed that their endless wait was itself shocking. The appeal should never have been filed because the death of Valli, wife of Thami of Tirur, consequent on a laparoscopic sterilization surgery was conceded. A sub-court at Tirur in Malappuram had decreed in 2003 a suit filed by Thami and children awarding the compensation after finding that the death of the woman was due to post-operative complications and medical negligence. The surgery was done on January 26, 1995.

The State government and the doctors had contended in the appeal that the probable reason why Valli must have contracted infection was because she had not taken full care of herself after she was discharged from the hospital.

Dismissing the contention, the court said that it would be shockingly uncharitable to the deceased, especially when she had voluntarily gone to the sterilization programme, responding to the call of the government for family planning, consequent on the birth of her fifth child.

When the appeal came up for hearing, the government pleader had submitted that half of the decree amount had been deposited before the trial court. The court, therefore, directed the State government to deposit the balance amount within two months.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kerala-high-court-raps-government-for-filing-appeal/article31046804.ece

320,2020/03/12,Dubai visit by councillors draws criticism,"UDF terms the foreign junket inopportune, improper

The UDF council party of the Kozhikode Corporation has alleged corruption over a few councillors’ visit to Dubai and demanded a thorough inquiry in this matter.

In a press release, UDF independent councillor S.V. Mohammed Shameel said that a group, including Health Standing Committee chairman K.V. Baburaj, members Bijulal P., Mullaveettil Moideen, Education Standing Committee Chairman M. Radhakrishnan, Public Works Standing Committee member Suresh M.P. and Finance Standing Committee member V.T. Sathyan had gone on a tour to Dubai. He condemned the journey at a time when the other councillors and the health officials were engaged in fighting COVID-19 and avian influenza.

Mr. Shameel alleged that the councillors’ Dubai visit was sponsored by the firm that was setting up the waste-to-energy plant at Njeliyanparamba and that it was a bribe to allot more space to the company in the area.

The UDF council party termed the journey a challenge to the people of Kozhikode.

In the council meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Shameel called upon the Mayor to not allow the councillors to get out of their houses for 28 days upon their return, as a safe procedure to ward of corona infection.

321,2020/03/12,New season of vacation foster care programme kicks in,"‘There are many applicants, but there are very few children legally free to be given for adoption’

Not every child gets to experience a normal family life.

There are hundreds of children even in Kozhikode district who have been deprived of that experience due to various reasons. Imbam, the vacation foster care programme of the Department of Women and Child Welfare, has, however, made quite a headway in making it happen for these children over the past six years.

The vacation foster care programme started in Kozhikode district in 2014 and since then, an average of 20 children from various orphanages in the district have been taken to various homes during their summer holidays. While the government remains the legal guardian of these children, the families can opt to keep the child with them for a longer term if the child is willing. There are families in the district that have kept the children whom they brought home under the foster care programme, for around five years.

“The children given for foster care are those that are not legally free, as they would have a living relative, who might not be in a position to take care of the child”, said Anusree M.S., protection officer in charge of non-institutional care attached to the District Child Protection Office in Kozhikode. After five years of foster care, if the families and children were willing, the unit makes arrangements to free the children legally and let their foster families adopt them.

“We recently had a get together of such families and children. There are around 60 such families in the district”, Ms. Anusree said.

The Child Protection Unit got around 50 applications in the previous year for foster care of which around 25 families were selected. “We conduct a thorough investigation of the applicants before entrusting them with the children. We also conduct follow-ups every six months”, Ms. Anusree said.

While there are so many applicants for adoption, there are very few children who are legally free to be given for adoption. Usually, only children below 6 years are given for adoption. Older children are often entrusted with foster parents, who are not their legal guardians.

Fresh applications for vacation foster care can be sent to the District Child Protection Officer, District Child Protection Unit, B. Block, Second Floor, Civil Station, Kozhikode-673020 with biodata.

The Kerala State Human Rights Commission has directed the Director, Health Services, to appoint the required number of house surgeons at the Government General Hospital, Kozhikode.

It was issued by commission judicial member P. Mohanadas on Wednesday.

A meeting to sensitise Madurai Corporation vehicle drivers to the importance of abiding by rules of road safety was held at Arignar Anna Maligai here on Thursday.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan chaired the meeting, which was attended by the drivers and their contractors. V. Senthilkumaran, Inspector of Police (Traffic), Avaniapuram, S. Ramesh and K. Subash Chandran, Sub-Inspectors (Planning), spoke to the drivers about the need to ensure their safety as well as that of other road users.

A police officer said that the meeting was arranged after a recent accident at Avaniapuram which claimed the life of a two-wheeler rider. “The two-wheeler collided with a Corporation lorry. The two-wheeler rider died on spot despite wearing a helmet,” he said.

Mr. Visakan said that the civic body had received complaints from residents regarding rash driving by many Corporation vehicle drivers. “The drivers must be careful and travel at a lower speed taking into consideration of safety of other vehicle users. If they drive vehicles at high speed, they will be removed from their job,” he warned.

325,2020/03/12,On SC directive CBI inspects fireworks units,"Agency collects samples of finished products, chemicals

SIVAKASI

A team of sleuths from the Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday began inspection of fireworks units here following a directive from the Supreme Court.

Hearing a contempt of court petition with regard to violation of green cracker norms by the fireworks units, the apex court on March 3 directed the CBI to probe whether six fireworks manufacturers had violated its order and used barium nitrate.

The CBI sleuths, accompanied by local policemen, swooped down on various fireworks units in and around Sivakasi and collected samples of finished fireworks products and various types of chemicals stocked on their premises.

After sending them for chemical analysis, the CBI is expected to file its report to the Supreme Court.

The court in March 2019 ordered banning barium nitrate in making of crackers. The fireworks industry was asked to follow the formulations given by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research to make various types of green crackers.

However, ahead of Deepavali in 2019, there were allegations that several cracker units in Sivakasi were not following NEERI formulations, but continuing to use the banned barium nitrate. The State police authorities were instructed to allow distribution, sale and bursting of only green crackers.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/on-sc-directive-cbi-inspects-fireworks-units-sivakasi/article31052234.ece
326,2020/03/12,TNSTC popularising sight-seeing package in Madurai,"For ₹125, a person can visit important places in and around the city in comfort

MADURAITamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Madurai Region, has introduced a sight-seeing package covering important tourist and pilgrimage spots here to lure passengers to its services.

TNSTC officials on Thursday distributed pamphlets explaining the attractions of the package to passengers at various bays around Periyar bus stand. The tourist special package is offered in the morning and the evening every day.

“We started this one month back during the Ayyappa season. It got good response from the devotees, who used our services to visit the places of tourism importance and temples,” said Assistant Engineer (Operations) R. Ashok Kumar.

The package for ₹125 per passenger starts at Ellis Nagar bus bay at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. It covers Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, Gandhi Museum, Teppakulam and Tirumalai Naicker Mahal. “The passengers have the option of either choosing Kallazhagar Temple at Alagarkoil or Subramaniaswamy Temple at Tirupparankundram in this itinerary,” he added.

For this group tour, the TNSTC has spared two buses.

“These buses will drop them at these tourist spots and wait for them to board to proceed towards the next spot,” he added. Each tour package would last for nearly six hours.

“If people are going to travel on their own, bus fare to all these places will be around ₹200 for each passenger. Besides, people will need to know the locations of the tourist spots and the bus routes to reach there. The package is cheaper and it gets them exclusive vehicles with all privacy,” he added.

TNSTC officials are also trying to get faster darshan at the temples for their passengers with the help of temple authorities.

“We would like to add Keeladi and the Jain cave at Keezhakuyilkudi to our itinerary depending upon the response from the public,” Mr. Ashok Kumar added.

The TNSTC is also ready to provide additional buses for this package if more people want to use it. The officials also encouraged people to use TNSTC buses instead of private vehicles or share autorickshaws to reduce air pollution.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/4aggep/article31057000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MATNSTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tnstc-popularising-sight-seeing-package-in-madurai/article31051557.ece
327,2020/03/12,Lankan fishermen escape from clutches of law,"COVID-19 scare forces ICG to hand them over to Lankan Navy

The COVID–19 scare has forced the Indian Coast Guard to release 15 Sri Lankan fishermen, who were nabbed on Wednesday off Kanniyakumari coast for entering Indian waters, instead of handing them over to the State police, to be remanded in judicial custody as being done usually.

When 15 Sri Lankan fishermen in three boats were fishing inside the Indian territorial waters 70 nautical miles off Kanniyakumari coast on Wednesday, they were nabbed by the Indian Coast Guard ship operating from the Kochi base. As they were handed over to the Indian Coast Guard unit operating from the Thoothukudi base, the detained fishermen were taken in ICG Abhiraj.

When the ICG ship carrying the Sri Lankan fishermen started its journey towards VOC Port, Thoothukudi, its base, health officials of the seaport opposed to it saying that foreign nationals and their boats could not be allowed to enter the harbour in the wake of COVID – 19 pandemic that has triggered panic across globe.

Consequently, the ICG officials held prolonged discussion with their higher-ups on handing them over either to the Tamil Nadu police’s coastal security group in the sea to be remanded in judicial custody as usual or to the Sri Lankan navy.

Since the ICG top brass decided in favour of handing over the detained Sri Lankan fishermen to the navy of the island nation, the ICG informed the Sri Lankan Navy to receive their fishermen. Subsequently, they were handed over to the Sri Lankan navy.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/lankan-fishermen-escape-from-clutches-of-law/article31050534.ece

Sanitary workers have been deployed in larger number in bus stands, railway junction and other places where people gather in large number to neutralise viral infection, if any, by sprinkling disinfecting agents.

In a review meeting held recently to discuss precautionary measures being taken by all departments in the wake of COVID-19, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish instructed officials to ensure disinfection of all public places by deploying sanitary workers in sufficient numbers for spraying disinfecting agents.

She directed owners of private buses and cinema halls to take adequate precautionary measures. In particular, she instructed theatre owners to disinfect seats in cinema halls after every show.

Subsequently, the corporation deployed sanitary workers in the Vaeinthaankulam new bus stand and in the temporary bus terminus at Exhibition Grounds to spray antimicrobials in buses. As buses arrive at bus bays, sanitary workers sprinkle chemical agents while awareness pamphlets are distributed to the commuters. The workers also spray disinfectants on vehicles, particularly autorickshaws and taxis parked in Tirunelveli Junction and in the vicinity.

All trains starting from Tirunelveli Railway Junction are being disinfected by sanitary workers who spray disinfectants in every coach and spray germicides along railway tracks. All railway staff on duty have been advised to wear masks.

Meanwhile, the 27-year-old youth, who had returned from Dubai to his native place of Chokkampatti in Tenkasi district and admitted to the isolation ward of Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital with fever, cold and cough on Monday, has recovered. His blood samples had been sent for analysis for suspected COVID – 19.

330,2020/03/12,Single donor enables doctors at private hospital to perform two ‘novel’ transplants,"Asia’s first combined bowel and abdominal wall transplant surgery performed on a teenager; 35-year-old woman gets new lease of life

Doctors at the Apollo Hospitals have claimed that they have performed Asia’s first combined bowel and abdominal wall transplant surgery on a teenager.

An 18-year-old brain-dead donor gave a new lease of life to two patients — a teenager with ultra short bowel syndrome and a 35-year-old woman on dialysis for end-stage renal disease — and enabled doctors to perform two “novel” transplants on them.

The teenager underwent combined small bowel and abdominal wall transplant.

The woman with a renal disease received a kidney that was perfused with Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion (HOPE) at the Apollo Hospitals.

Lack of awareness

J. Shyamala, paediatrician, said that only a few bowel transplants were performed in the country — the reasons being lack of awareness among recipients, reluctance to donate abdominal wall and small bowel, need for a high level of preparedness, intensive care, pre and post-operative care.

“The 17-year-boy from Andhra Pradesh had extensive small bowel gangrene and underwent complete removal of the small bowel. He had lost 20 kg over two months, and came to us in March 2019. We put him under aggressive nutrition rehabilitation. He gained 18 kg in eight months and returned home,” she told reporters on Wednesday.

The patient had two episodes of central-line infection and Total Parental Nutrition-induced liver injury.

“Eleven months after his first admission, he underwent combined small bowel-abdominal wall transplant and was discharged on the 15th post-operative day. He is gradually gaining weight,” she said.

Doctors said that intestinal transplants were taking baby steps in India and that it still had a long way to go.

The kidney harvested from the donor was perfused with HOPE and preserved for 11 hours.

Graft function

Explaining this, Mohan Kumar, urologist, said: “It improved graft function, increased utilisation and reduces rejection.”

Venkatesh Rajkumar, nephrologist, said that kidney diseases were increasing in the community and kidney failure patients requiring transplants were 20-25 per lakh population.

331,2020/03/12,"Yes Bank: prime properties in Delhi, Mumbai under ED scanner","Agency starts process to attach assets of Kapoor family

The Enforcement Directorate has started the process for attaching over a dozen properties in the posh localities of Delhi and Mumbai in connection with the case against crisis-hit Yes Bank’s promoter-director Rana Kapoor and others. Assets have also been located in the United Kingdom, United States and France.

The ED probe has revealed that the accused persons had invested about ₹6,000 crore through 78 companies, most of which were floated in the name of Mr. Kapoor’s wife and daughters, said a senior official.

“Five of the prime assets are in Delhi. They include the properties on Sardar Patel Marg, Kautalya Marg and Amrita Shergill Marg in Lutyens Delhi, one in the adjoining Jor Bagh and another one in Hauz Khas. Their evaluation is being done,” the official said.

Several properties in Mumbai have also come under the agency’s scanner under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

“Mr. Kapoor was also involved in a couple of companies. While the on-paper records indicate investment of about ₹6,000 crore through the 78 entities, cash components could be linked to the transactions that are being scrutinised,” the official said.

Following the money trail, the agency has also zeroed in on at least three properties in London, New York and France. “In a New York hotel, £20.66 million was invested and £30 million pounds was invested in a hotel in London,” the official said.

Also read | Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

While investigations into the domestic assets are under way, the agency plans to approach the authorities in these three countries for getting more information about the properties in question.

Before a Mumbai court, the ED has said that during Mr. Kapoor's tenure, loans to the tune of ₹30,000 crore were given to various entities and ₹20,000 crore turned non-performing assets.

According to the agency, the usual modus operandi adopted by the accused persons was to extend loans through Yes Bank to companies in lieu of investments in the ones floated by them.

The ED's case is based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation on March 7. Among those named are Mr. Kapoor, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited, RAB Enterprises (India) Private Limited, Morgan Credits Private Limited and RKW Developers Private Limited.

332,2020/03/12,News Analysis | Why oil prices are crashing,"Prices crashed by almost 50% this year, from $66 a barrel on December 31, 2019 to the current levels, primarily driven by lack of demand.

Oil prices saw their biggest single-day crash in almost 30 years on March 9, throwing global equity markets into turmoil. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed down 24% at $34.36 after a price war was initiated between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s largest oil producers. It recovered slightly on March 10, but crashed again. On Thursday, Brent crude price was hovering around $33 a barrel. Prices crashed by almost 50% this year, from $66 a barrel on December 31, 2019 to the current levels, primarily driven by lack of demand.

Also read: Data | Have falling crude oil prices affected petrol prices in the country?

What happened to the OPEC-Plus alliance?

After 2014 “glut” diplomacy which brought down prices below $30 a barrel, Saudi Arabia and Russia came together to cut output and steady prices. Known as the “OPEC Plus” arrangement (Russia is not a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC), this alliance kept production lower and pumped up the prices. The OPEC-Plus cooperation collapsed last week after Russia rejected a Saudi request to effect more cuts in output given the fall in demand owing to the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The exiting output reduction deal is set to expire later this month. The Russian and Saudi sides have said they are no longer constrained by the deal and are free to ramp up production. Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco announced that it would increase output from 9.7 million barrels a day now to 12.3 million barrels a day in April. Aramco also offered a discount to its variety of crude, targeting Russian markets in Asia and Europe. The fear of glut at a time of slowing demand (supply and demand shock) rattled the markets, crashing prices.

Also read: Oil prices crashed, Rahul reminds Prime Minister

What does Saudi Arabia want?

As it was clear that Russia was not ready to cut its output further, the Saudis moved to the attack mode. The plan is to flood the markets with Saudi oil and depress the prices, which would hurt all oil exporters. Riyadh may have multiple targets. One is to exert pressure on Russia and make it come back to the negotiation table. And if both sides agree to a new deal, they can reverse the decision to ramp up production and collectively take steps to pump up prices. Second, if the Russians do not blink, the plan is to capture market share from Russia with discounts. Third, bleed the U.S. shale oil producers who could not sustain production at depressed prices. In a way, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, is trying to take on both Russia and U.S. shale oil companies with a single move. But the question is whether Saudi Arabia could sustain the price war for a longer term. Roughly 90% of Saudi budget revenues are coming from the petroleum sector. The Kingdom wants prices to be over $60 a barrel to balance its budget. Prolonged depressed prices will leave a bigger hole in the Saudi budget, complicating further the Crown Price’s economic reform and diversification agenda.

What’s Putin’s plan?

Though Russia had been cooperating with OPEC for three years, there’s a growing opinion in Moscow that the output cut was hurting Russian energy companies. Russian companies also want to open the taps and gain more market share. Furthermore, there’s a convergence of interests between Saudi Arabia and Russia in hurting the U.S. shale oil companies, which are flooding markets with shale oil and challenging the supremacy of traditional oil producers in determining the prices (U.S. output was more than 12 million barrels a day in February). Russia is in a relatively stronger economic position than Saudi Arabia. Oil now accounts for less than a third of its budget revenue. The country has also built a war chest of $435 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Russian President Vladimir Putin may be in for a long game — to weaken both U.S. shale oil industry and the OPEC’s clout in the market.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/d6wy4r/article31051663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARAMCO-STANLY-KESAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/news-analysis-why-oil-prices-are-crashing/article31051664.ece

Automobile dealers’ body Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on March 12 said retail sales of passenger vehicles, measured by registration, declined 1.17% to 2,26,271 units in February.

Also read | Passenger vehicle sales pick up after 11 months

Passenger vehicle retail sales in February last year stood at 2,28,959 units, the FADA said in a statement.

Two-wheeler retail sales stood at 12,85,398 units last month as against 12,66,163 units in February 2019, a growth of 1.52%, it added.

Commercial vehicle retail sales also grew by 13% to 92,805 units last month as compared with 82,129 units in the year-ago period.

FADA said three-wheeler sales were up 20.7% at 65,752 units as compared with 54,474 units in February 2019.

Tractor retail sales stood at 41,485 units as compared with 36,543 units in February last year, a growth of 13.52%.

Retail sales of total vehicles across categories stood at 17,11,711 units in February 2020 as compared with 16,68,268 units in the same month a year ago, it said.

Commenting on vehicle retail sales, FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale said February turned positive for most of the segments as the entire auto ecosystem, especially auto dealers, focused on liquidation of their BS-IV Stocks.

“Rural sales contributed for retail sales turning green with tractors also being in double digit growth for second month in a row,” he added.

Despite the growth, the overall retail sales were much below expectations as the expected pre-buying for the BS-IV stock was not seen, he said.

“Many customers held onto their purchase decision expecting sweeter deals towards the end of March,” he added.

Commenting on inventory levels, Mr. Kale said it remains a very serious concern for BS-IV two-wheelers, and asked manufacturers to handhold dealers for 100% liquidation of stocks before March 31 deadline.

“FADA survey reveals a very high number of two-wheeler dealers will not be able to fully liquidate their BS-IV inventory and expressed inadequate support from their OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] for 100% liquidation of this stock,” Mr. Kale said.

With regards to passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, he said overall inventory is at a reasonable level, but the challenge remains in slow-moving, non-popular models as dealers look for adequate OEM support for liquidation of the same in March.

“FADA has already advocated for return of unsold BS-IV stocks and will be pursuing this for its members, if the need arises, as many dealers will be unable to sustain such losses,” Mr. Kale said.

On the outlook for March, he said with banks and NBFCs getting into a cautious mode with regards to financing BS-IV stocks and many RTOs (Regional Transport Offices) across the country prescribing their own cut-off dates for permanent registration, liquidation of BS-IV inventory continues to be a challenge.

“Dealers are now facing a new challenge with coronavirus cases being detected in India and alarming drop in customer walk-ins in auto showrooms,” he said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/3t90gl/article19253327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11HYUNDAICARS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/passenger-vehicle-retail-sales-down-117-in-february-fada/article31049887.ece

A day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, equity markets worldwide went into a bear phase — denoted by more than 20% fall from the recent highs of the benchmarks.

The Indian benchmarks registered their biggest single-day fall on Thursday, with the Sensex plunging 2,919.26 points, or 8.18%, to close at 32,778.14 — over 22% lower than its January high of 42,273.87. This was the lowest close for the index in nearly two years.

Deep losses

All 30 stocks in the Sensex ended the day with deep losses, with heavyweights such as HDFC Bank, TCS, Axis Bank, ONGC, State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank shedding over 9% each on Thursday. Most of the Sensex constituents touched their 52-week lows.

The dampened investor sentiments could be further gauged from the fact that more than 500 stocks touched their lower circuit on the BSE, even as 2,265 stocks ended in the red as against only 201 gainers.

Data | Where does the March 9 market crash rank in Sensex history?

The broader Nifty fell below the psychological 10,000 mark to close at its lowest level since June 2017. The index lost 868.25 points, or 8.30%, to close at 9,590.15.

The India VIX index jumped over 31% after witnessing a jump of 35% on Monday last.

The announcement by President Donald Trump restricting travel to the U.S. from Europe further dented investor sentiments.

“Global stocks, including India, plunged into a bear market after President Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to stem the coronavirus, threatening more disruption to the world economy,” said Deepak Jasani, Head-Retail Research, HDFC Securities. “Global recession risk is rising and the markets do not seem to be pricing that in fully,” he added.

Elsewhere in Asia, the benchmarks of Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and South Korea all fell between 3% and 5% each.

Foreign investors continued to sell Indian equities with Thursday’s selling pegged at nearly ₹3,500 crore. The current month’s net sales are already nearing the ₹23,000-crore mark.

Equity benchmark Sensex plummeted over 1,800 points and the broader Nifty gave up the 10,000 level in opening session on Thursday as worsening rout in world markets, after WHO declared coronavirus a pandemic, flared up fears of a global economic recession.

The rupee too plunged 82 paise to 74.50 against U.S. dollar in morning session.

The sell-off picked pace after the World Health Organization (WHO), late Wednesday night, termed the the new coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic, and expressed deep concern over the “alarming levels of inaction.”

Following the announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump suspended all travel from Europe, excluding the UK, to the U.S. for the next 30 days to stop the spread of the virus.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

In previous weeks, we have been cherry-picking five interesting cryptic clues from puzzles published during the week gone by and breaking them down for you. We also pose an interesting clue (non-cryptic) a day on our social media handles (so make sure you follow The Hindu on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram).

Going forward, we hope to take a word every now and then and examine either the brilliance of the clueing or the appeal of the word itself, or both.

Of course, we hope the puzzles have been providing you enough fun in and of themselves, but TH Crossword+ wants to be your solving friend and guide (we don’t quite have the beard for a philosopher). We know we haven’t quite been regularly in touch with you guys. But we promise to make it up to you with renewed vigour. We’re willing to wipe the slate clean and start afresh, if you are!

Speaking of wiping slates clean, if you tried Hypatia’s Thursday puzzle on TH Cryptic, you may have come across a word that may be new to many of us.

The Hindu Cryptic #12881 | Hypatia | (5 Down) Clue surface : Recycled old document including PPTs circulated with emails (10) Answer : PALIMPSEST Definition: Recycled old document Clue type : Anagram Annotation : The letters PPTS are to be jumbled (as indicated by ‘circulated’) with EMAILS

What in the modern world is a ‘palimpsest’, you may ask in all fairness. Well, simply put, it is a scroll or manuscript made from animal skin so expensive and rare that scribes in the past just decided to reuse it by shoddily scraping off the last bit of writing and inking afresh right on top of the smudges beneath.

The Cambridge Dictionary offers you two meanings for this word — one gives its original literal meaning, and the other a more figurative way it is used in common parlance (yes, believe it or not, the word ‘palimpsest’ has actually gained momentum with time, according to Google’s Ngram Viewer).

palimpsest noun /ˈpæl.ɪmp.sest/ — a very old text or document in which writing has been removed and covered or replaced by new writing eg: Plutonius the scribe had vegan tendencies. So, instead of turning over a new parchment leaf every day, he simply reused his manuscript as a palimpsest. ------- formal — something such as a work of art that has many levels of meaning, types of style, etc. that build on each other: eg: His performance is a palimpsest in which you see all the layers of a single life. Etymology: (from 17th-Century Greek) palin (“again”) + psaein (“to rub smooth”)

Kudos to Hypatia for constructing a clue that juxtaposes this ancient means of formal written communication with today’s variants!

339,2020/03/12,Economic uncertainty rises,"Supply shocks from China have caused a fall in production and decline in demand, leading to fears of recession

Stock markets globally have declined since the big drop this ‘Manic Monday’. They are reacting to the expected slowdown in the world economy due to the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to more than 100 countries. Crude oil prices also began dropping due to fears of global recession and drop in demand for energy. With increasing uncertainty, there is even a possibility now that the Olympics to be held in Japan this summer may be postponed. Travel and trade have been severely affected in large parts of the world, with restrictions on movement and cancellations of visa, etc.

In recent times, China, the epicentre of the outbreak and the largest supplier of many basic and intermediate goods, has come to dominate the supply chain of production of a large number of final goods. So, multiple industries have been impacted due to the spread of the virus. For instance, India has come to depend on China for supply of inputs in the areas of electronics, medicines, automobile parts and components used by small and cottage sectors. The Chinese juggernaut has been supplying even Indian cultural symbols like pichkaris for Holi and idols of Indian gods. China produces multiple items cheaply on a scale that other countries cannot match. Despite the low wages in India and the additional transport costs of getting these items from China, the Chinese goods have displaced a big portion of Indian manufacturing.

How far can domestic production help?

The current supply chain disruption requires that either Indian production is ramped up where possible, or alternative sources of supply abroad are found. But, given the fact that much of the alternative production possibilities have been disrupted in the last 20 years by cheap Chinese goods, finding producers who can quickly ramp up production is not easy. Even if alternative sources of supply are found within India, their prices will be higher, so inflation will go up. This inflationary tendency will be countered by the global decline in demand and a fall in commodity prices, similar to what is being witnessed in the case of energy.

In a recessionary scenario, there is a fall in incomes and reduction in demand in spite of a decline in inflation. Expenditures on health and disease control will rise but not enough to counter the slowdown.

The impact on the small producers is likely to be sharper due to the fact that they have small working capital. As demand declines, they are left holding inventory and also have to pay wages; this exhausts their working capital. If their units shut down for even a few months, it becomes difficult to bring them back to life. The financial sector is not very much attuned to catering to their demand and, hence, they have to depend on the more expensive source of private funds.

Also, as the economy declines, the already substantial non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks and the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) will increase in India. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already reported falling business and consumer confidence and a decline in capacity utilisation in the organised sectors of the economy. These factors are being aggravated by the virus-related impact, further denting investment.

Boosting demand and investment

Consumer confidence will remain low for a while even after the intensity of the spread of the virus declines with the onset of summer. But there is no certainty about this since the World Health Organization (WHO) says that not enough is known about this virus. People the world over are scared and anticipate trouble ahead, so they are unlikely to resume buying discretionary items. Car sales in China have plummeted and are unlikely to revive soon. People save more when the future is uncertain; hence, demand is not likely to increase immediately. Due to fear of lockdown and shortages, it is likely that people will hold more cash and essential items at their homes. Central banks will have to be prepared to issue more currency. They have reduced interest rates but this will have little impact since the primary reason for the global downturn and stock market volatility is decline in sentiment following the spread of the virus. It is not a cyclical downturn.

In brief, the problem is not fully understood but fears of a big impact have grown. Supply shocks emanating from China have spread and due to impact on production, incomes are declining, leading to a fall in demand and threat of global recession. The poor are likely to be impacted more in India. At present only the short run can be anticipated but since uncertainty has increased, governments will have to take fiscal steps anticipating the worst in the long run.

340,2020/03/12,A self-created political decline,"The Congress’s ‘first family’ is precipitating the fall of a party it was charged with safeguarding

With Jyotiraditya Scindia’s defection, the Congress Party has advanced further on the path toward an apparent self-fulfilling prophecy of political irrelevance. It is easy to blame Mr. Scindia for a lack of morality, ideological commitment and loyalty to his party but such blame only scratches the surface of the problem. Lack of morality and party loyalty and the absence of ideological commitment among Indian politicians are on display every day. The Congress leadership should have factored this into its calculations, especially when it comes to relatively young, ambitious and capable members.

The Congress high command’s inability to take seriously clear indications of Mr. Scindia’s unhappiness, especially over the party high command’s dithering over his nomination to the Rajya Sabha, shows a shocking degree of political ineptitude. Moreover, Mr. Scindia’s recent statements on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), dissenting from the leadership’s views, and his call for greater inner-party democracy should have also rung alarm bells in 10 Janpath.

Despite the façade of ideological division between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the political culture of the two parties is quite similar. As the Scindia affair — and it is not the exception but the rule in Indian politics — clearly denotes, the objective of most Indian politicians is power and more power. The Ajit Pawar episode in Maharashtra and the blatant luring by the BJP of Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs in Karnataka in exchange for ministerial berths were recent demonstrations of this phenomenon.

However, there are three major differences between the BJP and the Congress. First, the BJP, thanks to its parent organisation the RSS, is a cadre-based party with organisational discipline instilled into the psyche of its members. Two, loyalty to the party and to its residual ideology among Congress members has plummeted as the party has turned into a family enterprise. Three, the BJP has been in power for the past six years and is far-better equipped to attract potential defectors through the offer of perks and offices.

However, these factors by themselves do not provide the full explanation for the defections from the Congress of ambitious politicians such as Mr. Scindia. Although the RSS-BJP leadership may be authoritarian, the political environment within the Congress seems to be far more stifling of dissent. The decades-long vice-like control of the party by the Gandhi family and its sycophants is the main reason for this repressive atmosphere. Bright and gifted second-rung figures in the party are afraid of expressing disagreement with the Gandhi family’s views, leave alone criticise them, even in private. One wonders how these talented politicians, many of whom have been denied their due place despite their capabilities, have continued to remain within the fold despite the clearly oppressive atmosphere.

Speculation is rife that Sachin Pilot, passed over for the Chief Minister’s position of Rajasthan, may be contemplating following Mr. Scindia’s footsteps. Some observers believe that one of the reasons why Mr. Scindia and Mr. Pilot, both in their 40s, have been passed over for the positions they coveted and possibly deserved is because of Sonia Gandhi’s apprehension that they may outshine her son, also in his 40s, and capture the party’s leadership.

If true, this is an example of the worst form of nepotistic behaviour, and it has likely written the political death warrant of India’s Grand Old Party. The Congress seems to have become so organisationally decrepit that it is difficult to imagine that it can revive itself. Over the years, it has become increasingly clear that the ‘first family’ is precipitating the decline of the very institution that it was charged with safeguarding. Mr. Scindia’s defection has brought the party closer to such an end-game scenario.

341,2020/03/12,Ruling against judicial transparency,"A recent Supreme Court verdict has barred citizens from accessing court records under the RTI Act

In its recent decision, in the Chief Information Commissioner v. High Court of Gujarat case, the Supreme Court, regrettably, barred citizens from securing access to court records under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Instead, the court held that such records can be accessed only through the rules laid down by each High Court under Article 225 of the Constitution. The Registry of the Supreme Court was litigating a similar case (Registrar, Supreme Court of India v. R.S. Misra) before the Delhi High Court for several years after the CIC had ordered it to provide copies of pleadings filed in a case, under the RTI Act, rather than insisting on litigants filing an application under the Supreme Court Rules.

Though the particular decision taken earlier this month does not preclude the application of the RTI Act to the administrative side of the court, it does firmly slam the door shut on accessing, under the RTI Act, the millions of court records filed on the judicial side.

Importance of sharing records

Before explaining the faults and the consequences with this decision of the Supreme Court, it is necessary to understand the importance of court records to public discourse in India. A significant number of decisions taken by the courts influence our daily life. Every prosecution before a criminal court is essentially an opportunity to hold the police accountable just as every writ petition is an opportunity to hold the government accountable. Similarly, a significant number of commercial lawsuits are opportunities to learn more about corporations and the manner in which commercial translations are executed in the country.

In all of these cases, the pleadings filed by either party contain reams of information that are useful to a range of stakeholders such as citizens, journalists, academics, shareholders, etc., who can better inform the public discourse on the ramifications of these decisions. This is especially true in cases of public interest litigation, where the courts indulge in policymaking on the basis of the report of an amicus curiae or an expert committee set up by judges. The reports of these committees are not accessible to third parties, though they may be impacted by these decisions, because they form part of the court record and are hence outside the purview of the RTI Act.

There is no question of arguing for the confidentiality of these records because it is by now a well-recognised principle that all judicial proceedings must take place in open court, unless prohibited by law for reasonable purposes. But, while it is completely legal for anyone to sit in court and take notes while a lawyer narrates the content of pleadings, the courts make it as difficult as possible to access the pleadings in a simple manner. That said, for those with deeper pockets, it is only a matter of paying out a bribe to get copies of pleadings “informally”.

The overriding Section

The Supreme Court’s verdict in this case hinged on Section 22 of the RTI Act which states that the RTI Act shall override any other law to the extent that the latter is inconsistent with the former. The Section states: “Act to have an overriding effect — The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923), and any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act.” A clause such as Section 22 is known as non-obstante clause and is a common drafting device used by legislatures to permit certain actions regardless of what is mentioned in existing legislation.

The wording of the provision reveals that the drafters of the RTI Act were clearly aware that it may conflict with other laws and wanted to ensure that the procedure under the Act overruled the procedure in existing legislation. Despite this crystal-clear wording of Section 22, the Supreme Court and, on previous occasions, the High Courts, have concluded exactly the opposite.

The court’s reasoning has three steps to it.

First, it concludes that there is no inconsistency between the RTI Act and the court rules. This is factually incorrect because the Gujarat High Court Rules unlike the RTI Act require the submission of an affidavit stating the purpose of seeking copies of the pleadings. The RTI Act requires no reasons to be provided while seeking information.

Second, the court argues that, “A special enactment or rule cannot be held to be overridden by a later general enactment simply because the latter opens up with a non-obstante clause, unless there is clear inconsistency between the two legislations.” But that is exactly the point of an non-obstante clause. The accompanying factual inaccuracy, is its conclusion that there is no inconsistency between the Gujarat High Court rules and the RTI Act.

The third limb, of the court’s reasoning was its conclusion that Section 22 could not be read in a manner to imply repeal of other laws, such as the Gujarat High Court Rules. The court states that if the intention was to repeal another law, the legislature would have specifically stated so in the RTI Act, as was done in Section 31 when the RTI Act repealed the previous Freedom of Information Act, 2002. This reasoning is bewildering because it would render non-obstante clauses entirely useless.

From a citizen’s perspective, this decision is problematic for two reasons. One, most High Court Rules allow only parties to a legal proceeding to access the records of a case. Some High Courts may allow third parties to access court records if they can justify their request. This is entirely unlike the RTI Act, where no reasons are required to be provided thereby vastly reducing the possibility of administrative discretion.

Logistical difficulties

The second reason this judgment spells bad news is that unlike the RTI Act, the procedure under the Rules of most High Courts is challenging from a logistical perspective, apart from lacking in any significant safeguards. An application under the RTI Act can be made by post, with the fee being deposited through a postal order. The procedure is simple enough to enable most citizens file RTI applications by themselves. Not so for the procedure under the High Court Rules. Most High Courts and the Supreme Court require physical filing of an application with the Registry, and a hearing before a judge to determine whether records should be given. In an atmosphere where it is becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary litigants to even enter court premises because of thoughtless measures in the name of security, it becomes a logistical nightmare for citizens to file an application with the Registry.

The Supreme Court fails to understand that the judiciary’s track record of transparency is vastly inferior when compared to other arms of the state. In today’s world where every public institution is striving to become more transparent, the continued resistance from the judiciary to making itself transparent in a meaningful manner will have an eroding effect on its legitimacy.

342,2020/03/12,A COVID-19 control plan made simple,"The country needs a dedicated disaster management operation, with the Prime Minister at the helm

The COVID-19 outbreak is not yet an epidemic in India — as of today. From what is happening globally, a huge epidemic, an avalanche, growing bigger week after week, is predictable. Today it is a crisis looming on the horizon, but tomorrow it may turn out to be a disaster of unprecedented proportions.

The track record

Culturally we are always optimistic; we do not react fast as most problems, even outbreaks, have a tendency to settle down. So far we have stoically confronted all the new and resurgent communicable diseases that appeared in recent decades. We have shown surge capacity of crisis management during the 2018 Nipah epidemic in Kerala. We handled the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) scare of 2003 extremely efficiently. The 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 was also confronted reasonably well. Our weakness in dealing with seasonal influenza is embarrassing: there is no national policy to control seasonal flu. We ignore the high flu death rates reported annually. We manage short-term crisis very well but not long-term disease control — like running a short sprint but with no stamina to go on running a marathon.

Also read | COVID-19 now a pandemic, says WHO; India confirms 60 cases

From early February the reality of a very unusual SARS COVID-19 epidemic was known to all Health Ministry officers. In early January only China was known to have the coronavirus, but today more than 100 countries are affected. That speed is about the same as that of the pandemic influenza H1N1 of 2009.

What comes first

The onerous responsibility of confronting SARS COVID-19 does not rest with the Union Health Secretary who is the administrative head of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. It does not rest with the Director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) unless specifically empowered; The NCDC functions well only when smaller problems erupt in various States. The Director General of Health Services (DGHS) could be the person, but epidemic control is more than health-care service. The DGHS has limited executive powers and there is no competent public health infrastructure under the Directorate. The job of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under the unified command of the Secretary Department of Health Research-cum-DG ICMR, is to research all questions identified by the DGHS and the Director of the NCDC. We do need research but priority number one is the control of the epidemic.

The Minister for Health is a key person but this epidemic is more than a medical problem. Many ministries such as those of travel, tourism, industry, education, economics, railways and local governments are all being affected. So this disease avalanche requires responses of unprecedented speed, spread and magnitude.

Also read | What is a pandemic?

All officials listed above have a hundred and one things on their minds all the time. India needs a dedicated disaster management operation for this epidemic. The one person who can, and must, take immediate responsibility and manage the crisis the best possible way is none other than the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister should declare a national emergency and establish a ‘war-machinery’, with a ‘task force’ of the best experts in the country, of proven capability and track record against communicable diseases.

The war room should have all necessary facilities and should run a 24-hour control room. The support of the Ministers of all the relevant Ministries and their officers should be accessible to the task force. The job of the task force ought to have one goal: manage the epidemic, to minimise the spread and damage of the virus, and to mitigate the sufferings of all people everywhere.

COVID-19 | ‘Heat is not a deterrent for transmission’: Your COVID-19 queries answered

Once the task force designs a strategy with tactics, the Ministry of Health as well as all Ministries must implement them. The terms of reference of the task force must include the design of immediate, short-term, medium-term and long-term responses. The absence of such an empowered agency has had serious repercussions.

The slip-ups

International airports were instructed by the Ministry concerned to screen all passengers arriving from China. That was fine and towards January-end and early-February, two individuals returning from Wuhan, China, to Kerala were detected to be infected with “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)”. The time to establish a national agency such as the task force to advise the government on all necessary interventions was immediately thereafter. A 24-hour control room should have been operational by the second week of February. The infection was rapidly expanding in various countries. Shortly thereafter some 24 countries outside China, Hong Kong and Macau were known to be infected. When was Italy identified as a potential source of virus in travellers? On February 20, the following countries had reported over 20 infections: Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Italy was not in that list.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The next day Italy had 20 cases; thereafter the daily numbers were 79, 155, 229 and 322. Italy was identified as a potential source for screening of air travellers only on March 1. On February 29 a family travelling from Italy to Kerala did not fall within the screening net. That flaw resulted in a cluster of cases in Kerala — Italy should have been identified as a potential source on February 22 when the number of cases jumped from 20 to 79. All existing agencies and officers have many responsibilities. An agency exclusively for managing a constant and continuous watch on all developments — biomedical and sociological — and to recommend remedial and containment measures is essential in order to face this epidemic.

Public education must be technically correct and timely. Only one agency should be the source of all information; the cacophony prevalent now must be curbed. The ball is in the Prime Minister’s court.

343,2020/03/12,A royal somersault: On Jyotiraditya Scindia’s defection,"Mr. Scindia’s switch to the BJP poses questions about the politics he professed until now

Jyotiraditya Scindia’s departure from the Congress and his arrival in the BJP reveal many traits of both parties and the man himself. That he is termed as the lost future of the Congress is itself an irony, but a more intriguing question is whether the party was intuitive in not humouring any further someone who could so effortlessly cross over to the opposite ideological extreme. His aunt and BJP leader Yashodhara Raje Scindia likened his switch to a “homecoming”. In his crossing over, he also betrayed a popular mandate that he himself worked to win for the Congress in Madhya Pradesh in 2018. The Kamal Nath government is likely to collapse, and Shivraj Singh Chouhan who lost the poll appears set to return as CM with Mr. Scindia’s collaboration. As for the Congress, which needs every morsel to keep itself alive, it can ill-afford the loss of a State government and an urbane face who has a wider appeal. With his decamping, a new template is on offer for other Congress leaders who are ambitious and impatient at the same time, and are free of the force of conviction. The Congress is drifting into an annihilating eddy. Its interim president, Sonia Gandhi, still its most authoritative person, will have to do what is in her command to steer it back on course. His exit poses two questions for the Congress — the commitment of its leaders to a core ideology, and what it can do to hold itself together in this moment of crisis. Surely, the party needs to promote a new crop of young and rooted leaders from the country’s social diversity, who find it a vehicle of their aspirations and political empowerment.

Mr. Scindia’s formal ordination as a Hindutva torchbearer will not automatically raise him to a dominion role in a party so overwhelmingly under the personalised command of Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. True, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the abrupt nullification of Jammu and Kashmir’s special constitutional status last year, but he had also openly called out the BJP government’s insensitivity and inefficiency in controlling the communal violence in Delhi in February. Mr. Scindia will have to earn his saffron stripes, and the rites of that initiation will be prolonged and testing. The BJP, and the Modi-Shah combine that rail against dynastic and entitlement politics, will have to spin a new story for Mr. Scindia, who will be the fifth Gwalior royalty to adorn a formal position in the party. His father, Madhavrao Scindia, who spent most of his life as a Congressman, had started his career as a Jan Sangh leader. While his lineage might be a burden of sorts in the anti-elite politics that the current BJP leadership claims to promote, the aged association of his family with Hindutva politics could make him eligible for a welcome that the RSS usually does not offer to latecomers. As he said, it will be a new beginning.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-royal-somersault-the-hindu-editorial-on-jyotiraditya-scindias-defection/article31043253.ece
344,2020/03/12,For a level playing field: On election reforms,"ECI’s plans to strengthen the electoral process are welcome, but some require scrutiny

Even as electoral democracy has taken strong root in India, there is no gainsaying the fact that some unhealthy patterns have emerged. While voter electoral participation has remained robust, with the poor voting in large numbers, candidates and winners in Assembly and Lok Sabha polls have largely been from affluent sections — some even with several criminal cases against them. With elections becoming expensive, most parties have sought to field richer candidates irrespective of their merit in representing public interest. Current campaign finance regulations by the Election Commission of India that seek transparency on expenses by party and candidate, and prescribe limits on a candidate’s expenditure, have not been sufficient deterrents. Poll results have tended to be a function of either party or leader preference by the voter rather than a statement on the capability of the candidate. In many cases, capable candidates stand no chance against the money power of more affluent candidates. News that the ECI is considering tightening ways to cap the expenditure of parties is therefore quite welcome, as it should provide a more level playing field. But even this can be meaningful only if there is more transparency in campaign finance which suggests that the electoral bonds system, as it is in place now, is untenable. The ECI has also suggested bringing social media and print media under the “silent period” ambit after campaigning ends. Regulating social media will be difficult and it remains to be seen how the ECI will implement this.

The ECI’s plans to introduce new “safe and secure” voting methods, however, need thorough scrutiny. The use now of the EVM as a standalone, one-time programmable chip-based system, along with administrative safeguards renders it a safe mechanism that is not vulnerable to hacking. Any other “online” form of voting that is based on networked systems should be avoided. The idea of an Aadhaar-linked remote voting system that is sought to be built as a prototype could be problematic considering how the unique identity card has excluded genuine beneficiaries when used in welfare schemes, not to mention the inherent vulnerabilities in its recognition mechanisms. Two key measures are missing from the recommendations — the need for more teeth for the ECI in its fight against “vote buying” and hate speech. Increasingly, parties have resorted to bribing voters in the form of money and other commodities in return for votes, and while the ECI has tried to warn outfits or in some cases postponed polls, these have not deterred them. In times when hate speech is used during elections, the ECI has only managed to rap the offending candidates or party spokespersons on the knuckles but stricter norms including disqualification of the candidate would be needed for true deterrence.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-level-playing-field-the-hindu-editorial-on-election-reforms/article31043259.ece
345,2020/03/12,Garbage woes: Protesters meet CM,"Community members from Doddabelavangala, near Doddaballapur on the city’s outskirts, who have been demanding the closure of an MSGP waste processing unit, met with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in Bengaluru on Thursday. They have also been demanding that another unit which has been shut since 2016, be scrapped.

The Chief Minister, after listening to the representatives, reportedly stated categorically that the MSGP would continue to function. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has not been sending waste to the processing unit since the protest began on Friday.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar told The Hindu that for leachate storage and treatment, the civic body would be installing some systems in place. This would be done under the guidance of Bengaluru rural district in-charge and Revenue Minister R. Ashok and CM’s Political Advisor and Yelahanka MLA S.R.

346,2020/03/12,Probe ordered into notice on ‘J&K employees’ from police,"City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has ordered a probe into the notice issued by the Sampigehalli police to Manyata tech park on March 5 seeking details of employees from Jammu and Kashmir. He said on Thursday that the notice would immediately be withdrawn.

The notice included a proforma to fill in details such as name of employee, mobile number, residential address in the city, permanent address in J&K, and duration of employment. These details were sought purportedly to “maintain law and order”.

Mr. Rao told The Hindu that there has been no instruction to e-police stations to issue such a notice and that he was not aware of it. “At any cost, we will not profile any section of society. The notice will be immediately withdrawn. I have asked the DCP to probe the matter and submit a report soon,” he said.

The notice came under severe criticism from human rights activists and people from J&K. “While abrogating Article 370, the government said it was to integrate J&K into the country. But ever since, Kashmiris — students, employees and traders — have been discriminated against in myriad ways. The notice issued by the Bengaluru police is only the latest form of discrimination. Such moves create anxiety and fear in Kashmiris outside, but also in their relatives in J&K. The government should instead take measures to quell such fears,” said Nasir Khuehami, spokesperson of the J&K Students’ Association.

“The police cannot issue notices seeking details of persons like this without any evidence of wrongdoing [by them]. This amounts to profiling,” said Vinay Sreenivasa, activist and advocate. “The Marathahalli police station had issued a notice to the slum in Kariyammana Agrahara that was later illegally evicted by the police. The Commissioner claimed he was not in the know. How can police inspectors issue arbitrary notices without the knowledge of superior officers?”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/probe-ordered-into-notice-on-jk-employees-from-police/article31053223.ece
347,2020/03/12,COVID-19 | Schools in Bengaluru to remain shut starting today,"Summer holidays begin for class 1 to 6 students; children of class 7 to 10 should only come to school to write examinations

School managements in Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts have been directed to suspend classes immediately.

Only students of Classes 7 to 10 should come to school, and only to write the year-end examination, said Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar at a press conference on Thursday. This is applicable for students across all boards.

The minister also announced that summer vacation for students of Class 1 to 6 will begin on Friday. Earlier this week, the department had announced that classes would be suspended for students in pre-primary sections and those in class 1 to 5 until further notice.

No assessment

No assessment will be conducted for State board students till Class 6. “Students in State board schools of these classes will be evaluated based on their early academic performance. We have conducted four formative assessments as well as one summative assessment and we will evaluate students based on those,” said Mr. Kumar.

He added that while it was mandatory for schools to begin summer vacation from Friday for students till class 6 across all schools, those affiliated with other boards can decide on the assessment process.

The government has decided this course of action as a precautionary measure with five new cases of COVID-19 being detected in the city. The Minister stated that students from class 7 to 10 in Bengaluru should come to school only to appear for the examination.

Private schools, too, will have to comply with the government’s decision. Some schools have asked even class 7 students to stay at home. “I received a notice from my son’s school in Sarjapur that his class 7 examinations have been cancelled,” said one parent.

However, the Private Schools’ Association stated that many schools were not complying with the government order and were conducting classes. They have demanded that disciplinary action be taken against those who violate the department’s directions.

In other parts of the state, school managements will have to stick to the advanced examination schedule announced by the department.

No change in SSLC examination schedule

Amidst rumours doing the rounds that SSLC examination will be advanced, the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board has clarified that there will be no changes in the Class 10 board examination schedule.

V. Sumangala, director of the board said the examinations will take place between March 27 and April 9. She asked students, parents and teachers not to listen to rumours and focus on their preparation instead. The rumours surfaced on social media platforms after people tested positive for COVID-19 in Bengaluru.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar also dismissed rumours on Thursday. “Students can wear masks if they wish to for the board examination. Additional precautionary measures will be taken based on the situation.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-schools-in-bengaluru-to-remain-shut-starting-today/article31052394.ece
348,2020/03/12,HC notice to Bescom on transformers on footpaths,"The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday ordered issue of notices to the State government, the Bangalore Electicity Supply Company Ltd (Bescom), and the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on a PIL petition complaining that the authorities have failed to remove and relocate transformers and other electrical installations from footpaths and roadside drains.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S Kinagi issued the direction on a petition filed by G.B. Athri, a retired Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force.

Pointing out that Bescom, in a reply to information sought under the RTI Act, had in June 2017 informed the petitioner that there are 8,659 transformers installed on roads, footpaths and storm water drains, the petition says Bescom has not taken action for removing such transformers from footpaths and drains despite several reminders.

While contending that the Bescom, in an earlier PIL petition proceedings during 2015, had indicated to the court that it was in the process of removing their electrical installations from footpaths, the petitioner alleged that no action action was taken to remove such transformers, which are posing hardship to pedestrians besides endangering the lives of public in case of electrical accidents.

The Bench also directed Bescom, in its statement of objection, to specifically state about the action taken based on a series of representations given by the petitioner.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-notice-to-bescom-on-transformers-on-footpaths/article31051500.ece
349,2020/03/12,BWSSB employee dies as tree falls on his car,"Incident occurred within Board’s premises at Swami Vivekananda Road

Falling trees and branches are proving to be dangerous for pedestrians and motorists as in a span of two days one man was killed and a girl is battling for her life in separate tree-related accidents.

A 52-year-old Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board employee succumbed to his injuries on Thursday evening after a huge tree crashed on his car earlier in the day.

The incident occurred within the Board’s premises at Swami Vivekananda Road on Thursday afternoon where Srinivas worked as a fitter in the south-east division. He had been on extended medical leave after his leg had been amputated to stop the spread of gangrene.

However, he had come to office on Thursday afternoon around 1.30 p.m., with his wife and son, and was hoping to seek permission to resume work. “As he couldn’t walk, his wife and son went into the BWSSB office to seek permission from the Assistant Executive Engineer Nagaraj K., while Srinivas was sitting in the backseat of the car,” said a police officer.

Minutes later, a huge tree fell and crushed the car. BWSSB staff ran out and managed to extricate him from the car. “He had sustained injuries to his head. They took him to a hospital where he succumbed on Thursday evening.

“Around 15 people, including staff members, were at the office and had a narrow escape,” a senior police officer said.

The Halasuru police have taken up a case of natural death and are investigating. Civic commissioner B. H. Anil Kumar, when contacted, said that the maintenance of the tree is the responsibility of the BWSSB and not the BBMP.

Eight-year-old critical

On Wednesday, at 8.40 a.m., a dry branch from a peepal tree fell on her near Anjaneyaswamy temple at Kundalahalli, Ramamurthy Nagar, while she was riding pillion on a scooter with her father, Y. Raju. He was dropping her off to school.

According to the police, Mr. Raju slowed down to negotiate a hump when the tree branch fell on his daughter. “She fell from the two-wheeler having sustained severe head injuries. He lost his balance and slipped,” said a police officer.

Passers-by rushed her to a private hospital where she is in the ICU. Her condition is said to be critical. As word of the injury spread to surrounding neighbourhoods, residents gathered at the accident spot to protest against the BBMP. Many alleged that it was negligence on the part of the civic body as they had brought up the problem of dead branches on the peepal tree and the risk posed to passers-by. A case has been registered at K.R. Puram police station against BBMP officials and probe under way.

BBMP Mayor M. Goutham Kumar, and commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar on Thursday visited the hospital where the girl is being treated and assured the family that medical expenses would be borne by the civic body. Mr. Anil Kumar, who said that he was saddened by the incident, claimed that forest officials had attempted to clear the dead branch a week ago. “However, they were prevented from doing so by local residents. The BBMP has already taken up tree census, and we urge citizens to cooperate,” he said.

Mr. Goutham Kumar said he would meet with forest and horticulture departments and direct them to identify dry branches and clear them immediately to ensure that such accidents do not recur. Padmavathi Srinivas, chairperson of the Standing Committee for Markets and local councillor, has given ₹1 lakh from her personal funds to the victim’s family.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8-year-old-girl-among-two-injured-in-tree-fall/article31051082.ece
350,2020/03/12,COVID-19 | Small travel agencies struggle to survive,"Both domestic and international tourism have taken a hit

Travel agencies are already reeling from the impact of COVID-19 and are flooded with requests for cancellation. Many of the smaller agencies, who are finding it difficult to operate, are considering shutting down operations temporarily.

It’s not just international travel but also domestic tourism that is taking a hit. What’s worrying owners is the uncertainty of the situation. Sanjar Imam, president of Karnataka Tourism Forum, said: “We do not know how long this situation will persist and cannot foresee when things will improve,” he said.

People in the tourism industry are recommending that clients put off plans in public interest. “More than travelling to a place where there are no infected cases, people may be at risk during the journey itself and that is why it’s best to be cautious.”

A travel agent in west Bengaluru stated that they were considering temporarily closing their company as they could not afford to pay salaries for six of their employees. “We have been receiving an average of 20 cancellations per day,” he said.

Suspension of tourist visas

The government’s decision to suspend all tourist and student visas as well as the visa-free entry of Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) card holders is making itself felt.

Rajesh Magow, Group CEO, MakeMyTrip in a statement said, “So far there are no restrictions or advisories issued for domestic travel. The period between February till the end of March is typically a lean period because of exam season but we are seeing a demand slowdown for the upcoming summer holiday season especially for international travel.”

The silver lining for consumers is most travel agencies are willing to reschedule bookings without additional charges. “I planned to travel to Andaman with my family. But I decided to cancel my plans due to the situation. I was told that I can reschedule my travel any time till September,” said a 37 year old media professional.

Some operators are giving full refunds for international flight bookings to affected countries such as China, France, Italy, Iran and Japan for travel dates up to March 31.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/4v5o94/article31073388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGCORONATOUROPERATORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-small-travel-agencies-struggle-to-survive/article31050729.ece

352,2020/03/12,"Karaga, Kempe Gowda Jayanti celebrations on same day, for now","Final decision will be taken later after assessment of COVID-19 cases

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has tentatively decided to go ahead with celebrating the Bengaluru Karaga and has started preparing for it. It is also planning to celebrate Kempe Gowda Jayanti on the same day. However, this is dependent on the situation on ground and the incidence of COVID-19 in the city.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said though it was too early to decide on the nature of the celebration this year in the wake of COVID-19 and cholera, he said the civic body will take all precautionary and preventive measures as there will be a huge gathering of people. The senior civic officials along with the police will inspect the karaga route on Thursday.

“As of now, Karaga will be celebrated in the usual manner. There is still time to decide whether celebrations will be on a large scale, as usual, or whether it will be celebrated in a simple but traditional manner,” he said, adding that there still was 28 days to go.

This year, the 11-day annual Karaga festival will be held from March 31 to April 9. The BBMP will work with the Health Department and consult with stakeholders on precautionary measures to be taken.

This was decided at a preparatory meeting on Karaga festival on Wednesday, which was attended by senior civic officials and trustees of the Dharmaraya temple.

A senior BBMP official informed The Hindu that the civic body had asked the BWSSB to keep a check on water supplied across the city, especially the old pete area where the procession and other rituals of Karaga take place.

Former Mayor P.R. Ramesh, one of the main organisers of Bengaluru Karaga, expressed confidence on celebrations going as planned. “The Karaga is an important living heritage of the city that had to be celebrated on the full moon day of the first month of the Lunar Hindu calendar (Chaitra masa). However, if the situation demands, it will be celebrated in a simple way without compromising on traditional rituals” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9ve5l6/article31046604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGKARAGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/karaga-kempe-gowda-jayanti-celebrations-on-same-day-for-now/article31046605.ece
353,2020/03/12,Mental health counselling for quarantined persons,"2,662 people are under surveillance for being in contact with the first positive case

Living under quarantine with fears of a possible COVID-19 infection can be traumatic and this has led the State Health Department has started offering counselling to those in hospitals and isolated in homes.

District mental health counsellors are following up through telephonic counselling apart from regular follow up by surveillance teams, said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Medical Education and Health and Family Welfare).

“While putting people in quarantine has proved to be effective in controlling epidemics, it is important that the process is sensitive enough to ensure that such people do not suffer mental agony. Due to misconceptions going around about the disease, some people think that they are going to die and such thoughts may affect their recovery,” the official said. He said the mental health counsellors will call them every day and reassure them that quarantine does not mean they are being stigmatised.

Around 2,662 people are under surveillance for being primary and secondary contacts of the first positive case. His wife and daughter also tested positive and the family has been quarantined in the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD).

B.G. Prakash Kumar, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases) said of the 2,662 contacts of the first case, 1,865 are students of the school where the techie’s daughter studies. While all are under under surveillance (medical observation), 28 of her classmates are under home isolation,” he said.

While 46 people travelled with him on the flight from the US via Dubai, four other people he was in contact with include the driver and the driver’s family, 15 people worked with him, a few others were children the daughter played with and the remaining people in his apartment.

“A team including a medical officer has been placed at the apartment complex (containment zone) round the clock. Disinfection as per protocols have been done at all places visited by the cases since arrival in India including workplaces. Cleaning staff in the apartment complex have been trained regarding disinfection and regular cleaning advice given,” he said.

Meanwhile, no new COVID-19 cases were reported in the State on Wednesday.

All patients stable

All the four positive cases, under treatment in RGICD, have responded well to treatment and are recovering, said RGICD Director C. Nagaraj.

“While three of the four cases have no symptoms now, one has mild fever and body ache. The 46-year-old techie, who first tested positive, is recovering fast although he has pre-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. His wife and daughter are asymptomatic now,” the doctor said.

354,2020/03/12,International conferences in State postponed,"In the wake of COVID-19, the State government has taken a decision to postpone all international conferences in Karnataka with immediate effect till further notice. An official advisory in this regard will be released soon, said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Medical Education and Health and Family Welfare).

“With most of the suspected cases being those who are arriving in Bengaluru from COVID-19-affected countries, it is important to restrict entry of people from other countries in case it can be avoided. Although not many international conferences are being slated in the next one month, it is important to postpone such conferences, if any have been planned,” Mr Akhtar told The Hindu.

He pointed out that the government of India has already suspended visas and e-visas granted on or before March 11 to nationals of three major European countries — France, Germany and Spain.

Regular visas (including e-visas) granted to all foreign nationals who have travel history to these countries on or after February 1, 2020 and who have not yet entered India also stands suspended, he said.

Meeting with IT/BT companies

The State Health Department will hold another meeting with IT/ BT companies on Thursday to brief them about the guidelines and precautions they need to take in their companies regarding COVID-19.

While the Health Department has maintained confidentiality about the positive cases, two IT companies have come out with statements regarding their employees being infected.

“Patient confidentiality has to be maintained. Such statements are not required as they can lead to further panic in the community and among the employees. It is important for the companies to maintain confidentiality and we will issue them a notice,” said Health Minister B Sriramulu. The Department has already has two rounds of meeting with representatives of 25 companies.

He said the department cannot ask the companies to completely ban foreign travel at this juncture, but have asked them to follow all guidelines and avoid unnecessary travel.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/international-conferences-in-state-postponed/article31044109.ece
355,2020/03/12,COVID-19: ‘Stay more than 3 ft. away from a person who is sick’,"With panic over the spread of COVID-19, there are several misconceptions and queries about the disease and how people can avoid complications. V. Ravi, senior professor and Head of Department of Neurovirology in NIMHANS, answers some frequently asked questions. Excerpts:

What are the big misconceptions about the spread of the virus?

Among the big misconceptions are that it is spread through air and you can get it from pets and animals. Available evidence clearly indicates that the main mode of spread is through droplet infection either from close contact with an infected person or touching contaminated surfaces and subsequently touching nose, eye, or mouth without washing hands.

How long does the virus survive in the atmosphere?

It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions such as type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment.

If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

How does a person get infected?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than one-metre (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

Who are the most vulnerable in COVID-19?

While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. Having said that everyone is at risk of contracting infection as this is a novel virus and there is no evidence at this point of time to assume that there is pre-existing immunity to it in the population.

Vulnerability can be reduced by practising hand hygiene, not touching eyes, nose or mouth unless you have washed hands. Avoiding crowded places, practising cough etiquette, and postponing travel that is not necessary will certainly help.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

When should a person seek medical help?

People with fever, cough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

How to avoid complications?

Seeking prompt medical help for signs and symptoms avoids complications.

Should one wear a mask to protect oneself?

Wear a mask only if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can be used only once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/stay-more-than-3-ft-away-from-a-person-who-is-sick/article31044104.ece

357,2020/03/12,TNERC directs Tangedco to provide service connection to residential project,"It warns of action against officials if the connection is not given by April 7

The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has directed the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) to provide service connections to Navin Housing & Properties Pvt Ltd’s residential project in Medavakkam before April 7. It warned of action against officials if the direction is not complied with.

As per norms, if the total demand of the housing complex exceeds 5 Mega Volt Amp, it is mandatory for developer to provide 225 sq.metre for erecting a compact sub-station within the periphery of the city limits.

Navin Housing said it had earmarked around 357.95 sq. m but the Tangedco officials were refusing to take over the land offered. Instead, the Tangedco was insisting for 400 sq. m, which was contrary to the regulations.

Because of such an abnormal delay, applications for new service connections for 412 dwelling units were not yet processed and flat owners were putting pressure on the builders to allow them to occupy the flats, the developer said.

The Tangedco said while the regulation prescribed 225 sq. m land generally, it should be in a regular rectangle or square shape to erect the sub-station with accessibility to the roadside for maintenance which was important to minimise shut-downs and sought for more land.

The TNERC directed Tangedco to process the new service connections without waiting for sub-station and to take over the open space reserve land by approaching the local body, for which builder would pay the market price.

It said if the service connections are not effected as directed, action would be taken under section 142 of the Electricity Act, 2003, which provided for penalty for non-compliance.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tnerc-directs-tangedco-to-provide-service-connection-to-residential-project/article31048077.ece
358,2020/03/12,"Never aspired to be CM, want resurgence first: Rajinikanth","Rajinikanth shies away from specifying if and when he will launch his political party.

Claiming that he never aspired to be Chief Minister, actor Rajinikanth on Thursday propagated three political ideas, as a ‘preview’ to his brand of politics, and declared that he wanted to “see a wave of resurgence” and an endorsement for them from the people before taking the political plunge.

Though he felt that in the absence of former Chief Ministers M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa this was an opportune moment to oust the Dravidian parties and create a 1967-like “revolution”, he did not specify if and when he would launch his political party.

He did not take any questions at the “press conference” he convened in the city, where he delivered a 30-minute speech.

Mr. Rajinikanth said he wanted to separate the party leadership and the government, induct talented youngsters into politics and create a party council (headed by him), which would appoint a capable and young Chief Minister (and Council of Ministers), and abolish thousands of party posts to prevent party functionaries from influencing governance.

“People voted 30% for the DMK and the AIADMK and 70% for Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) and Jayalalithaa. This is the best time to enter politics and push for change. We need to create an uprising, revolution, a wave that will sweep away the power of money, men and party structure. I believe that it is possible in Tamil Nadu,” the actor said.

Also Read Star power alone not enough, says Rajini

He urged his fans to take this message to every corner of Tamil Nadu. “I want to see that uprising among the people. This should spread throughout India – party and government should be separate,” he said.

“Don’t do it for Rajinikanth…for Tamil Nadu and people of Tamil Nadu. Political revolution must explode. Otherwise, what is the point? I will just be one of the players – getting 15%-20% – and merely divide votes. Do I get another chance? Am I 44 or 50? I am 71. I have survived (after health setback). My body is patched up. I will be 76 in 2026. When you don’t accept my idea now, how will you accept it in 2026? Let me see the uprising, revolution among people, I will come then,” he said.

Mr. Rajinikanth said that miracles and revolutions are possible in Tamil Nadu.

“I believe that a change is possible. Tamil Nadu is known for revolutions. Gandhi decided to wear only loin cloth in Tamil Nadu. Vivekananda said his famous lines ‘Give me 100 youngsters, I will change the world’. It was here in Tamil Nadu that a regional party dislodged the Congress in the 1960s.

360,2020/03/12,HC strikes down law that restricts hoardings on private land,"‘No rationality in totally excluding private land or govt. land’

The Madras High Court on Wednesday struck down a legal provision which restricted erection of hoardings only to lands belonging to local bodies in the State and held that even those who want to erect hoardings on private lands as well as on lands owned by entities such as Southern Railway could make necessary applications.

Allowing a batch of writ petitions filed by Chennai Hoardings Association and others against an amendment introduced in 2018, Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad rejected the argument that there could be better control and monitoring if hoardings were permitted only on lands belonging to local bodies.

“The regulation and control as per the municipal laws will apply equally and, therefore, the placing of a hoarding at place A or at place B would hardly make a difference. While granting licence, the Corporation has the authority not to grant licence at a particular place keeping in view the necessity or otherwise of placing such a restriction.

“Thus, there is no rationality in totally excluding private land or State government land or otherwise the land belonging to the Central government like the Railways. The choice to grant licence or otherwise is still there and any violation of the restrictions imposed can still be a matter of application by the municipal corporation.

“A place where a hoarding has to be set up has to be regulated and merely because the municipal corporation, through its employees, is unable to cope up with the monitoring process, the same cannot be a ground to exclude and classify private land or government land as untouchable or unavailable,” the Bench held.

It went on to state that such exclusion of lands amounted to prohibition and such curtailment also hits the fundamental rights of private land owners to enjoy their properties if a licence could be granted for erection of hoardings.

“The municipal corporation also cannot be permitted to raise hoardings on land belonging it, if it is otherwise not desirable or permissible,” the judges concluded.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/scf0el/article31044475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THHOARDINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-strikes-down-law-that-restricts-hoardings-on-private-land/article31044476.ece
361,2020/03/12,Transport staff call off sit-in,"Unions assured of inclusion in wage agreement talks

The Federation of Transport Trade Unions called off the sit-in on Wednesday evening after an assurance was given by officials of the State Transport department to include the trade unions in wage agreement talks.

A large number of drivers and conductors who are members of transport trade unions affiliated to the Opposition parties staged protests at various bus depots by not operating Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses on Wednesday morning. The delay in operation of buses during morning peak hours resulted in commuters facing difficulty in reaching their destinations.

M. Anand, a resident of Medavakkam, said that there were limited MTC buses being operated on the Tambaram route, resulting in commuters being forced to depend up on share autos. The few buses in operation were all packed during the morning rush hour.

Thousands of commuters bound for Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Central station bus stop and Broadway bus terminus were badly affected because of the traffic diversion caused by the protest held on Pallavan Salai. Commuterswanted the city police to not permit any protest on Pallavan Salai.

A senior official of the MTC said that initially the drivers and conductors refused to operate the buses by staging protests, complaining that there was no representation of the transport trade unions in wage agreement talks. He said that the first round of the talks is proposed to be held at Chromepet bus depot on March 20. Denying that the MTC bus services were affected by the sit-in, the transport official said that all 3,500 buses were operated on Wednesday.

A. Soundararajan, State president, CITU, said that the transport trade unions had gone on sit-in from Tuesday because they did not receive any invitation from the Transport department for the proposed wage agreement talks. However, based on the assurance from the Transport department officials that recognised trade unions would be part of the wage agreement talks, the protest was called off in the evening. He said that the union members have been ‘advised’ not to cause any hardship to commuters.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hhjidl/article31044458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THTRANSPORTSTAFFSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/transport-staff-call-off-sit-in/article31044459.ece

364,2020/03/12,CCB busts online loan racket,"Vacation club MD in the net for abetting fraud

The Bank Fraud Prevention Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) has unearthed a network of fraudsters operating call centres and duping the public on the pretext of arranging quick online loans.

In a series of arrests, the police on Wednesday held the managing director of a popular vacation club, who is also a functionary of the MGR Mandram of the AIADMK, for abetting the criminal gang. He was accused of allowing the gang to operate from his premises on Anna Salai and collecting commission from them.

A few months ago, several persons in the city and suburbs complained to the CCB about losing money to unidentified callers. The officers of the special unit, led by its Assistant Commissioner S. Prabakaran, found that the calls originated from Sembakkam, and after tracing the money trail, caught Mohammed Zaheerudin, 31, and his associate Salim, 40, last month while they were withdrawing money from an ATM in Teynampet. The duo and their associates were running an office in Sembakkam and holding bank accounts in fictitious names. The back-end offices were being operated by a few other suspects — one of them identified as Selva alias Selvakumar, 44.

Police said they arrested Selva and his associates Kumaran and Mithuen Rayan on Monday. They were running call centres by engaging telecallers who contacted people over the mobile phone and offered quick online loans on a commission basis or privilege cards. They asked victims to pay ₹5,000 to ₹45,000, depending upon the loan amount, into their accounts. After collecting the OTP number and other details from victims, they swindled the money.

On further investigation, the police zeroed in on the place where they were operating from. The police team found a full-fledged call centre in a shopping complex on Anna Salai, in the heart of the city. Investigations revealed that the premises had been sub-let to the gang by Benze Saravanan, managing director of Benze Vacations Club.

Selva and his associates entered into an understanding with Saravanan to utilise the premises since the latter was not able to pay the rent. They ran a call centre here for four months by engaging more than 100 telecallers, most of them women, police said. The telecallers were harassed by bouncers if they failed to meet monthly targets. “They were beaten in case they failed to achieve the target and sexually harassed,” said a police officer.

Police said Saravanan was paid ₹6,500 by the gang for each case of cheating.

366,2020/03/12,Two Minjur tanks to supply city,"WRD aims to increase storage of Kattur and Thataimanji to 350 mcft

By improving the capacity of two tanks near Minjur, the government aims to create another reservoir for the city.

According to Water Resources Department officials, the two tanks are in Kattur and Thataimanji near Minjur — nearly 35 km from Chennai.

The WRD project aims to not just augment Chennai’s water supply but also resolve drinking water issues in the Minjur region, which has been grappling with the challenge of seawater intrusion.

WRD plans to increase the storage capacity of the tanks, spread over 615 acres, by raising the height of the bund.

Unlike the upcoming Thervoy Kandigai-Kannankottai reservoir, where a common bund is being put up, WRD officials said that the height of the bund in the adjoining tanks would be raised to 7.1 m.

The storage capacity of the tanks is expected to increase from 58.27 million cubic feet (mcft) to 350 mcft. Nearly 1,700 mcft of surplus water is drained into the sea, every year, through the Araniar river, even after filling up the tanks, an official pointed out.

There are plans to convey water stored in the tanks to the nearest Metrowater pumping station. It may be recalled that Chennai Metrowater has not drawn from its Minjur well fields for several years now.

The sluices and regulators will be reconstructed. The carrying capacity of the channel conveying surplus water from the Araniar river to the Kattur tank will also be improved.

Moreover, the State government has also approved a proposal to construct a combination of check dam and sub-surface dyke across the Araniar river, in Andarmadam, as part of the ₹65-crore project.

Officials say that though groundwater is available at a depth of 2-3 m, it has turned saline. The storage structures will serve purposes of arresting seawater intrusion and groundwater recharge. The WRD has sought the support of IIT-Madras to design the structures. It plans to begin the project in three months with funding from the State government and NABARD.

In Minjur, several farmers continue to depend on the tanks for paddy and groundnut cultivation. According to a study by the Department of Geology, Anna University, seawater has intruded up to 14.7 km in the Minjur-Panchetti belt, over a length of 20 km along the coast.

Prof. L. Elango of the Department of Geology said instead of direct intervention in the affected region, the government must focus on groundwater recharge in the areas that have seen seawater intrusion. This would help improve water quality and flush seawater back to the sea.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p4l0vi/article31044264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/two-minjur-tanks-to-supply-city/article31044301.ece

On Tuesday night, six men were standing near a restaurant on Anna Salai. Following a heated argument, five of them forcibly pushed one person into a car and fled. The police control room was alerted.

Deputy Commissioner of Police, Triplicane, Dharamarajan immediately instructed the local Inspector, Mohandoss, to trace them.

The police team quickly traced the car near the clock tower in Royapettah. The inspector and his men rounded the gang, along with the kidnapped. The gang members attacked Mr. Mohandoss while he was trying to rescue the kidnapped person.

The police team overpowered them and rescued the businessman, identified as Faizuddin, 48, a resident of Chella Pillayar Koil Street. He runs a helmet shop in the city. He had borrowed ₹10 lakh from Raja Hussain, 48, of Madurai, for business expansion. As he failed to repay the loan, they had a running feud.

The police said that Raja Hussain had criminal cases against him, and on Tuesday, he came to the city court for a case. Faizuddin and Hussain had a conversation near the Buhari restaurant. As the former demanded more time to repay the amount, he was beaten up by Hussain and his men.

Raja Hussain; Mohamed Saizfulla, 27, of Madurai; Rahamadullah, 25; Asif Khan, 22; and Thowfiq, 22 of Tiruchi were arrested for criminal intimidation, kidnap and uttering obscene words.

368,2020/03/12,One donor and two ‘novel’ transplants,"Apollo Hospitals claims a first

Doctors at the Apollo Hospitals have claimed that they have performed Asia’s first combined bowel and abdominal wall transplant surgery on a teenager. An 18-year-old brain-dead donor gave a new lease of life to two patients — a teenager with ultra short bowel syndrome and a 35-year-old woman on dialysis for end-stage renal disease — and enabled doctors to perform two “novel” transplants on them.

The teenager underwent combined small bowel and abdominal wall transplant, while the woman received a kidney that was perfused with Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion (HOPE) at the Apollo Hospitals.

J. Shyamala, paediatrician, said that only a few bowel transplants were performed in the country — the reasons being lack of awareness among recipients, reluctance to donate abdominal wall and small bowel, need for a high level of preparedness, intensive care, pre and post-operative care.

“The 17-year-boy from Andhra Pradesh had extensive small bowel gangrene and underwent complete removal of the small bowel. He had lost 20 kg over two months, and came to us in March 2019. We put him under aggressive nutrition rehabilitation. He gained 18 kg in eight months and returned home,” she said. “Eleven months after his first admission, he underwent combined small bowel-abdominal wall transplant and was discharged on the 15th post-operative day. He is gradually gaining weight,” she said.

Doctors said that intestinal transplants were taking baby steps in India and that it still had a long way to go.

The kidney harvested from the donor was perfused with HOPE and preserved for 11 hours. Explaining this, Mohan Kumar, urologist, said: “It improved graft function, increased utilisation and reduces rejection.”

Venkatesh Rajkumar, nephrologist, said that kidney diseases were increasing in the community and in such circumstances, HOPE has tremendous scope to increase usability of organs.

370,2020/03/12,No more advance increment to T.N. government staff for higher qualification,"‘Lately, highly qualified persons like doctors, engineers taking up clerical jobs’

With several over-qualified candidates such as post-graduates, doctors and engineers increasingly joining the government service for clerical jobs, the Tamil Nadu government has decided to cancel the scheme of sanctioning advance increment to government staff, of all departments, for acquiring higher education qualification, with immediate effect.

Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam issued a G.O. on Tuesday in this regard to the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, cancelling all relevant G.O.s issued over the years for sanction of advance increment. The sanction of advance increment for passing Account Test for Sub-ordinate Officers Part-I has also been dropped with immediate effect.

The scheme for advance increment for passing the Account Test exam was initially introduced in 1963 to non-gazetted employees in the Ministerial Service. In 1972, advance increment was granted to engineers in Public Works Department. Since then, the scheme underwent several modifications and included several departments.

The scheme was introduced a few decades ago when the government realised that qualified persons were rarely identified for government posts. This was not the case anymore.

“But, in present days, highly qualified persons, including many professionals (doctors and engineers) are entering into government service... even for Group C posts like Assistants/ Junior Assistants/ Typists, etc., to do clerical jobs,” the G.O. pointed out.

Increasing number of educational institutions and qualified candidates, and pay anomalies in advance increment between seniors and juniors in a department, were cited as other reasons behind the decision.

“If a government servant needs promotion/appointment to a higher post which carries higher qualification, then it is the responsibility of the government servant to qualify himself/herself for promotion/appointment to that higher post.”

The government also pointed out that in several departments, the employees with higher qualification, like those with the required qualification, were “discharging the same duty of the post concerned in routine manner only.”

Various recruiting agencies are selecting qualified persons suitable for various government posts after conducting tests/examinations at various stages.

However, the advance increment for acquiring higher qualification already granted to government employees will not be recovered from candidates.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pd7xs3/article31044210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THGOVTSTAFF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/no-more-advance-increment-to-tn-government-staff-for-higher-qualification/article31044211.ece

Elangovan of Vellore in 2008 seeking details of fee and special fee collected from students in under-graduate and post-graduate courses since 2003 from Dhanabagiyam Krishnasamy Mudaliar College for Women (Autonomous), Sainathapuram, Islamiah College, Vaniyambadi, Mazharul Uloom College, Ambur, C. Abdul Hakeem College, Melvisharam and Vorhees College in Vellore district, under the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.

Not satisfied with the reply received from the Joint Directorate of Collegiate Education, the petitioner moved the commission which passed orders in 2009 directing the Public Information Officers of the respective colleges to provide the details sought under the Act. However, the colleges moved the Madras High Court by filing a writ petition challenging the order.

After hearing both sides, the court in 2019 passed orders directing the Commission to pass fresh orders after hearing all parties concerned.

In the fresh hearing that commenced later, the PIOs of Islamiah College and C. Abdul Hakeem College assured to provide details sought by the petitioner while the PIO of Mazharul Uloom College sought more time to furnish the same. The petitioner did not turn up for the hearing. The PIOs of Dhanabagiyam Krishnasamy Mudaliar College for Women (Autonomous) and Voorhees College also failed to appear in the hearing to present their arguments. The Commission recorded their absence with dissent.

Passing orders, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj directed all the colleges to send the information required by the petitioner by registered post and report compliance to the Commission.

He sought an explanation from the two colleges that did not appear in the hearing as to why disciplinary action should not be initiated against the PIO and the Principal under Section 20(2) of the Act.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fmgkcm/article31044184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THTNIO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/private-colleges-told-to-disclose-fee-collected-from-students-under-rti/article31044185.ece
372,2020/03/12,"Take pride in mother tongue, says Minister","Three persons, including two youngsters, were honoured at the Tamil Lexicography Day celebrations on Wednesday.

The awardees were selected from a list of applicants from across the world who claimed to speak only pure Tamil.

“We tried our best to make them use other languages, but we could not,” said Thanga. Kamaraj, director of the Tamil Etymology project, announced the prize winners.

R. Haridas, 71, a former Elementary Education Department employee from Jayam Kondan in Tiruvarur; C. Manikandan, a Coimbatore-based Tamil teacher; and Arokiya Oliver Raja, a second-year BSc student of St. Joseph’s College, were chosen for the honour.

The winners were honoured with a shawl, a memento and cash, by Food Minister R. Kamaraj and Minister for Tamil Language and Culture K. Pandiarajan.

Mr. Kamaraj urged the students to take pride in their mother tongue. Sudha Seshayyan, vice-chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University, said thatthe institution had organised the first meeting to identify Tamil words for technical terms in medicine.

As many as 100 professors had put in their efforts for the project, she said.

‘An evolving language’

Mr. Pandiarajan said synonyms for a word in Tamil had existed for many centuries. But it was Veeramamunivar, an evangelist who travelled from Italy to India to preach Christianity, who compiled the words into a dictionary.

T. Udhayachandran, Commissioner of Archaeology, said that the base for the dictionary was laid as early as the 7th century in Tamil Nadu. But the collection of words were scattered in various texts. Tamil is an evolving language that writers and poets have been building by coining new words, he said.

For instance, Bharathiar struggled to find a word for member. He initially came up with urupali but it was only later that urupinar began to be used.

377,2020/03/12,T.N. tourists ready to fly back,"Seventeen were quarantined on a cruise ship in Egypt

A total of 17 of the 18 tourists from India, all from Tamil Nadu, who were quarantined on the cruise ship A Sara, moored on the banks of the Nile in Egypt, after several passengers and crew contracted COVID-19, were ready to return to India on Wednesday.

One person, an engineer from Chennai, will remain in a military hospital in Alexandria, in quarantine, though he reportedly tested negative for the virus.

The 18 tourists from India had left for Egypt on February 27 and they were scheduled to return on March 7.

Vanitha Rengaraj, 60, a tourist from Coimbatore, who was quarantined in the ship along with her husband R. Rengaraj, 62, told The Hindu over phone that the Indian embassy took the 17 persons to the international airport in Cairo.

378,2020/03/12,"Fail-safe exit for America, but a worry for India","New Delhi seems to be the only entity on the losing end in Afghanistan’s unfolding game of chess and patience.

The recently negotiated peace deal between the United States and the Taliban is unlikely to bring peace to Afghanistan, is geopolitically disadvantageous for India, and has serious implications for our national security. The terms of the deal, the manner in which it was negotiated as well as the geopolitical context in which it was stitched up indicate that it was more about providing an honourable exit route for the U.S.’s Trump administration from its military campaign in Afghanistan than about ending violence in the country. Within 24 hours of the much-publicised deal, violence and major disagreements about the deal began erupting in Afghanistan. Given that the Taliban negotiated from a position of strength, the Trump administration from weakness and little political will, and that the Ashraf Ghani administration in Afghanistan was by and large a clueless bystander in all of this, means that the country is perhaps on the verge of yet another long-drawn out and internecine battle.

Geopolitical futures

When the Taliban came to power in the mid-1990s in Kabul, it had few backers in the world, nor was it seen as a useful commodity by the great powers or the states in the region, except for Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. And the international community was almost united in offering a normative pushback against the violent outfit. As a result, the Taliban was at best reluctantly tolerated until it messed up towards the end of its regime in Kabul. The Northern Alliance, supported by countries such as Russia and India, kept up its military pressure against the Taliban while it was in power. The situation today, at least for the moment, is perhaps the exact opposite of what was the case then. The Taliban today is also more worldly-wise and might have learned, during its exile, to deal with the international system and play the game of balance of power. More so, it may not necessarily be a puppet of the Pakistani deep state once it returns to power.

Given the war fatigue and the geopolitical stakes in Afghanistan, most of the key players in the region and otherwise have been in negotiations with the Taliban one way or another, and for one reason or another, lending the terror group certain legitimacy in the process. Today, the Taliban is the flavour of the season — anyone desirous of a stake in Afghanistan or does not want its domestic turmoil to spill over into their country would want to keep the Taliban in good humour. There is another reason why the Taliban has many suitors — because the U.S. withdrawal by and large suits everyone, be it China, Pakistan, Iran, or Russia. Suddenly, the Taliban appears to have been forgiven for its sordid past and unforgivable sins because for most of these countries, the U.S. is the bigger challenge than the Taliban.

India’s Afghan puritanism

The only state that seems to be on the losing end, unfortunately, of this unfolding game of chess and patience in Afghanistan is India. It did not have to be this way: if the earlier Taliban regime was anti-India, it was also because India had militarily supported the Northern Alliance that kept up the military pressure against the Taliban. Today’s Taliban does not share the same animus for New Delhi. New Delhi, therefore, could have rejigged its approach to Taliban this time around. However, it put all its eggs in the Ashraf Ghani basket, even on the eve of the signing of the peace deal in Doha. New Delhi also, for most intents and objectives, adopted a puritanical approach to the Taliban, neither reaching out to the Taliban nor exploiting the fissures within it; one, because it did not want to irk the elected government in Kabul and two, because it adopts a moralistic approach to dealing with extremist groups in general — not a smart diplomatic strategy. This moralistic attitude, also a diplomatically lazy one, I would say, that be it Pakistan or Afghanistan, India would only talk to the legitimate government in that country, is a self-defeating position. The world is not that perfect, nor are states all that uniform, created in the shape and image of the Westphalian forefather. Smart statecraft, therefore, is dealing with what you have and making the best of it.

As a result, India’s relations with Afghanistan will take a hit in the immediate aftermath of the deal. Here is why. With China, India’s strategic adversary, deeply involved in the geopolitics and geoeconomics of the region, including in Afghanistan, India’s traditional ability to influence the region’s political and security outcomes will be severely limited. This will be further exacerbated by the withdrawal of the U.S., India’s closest friend, from the region. Other regional actors in Afghanistan are also less friendly towards India than ever before: Iran feels let down by India given how the latter has behaved towards it at the behest of the Americans; for Russia, India is only one of the many friends in the region — the exclusivity of Russia-India relations is a thing of the past — and Pakistan would consider targeting India a fair game.

Unless New Delhi carefully envisages a counter strategy, these factors will increasingly push India into a geopolitical tough spot in the region. It should worry us that our political class is focused on domestic politics while the region is becoming ever more uncertain and evidently unfavourable to us.

Taliban and Kashmir angle

While the direct physical impact of the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan on Kashmir will be negligible, this will not be without serious implications for the unfolding situation in Kashmir’s restive regions. The most important impact is going to be psychological. Disenchanted Kashmiri youngsters, and there are a lot of them, will interpret the events in Afghanistan as follows: “If the mighty superpower USA could be defeated by the Taliban in Afghanistan with help from the Pakistan army, defeating Indian forces in Kashmir won’t be impossible after all.” This enthusiasm is completely misplaced, but that is not the point. That the Kashmiri youth might pick up guns drawing inspiration from the situation in Afghanistan is indeed the point.

Second, the U.S.-Taliban deal cannot survive without Pakistan’s assistance towards ensuring its success, and the U.S. and its allies recognise that. Such a recognition of Pakistan’s utility provides the country with an ability, as and when it wishes to, to up the ante in Kashmir.

Third, New Delhi’s official statement which describes Afghanistan as a “contiguous neighbour” — meaning that India considers Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) a part of its sovereign territory — will make Pakistan and China sit up and take notice. Recall that India also made a similar claim about Aksai Chin in the wake of its August decision on Kashmir. Erstwhile rhetorical claims on PoK and Aksai Chin have suddenly assumed lot more geopolitical significance today making conciliatory approaches to conflict resolution ever more difficult.

Victory of fundamentalism

The return of the Taliban, however unavoidable that may be, signals a victory of religious fundamentalism in the region and it will have serious implications for the region as a whole. Not only is the Taliban’s return a victory for a puritanical religious outfit, it is also an act in legitimising it. More so, given that a new Taliban-led dispensation in Afghanistan will be far more accepted by the international community than the last time around (1996 to 2001) also means increased acceptability for such regimes in general, either out of necessity or as a function of geopolitical calculations. That the Taliban mass-murdered its opponents into statehood in the 21st century and that this might provide potential inspiration to other outfits in the region and outside should indeed worry us.

379,2020/03/12,"Letters to the Editor — March 12, 2020","Exit Scindia

The Indian National Congress’s ignominious defeat in the last Lok Sabha election, just after winning some Assembly elections, should have made its leaders to deeply introspect, close ranks and work together for the revival of the party (Page 1, “Scindia meets Modi, quits Congress”, March 11). But it seems the stranglehold of the old guard and coterie politics continues to hold sway in the grand old party, giving no room for the younger generation. The exit of a high profile leader like Jyotiraditya Scindia from the party indicates its moribund state and the short-sightedness of the leadership. The fact that the party could not accommodate a leader of some stature in a State where it is in power speaks loudly about poor political management skills. From its political victories in some States in the last two years, it is evident that people are willing to give the Congress another chance, but it only appears to be frittering away its chances. Mr. Scindia’s exit could now result in a domino effect as far as other younger leaders such as Sachin Pilot and Milind Deora are concerned. It is time the old guard takes note and saves the party from further marginalisation in the political arena.

Kosaraju Chandramouli,

Hyderabad

Mr. Scindia’s unceremonious exit has sent a tremor through India’s political landscape, with many questioning the grand old party’s lack of support to young leaders. It is clear that the Gandhi family is wary of the creation of an alternative power structure within the party. Even though the Congress party came back to power in Madhya Pradesh after years, it is unfortunate that it will not be able to fulfil its electoral promises.

C.K. Subramaniam,

Navi Mumbai

The predicament of the Congress, especially in Madhya Pradesh, is more a self-inflicted one. It appears the trouble has been brewing for a while, and by wantonly not addressing Mr. Scindia’s genuine concerns. After the Lok Sabha election debacle, it seems that a lack of internal democracy is catalysing the disintegration of the Congress. At this rate, it won’t come as a surprise if the Congress is reduced to a status of a regional party — if not already.

A. Venkatasubramanian,

Tennur, Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu

I feel that there is nothing for the BJP to be elated about. Mr. Scindia’s act is one of rank opportunism. What is the guarantee that the defector will stick on with the BJP ?

Aadarsh Narayanan,

Coimbatore

The Congress party’s existential struggles spring from one source: the ruling dynasty’s inability and unwillingness to recognise and accept its declining power to influence the course of national politics and decreasing clout to command unquestioning obedience and uncritical deference from the second trier of leadership. Gone are the days when the party functioned as a family business. The party’s centre of gravity has shifted toward the peripherals; it is not the ruling clique but the powerful and hardworking regional leaders like Scindia, Amarinder Singh, and Sachin Pilot who shape the party’s electoral fortunes. When the aura surrounding the dynasty has dissipated, the young regional leaders are no longer beholden to the dictates and whimsical decisions of the central leadership. The old guard, adept practitioners of realpolitik, and beneficiaries of the party’s culture of rewarding sycophancy won over the dynasty by shielding the latter from criticism, established the impression of its own indispensability, and refused to hand over the baton to the ‘Young Turks’.

A single mutiny can be a tipping point to unleash dormant forces of revolt. It remains to be seen whether the dynasty will unleash perestroika to signal a transition of power to the second generation of leadership or will take refuge in the protectionist shelters erected by the self-serving and wily old guard.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

Thiruvananthapuram

To be frank, who is not power hungry? Did not the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress sup with the Shiv Sena to snub the Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra? Such “horse trading” has been going on for decades. In the end, it is we the common voter who has to lament and ask ourselves why we elect such greedy members to rule us.

N. Mahadevan,

Chennai

The most revealing issue is how without an iota of self-introspection, Mr. Scindia, who is a politician with promise, has chosen to join a party which he has opposed tooth and nail — for its authoritarian outlook and its undemocratic ways of functioning. He could as well have formed a separate entity in the Assembly with loyal MLAs backing him. Finally, most of our politicians prove that they are power hungry.

K. Ramalingam,

Chennai

Mr. Scindia has said he left the Congress because he was stifled and could not serve the people. I think both he and others like him still in the Congress should leave the mother party and form the real Indian National Congress, sans prefixes or suffixes, where the young at heart with fire in their bellies can work in a democratic way for the betterment of the people and the country. The time for action is now.

Banking woes

It is not the lack of existing rules and regulations that should be cited for the messy situation in the banking system. It is the slackness and indifference on the part of the enforcement agencies, for reasons best known to them, especially in the case of Yes Bank. It is also not clear why the promoter is being questioned for his misdeeds after much delay especially when there was evidence earlier to nail him. It is a pity that the interests of lakhs of depositors are being compromised due to the impassive attitude of the regulator and the government. With the imminent merger of banks, investors are also being deprived of varied choices of banks to invest in different baskets.

380,2020/03/12,‘We want to explore how design intersects with daily life’,"Paper Planes kicks off its first event for the year, with a panel discussion on food security

Can design play a role in determining the future of our food? Contemporary design and lifestyle e-commerce platform, Paper Planes event, this weekend will try and answer that. That is, how can design and technology shape the way we produce our food and help us make a sustainable choice. “Design is about creative problem solving. Design thinking can be an aspect of almost everything we do and the things that we interact with in our daily lives,” says Nupur Joshi-Thanks, founder Paper Planes.

Thoughts on a plate: (left to right) Roshini Bajaj Sanghvi; Ramya Ramamurthy; Divya Karnad; and Himanshu Arteev

Community model

From selling magazines to producing their own content was but a short leap. Their website joinpaperplanes.com focuses on design, design thinking and culture. “Paper Planes started five years ago with the idea of introducing people to passion-driven content from around the world. Since we are such a community-driven brand, exchange of ideas was very important to us. We decided to launch this property – Oddly Enough -- an offline series of events with the idea to meet ‘our people’ and extend the dialogue we have with them on our digital platform,” elaborates Joshi-Thanks.

Paper Planes hosted four editions of Oddly Enough last year, covering topics such as how to make an independent magazine, design and the city, and climate change. While these three editions were held in Mumbai, the fourth edition on the business of design was held in Ahmedabad. “We wanted to explore how design intersects with our daily life and make that a topic of conversation for each edition,” explains Joshi-Thanks.

Future tense

The fifth edition of Oddly Enough and the first one this year, will tackle the problem of food security. The panel comprises researchers and designers working in the food space. “We wanted to pick the aspect of food where we see a lot of innovation because that’s where design thinking plays a role. Where the innovation is actually going to matter is in how we grow our food, because that’s where we are seeing more challenging times ahead of us, whether it’s the lack of land to grow food or the kind of food we are eating or how our natural resources are depleting,” she elaborates.

On the panel are marine ecologist and co-founder of InSeason Fish Divya Karnad, permaculturist and co-founder of Ananas Design Himanshu Arteev, and Ramya Ramamurthy of The Good Food Institute India who co-hosts the podcast Feeding 10 Billion. Food writer Roshni Bajaj Sanghvi will moderate the panel.

Karnad’s InSeason Fish is a sustainable seafood initiative, which not only produces an annual seafood calendar but also works on-ground with fishermen and seafood consumers to promote sustainable fishing techniques. “We need to increase the diversity of what we are consuming, whether it’s seafood or plants. The more diverse our diet the better it is for our health and for the ecosystem,” she asserts. Arteev’s company works on ecological landscape design to create sustainable systems that grow food, conserve water, and restore soil. Ramamurthy is a Communications Specialist who works with scientists and entrepreneurs focused on creating affordable and accessible plant-based alternatives to animal protein. “If we are going to feed 10 billion of us by 2050, we need to find a more efficient way to make our protein. What to eat is a personal choice, but if you can eat something that’s as tasty and nutritious, and priced the same or cheaper than what’s available currently, that’s actually better for your health and that of the planet, then why not? That’s the kind of ecosystem we are trying to create so that consumers have a choice,” she emphasises.

Step into Serefe and you get a whiff of the attractively-perfumed air that emanates from Absorb, a boutique bar which is owned by the same team: Neha and Nitin Ganeriwal. While Absorb is known for its spacious luxury island vibe, Serefe is reminiscent of an intimate midnight bar.

I arrive at Serefe at lunchtime, when the floor-to-ceiling curtains are drawn, allowing natural light to pour into the resto-bar. Neha says the space takes on an entirely different character at night; the space, encased by geometric mirrors, gives the lighting from the high-up chandeliers more of a playground to add some mood. “We definitely offer glamour to our patrons — in look, feel and service,” explains Neha.

Deeply passionate and committed to making Serefe a success, Neha says perfection should not be a far reach for thriving restaurants in the city. “When you say you want to start a restaurant in Hyderabad, it becomes a day-to-night commitment. Having been a housewife for 20 years, my whole routine has changed when bringing Serefe from the ground-up.”

Serefe has quickly made a name for itself in a certain sector of fine dining in the city. Its appointment-based system controls the in-flow of patrons during mealtimes. This booking system can be found via the Facebook page. Serefe also draws plenty of eyes from different kitty groups in the city who quickly book up their upstairs private dining rooms, one of which has normal seating while the other has chilled-out sofa set-ups.

The menu at Serefe is a seemingly never-ending one. Not sure what to order, Neha brings a spinach salad laced with creamy cheese, walnuts and cherry tomatoes. She sends some tandoori chicken tikka our way, the chicken fillets tender and the accompanying cheese sauce — rather than the traditional mint chutney — adding just the right amount of tang. However, do gobble these up quickly before the chicken dries up.

If you are looking for something basic, get the hummus plate, it is not too overwhelming in variety and gives you company while you wait for your next dishes or drinks. What does come next is a tasty grilled fish slathered with lemon-garlic butter sauce. As someone who eats garlic-anything, this was a treat and a light one too to keep us paced before the arrival of the pesto-stuffed chicken roulade glazed with olive tapenade, drizzled with cheese.

Do not miss out on Serefe’s desserts. I have a major sweet tooth but when a chocolate tart and a tiramisu is set in front of me, it is as though the previous binge session never happened. The chocolate tart is puddled in dark chocolate sauce, the dish a flourish of both sweet and bitter. The tiramisu, was a delight, though there were no discernible layers of biscotti and sponge. However, the mascarpone cheese was whipped to a cloudy lightness while the filling has a satisfying amount of coffee liquer without inciting guilt.

When ordering a drink, be sure to consult general managers Tony Snehashis and Dominic who have been in the mixology game for a hot minute. I first order a whisky-based drink which has fruit overtones and a pretty sunset ombre going on, but Tony is quick to say, “You have got to finish that in five minutes or the drink is dead.” He then orders me a Cosmopolitan which has cointreau instead of triple sec and sugar syrup, my first Cosmo in a while which does not taste like bubblegum.

Dominic sends me a vodka-based berry drink (with biodegradable straws, yay!); as someone who detests vodka, this was pretty decent as it was balanced out with green tea.

382,2020/03/12,Chennai’s Bass & Soda serves light cocktails with trap music and ’80s rock,"Soda-based cocktails and carefully curated playlists define the Bass & Soda experience, good for both busy weeknights and weekends

Bass & Soda promises three floors of just that — bass aka music, and soda-based cocktails deemed appropriate for weeknights and mid-office brunches by mixologist Rahul Siva. When we walk in on an early Monday night, we find the ground floor’s leather-finish sofas still awaiting their 9 pm family dinner crowd, and the rooftop unopened for operations. But the first floor, even at 7.30 pm on a weekday, is a solid mood. And the mood is the Eighties.

Late 1970s as well, to be honest. Our ears prick up at Gloria Gaynor’s spirited ‘I will survive’ and stay that way for the rest of the night, thanks to manager Abdul Rahman’s playlist, featuring everyone from Bees Gees and The Bangles to Modern Talking and Michael Jackson. And not once — I repeat, not once — do we have to shout to make ourselves heard. Are you reading this, every other lounge in Chennai?

Pick your night Mondays – Rock and retro

Tuesdays – Old school hiphop, pop, commercial

Wednesdays – Hiphop and trap

Thursdays – Old school and new school hiphop, Raggaeton

Fridays and Saturdays – Bollywood, pop, R&B, trap, hiphop

Sundays – Funk and commercial music

It is hard not to relax after a hard Monday, when your cocktail arrives just as ‘Manic Monday’ starts playing in commiseration. The IT crowd on this stretch of the expressway — fairly close to Tidel Park — seems to have picked up on this, because the lounge steadily fills up with loose-collared office-goers, friend groups of all genders, and even that one frustrated executive nursing a lone whisky in a corner.

You don’t have to stick to whisky. The cocktails we order arrive like tributes to a Hawaiian summer. A sunset-red watermelon basil gingerita has enough vodka to make me happy, but also enough ginger to mask my beloved watermelon. The pineapple grenadine soda is also misbalanced: here, the grenadine overpowers everything else, so all we taste is syrupy sweetness. Dill orange soda, however, is just right. Fresh, citrusy, light and the colour of sunshine.

On the side, we have chilli chinga rolls: spring rolls packed tight with light vegetables and heavy cheese. There is nothing dramatic about these little rolls — each is simple, crisp and non-oily. Even the cheese refrains from spurting out at first bite. I could take confidence lessons from these understated, delicious rolls.

The Andhra chicken roast sets a contrasting note: the first thing it does is set your mouth on fire. In a very good way. Soft and deep-fried, these fiery red platefuls are served with a crunchy sprinkling of crushed peanuts that does nothing to dissuade the heat. Because we wouldn’t want that, would we?

“This is the first time I’m eating broccoli wantonly,” says my friend A, one of the biggest compliments a hardcore non-vegetarian can pay to a plate of greens. An exaggeration — the broccoli, caked with cream cheese, is softer than most ‘tandoori’ vegetables and though its stem looks nicely charred, it has neither the hard crunch nor the semi-burnt tartness expected from a tandoor used well. Hardly the best tandoori broccoli in town, it pales in comparison to our next starter: an entire vanjaram fish, deep-fried. It arrives gleaming with a coat of spice that is surprisingly balanced and percolates through, instead of resting on the skin. As expected, no tiny bones catch us off-guard, which is characteristic of this particular species of fish. Flat though it is, it has a slim, oily edge that is sharply crisp; everything else falls off the bone easily.

The mutton pot biryani, on the other hand, makes you put in some work. The onions are caramelised to just the right amount of sweetness, but the biryani itself needs to be mixed thoroughly before its heady aroma rises to the top and the flavour hits your palate. Like in any other dum biryani — this one is cooked in black clay pots sealed with mud and brought to the table — scooping up just the surface provides an incomplete, dissatisfying taste: it is the substance across layers that hits the spot. The meat itself, however, is quite less. You don’t want to dig through a dum biryani if you aren’t going to rewarded with generous chunks of mutton at the end.

The bacon cream cheese pizza comes to us at the same time as ‘Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters’, and now I don’t think I can ever do one without the other. The combination brings together everything that is familiar and slightly ridiculous, from the too-liberal strewing of bacon and heavily caramelised sweet onions to the laughably exciting act of — well, ghostbusting.

383,2020/03/12,How this Kerala entrepreneur proves good health begins at home with her multi-grain mix,"Priya Ravikrishnan from Thiruvananthapuram highlights healthy eating habits with her home-made multi-grain mix that can be used to make a number of dishes

Priya Ravikrishnan believes in doing it herself. For the past three decades, the “health enthusiast” has made it a point to prepare her own “home-made health mix”, keeping frugality and hygiene in mind.

“My inspiration is my mother-in-law, Lakshmi Balu, who taught me nutritious home recipes that can be used to prepare various snacks or even simply had as a porridge. This helped us stay clear of junk food. My daughter, Vaishnavi Ravikrishna, used to be a fussy eater as a child and I wanted to ensure she had a balanced diet,” says Priya.

What began as a wholesome culinary habit sparked an idea one day. Four years ago, Priya decided to scale up preparations, and the former home cook turned entrepreneur when she brought out her multi-grain health mix powder under the name Swasti. Meaning ‘well being’ or ‘good health’ in Sanskrit, the home-made health mix packs in 18 nutritious ingredients, such as bamboo rice, finger millet, foxtail millet, almond, flaxseed, green gram, horse gram and so on, to make a balanced wholesome eat.

“I have tried to maintain a balance of carbs, fibre and protein. You can see how grains such as millets are now being promoted as the new superfoods, at a time when the clamour is for ‘organic’ products,” says Priya, a resident of Karamana.

Quick recipes Simple porridge: Mix a few table spoons of the multi-grain mix in a cup of water. Bring to boil till it attains the consistency of porridge. Can be consumed with milk or palm sugar.

Mix a few table spoons of the multi-grain mix in a cup of water. Bring to boil till it attains the consistency of porridge. Can be consumed with milk or palm sugar. Multi-grain veg soup: Sauté onion, ginger, garlic and vegetables such as carrot and beans in butter for a minute or two. Add the health mix porridge and coconut milk and cook for a few minutes. Garnish with salt and pepper.

From sourcing to packaging, Priya says she manages the process single-handedly and it has become viable as the production is on a small scale. “Perhaps, good quality bamboo rice is the most difficult to source among the assorted ingredients but I retain it for its good calorific content. I source bamboo rice from Wayanad and rest of the grains are bought from regular suppliers in the city. It’s a family recipe and I just modified it,” explains the 48-year-old.

It is a laborious process. The raw materials are cleaned and washed a few times before being roasted together in a two-kilogram capacity automatic roaster.

“The dry mixture is then allowed to cool for a day before it’s powdered at a mill and sieved at home,” she says, adding that preservatives and added sugars are a strict no-no. Earlier, Priya used aluminium pouches for packaging but now employs eco-friendly paper packets. She prepares 15 kilograms — 20 kilograms of the mixture in a single batch and the frequency depends on the orders. The health mix comes in half-kg packets that are priced at ₹300.

Priya says one advantage of such a health mix, which has a predominantly nutty flavour, is the numerous recipes and snacks that can be prepared solely from the ingredient, which can be made into a batter.

“Essentially, it can be used to make your traditional breakfast items such as puttu, idiyappam and even dosa. Otherwise, snacks such as ela ada with banana and jaggery fillings can be prepared, healthy options that many can enjoy at any time of the day. Or as shakes or veg soup or even sweets such as ladoo by mixing with other suitable ingredients,” points out Priya. Perhaps, if one is pressed for time, a convenient option would be a simple, easy-to-make porridge, she says. A toast to good health!

384,2020/03/12,Why the same old coffee?,"Speciality coffee, with its varied flavours, methods of brewing and roasting, is the next big thing in Hyderabad

This is not your average cup of coffee. Hyderabad, known for its Irani chai and biryani, is embracing a new culture of speciality coffee places. Coffee lovers have the chance to pick from cold brew, cold drip, and nitro cold coffee among others, depending on their mood and demands of the weather. Clearly, one’s caffeine fix need not be just a piping hot cuppa.

It’s hot 9from left) Pour over preparation, barista Kalpana Behara, inside Sentido Coffee Breweries By arrangement

And if you thought these drinks were for only seasoned coffee lovers, you are clearly mistaken. Baristas say young visitors at cafés are the ones who are increasingly experimenting with cold brews. Some even go for the cascara, which has nothing to do with coffee notes or flavours.

So, if you are a coffee drinker tired of mocha served with a truckload of the usual whipped cream, it is time to try the affogato or experiment with coffee from different beans with varied roasts. “Why just coffee, it is also a good idea to look at techniques,” says Mahadev Krshna, who recently opened Bottega, a speciality coffee shop at Chalet. “Forget coffee from espresso machines. Try those made with pour-over technique, the aeropress, and siphon. Technique and roasting play an important role in unravelling the character of the coffee bean.” According to Harsha Reddy, who started Sentido Coffee Brewers with his partner, that the taste of speciality coffee is controlled by the roaster depending on what brew it is used for, also makes it unique.

Even breweries have jumped onto the bandwagon by making coffee-flavoured beers. These cafés, apart from offering customers various options to choose from, and the opportunity tolearn about coffee, are also creating employment opportunities for those who want to do more than just serve coffee from espresso machines.

“Earlier, we either drank coffee off machines or bought instant coffee; the purist drank filter coffee in the comfort of their homes,” points out Nishant Sinha who started the city’s first speciality coffee shop, The Roastery Coffee House, in 2017. But now, more and more people are looking for freshness in their average cuppa. “Coffee farming too wasn’t as focussed,” he adds. “Coffee beans were harvested, processed without much thought. Which meant ripe and raw beans were processed together. Coffee came with the notorious allegation of being bitter. But coffee farmers soon decided to pay attention to their beans; they started boutique cultivation within the farms, thereby changing coffee’s profile a lot more differently.”

The change in the way coffee was grown triggered the third wave in coffee. While this is not new to places like Bengaluru, Hyderabad took some time to catch up. “But once we did, people have started walking in with the intent of knowing their coffee. This helps me to a large extent. Most of them are either well-travelled or are curious epicureans,” adds Nishant.

These initial curious lot, according to baristas, are now loyalists responsible for inducting more people into speciality coffees. “In a regular coffee shop, we might make just one or two coffee varieties, but in speciality coffee shops, there’s a lot more. This, in turn, helps us to interact with customers more,” says barista Kalpana Behara. “Here, they are more aware. Customers know their coffee and the technique of brewing as well. I have also observed the type of brew one orders also varies with the time of the day they have it.”

Apart from well-travelled coffee lovers, the popularity of speciality coffee in Hyderabad can also be attributed to some extent to the opening of a popular American coffee brand in the city. Harsha however, says that he is not a fan of beverages there.

The methods of engagement with coffee also play an important role in pushing the beverage to become a hot favourite. Coffee brewing and roasting workshops have brought hungry Hyderabadis closer. “As consumers become more aware, the more they are drawn to the beverage,” adds Nishant.

What next with coffee? “Food pairing could be the next big thing,” sums up Harsha.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/cb9za/article31047550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym12kalpana1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-roastery-coffee-shop-mahadev-krshna-sentido-coffee-brewers-bottega-nishant-sinha-hrasha-reddy/article31047553.ece
385,2020/03/12,Conman held for duping Delhi gold merchant of ₹80 lakh,"50-year-old was out on bail in a similar case registered against him in Surat

A 50-year-old man was arrested from Thane city for allegedly cheating a Delhi-based gold merchant of ₹80 lakh, the police said on Wednesday.

The accused, Vijay Ambalal Soni, was also wanted by the Nagpur Police for allegedly siphoning off ₹25 lakh from a private sector bank, they said.

Mr. Soni, who hails from Mehsana in Gujarat, set up a small jewellery shop at Karol Bagh in Delhi a few months ago. On October 23, 2019, he placed an order with wholesale merchant Krishnadev Khupkar for a 2-kg gold bar. After taking the delivery of the gold bar, Mr. Soni left his shop, telling Mr. Khupkar that he was going to a bank to transfer the money into the latter’s account.

When Mr. Soni did not return, Mr. Khupkar filed a police complaint with the Karol Bagh police of being cheated of gold worth around ₹80 lakh, police inspector Rajkumar Kothmire, Thane Anti-Extortion Cell (AEC), said.

Mr. Khupkar also approached the Thane Police AEC last month after he got a tip-off that Mr. Soni was to come here. Based on the complaint, the officials launched a probe and nabbed Mr. Soni from Talao Pali on Tuesday and booked him for cheating under the Indian Penal Code, the official said.

Mr. Soni would set up a small jewellery shop and find wholesale merchants to place orders for gold with, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Crime) N.T. Kadam said. After winning their confidence, he would place big orders and run away after taking the delivery.

The accused has been handed over to the Karol Bagh police in Delhi, the official said. He was also wanted in a case registered at Ganeshpath police station in Nagpur for allegedly siphoning off ₹25.11 lakh from a Mumbai branch of a private bank through online transfer. He also has a case of cheating registered against him with the LT Marg police in Mumbai, the police said.

Mr. Soni’s interrogation revealed several offences were also registered against him at Boisar in Palghar district and Surat in Gujarat, Mr. Kadam said.

He was booked under Sections 407 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code by the Boisar police in 2013. He was later convicted and served a two-year jail term for the offence. Mr. Soni was also booked by Varachha police in Surat and arrested by them. He was currently out on bail.

A search is also on for Mr. Soni’s brothers, who were allegedly also involved in these offences, the police said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/71nidd/article31046921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bmthief,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/conman-held-for-duping-delhi-gold-merchant-of-80-lakh/article31046922.ece
386,2020/03/12,Government scraps tender for Thackeray memorial in Dadar,"Lowest bidder quoted 54.5% above the estimates, says Shinde

The tender for construction of the Bal Thackeray memorial in Dadar has been scrapped as the bidder had quoted much higher than the estimates. The memorial is to come up in the erstwhile Mayor Bungalow at Shivaji Park.

The State government has approved converting the bungalow into a memorial for the Shiv Sena founder. The two-storey sea-facing bungalow is a grade II-B heritage structure. Its reservation was changed to a memorial in the Development Plan 2034.

Sena legislator Vilas Potnis raised a question over the memorial’s status in the Council on Wednesday. In his written reply, Urban Development Department Minister Eknath Shinde said the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority had invited tenders for the project on February 24, 2019, but the lowest bidder had quoted 54.5% above the estimates, and therefore the tender had to be cancelled.

“We had to scrap that tender, and are inviting fresh bids. We are hopeful of better response this time. Once the work order is issued, the memorial will take at least two years to be completed,” an officer from Mantralaya said.

The Bal Thackeray Memorial Trust, represented by architect Abha Lambah, has proposed creating a separate structure for the main memorial building that will be constructed after demolishing a round-about at the bungalow. The new structure will have an art gallery, library, seminar and lecture hall, and toilets among others. It will also have a small pond on its terrace, which will reflect the bungalow. Besides, the premises will have an amenity block and an open parking area.

The existing servants’ quarters will be razed to have a new amenity block in the northeast corner. The trust has also proposed a sloping-roof structure that will have a visitors’ centre, café, and an administrative office. The bungalow will host images depicting Thackeray’s life. The alternative location to the main memorial building, an existing parking lot, was not considered as it would require cutting of trees. The government has allocated ₹100 crore for the project.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nxeqe4/article31044893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMMAYORSBUNGALOW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/government-scraps-tender-for-thackeray-memorial-in-dadar/article31044891.ece
387,2020/03/12,"51 people have died in Mahul in four years, minister tells House","‘BMC informed us not a single death was caused by pollution’

Fifty-one people in Mahul have died in the last four years, and not a single death is related to pollution, Urban Development Department Minister Eknath Shinde said in the Council on Wednesday. A decision to move the people out of Mahul will be taken after the Supreme Court judgement.

Nationalist Congress Party legislator Hemant Takle raised a query during Question Hour demanding to know whether any more project affected persons (PAPs) had been shifted to Mahul despite a High Court order prohibiting it, and the status of the existing PAPs who wanted to be relocated.

Responding to this, Mr. Shinde, in a written reply, said, “No one has been moved to the PAP Colony in Mahul following the HC order. Between January 2013 and January 2020, 51 people have died in the PAP Colony, and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has informed us there is no indication that these deaths occurred due to pollution. In Mahul, complaints of respiratory illnesses have come down from 20% to 6% and complaints of breathlessness from 30% to 12.5%”

Mr. Shinde said the matter of moving existing families out of Mahul is in the SC, and the government is awaiting the hearing on March 16, following which a decision will be taken. Council Chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar said, “If there is no stay on the HC order by the SC, the State is then bound to implement the HC order.”

388,2020/03/12,"Projects aim to tap energy from shoes, speed breakers","The ideas, developed by students of various engineering colleges, were showcased at finals of CreaTech

Tapping energy from walking, generating electricity from speed breakers, capturing waste heat generated from air conditioning units and using a mobile application to measure the dimensions, were some of the major ideas showcased by students at CreaTech, a competition organised by Larsen & Toubro.

A team of three second year students from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, bagged the top prize at the final held in Mumbai last week. The team had created a set of four solutions aimed at harvesting power at construction sites.

The first solution sought to convert the pressure exerted by vehicles on speed breakers into electric energy using a rack and pinion mechanism, where electricity would be generated every time a vehicle passed over the speed breakers. Rahul Mohata, one of the team members, said that the mechanism would also help in smart parking within construction sites by keeping a tab on the number of vehicles that pass through the speed breakers.

The other key solutions included the use of ‘smart’ shoes which used piezo sensors to convert mechanical stress into electrical energy. The shoes are equipped with a battery that would be charged by the energy produced while walking and having sensor-based lighting on streets that would light up only when a vehicle is passing.

The first runners-up, were a team from Vellore Institute of Technology, who developed a mobile application called ‘Naap’. The application was designed to use any regular camera on a phone and accurately ascertain the dimensions of the space. The user only had to input his or her height in centimetres and the rest would be calculated based on the eye level of the user.

The competition was started in 2019 to encourage top engineering talent in the country to solve challenges that the company and the industry at large were also engaged in solving. The students were expected to send synopsis of their solution to six problems that were decided by the company.

These included waste heat management, network continuity, power harvesting, variable intensity lights, image processing and conversion of conventional substation to digital substation. Based on the synopsis, the jury selected nine teams out of 350 who submitted their synopsis. These nine teams were asked to build a prototype and present it in the finals.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xomgai/article31044860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMCREATECHEXHIBITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/projects-aim-to-tap-energy-from-shoes-speed-breakers/article31044862.ece
389,2020/03/12,"International theatre project gives queer relationships visibility, fosters acceptance","Even Mists Have Silver Linings has been funded by U.S. Consulate General Mumbai

A married woman in love with a woman and the husband playing a supportive ally, a homophobic man coming to terms with his own toxicity, transgender parents separated from their children, and indoctrination camps in which masculinity becomes an armour. These vignettes of Indian queer lives are part of an international collaboration, Even Mists Have Silver Linings, a theatrical project advocating for change in perception among the audience.

Supported by a grant from the U.S. Consulate General Mumbai to develop and document a theatre performance that addresses LGBTQIA+ issues of identity and stigma in India, the play is a collaborative effort between directors Jeffrey Pufahl and Will Weigler of the University of Florida, Hardik Shah of the Mumbai-based Five Senses Theatre, playwright and dramaturge, Vikram Phukan, director Victor Thoudam, and seven actors. The purpose is to foster acceptance and de-stigmatise queer lives and relationships by providing visibility.

“Lesbian visibility is very strong in this play,” said Mr. Phukan, who provided an original open script, and sensitisation workshops for the actors. “The intimacy and struggle of queer women is seldom seen on stage, which we have in this play. Some monologues, like that of actors Lauren Robinson and Tanvi Lehr Sonigra, come from a personal space.”

Collaborative theatre

The creative process began with the open script by Mr. Phukan, followed by psychophysical direction by Mr. Thoudam, which entails using the body to emote. The actors interpreted the script using community-based research like a queer heritage walk in Colaba, extensive discussions about the Indian queer communities, and Mr. Weigler’s techniques as discussed in his doctoral dissertation, The Alchemy of Astonishment. Mr. Weigler’s method involves using a set of teaching cards, containing a compilation of ideas and motivations, for actors to create theatrical moments that audiences might find unforgettable. The making of the play is also the subject of an independent documentary by filmmaker Malati Rao.

The play features a dozen episodic verbal and non-verbal stories involving characters like gender non-conforming adventurists, cloistered homemakers opening up to desire, fierce warrior princesses raised as men, and young urban millennials in same-sex love grappling with both loss and fulfilment.

In order to calculate the impact of this theatrical project, the Humsafar Trust, as an audience research partner, will hand out a questionnaire to viewers, asking them to fill in their answers before and after the play. The questionnaire includes opinions like, “Do you believe that sexual orientation is nature or nurture?”

The audience answer ascertains how influential the play has been in changing their perceptions. “It’s very interesting to see how the answers change, because some of these questions fall in grey areas and with some others, we are already speaking to the converted,” said Mr. Phukan.

Even Mists Have Silver Linings premiered on March 7, and will be staged again this evening and on March 14 at G5A Foundation for Contemporary Culture, Mahalaxmi.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2erpt9/article31044868.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bmQueer-space,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/international-theatre-project-gives-queer-relationships-visibility-fosters-acceptance/article31044843.ece

The police have arrested a 20-year-old man from Satara, who tried to break open an ATM in Kalamboli.

Roshan Modak, a Class XII graduate, had come to Navi Mumbai two months ago in search of a job and was staying at his friend’s house at Chaudhary Chawl in Kalamboli. Unable to find a job, he started trying to break open ATM machines.

At 1.15 a.m. on Tuesday, a police constable, alerted by the ATM siren during night patrol, spotted a man breaking the ATM machine of Induslnd Bank near Varun Bar. The constable alerted the police station and called for reinforcements, but Mr. Modak fled after the siren went off. An hour later, he was nabbed from a nearby lane.

“We have procured CCTV camera footage and confirmed the accused’s identity. He also confessed to previously attempting to rob an ATM beside Panvel RTO office on January 25. We had found CCTV footage of that case as well and were on the look out for the accused when he was nabbed,” senior police inspector Satish Gaikwad said. According to the police, in both attempts, Mr. Modak broke the machine using a screwdriver but could not take any cash due to the siren.

“Every bank should take precautions and have sirens at the ATM. Mostly in such cases, we end up taking suo motu cognisance as bank officials keep delaying the process, citing reasons such as approval from head office or unavailability of manager.

Online food ordering and delivery platform Swiggy on Wednesday introduced an option for the delivery person to leave the food packages by the door, in wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

‘Proactive measures’

In an e-mail to customers, Swiggy said it was taking proactive measures to help minimise the spread of the infection. This included requesting the delivery partner to leave the food package by the door in case of online payment, if the customer was not feeling well or preferred the option.

“Our delivery partners are continually being trained in best practices of respiratory hygiene, proper method and frequency of washing hands as well as identification of associated symptoms,” Swiggy said.

The mail said, should a delivery partner notice any associated symptoms, they have been asked to immediately reach out to the company and consult a medical professional. “We are providing them with free medical consultation through our partners in such cases. Our delivery partners have also been advised to self-quarantine themselves for the recommended period upon noticing any symptoms. To ensure their financial safety, we are committed to supporting them financially in such situations,” it said.

392,2020/03/12,Travel industry concerned over viability,"COVID-19 scare and 5% TDS on international packages hit tourism business hard

The travel industry has said that the panic caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19), coupled with the new 5% tax on international travel packages from April 1, will make it very difficult for travel agents to sustain their operations.

This has forced many in the tourism business to switch to a cash-only system to retain customers. The recent Union Budget had proposed that a seller of an overseas tour package should be liable to collect TDS (tax deducted at source) at 5%. This is, however, not applicable to customers directly booking through Booking.com, Expedia, or hotels.

Tour operators are liable to charge the amount when the package is bought. If PAN or Aadhaar is not produced by the buyer, the tax will be charged at 10%. The Budget 2020-21 has also mandated a 5% tax collection at source for remittances of over ₹7 lakh.

In an online petition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) said the business of Indian companies would eventually be transferred to overseas travel companies by travellers directly resulting in a loss of tax revenue for the Indian government.

Indian travel agents will now have to pay TDS on a monthly basis and file returns for the same on a quarterly basis. This is in addition to the existing compliance of GST and other filing, which will entail extra time and additional costs and also risks job losses for those employed in the travel trade.

“International online travel companies and foreign tour operators with a base outside India are booking air tickets, hotels and tour packages directly for travellers without collecting any GST or taxes. They shall not even collect income tax at source (TCS),” TAAI vice president Jai Bhatia said.

Travel agents said the introduction of TCS will increase compliance cost of the local companies and will be contrary to the ease of doing business. “At present, 5% GST is collected from the traveller and paid to the government. This is already uncompetitive vis-a-vis global traveller companies as many travellers are booking directly with overseas vendors,” TAAI said.

Assocham National Council on Tourism and Hospitality chairman and STIC Travel Group chairman, Subhash Goyal, said the 5% tax will discourage people from travelling abroad. “There is a good possibility that the tour operator will pass on the taxes to the customers,” he said.

Tour operators also pointed out that in case of cancellation of a package, there is no provision for refund of the amount to the consumer by the travel company. “Credit for the same can be availed by the consumer when filing tax returns,” Reji Philip of Fort-based travel agency Cosmos said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pvfmul/article31044826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMTRAINTRAVELLERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/travel-industry-concerned-over-viability/article31044808.ece
393,2020/03/12,Kombadbhuje on high alert after GVK guard spots leopard,"Villagers believe it a plot to get area vacated for airport project; first spotting after 2011, say officials

After a GVK security guard spotted a leopard near the the Navi Mumbai airport office in Kombadbhuje, residents of the area have been alerted by forest officers.

“A security guard at GVK informed us that he spotted a leopard on Sunday night. We have since alerted the residents nearby and also started night patrolling between Kombadbhuje and Waghivali. However, no one has seen or heard about the leopard after that incident,” Shashank Kadam, Uran forest range officer, said.

A WhatsApp message along with a video and a photo has gone viral among the residents, instilling fear in them. However, some of them also suspect it to be a plot to get the villages vacated for the airport project.

“Some of the villagers are yet to leave their homes as they have been having issues with CIDCO. GVK has already started work on some parts of the project and work has been sub-contracted too. We suspect that this could be fake news spread to make us feel scared so that we leave the villages at the earliest,” a villager said.

“We are using fire crackers in the area so that if the leopard is still around, it goes back to its habitat. We have alerted the residents and asked them not to move around alone in the dark. They have also been asked to alert forest officers immediately if they spot the animal,” assistant conservator forest officer Nandkishor Kupte said. Forest officers believe the leopard came from Karnala side.

“In 2011, a leopard had once entered Karanjade in Uran. It entered a house and was stuck there until it was rescued successfully. After that no leopard has been spotted in this area,” Mr. Kadam said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a8xcwj/article31044761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bmLeopard,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kombadbhuje-on-high-alert-after-gvk-guard-spots-leopard/article31044762.ece
394,2020/03/12,OPD at Kasturba a hive of activity,"Gripped with coronavirus fear, people turn up in large numbers; two with travel history advised isolation

A special outpatient department (OPD) for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) set up at ward no 9 of Kasturba Hospital has been witnessing a lot of activity since Wednesday morning. Those with a travel history and others without any are seeking doctors’ help. Among those who were advised isolation after reporting to the OPD were a 40-year-old woman and a six-year-old girl with travel history to Sharjah and Dubai.

The woman, who returned to Mumbai on March 1, had gone to a local doctor in Mira Road, who prescribed her medication but also referred her to the primary health centre (PHC). Soon as the PHC got to know about the case, two nurses visited the suspected patient and advised her for a visit to Kasturba Hospital. “We brought the woman to Kasturba in our ambulance,” said one of the nurses who travelled along with the woman. She had been isolated and her samples were collected for tests.

Parents of the six-year-old girl who returned from Dubai on March 8 said that she had started coughing after coming back. “However, she had played in the swimming pool, and she catches cold easily. But just as a precautionary measure, we decided to come to the OPD,” the father said. Doctors said the child would be isolated but the mother would be allowed to be with her.

Among the many people who queued up at the OPD were a few who sought medical certificates to submit at the workplace, but were turned away. Many also had no travel history but feared the exposure to the virus.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said many people have started walking in to the OPD and they are now planning to keep it operational round the clock. On Wednesday, 10 people were placed under isolation in Mumbai due to the suspected exposure.

CR, WR gear up

The Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) have begun their preparations to combat the outbreak of the virus in the city.

The CR has created isolation wards across all its hospitals, including the two in Mumbai — Byculla and Kalyan. Similarly, the WR has designated 75 beds in all divisions and zonal hospitals, including a dedicated ward of 30 beds for clinically suspected cases at Jagjivan Ram Hospital at Mumbai Central.

Hospital staff are being trained to deal with any suspected cases, and educational posters on dos and don’ts have been put up at prominent locations across all station premises and inside trains.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ur0qlf/article31044774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMCORONASAMARITAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/opd-at-kasturba-a-hive-of-activity/article31044739.ece
395,2020/03/12,Holi ‘party’ goes awry as two try to burn friend’s genitals; held,"The Rabale MIDC police on Wednesday arrested two men for allegedly trying to burn their friend’s genitals under the influence of alcohol during their Holi ‘party’.

The complainant (27), a resident of Digha in Rabale, along with Aakash Kale (26), Nilesh Kharkar (35), and two other friends were drinking alcohol on Tuesday evening at one of their houses in Digha after playing Holi in the first half of the day. After consuming alcohol, the complainant passed out and urinated in his pants while half asleep. Mr. Kale and Mr. Kharkar decided to burn his genitals.

“While Mr. Kharkar shot a video, Mr. Kale removed the complainant’s underwear and tried to burn his genitals using a matchstick. The complainant was heavily under the influence of alcohol and did not realise what was happening,” police inspector Anil Patil from Rabale MIDC police station said.

On Wednesday morning, after he woke up and was out of his hangover, he saw the burn injuries on his private parts and went to the NMMC hospital in Vashi. “The injuries are minor, and not deep. He was not admitted. The accused claimed that they did it for fun. We arrested them on Wednesday evening and will produce them before court on Thursday,” senior police inspector Nitin Gite from Rabale MIDC police station said.

The person to whom the house belonged to, was an witness to the incident, the police said. The accused and the victim drove autorickshaws on rental basis for a living. The duo was arrested under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 34 (common intention), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

396,2020/03/12,‘Charitable institutions are over-regulated in India’,"Experts ask why trusts must re-register for tax exemptions

The government’s move to make charitable and religious institutions renew their registration every five years through an amendment to the Income Tax Act came under criticism at a public meeting in the city on Wednesday.

Experts and representatives from various trusts and non-government organisations participated in the event organised by The Association for Protection of Public Trusts and Charities. They have decided to present a memorandum to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressing their grievances.

Ms. Sitharaman had proposed substantial amendments for granting exemptions to charitable and religious trusts in the Union Budget 2020. Under the new tax regime, the Finance Minister proposed to introduce Section 12AB to grant registration to charitable institutions, enabling them to claim exemption under Section 11 of the Act.

All charitable institutions, including those registered under Sections 12AA or 12A, will now have to make a fresh application for registration on or before August 31 to be eligible to claim the exemption. On receiving the application, the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax or the Commissioner can grant registration to the trusts under Section 12AB, after carrying out the required examination. The registration granted after the examination will be valid only for five years.

“The amendments are very few, but have far-reaching implications,” said senior advocate Firoze Andhyarujina. The most crucial issue, he said, was the requirement for charitable institutions to make a fresh application for re-registration at the end of five years. “The other major issue is the confusion as to the role of the assessing officer in determining the object of the institution. The proposed amendments do not clearly state whether the registration granted will be valid till the end of the assessment year or the financial year after completion of five years,” Mr. Andhyarujina said.

Chief executive, Centre for Advancement of Philanthropy, Noshir Dadrawala, said charitable institutions and trusts are the most over-regulated sector in India. “These amendments are not even advantageous for the government because the government is not equipped to implement them,” he said.

Chartered accountant Viren Merchant questioned the need to renew the registration every five years. “If companies are not required to re-register, then why do charitable institutions need to do so? When clauses for cancellation of registration and scrutiny assessment exist, then what is the need to re-register?” he asked.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/charitable-institutions-are-over-regulated-in-india/article31044663.ece
397,2020/03/12,"ED gets extension of Rana Kapoor’s custody, plans to grill him on several loans","A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday granted the Enforcement Directorate (ED) an extension of Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor’s custody till March 16. The prosecution sought the extension citing his interrogation with regard to several other loan sanctions amounting to ₹30,000 crore.

The ED claimed that the former Yes Bank MD and CEO was involved in transactions involving 78 companies owned by him and his family, and sanctioned loans of up to ₹30,000 crore during his tenure at the bank.

The former Yes Bank co-founder was arrested by the ED on Sunday under provisions of the PMLA and was remanded in custody till March 11. A case with the CBI was also lodged after documents pertaining to loan sanctions to several entities were recovered during a DHFL-related probe, which was conducted at Mr. Kapoor’s residence on March 7.

“During investigation, the amount of the loans sanctioned was found to have gone up from ₹4,300 crore to ₹30,000 crore. Of the ₹30,000 crore, ₹20,000 was turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). Where have these loans gone? The flow of transaction needs to be probed in detail. How has the money been siphoned off? The amount and documents are also voluminous and need to be looked into deeply. The ED is calling key management persons, and we need more time to question the witnesses who need to be confronted with Mr. Kapoor,” the ED counsel, Sunil Gonsalves, said.

The defence lawyer argued that Mr. Kapoor was being made a scapegoat and that the investments were not connected, claiming that the NPAs of the company when he (Mr. Kapoor) left were only 1%.

“In the last two years since he has left the company, the market capital value of Yes Bank has fallen from ₹93,000 crore to ₹5,000 crore. The present management cannot hold him responsible if the company is unable to recover its loans,” advocate Satish Maneshinde representing Mr. Kapoor said.

Mr. Maneshinde told the court that the three loans during 2017-2018 were issued before the issue of debentures, which were only opened up from May 22 to June 4, so the issue of them being used as kickbacks did not arise. “We have already paid an interest of up to ₹130 crore and can fully repay the loan amount of ₹600 crore which is due by 2023.”

On being accused of maintaining shell companies, the defence lawyer said that all investments had been audited and there were no exceptions listed by auditors. “We have all documents as proof. We can give details of where the ₹600 crore was spent — ₹174 crore has gone into a design school, and there are other investments in real asset companies, healthcare and wellness companies among others, which can all be accounted for with proof.”

The counsel for ED concluded arguments and said whether they had bungled or not came at the trial stage, not the remand stage. “Right now it looks like they have received kickbacks through their companies. It is a quid pro quo situation and divergence needs to be investigated,” Mr. Gonsalves said.

Upon hearing the arguments from both sides, Judge P.P. Rajvaidya ordered an extension until March 16 and asked the parties to appear for further arguments on the same day post lunch.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gjzczs/article31044675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-RANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ed-gets-extension-of-rana-kapoors-custody-plans-to-grill-him-on-several-loans/article31044646.ece

400,2020/03/12,HC has addressed the concerns of elected government: Puducherry Chief Minister,"“We have no intention to work independently or in collision with the Lt Governor. We have been insisting on everyone working within the boundaries of rules. Now any violation will be treated as contempt of court”

Expressing satisfaction over the judgement given by the Madras High Court on the powers of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi vis-a-vis the elected government, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said the court in its order has upheld the spirit of the Constitution and addressed most of the concerns raised by him about the style of functioning of Ms Bedi.

“We are satisfied with the judgement as it upholds the spirit of the Constitution, Union Territories Act and Business rules which govern Puducherry. We have been telling that everyone has to function within the framework of rules. The government’s view has been upheld,” he said addressing a press conference along with his Parliamentary secretary K. Lakshminarayanan.

Mr. Narayanasamy said he had time and again stated that the Lt Governor has no independent powers and she cannot give directions on her own without the knowledge of the concerned Ministers. “These concerns have been addressed by the court,” he said.

The court in its judgement has clearly stated that “the popularly elected Government of Puducherry no doubt represents the will of the people and the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers is binding on the administrator(L-G),” he said quoting the relevant observations made by the judges in the order.

The court has observed that “the will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government and to protect its free expression should be our first object,” Mr Narayanasamy said.

The court had also referred to the Supreme Court judgement in Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Vs Lt Governor of the national capital to underscore the need to respect “well-deliberated” decisions of the Council of Ministers by the Lt Governor.

The government had always maintained its stand that the Lt Governor could not outrightly reject cabinet decisions or direct the officials to act according to her directions on a policy matter. The issue has now been settled with the Court mandating the Lt Governor to refer the matter to Central government.

The two-bench judge had observed that “the administrator cannot on his own outright reject a proposal or direct the authorities to act otherwise.” As per the order, the Lt Governor can “differ and refer,” the matter to the Central government in case of any dispute on policy matters, the Chief Minister said.

Again quoting the judgement, the Chief Minister said the Secretaries are bound to submit papers to the administrator after getting the approval of the Chief Minister. “This again was another bone of contention. We have been opposing attempts by the Lt Governor to bypass the Ministers. Now, with the court’s intervention it is not possible,” he said.

The Chief Minister said the court on Wednesday had set aside a single bench order restricting the powers of Lt Governor only subject to the observations made by the judges.

“We have no intention to work independently or in collision with the Lt Governor. We have been insisting on everyone working within the boundaries of rules. Now any violation will be treated as contempt of court,” he said.

Mr Narayanasamy said he would compile all the relevant portions of the judgement and issue a standing order so that the officials work as per the laid down procedures.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ntfwsg/article31049375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PONDYCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/hc-has-addressed-the-concerns-of-elected-government-puducherry-chief-minister/article31049376.ece
401,2020/03/12,Govt. steps up efforts to tackle COVID-19,"Isolation wards with ICU-level facilities have been opened following a high-level meeting convened by CM

With more cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 being reported in neighbouring States — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala, that share cross-migration with Puducherry, the administration is ramping up its preparedness for potential COVID-19 admissions.

Isolation wards with ICU-level facilities have been opened at Jipmer, the Government Chest Diseases Hospital and six private medical colleges following a high-level meeting convened by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy.

The Government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to keep the virus at bay.

Various health agencies including the Health Department, Jipmer, government and private medical colleges and hospitals are working in accordance to a common protocol to prevent the spread of the disease, the Chief Minister told reporters.

“As foreigners account for 70% of the total tourists visiting Puducherry, we are keeping a close tab on the situation,” he said.

“We have kept on standby a combined capacity of 100 beds in isolation wards in public and private hospitals,” Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said.

According to a public advisory, those who have made an overseas trip are required to self-quarantine at home for a period of 14 days irrespective of whether they are sick or not and to report to a hospital if they develop any symptom.

The public has also been advised to avoid travel and overcrowded places and to adopt personal hygiene such as washing hands with soap frequently as a precautionary measure.

The Chief Secretary said he expected timely exchange of information from other States about travellers from abroad headed to the city.

The Health Department has set up a helpdesk at the airport to counsel inbound travellers in addition to similar desks at the main bus stand and railway station.

“At present, we have set up an eight-bedded isolation ward, which can be scaled up to a limited extent given constraints of space and manpower,” M. Vivekanandan, chief of Emergency Medicine, Jipmer, and nodal officer for coronavirus, said.

Unlike other contagious diseases, the threat from cross-infection in relation to the coronavirus is that unlike, say tuberculosis where we have a definitive treatment available in the eventuality of a transmission, no such protocol exists as of now for COVID-19, he added.

“While the good news is that all reported cases have been imported and we are not yet seeing a surge of infections, unless cases reported so far are quickly contained, we could be facing a more daunting challenge given the density of population and health infrastructure available here,” Dr. Vivekanandan said.

In fact, even the advisory to self-quarantine at home for those with a recent history of travelling abroad may not be practical given the relatively small size of dwelling units and the proximity to next-door neighbours, he pointed out.

The most important public interest message is to advise anyone with a travel history of visiting an overseas destination within the last one month and who has tell-tale signs of fever, cough and breathlessness, to contact the designated helpline (104). Even if one is not a traveller, there are precautions to be taken, especially if someone in the immediate circle has gone abroad.

Jipmer is one of the 50-odd laboratories in the country that has been equipped for testing for COVID-19. The roughly 15 throat swab samples referred from neighbouring districts of Tamil Nadu have been negative, the nodal officer said.

Open House suspended

Meanwhile, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi has suspended Open House sessions for the public to air grievances as well as visitor’s hour and public appointments for a fortnight in compliance with public health and safety guidelines. As an interim measure, complainants can open house deposit petitions in the drop box kept at the Raj Nivas entrance.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/uw6s9i/article31044272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12PONDYMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/govt-steps-up-efforts-to-tackle-covid-19/article31044273.ece
402,2020/03/12,"Role of Lieutenant Governor and elected government intertwined, rules Madras High Court","‘They are expected to act in unison and not in division’

The Madras High Court on Wednesday said a government is “a trustee for the little man who should not have a perception that the running of the government is a gigantic conspiracy”.

It held that the role of Puducherry’s Lieutenant Governor and that of an elected government in the Union Territory were intertwined as per law, and therefore they were expected to act in unison and not in division.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the ruling, setting aside the judgment of a single judge who, according to the Bench, had delivered a verdict in favour of the elected government and held that the L-G could not interfere with its day-to-day functioning by fostering a “basically incorrect” opinion that the legislature of the Union Territory was on a par with that of a State.

“The view of the learned single judge suffers from a basic fallacy of drawing a parallel on the basis of expected notions of democracy and republicanism vis-a-vis the status of elected legislature of a Union Territory and that of a State. This cannot be done by a judicial pronouncement and has to be through a legislative process by the appropriate legislature. For the time being, there is no such law that may equate or put them at par,” the Bench said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/flqfhn/article31044050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THRDKIRANBEDI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/role-of-lieutenant-governor-and-elected-government-intertwined-rules-madras-high-court/article31044052.ece
403,2020/03/12,AIADMK seeks resignation of CM in the wake of HC order,"Anbalagan terms court decision as a blow to Congress

The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) has demanded the resignation of Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy in the wake of Madras High Court’s decision to set aside a single Bench order restricting the powers of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan said the court decision was a blow to the ruling Congress. “Although the court decision is not in agreement with the principles of democracy, the Chief Minister has lost his legal battle. Hence, he should demit office at the earliest,” Mr. Anbalagan said.

‘Policy paralysis’

The administrative power struggle between the Lt. Governor and Chief Minister has brought policy paralysis in the Union Territory. The Chief Minister’s decision to take every dispute to the court had worsened the situation, he said.

The Chief Minister, while holding a Ministerial position in the United Progressive Alliance government, could have amended the Union Territories Act to vest more powers with the elected government.

He did not take steps to amend the UT Act when he was holding a powerful position in the Prime Minister’s Office.

404,2020/03/12,Read about Ustad Zakir Hussain’s childhood in author Sandhya Rao’s new book for children,"Author Sandhya Rao’s new book, ‘Zakir and His Tabla’, traces the life of a young Zakir Hussain and his relationship with his father and mentor, maestro Allarakha Qureshi

After Bavi Begum brought her baby boy home from the hospital in 1951, she placed the day-and-a-half-old into his father’s arms. He was to pour blessings into his son’s ears, as is custom. Instead, he recited tabla bols. “These are my prayers,” he said.

Though born to maestro Allarakha Qureshi, the world then did not know this baby would grow up to be a tabla virtuoso: Ustad Zakir Hussain.

In her new book for children, Zakir and His Tabla (Tulika), Chennai-based author Sandhya Rao traces Zakir Hussain’s childhood. As Priya Kurian’s accompanying illustrations go to show, there are two things that have remained constant in Hussain’s life: the tabla, and his messy crown of curls.

Early signs

Sandhya describes how a toddler Zakir would find any surface to beat his fingers upon: Amma’s cheeks, chairs he held on to as he tried to pull himself up, the pots and pans in the kitchen… Sometimes those he upturned would have food in them, and his body would be splattered with dal. Once, he even joined a Pathani procession passing by his house to play the dhol. Hung around his neck, the musical instrument dangled well below his knees!

A master tale Illustrations from Zakir and his Tabla | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

These are anecdotes Sandhya came upon during her research. “I watched Sumantra Ghosh’s film (The Speaking Hand: Zakir Hussain and the Art of the Indian Drum) on him, read Nasrin Munni Kabir’s book (Zakir Hussain: A Life in Music), read and watched lots of interviews and of course, listened to lots and lots of Zakir Hussain, both classical and contemporary,” she says.

Her life for the past year-and-a-half that she worked on this book was ‘a delightful journey of music’. She would play his music in the background as she wrote: “Then I would stop writing and only listen!” she exclaims.

The author herself is partial to the sound of percussion. “In the dim distant past when I was younger, I played a little piano and a little veena. But I must admit it was more a case of the spirit being willing but the flesh simply not doing its bit!”

The language of sound

In her book, she has sprinkled tabla bol at different points in the story’s progression: ‘Dha dhin dhin dha’.

“I tried to ensure that they reflect the music of the Punjab gharana, the style of tabla playing that Zakir Hussain inherited from his father, Ustad Allarakha,” she says, adding that the publishers helped her verify this.

One of the book’s main threads is Zakir’s relationship with his father. For many years, the two would wake up at three in the morning, sit in the verandah of their home in Mahim, a Mumbai suburb, and talk about musical traditions until the crack of dawn.

Formative years One of the book’s main threads is Zakir’s relationship with his father, Ustad Allarakha * SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT

With a lot of help from Priya’s fine drawings, the book helps children see themselves in a young musician’s shoes: “We must not ever forget all the hard work that goes into becoming a musician (or anything else, for that matter) of such a high calibre,” says Sandhya.

Explaining her choice of subject, she says, “His life, as indeed, the lives of many artistes of his and especially his father’s generation, is a beautiful amalgamation of the many different strands that make us who we are in an all-encompassing way, not in the narrow bigoted way that is being propagated today. The different coloured strands stand out, yet are in harmony with each other.”

And it is this sense of joy that she found reflected in his music as well as interviews, and that she wishes to convey to young readers. “Feel the music. Feel the joy. Feel the love.”

Leader Godwit: Yes, non-stop for 7,000 miles. No halts for food. We will go as high as 9,000m while over the Himalayas. And don’t forget, shed your old feathers, grow new ones. Get fit.

The bar-tailed godwits take off. After eight days they are flying over India. It is night time.

Leader Godwit: What’s this? The night sky looks different. I am confused. What are those lights down below? Are they new stars? How can we navigate?

Leader Godwit’s female partner: Use the earth’s magnetic field to guide us.

(Godwits use the magnetic chemicals in their brains, eyes and beak as sensors to land in their usual spot.)

At the time the godwits began their journey, a flock of steppe eagles too took off from Russia for India. They arrive at their destination at sunset.

Leader Eagle: It’s time to break and catch up on some sleep. But, wait... are my sharp eyes playing tricks? The landscape is different. There was never a reservoir here. What happened to the river?

Leader Eagle’s partner: Have we lost our way?

Leader Eagle: I can bet you 30 mice we have not lost our way. But this enormous dam — where could it have come from?

After much debate they decide to land.

Leader Eagle: I was right. We have not strayed from our path. I recognise this...my favourite Haldu tree.

406,2020/03/12,Dead birds spark bird flu fear in Thiruvananthapuram,"Bird flu has not been reported in Thiruvananthapuram before

Dead birds found on trees on the MLA Hostel caused a flutter on Wednesday. The incident sparked concern in the wake of the bird flu (Avian Influenza) outbreak in Kozhikode. But animal husbandry officials here said it could be a stray incident.

Three dead birds, reportedly egrets, were found on trees and recovered with the help of the Fire and Rescue Services.

“Two of the birds had their feet tangled in cord. We have sent the dead birds to the State Institute for Animal Diseases (SIAD), Palode, for tests,” Dr. Aravind, Animal Husbandry Officer for the district, said. Test results are expected on Thursday.

Bird flu has not been reported in Thiruvananthapuram before.

407,2020/03/12,Special notification issued for recruitment of priests from SC category,"12 priests from SCs in TDB and 11 in CDB have been recruited

Ever since 2017 when the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board began recruiting priests beyond considerations of their caste, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has recruited 272 priests and the Cochin Devaswom Board (CDB) has recruited 128 priests, Dewaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran told the Assembly on Wednesday.

Out of this, 12 priests in temples under the TDB and 11 in temples under the CDB were from the Scheduled Castes while the number of priests from the Other Backward Castes were 83 and 25 respectively.

Special notification

Since there were not enough Scheduled Caste candidates to fill the priest vacancies under the TDB, it has been decided to issue a special notification calling for recruitment from these categories to the 18 posts.

As part of the reservation being provided for forward caste candidates from economically backward backgrounds, six were recruited to the posts of lower division clerk/sub-group officer grade II in the TDB.

The board had now implemented a recruitment management software called ‘Devajalika’ through which aspirants could register online and the board could process the applications and prepare the rank list transparently.

Rank lists having 939 applicants for various posts in the TDB, 975 applicants in the CDB, and 61 applicants in the Malabar Dewaswom Board had been published already, the Minister said.

The recruitment from this rank list was going on.

Rounding up the discussion and voting on demands for grants for police in the State Budget for the financial year 2020-21, he said the Public Accounts Committee of the House was vetting the report. The CAG had found that the police had diverted the funds to acquire luxury vehicles and build villas for senior officers.

Earlier former Home Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan had demanded a police investigation based on the CAG’s findings against State Police Chief Loknath Behera.

Reduction in crime

He said the police have reported a reduction in serious crime such as rape and murder.

He said the number of such cases has fallen from 2,57074 in 2015 to 1,76821 in 2019.

The police have also achieved a 78% conviction rate in grievous offences.

409,2020/03/12,RGCB to establish BSL 4 facility,"Facility allows handling of extremely dangerous pathogens

The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) is setting up a BSL 4 testing and research facility here at ₹100 crore.

M. Radhakrishna Pillai, director of RGCB, said a decision to this effect had been taken at the institution’s governing council meeting, which was held on March 6.

A BSL-4 facility is the highest level of biosafety containment facility available today to handle extremely dangerous pathogens that can cause severe and serious life-threatening illness in humans that have no treatment or preventive measures.

A BSL-4 facility support study of diseases such as Nipah, H5N1 Avian influenza, Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and many others.

Only two so far

There are only two such laboratories in India, the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which is a dedicated facility for the study of human pathogens, and the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, a dedicated facility that studies animal pathogens.

Establishing a BSL-4 laboratory was not an easy task given the stringent international standards and safety precautions that had to be met apart from the high cost of training personnel and maintenance.

While approving the proposal, RGCB’s governing council made a special note of the ongoing internationally recognised research and development programmes in pathogenic viruses in the RGCB, including those on human and avian influenza, measles, Chandipura virus, chikungunya and dengue.

The Department of Health Research, Government of India, had informed the Department of Biotechnology that should the current COVID-19 outbreaks intensified in Kerala, the services of the RGCB would be used, Dr. Pillai said in a statement here.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/rgcb-to-establish-bsl-4-facility/article31044012.ece
410,2020/03/12,Plots to be given to small industries,"‘54,420 MSMEs since LDF came to power’

The State government is taking steps to make available multi-purpose industrial plots to address the issue of land scarcity faced by small and medium scale industries. The first such endeavour is being readied in Vadakkanchery in Thrissur, based on a public-private partnership model, Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan told the Assembly on Wednesday. He said 54,420 micro, small and medium scale units (MSME) were opened in the State after the LDF came to power. These units in total contributed an investment of ₹4,953.69 crore and created 1.9 lakh jobs.

He was answering a question from K.S. Sabarinathan on whether the Ascent 2020 investors’ meet had paved the way for any concrete investment on the ground. The Minister said that a total investment of ₹1.3-lakh crore has been promised. Memorandum of Understanding have been already signed for 32 projects, out of which 7 projects have started working on the ground. As part of improving ease of doing business, amendments were made to seven laws.

Ease of doing business

He said that the Kerala Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Facilitation Act, aimed at cutting red tape, dismantling the licence raj and ushering in an era of ease of doing business in the State, gives the investor a grace period of up to three years to get the requisite sanctions and accords him or her wide latitude in getting various licences.

However, the secretaries of some local bodies were still unaware of this Act and have been demanding entrepreneurs to produce all licenses immediately.

411,2020/03/12,Statistical panel to be set up,"For reliable data on various fields

The government has decided to set up a Statistical Commission to provide reliable and timely data on agriculture, industry, infrastructure and finance while planning for development projects.

The Cabinet on Wednesday decided to appoint P.C. Mohanan as chairman of the new commission. Mr. Mohanan is former acting chairman of the National Statistical Commission. Former Director, Economics and Statistics Meera Sahib will be the full-time member of the commission while Head of the Department, Indian Statistics Institute, Bengaluru, Madhura Swaminathan and Faculty, National Institute of Rural Development, Hyderabad, V. Surjit Vikraman will be part-time members.

A pressnote issued by the Chief Minister’s office said the decision to set up the commission was triggered by the lack of timely and precise data on the State’s domestic revenue, the quantum of investment, consumer spending and the State’s utilisation of revenue. This, it said, was affecting policy formulation and analysis.

The meeting also approved the draft memorandum of understanding and Article of Association for two special purpose vehicles to be created for the Life Science Park and Electronic Hardware Park.

412,2020/03/12,New facility for animal studies,"Unit for in vivo evaluation of medical devices to be inaugurated at SCTIMST

The development of medical devices at the Technical Research Centre of the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here is set to get a boost with the commissioning of the in vivo evaluation facility for animal studies on Thursday.

The state-of-the-art facility attached to the Technical Research Centre (TRC) of the SCTIMST is equipped to house 40 adult pigs and 70 adult sheep in compliance with the requirements of regulatory agencies. There is also space for minor medical procedures and acute pre- and post-operative management of experimental animals.

All the animal enclosures have automatic stainless steel drinkers for animals and the sheep facility has been provided with durable and impact resistant polypropylene slatted floor.

The building is designed to ensure safe housing of animals, their management and movement, species segregation and paddocks for grazing and exercise of sheep.

The entire facility is pest and rodent proof and has an efficient system for managing animal waste and effluents.

Functional safety

Animal evaluation of medical devices is an integral part of medical device development to establish functional safety prior to its clinical use in patients.

The Biomedical Technology wing of SCTIMST located at the Satelmond Palace campus, Poojappura, has carried out animal studies on numerous high-risk medical devices such as the mechanical heart valve, oxygenerator, vascular graft, hydrocephalus shunt, bone substitutes and dental materials to prove their safety and performance before they reached patients. The institute has also undertaken preclinical animal evaluation for Indian medical device companies.

Biomedical devices

Funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, the Technical Research Centre under the SCTIMST has taken up 40 research projects for the indigenous development of biomedical devices and biomaterials. Several teams are working on the projects to develop technologies for transfer to industry partners.

An official pressnote issued here said the new facility would enable the SCTIMST to go for GLP certification by the Government of India, thereby enhancing the global acceptance of animal study data generated by the institute.

413,2020/03/12,Pathrakulam area for flood mitigation,"Govt. not averse to returning area occupied by Chattamby Swamy shrine

The government on Wednesday told the Assembly that it would use the 65 cents of land it had recovered from the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha near the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple to mitigate the seasonal threat of flooding at Thampanoor and East Fort.

Replying to a submission by O. Rajagopal of the BJP, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan said the government was not averse to returning to the sabha the area occupied by the small shrine dedicated to Chattamby Swamy.

Land with govt.

The rest of the land would remain vested with the State government, the Minister said.

He said the prime land known as Pathrakulam was earlier a waterbody and part of an intricate network of channels and ponds that helped mitigate flooding in the temple locality and regulated the drainage of the nearby Padmatheertham pond.

The government had now sanctioned a scientific study to revive the old water management system to resolve the annual flooding of the downtown locality, that included the famed Chala market.

414,2020/03/12,Technopark firms take steps to check COVID-19 spread,"From thermal scanners to work from home, no stone left unturned

IT companies in Technopark are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their employees. UST Global, one of the companies in the IT park, will be introducing a new infra-red thermometer scanner at their entrances to scan every employee or associate entering the premises for high body temperature.

As per a communication sent by the company to the employees, this scan will be non-invasive and done remotely without any body contact. Any person with temperature above 99.6 Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees) will be requested to go to the company’s wellness centre or consult a doctor before being allowed inside the office.

Most of the companies have been asking employees from the COVID-19-affected districts of Pathanamthitta and Kottayam to work from home, if they had visited their home recently.

Those returning from overseas locations, where they had gone for on-site work, have also been asked to work from home for 14 days at least. Client visits have been cancelled.

Advisory on travel

Employees have also been asked to restrict travel on weekends or vacation, until the COVID-19 scare is over.

In case of unavoidable travel, they have been asked to utilise personal transport like cars or cabs on hire where they are minimally exposed to crowds.

Companies have also done away with biometric punching to prevent finger to finger spread of the virus.

All public gatherings in Technopark have been cancelled. Prathidhwani, a socio-cultural organisation of Technopark employees which regularly organises events on the campus, has cancelled all the programmes charted for the month, including its women’s day events, coding competitions and a food festival.

The organisation is now focussing on spreading awareness regarding the safety measures to be taken and in quelling fake rumours on the virus spread on the campus.

On Wednesday, Prathidhwani organised a medical camp.

Concern

The State government has issued special instructions and operating protocol to IT parks and IT companies as a precautionary step to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by IT Secretary M. Sivashankar at the Technopark here on Wednesday.

IT employees who have visited COVID-19-affected parts of Ranni and Kottayam during the past two weeks may be given permission to work from home for two weeks. The IT secretary urged all companies to provide necessary medical equipment and hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of the virus. The companies and employees have to ensure that workplaces are maintained clean and hygienic. Surfaces and objects, including telephones, keyboards and tables, need to be wiped with disinfectant regularly as contamination on surfaces touched by infected persons is one of the main ways that COVID-19 spreads. Biometric access need to be disabled to prevent finger to finger spread.

Hand-washing

The companies have been asked to promote regular and thorough hand-washing by employees. Sanitizing hand rub dispensers need to be put in prominent places around the workplace. It should be ensured that these dispensers are regularly refilled. This needs to be combined with other communication measures such as offering guidance from occupational health and safety officers, briefings at meetings and information on the intranet to promote hand-washing.

All visitors should be screened for COVID-19 symptoms and they should be asked to reschedule the meeting if they exhibit any of the symptoms. A barrier should be created between employees’ workspace and visitors. The companies have to make sure that staff, contractors and customers have access to places where they can wash their hands with soap and water. The lobby and security and visitors waiting area should be sanitised regularly.

Discourage gatherings

The companies have been asked to discourage large gatherings which involves close proximity of persons and encourage use of technology for meetings. Posters shared by government on COVID-19 need to be displayed in all common areas like lifts and cafeteria. The standard operating protocol for IT parks and IT companies has been issued to all the IT companies operating from the IT parks. He urged companies to adhere to government guidelines.

417,2020/03/12,CRPF gets first batch of Tiruchi-Assault Rifle,"Ordnance Factory, Tiruchi, (OFT) on Thursday handed over the first batch of indigenously-developed 7.62 x 39 mm Tiruchi-Assault Rifle (TAR), the Indian equivalent of AK-47 assault rifle, to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

CRPF took possession of the first lot of 500 TAR weapons out of the order placed for 6,137 rifles. The entire order will be executed in the coming months, OFT General Manager Sirish Khare said after symbolically handing over an assault rifle to Deputy Inspector General of CRPF, D. S. Rawat.

The TAR was as reliable as any other rifle of international standard, he said, adding that more improvements will be made based on customer feedback, to attain a position to say “we are the best”.

Mr. Sirish said he was confident of similar patronage from the central forces for the turbines and other products developed with in-house know how in keeping with the ‘Make in India’ slogan.

The General Manager said he had impressed upon the deputy commandants and assistant commandants of central forces including Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Central Industrial Security Force, Border Security Force, and Special Protection Group, besides the CRPF, earlier to examine other products and extend their patronage.

Mr. Sirish exuded hope that the OFT will secure orders despite competition from Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited, citing the superior make of the TAR. OFT, he said, was on course to reaching productivity level of 2,000 weapons per month.

So far, the OFT has executed orders for supply of 11,000 weapons. There were orders in hand for supply of 17,000 more weapons, Mr. Sirish said.

Expressing pride over receiving the indigenously-developed assault rifle, Mr. Rawat said the workmen were also the stakeholders in the fight against militancy by virtue of manufacturing a quality weapon. The feedback must be taken as constructive criticism for raising the weapon to the level of world standard, Mr. Rawat said.

The OFT started developing Tiruchi-Assault Rifle in 2015 and established production line in 2017 after successful in-house trials. The first batch of 200 TAR weapons was issued to Chhattisgarh Police in March 2017.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/yhrzpx/article31052231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13RIFLETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/crpf-gets-first-batch-of-tiruchi-assault-rifle/article31052232.ece
418,2020/03/12,Commuters sweat it out at bus stops that have no shelters,"With the rising summer heat in the city, commuters using city buses complain about the lack of proper shelters at several bus stops. It has been a long-standing yet ignored demand due to which commuters have to resort to sitting on footpaths or finding solace under trees or nearby shops, they say.

With the scorching sun, many waiting to board a bus towards Thanjavur at the Old Palpannai junction stop on Thanjavur Road feel dehydrated. “We live near here and go to a private college on Thanjavur Road. Many girls feel dizzy and need to be given water. Headaches from standing in the sun for long are also common,” said R. Ranjitha, a student waiting at Old Palpannai. Buses stop anywhere before the Ariyamangalam flyover and passengers have to run to board it, she added.

Passengers at the District Court bus stop, Goodshed Bridge near Head Post Office circle, Warehouse bus stop on Madurai Road and several other stops face the same plight. “We put our lives at stake standing on these narrow roads waiting for buses. The authorities should build permanent shelters. Sometimes accidents occur because vehicles following the bus do not know where it is going to stop,” said M. Subha, a housewife waiting at the Goodshed Bridge stop.

In some places, such as the TVS Toll Gate connecting Pudukottai main road to the Chennai-Bypass Road, bus stops exists but are unused due to inconvenient location. “If you notice, not even one person will be waiting at the shelter. The buses stop at the turning of the service lane and passengers resort to wait under the shade of trees or a street stall until a bus arrives,” says K. Sumithra. Travelling with children or aged persons at stops like these poses a huge risk, she added.

M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations, said that various such requests have been placed before the city corporation various times. “The civic body has set up a few air-conditioned bus stops with private partnership. But we are not asking for air-conditioned shelters at all stops. Only a proper shelter for passengers is required,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/goeje4/article31051897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13SHELTERTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/commuters-sweat-it-out-at-bus-stops-that-have-no-shelters/article31051898.ece

Awareness programmes were being conducted in all educational institutions to sensitise students on the need for frequent and proper hand washing and avoiding visiting crowded places. Students should wash their hands after play and clean all play materials and equipment with disinfectant. They should use tissues or handkerchiefs while sneezing or coughing. They should avoid spitting in public places and should not touch the eyes, nose and mouths of persons with fever and cough.

421,2020/03/12,Tiruchirapalli Corporation plans STEM park in city,"Proposals on establishing a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Park, smart toilets, installation of incinerators in each of the four zones, development of model schools and creating dense forests in each zone are some of the salient features of the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation Budget for 2020-21.

The Budget estimates, released by the Corporation Commission S. Sivasubramanian, in the absence of an elected corporation council on Thursday, projects the civic body’s total revenue for the 2020-21 financial year at ₹1335.47 crore and expenditure at ₹1335.04 crore, leaving a surplus of ₹42.65 lakh.

With the Smart City Mission under implementation, the Budget expects the infusion of capital funds to almost double this year to touch ₹1029 crore against the ₹526 crore shown in the revised estimates for 2019-20. The Corporation expects another ₹100 crore from the National Urban Livelihood Mission and ₹200 crore from the National Urban Health Mission. The Corporation revenue receipts are projected at ₹228.90 crore.

Prominent under the projects to be taken up with the Corporation’s General Funds are the move to create dense forests in each of the four zones, at an estimate of ₹40 lakh, as an environment protection initiative. The urban forests would be established depending on the availability of space and apparently adopting the Miyawaki method of afforestation.

Besides establishing 17 more micro compost yards in different parts of the city, in addition to the existing 32, the civic body has also planned to install incinerators – one each at the four zones in the city – at a cost of ₹16 crore.

Talking to reporters here on Thursday, the association general secretary, P. R. Pandian wanted the Tamil Nadu MPs to raise the issue in both the houses of the Parliament so as to add strength to the Tamil Nadu Protected Agriculture Zone Development (TNPAZD) Act, recently enacted by the State government.

Agriculture operations in the delta region would become impregnable in the future if the Union Government was also made to fall in line with the policy decision taken by the State government, he said.

Responding to a question on the demand for ‘eviction’ of oil exploration companies from the delta region in view of the enactment of TNPAZD Act from certain quarters, Mr. Pandian said any such move would only give room for the companies to approach the Court and thereby drag the Act into unwanted legal scrutiny.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/prevail-on-centre-to-preserve-cauvery-delta/article31051570.ece

426,2020/03/12,Civic body stops collection of garbage from restaurants,"‘Trucks deployed to collect food waste at night will no longer hotels’

In a significant development, the Tiruchi Corporation has stopped collecting solid wastes from bulk waste generators such as hotels and restaurants in the city.

Speaking to The Hindu, Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian said that the hotels and restaurants, which were generating more than 100 kg per day, had been given sufficient time to find their own means to dispose food waste. The Corporation had demonstrated different types of machineries and mechanisms to produce organic manure with food waste. It had also motivated the bulk waste generators to install machines on their premises. But, except a few, most hotels and restaurants had not set up mechanisms to dispose the waste on their own.

Hence, Mr. Sivasubramanian said, the Corporation had stopped collection of garbage from hotels and restaurants. The trucks, which were deployed for collecting food waste at night, would not visit the hotels and restaurants for collecting waste.

“Some hotels and restaurants generate loads of waste daily. They can not simply wash off their responsibility by depositing the waste with our collectors. If it is just few kilos, we can collect waste. Hence, I have issued orders not to collect waste from bulk waste generators,” Mr. Sivasubramanian said.

He said that hotels, restaurants, marriage halls and hospitals accounted for nearly 20% of waste generated in the city daily. Since the introduction of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the civic body had been campaigning for disposing waste at source. Hotels and restaurants had been reminded of the importance of installing solid waste management on their premises. But, only a few restaurants had taken the directive serious and installed machineries to produce organic manure by processing wet waste.

Mr. Sivasubramanian said that there would be no change in the decision of the Corporation. The waste collectors had been given clear instructions not to collect waste from bulk waste generators. Action would be taken against those violating the instruction, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/iw95fb/article31051274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13GARBAGETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/civic-body-stops-collection-of-garbage-from-restaurants/article31051275.ece
427,2020/03/12,New campus of GKMCH to become fully operational soon,"In-patient and out-patient units to be shifted to Sanapiratti within 10 days

The Government Karur Medical College and Hospital (GKMCH) has planned to shift all in-patient and out-patient units to its new campus at Sanapiratti.

These units have so far been functioning on the Government Hospital premises in the town, which was attached to the GKMCH about two years ago..

Though the medical college had begun its operation in 2019 with an intake of 150 students on the new campus, the hospital was not shifted to the new campus due to fine tuning of medical equipment and a few pending works. Now, the new campus of GKMCH at Sanapiratti is fully equipped both for treating patients as well as teaching.

Rosy Vennila, Dean of the hospital, told The Hindu that the new campus would become fully functional within 10 days. All necessary steps for shifting the day-to-day operation of treating patients from the existing Government Hospital premises to the new campus has begun.

Most of medical equipment needed for screening and treating the patients have been set up at the new campus. Similarly, furniture for doctors, para medical staff members, patients and others have also been provided.

The inpatient block has 700 beds. All basic infrastructure for both outpatient and inpatient blocks have been established and were fully equipped to start treatment. Hence, the inpatient and outpatient units would be shifted to the new campus within 10 days. Similarly, the kitchen also would start functioning within a week, Dr. Vennila added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/umr0y7/article31051266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13WARDTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/new-campus-of-gkmch-to-become-fully-operational-soon/article31051267.ece
428,2020/03/12,Anna University develops app on medicinal plants for farmers,"The mobile app will guide farmers on the ways of preparing land, testing soil and water, planting the crop and documenting its growth with geo-tagged photos

Anna University, through the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology at the BIT (Bharathidasan Institute of Technology) campus in Tiruchi, has developed a mobile application for farmers and industries providing information on 24 medicinal plants.

The android app will enable farmers to get direct crop advisory for medicinal plants at a click of button from agronomista, soil scientists, entomologists, pathologists, marketing experts and nominated scientists, according to the app developers.

The app will gradually guide farmers on the ways of preparing land, testing soil and water, planting the crop and documenting its growth with geo-tagged photos.

Farmers will also be provided with guidance on irrigation, application of fertilizers, management of pests, controllng weeds, handling harvest and post-harvest, primary processing, storage and transportation to meet stringent standards for Siddha medicine, ayurveda, pharmaceutical industry and international trade, they said.

The user-friendly app was developed by a university-led consortium that also includes Annamalai University, Chidambaram; National Institute of Siddha (NIS); Madras School of Social Work (MSSW); and technology partner Climate Smart Technologies (CST) that entails hosting of information on Package of Practices (PoP) online and updating it periodically based on high-quality research.

The App was developed as part of a proposal for establishment of Center for Excellence the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology had submitted to Ministry of Ayush, Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science and Technology.

“We have already done an extensive research on 14 medicinal plants. Ten of the plants have been prioritised in listing by the Ministry of Ayush and Ministry of Science and Technology. The App is expected to promote cultivation of high priority medicinal plants with market demand to get better prices,” said Prof. Antony Stephen, associate professor, Madras School of Social Work.

The cropping experience of lead farmers will be validated by crop scientists for creating a sustainable plant resource base for the 10 high priority medicinal plants with newer varieties and alternates in the southern region of India. The long standing cropping experience of farmers will also be validated by crop scientists.

The National Institute of Siddha (NIS), Chennai will be conducting pre-clinical trials using its various formulations such as chooranams, kalimbu and infused oils.

Jeevanandhan Duraisamy, Founder CEO of CST, stated that the medicinal plants android app framework was based on the PoPs developed for 250 agriculture crops globally and if fully adopted it would emerge as game changer in technology based sustainable medicinal plants trade globally with traceability in India.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/anna-university-develops-app-on-medicinal-plants-for-farmers/article31049168.ece

432,2020/03/12,A rickshaw driver with a social agenda,"‘Nizam’ of Guntur district to tour various States to spread message of humanity

For the people of Vijayawada and Guntur, 57-year-old P. Padmavathi, well known as ‘Nizam’, needs no introduction. The rickshaw driver, who has been on a mission to promote social issues for the past one decade, is getting ready to set out on an expedition covering several States in South India to create awareness about taking care of elderly persons, road safety, environment, and humanity.

Nizam, a native of Palakkad in Kerala, resides at Kollipara in Guntur district, after his parents migrated to the area in search of livelihood. It was in the year 1998, when the rickshaw driver decided to serve the needy after no one came forward to help him carry his father’s body. Since then, he had started to transport poor senior citizens, physically challenged and schoolchildren free of cost on his vehicle which he named – ‘Mother India Swaccha Bharat Amaravati Rickshaw Service'.

“I go by the philosophy that being a human, one should help others in some way. Though I do not have much earnings, I keep on moving from one place to another to spread the message,” he says.

He carries several placards to display them during his trips. Wherever, he goes, he serves the needy there. Despite being a rickshaw driver, Nizam never hesitates to share his meagre earnings with the needy.

The elderly person played the role of good Samaritan by offering free rides during the Krishna Pushkarams at Vijayawada in 2015. He also goes to Sabarimala, Kerala, to help devotees very often.

“Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had recognised my service and gave ₹13,000. Officials from Karnataka and Kerala have also lauded my work,” he says.

Journey plan

According to Mr. Nizam, he is prepared to go to Hyderabad from Vijayawada, later Bengaluru, and finally Kerala. Through out my journey, I wish to meet people, tell about my experiences and create awareness about humanity, he says.

“I would also like to spread awareness about environmental hazards, importance of wearing helmet/seat belt. We also see many leave the elderly parents in old age homes. I would also focus on the issue.”",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/wjfkaz/article31046450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01ONGRICKSHAW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/a-rickshaw-driver-with-a-social-agenda/article31046451.ece

Several aspirants filed their papers on the first day of nominations for the elections to 98 corporator posts in Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, here on Wednesday.

Vijaya Sai Reddy, Ministers Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao and Kurasala Kannababu and Lok Sabha in-charges and party observers, respective MPs and MLAs and coordinators.

There are multiple aspirants for the corporator posts with the number going up to 10 in some wards. The list prepared here will have to be finally approved by the party leadership. A final announcement is likely on Thursday, which gives nominees a day’s time to file papers with Friday being the last day for nominations. In wards where there are some strong candidates, only one name is likely to figure.

The Opposition TDP is also carrying out an exercise to select nominees. “We have aspirants for all the wards and the final list will be from among 400-odd aspirants,” MLA and TDP (Urban) president Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar said. The screening by MLAs and local in-charges is expected to be finalised and sent to the party leadership by Thursday morning. The final nominees will be announced after that.

435,2020/03/12,Traffic congestion at Asilmetta Junction a perennial problem,"‘Presence of 10 educational institutions in 1.5 sq km radius makes it worse’

The measures launched by the authorities to ensure smooth traffic flow at Asilmetta Junction appear to have fallen short to yield the desired result as congestion has become the order of the day, especially during the peak hours.

An estimate suggests that about one lakh vehicles have been added in the last four years, taking the number of vehicles plying on the city roads to more than 10 lakh.

Even as several initiatives have been taken to ease the traffic congestion, the perennial problem persists during the peak hours at Asilmetta Junction.

According to a senior traffic police officer, the major problem at the junction is the presence of more than 10 major educational institutions in radius of 1.5 square kilometre.

“During the peak hours (from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., 12 noon to 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.) more than 20,000 students with their commuting vehicles ply in the area at the same time, causing a chock-a-block situation,” said the senior officer.

Staggered timings

The traffic police had tried to implement the staggered timings for the educational institutions in the past, but it fizzled out after a while.

“It is a daunting task to regulate more than 20,000 people with vehicles including school buses and auto-rickshaws plying at the same time. Either the educational institutions have to be shifted or the timings have to be staggered and strictly followed,” opined ACP (Traffic Zone-I) Papa Rao.

Though the traffic police have engaged more personnel to regulate the vehicle flow, all roads leading to the junction including the under path gets blocked and it takes at least 25 minutes for the jam to ease.

Another critical aspect is the presence of the APSRTC complex in the vicinity of the junction.

This makes the congestion worse during the peak hours.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/m0j8l1/article31046445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VZ3TRAFFICJAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/traffic-congestion-at-asilmetta-junction-a-perennial-problem/article31046446.ece
436,2020/03/12,Have falling crude oil prices affected petrol prices in the county? Not really,"Crude oil price has seen the biggest drop since the 1991 Gulf war - but, it remains to be seen if the government will pass the benefit on to consumer

The dynamic pricing of petrol has not resulted in a fall in retail prices commensurate with crude oil price crashes. Crude oil prices have fallen again lately, coinciding with an economic slowdown, but the high share of central excise duties have resulted in retail prices remaining relatively high.

Lost in translation

Petrol prices in Delhi (red, left-axis) remained above the ₹70/litre mark on March 10. Since late-2014, crude oil has experienced price crashes on many occasions. But this has rarely translated into a reduction in retail petrol prices. This is largely due to the rupee’s depreciation and a high share of excise duties.

Centre's high share

The graph shows retail petrol price in Delhi (bar) and the States’ (line, yellow) and the Centre’s (line, red) share of revenue from it. While the States’ share has remained constant, the Centre’s has increased many times after late 2014, peaking in mid-2016. This explains why the retail price never dropped despite a huge crash in oil prices.

“Apeirogon means a shape with a countably infinite number of sides. It was a startling word when I first stumbled upon it. And what it really means in relation to the story which is about two men who lose their daughters, is that we are all involved… one is Palestinian and one is Israeli and they travel the world around, sharing the story of what happened to their daughters in order to harness the power of their grief. We are implicit in a certain way, we are all touched by it…somehow we are part of every story,” says Colum McCann expalining the title of his book.

The story of Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan, “…spins out in every different direction but always comes back to the two girls, Smadar who was 14 or 13 when she died and Abir who was 10 when she dies. Smadar died in a suicide bombing and Abir died from a rubber bullet that hit her in the back of her head,” says McCann. He continues, “And these two fathers came together and for years and years now they have been travelling the West Bank, Israel, around the world, trying to tell the story in order to say…as they would say in Arabic..khalas, enough. And it is time for us to know one another and if we don’t tell our stories we wont know one another. And if we don’t know one another all this fear is going to come tumbling in upon us. And as Bassam says, “If we don’t know each other above ground the only place we will know each other is above ground.”

McCann recollects, “The men are real. I knew the moment I met them that things are never going to be really the same for me…these two ordinary men begin to speak and I realise they are not ordinary men, they are extraordinary…and I, embarrassingly, started to weep…They wrote on a napkin:let us harness the power of your grief. I did not know that I could ever write about them, but they kept coming back to me. So this is a spirit of hybrid novel…the men will be going on tour with me. They allowed me to go in and rewrite some of the things…I am not interested, neither are they, in the absoluteness of facts. Facts are mercenary things…text, emotional text is completely different and that is what I have tried, to capture the emotions…we are a lot more complexed than our political parties think we should be, a lot more nuanced.”

Pleading the need for peace in such a beautiful manner, McCann says, “It is a heartbreaking story…For any parent it is very difficult to lose a child…so difficult that we do not even have a word for it in the English language…and yet there is extraordinary hope in the two men…”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/when-grief-shows-a-shore/article31048944.ece
438,2020/03/12,Rare variants of Urdu,"Two recent books spell out the features of Maithili and Gulabi Urdu

Urdu, despite being perceived as the language of aristocratic culture, does not follow a single monistic grammatical structure and strait-laced vocabulary, and multiformity, both at syntax and diction level, is its defining feature. Its unique cadence lies in the diversity and unorthodox use hardly makes it jerky or impairs the flow of the language. This is what finely-grained arguments eloquently bring out in two recent books on the not much-known variants of the language: ‘Maithili Urdu’ and ‘Gulabi Urdu’. Dr MJ Warsi, an author, and teacher of linguistics spells out the features of Urdu spoken by a considerable number of people that draws considerably on Maithili and a celebrated writer Dr Aziz Ansari meticulously lays bare what constitutes Gulabi Urdu.

Both the books betray academic rigour and proficiency in the language and go into details of two recognisable segments of language that are distinct from the widely known variations, ‘Dehlvi Urdu’, ‘Lakhnawi Urdu’, ‘Dakhani Urdu’ and ‘Punjabi Urdu’ with a sense of thoroughness.

One has to pore over how some rigid boundaries of the language are breached, and language gets lexicalised. Jahangir Warsi does well to zero in on the unconventional expressions used by people living in a particular area in his book “Maithili Urdu”.

Tracing the cultural history and etymological foundation of Maithili Urdu, Warsi points out that the Muslims living in Mithila know local language Maithili very well. Still, they use Urdu as their medium of conversation, which is not adequately measured up to the requirements of the standard Urdu. Its syntax and semantic structure owe much to Urdu, hence it can be described as Mithilanchal Urdu. At spoken level, Maithili speakers falter considerably, and the gender of the word remains flexible. One tends to agree, but here the difference between a language and dialect gets blurred.

Since no two persons speak alike, the book deflates the infallible myth of consent-construct system of the standard language, but the question why this distinctive mode of expression, spoken by people residing in Dharbanga, Samstipur, Begusarai, Madhubani, and Muzaffarpur, has no literature of its own remains unanswered.

Warsi regrets to notice that no serious attempt has been made to provide an intimate glimpse into the redemptive linguistic bearings of the language that immensely enriched Maithili, Hindi and Urdu literature. The book divided into six terse chapters discusses the syntax, morphology and segmental phonology and frequent use of technical terms makes it a bit jarring. Still, it does domiciliate a new variant of Urdu efficiently.

Pink Urdu

Pink is the colour of hope, warmth, affection, inner peace, tranquillity, and accessibility, but this nomenclature can be tangled with prose for a means of concealing meaning and dog the provisions of the colonial law conclusively. It has been creatively carried out by a well-known author and poet of Bhopal, Siddiq Irshad, better known as Mullah Ramozi (1896-1952), who envisaged, ‘Gulabi Urdu’. Aziz Ansari astutely delineates his seminal but less acknowledged contribution in his book, “Mullah Ramozi: Tanz-o-Mizah Aur Shairye”.

Ramozi’s brilliant linguistic enterprise oddly resembles with argot that uses turgid sentence structure, unconventional diction, and ever-changing patterns of meaning that are impenetrable to the power that- be but have the potentiality to arrest the attention of the discerning readers.

Contrary to the widely held view that Gulabi Urdu is an ornate and mushy prose genre, the veteran author Aziz Ansari cogently elucidates the salient features and symbolic import of Mullah Ramozi. Paring down the acceptable word usage hierarchy, Ramozi went in for a new sentence structure that began with a verb followed by subject and object.

It corresponded to the verbatim translation from Arabic, and the clerics frequently used this sort of prose for the translation of the religious texts into Urdu. With a marked sense of critical sensibility, Aziz asserts that Mullah’s offbeat prose style was the creative fusion of old-fashioned translations are done from Arabic and Persian.

It was mostly word by word translation used for rendering the Koran into Urdu as a slight modification or aberration could hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslims. It fired the imagination of Ramozi, and he emulated this style by roping in his literary and aesthetic prowess to ward off the repressive provisions of the Press Act, vigorously pursued by the British Government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. The author wrote a piercing and equally witty piece “Gulabi Urdu” that was carried by the Congress in its issue of December 27, 1917.

Artistically camouflaged in irregular sentence structure, the article delivered a stinging blow to the government without making it too visible. Still, its metaphorical meaning went well with the Urdu knowing people. Ramozi ran through this unconventional but alluring prose composition for seven years (1917-1924), and with the slackening of the rules, he pulled the plug and started using familiar style. Through his perceptive book running into 200 pages, Aziz explores the oeuvre of Ramozi comprising poetry, humorous outpourings, political and journalistic writings candidly. These books stand apart from the run-of-the-mill books published frequently as they acquaint the readers with little known, but significant strands of Urdu and Jahangir Warsi and Aziz Ansari deserve appreciation.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/v9v7zm/article31048389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DFRKIDWAI,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/rare-variants-of-urdu/article31048390.ece
439,2020/03/12,New environment impact norm cuts time for public hearing,"The draft EIA notification proposes to be an update to the EIA of 2006, which specifies a “minimum of 30 days” for people to respond.

A set of key updates to India’s Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, the law that governs how the threat posed by large infrastructure projects to the environment ought to be evaluated, proposes to reduce the time given to people to air objections.

Also Read How not to do an environmental assessment

The draft EIA notification proposes to be an update to the EIA of 2006, which specifies a “minimum of 30 days” for people to respond. The current version of the update, which will likely become law in 60 days, gives a “minimum of 20 days” of notice period. It also requires that the public-hearing process be wrapped up in 40 days, as opposed to the existing norm of 45 days.

The public hearing process is considered a key component of the EIA. An organisation has to submit a detailed plan, as part of the EIA process, that details the nature, need, potential impact and remedial measures, if their proposed infrastructure project threatens to significantly impact a region. As part of the process, representatives of the company, State and district administration representatives must discuss the environment impact management plan, record objections from residents of the region and submit these to a committee of experts, constituted by the Union Environment Ministry, who will then take a holistic view of the comments and the management plan and decide on whether to accord clearance to the project.

While expert committees constituted by the MoEF appraise projects, those below a certain size are appraised by State-level authorities called the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).

On March 2016, the Ministry further delegated the authority to grant clearances for up to five hectares of individual mining lease of minor minerals and 25 hectares in clusters, to the DEIAA, or District Environment Impact Assessment Authority.

Over the years, several provisions in the EIA 2006 have been challenged in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and led to the MoEF modifying the rules. The EIA 2019 aims to accommodate all these revisions, officials have told The Hindu.

Last year, the Union Environment Ministry circulated a ‘zero draft’ to States where it sought comments from State authorities and prepared the draft that has now been put up for public feedback.

Independent experts opine that the proposed EIA introduces new aspects to the regulations. Kanchi Kohli, who analyses EIA legislation and its effects, said that authorities were earlier mandated to monitor projects for compliance with environmental norms every six months. It has now been proposed to relax the monitoring frequency to once a year. “Shorter processing times pose both institutional challenges and the quality of participation,” she added.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/new-environment-impact-norm-cuts-time-for-public-hearing/article31052406.ece
440,2020/03/12,Spotting the nomadic Rosy Starling through Delhi's chatter,"Read on to know more about medium-sized bird which visits the Indian sub-continent twice a year

One of my fondest memories is from four years ago, standing with my then 90-year -old Paati (grandmother) on our balcony, facing an old mulberry (Shatoot) tree. In spite of her diminished hearing, she could make out a cacophony of chattering calls from the tree and asked me if I knew what they were. I was quick to point out a flock of Rosy Starling, and spent 10 minutes telling her about them, their flocking roosting behaviour, and their constant chatter while roosting or feeding.

The Rosy Starling is a medium-sized (19-24 cm) passerine (perching) bird in the starling family, gregarious in nature, thus living and moving in communal harmony. It is a vision in black and pale pink, hence the name. The males are often more vibrant than the females. During their breeding time (May-June), they assume a longer crest and showcase a pink beak and legs (yellow-orange-ish in non-breeding times). Juveniles are considerably duller with brown, black, and white shades on the body. The scientific name Pastor roseus has been derived from the Latin word ‘pastor’ meaning shepherd and ‘roseus’, literally meaning rosy or rose-coloured.

Starlings are mostly found in flocks, and this bird is no different. It breeds in Eastern Europe and certain parts of Asia in huge colonies along the Steppes. During breeding season, they follow an insectivore diet, feeding mostly on invertebrates. At this time, they help farmers get rid of locusts and other pests on their land, thus acting like natural pest controllers. Their breeding is lined perfectly with the abundance of locusts and grasshoppers to satiate their innate need for food during these times. Once the pairing is complete, both adults assist in building a nest which is placed in crevices on cliffs, in old buildings, and in tree holes as well.

Their feeding behaviour changes drastically when they migrate in mid July-August, to the Indian Subcontinent and other tropical areas in Asia. Here they feed on fruits and berries (wild and cultivated) and also eat white millet (jowar) with an occasional insect too.

The Rosy Starling is a strong flier, has a direct flight, accompanied by rapid wing-beats and short glides. It is one of the very few birds that spends very less time in its breeding range and spends most of the year in its wintering range.

Huge flocks of these starlings often indulge in a mass aerial stunt where thousands of birds swoop and dive in unison — called starling murmuration, a phenomenon captured in several videos and pictures online.

It is a mesmerising act of pure pleasantry. One may assume that they flock together to evade predators like falcons and eagles that have the tendency to hunt singled out birds.

They usually perform these stunts especially at dawn and dusk, coming out of roost or before they roost for the night.

Rosy Starlings lead quite the nomadic life and are seen in Delhi twice. Once is in September when flocks spend a few days in our garden by roosting in fruiting trees like mulberry, and then carrying on Southwards (till even Sri Lanka). The second time is during their reverse migration in the month of March-April, when they move upwards and then to their breeding grounds. The best places to see their murmuration are Lodhi Garden, India Gate and other open areas with a lot of fruit-bearing trees in Lutyen’s Delhi.

My grandmother believed that one’s never too old to learn something new, and always showed a keen interest in my work. Ever since she learned to recognise this bird following our first conversation, she would often point them out to me and others who visited her. I lost her recently.

Now, a Rosy Starling will always remind me of her incredible strength, free-spirited nature, and her determination to learn and share her knowledge with others. The fact that she always supported me in all my endeavours, will continue to motivate me to show people the beautiful world outside (and sometimes inside) their homes and offices.

441,2020/03/12,India’s first COVID-19 death confirmed in Karnataka; total number of cases touch 78,"Fresh cases in Maharashtra, Delhi, Ladakh, A.P., U.P., MEA advises BCCI against IPL

Health officials in Karnataka reported the country’s first COVID-19 death late on March 12 after samples of a 76-year-old man, who was a suspected COVID-19 patient and passed away on March 10 night, tested positive for the disease. The patient from Kalaburgi also had co-morbidities such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes.

He had returned from Saudi Arabia on February 29. According to reports, he fell ill soon after and was admitted to a private hospital and later shifted to the Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS). His throat swab was sent to check for COVID-19 infection.

Despite efforts by the District Health Official to convince his family that he be shifted to the GIMS isolation ward, he was transferred to a private hospital in Hyderabad. Later, he was discharged from the hospital and was being brought back to Kalaburgi when he died en route.

The Union Health Ministry confirmed the COVID-19 death in a late night statement.

Karnataka Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey, who confirmed that the patient’s samples tested positive for COVID-19, said contact tracing, isolation and other measures as per protocol are being carried out. The government of Telangana has also been informed.

Earlier in the day, the Union Health Ministry said the number of patients in the country has risen to 74, with fresh cases reported from Maharashtra, Delhi, Ladakh, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, as well as one foreign national. India is still seeing local transmission, the Ministry said.

The rise in numbers came a day after the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Stating that India is still seeing local transmission, the Health Ministry said: “We have to remember that while there is no need for panic we are dealing with an evolving situation. Currently we have 1,500 contacts of the 74 positive cases currently being monitored,” Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry Lav Agarwal told reporters at a press conference on March 12.

In empty stadiums

In widening fallout of the pandemic, the Ministry of External Affairs advised the BCCI not to go ahead with the cash-rich IPL. MEA Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi, the nodal officer to coordinate efforts to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, said the government’s advice to the BCCI would be “not do it at this time but if the organisers want to go ahead, it is their decision”.

Following a directive from the Sports Ministry, the remaining two ODIs between India and South Africa in Lucknow and Kolkata, the Indian Super League football tournament final in Goa are among events to be played in empty stadiums.

The Ministry directed all National Sports Federations to “...ensure that no public gathering takes place in any sporting event...if the event cannot be avoided, the same could be done without allowing gathering of people, including spectators”.

In Andhra Pradesh’s first COVID-19 case, a 24-year-old youth, who returned from Italy, has tested “positive”, health officials said in Nellore. With two more cases being confirmed in Kerala, the total number of cases in the State has touched 16. Two more cases were also confirmed in Maharashtra, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, taking the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to 14.

The patient in Nellore, who was admitted to the isolation ward of the Government General Hospital late on March 9, is now stable and all his vitals are normal, said Nellore District Joint Collector V. Vinod Kumar. All the five relatives of the youth have been kept under observation in GGH.

The new cases were reported from Kannur, of a person who had come from Dubai, and Thrissur in a person who returned from Qatar. They are currently in isolation in Pariyaram Medical College hospital and Thrissur General Hospital respectively.

Explained | How is India containing COVID-19?

Globally while COVID-19 has over 1,18,000 cases sweeping across 114 countries, the Health Ministry has asked Indians not to panic but co-operate with the government to detect and contain the situation.

“The country should stay focused on a preventive approach. Till now 10.5 lakh people have been screened at 30 designated airports in India,” Mr. Agarwal said. He added that the country currently has 1 lakh testing kits and that the government was in talks with even the private sector to ensure that enough isolation beds are made available should the need arise.

Speaking about the Indian who are abroad and want to return home, the Ministry said an Indian team of doctors will leave for Italy to collect and bring swab samples of Indian students stranded there so that they can be tested before being brought back to the country.

“The government is also undertaking measures to ensure safety and security of its citizens in Iran after it became clear that the country was facing a COVID-19 outbreak. We will be bringing back 130-150 Indians by three flights,” Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Rubina Ali said.

Coronavirus updates | March 12, 2020

On March 7, 108 samples were received from Iran. These samples are being tested at the AIIMS laboratory. Also, six scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are stationed in Iran and have so far have collected swab samples of over 400 Indians stranded there, a senior Health Ministry official said.

“The first batch of 58 evacuees from Iran has arrived on March 10 with 25 men, 31 women and 2 childrenon board. All evacuees are asymptomatic at present,” the Health Ministry noted.

India has so far evacuated 948 persons from COVID-19 affected countries. Of these, 900 are Indian citizens and 48 from different nationalities, including from Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, USA, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa and Peru, teh Health Ministry said.

In Delhi the mother of a 46-year-old man, who had tested positive for COVID-19, has also been detected with the virus, making her the sixth patient here.

“The woman, a 69-year-old has been admitted to RML Hospital. Her son has a history of travel to Japan, Geneva and Italy. They are residents of West Delhi’s Janakpuri. Eight other members of their family were found to be asymptomatic. Cinema halls in Delhi to remain shut till March 31 due to coronavirus threat,” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.

Pune has reported nine cases with District Collector Naval Kishore Ram stating that a person who had travel history to the United States tested positive on March 12.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said there is sufficient stock of raw materials for medicines and formulations available to meet requirements of the situation arising due to the coronavirus outbreak.

NPPA Chairman Shubhra Singh met representatives of pharmaceutical industry associations on the issue of availability of critical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

442,2020/03/12,Coronavirus: The story of a Kerala vlogger who documented his stay in isolation ward,"Shakir Subhan, better known as the ‘Mallu Traveller’ on YouTube, continued to post videos after he got himself admitted into an isolation ward at a government hospital in Kannur

“My lab result has come. It is negative. The doctor also has approved my discharge. As I told you all, be fearless. This coronavirus won’t affect us,” says a cheerful Shakir Subhan, better known as the ‘Mallu Traveller’, in Malayalam in one of his latest videos, which shows him still sporting a mask.

The avid vlogger from Iritty, Kannur, whose videos documenting his three days in an isolation ward at a Government hospital have gone viral, is happy to be home. The globe-trotter had been on “a solo world bike tour” when he was forced to discontinue his odyssey in Azerbaijan just as he was to enter Georgia, due to the global coronavirus outbreak. His videos, posted in his YouTube channel the ‘Mallu Traveller’ that has over 6,62,000 subscribers, attempt to bust some quarantine myths and throw light on what life is like in an isolation ward.

“I reached Iran on January 28 and was in the country till February 16, a period when reports about the spread of the virus were rife there. Throughout my trip, I had been wearing helmet, gloves and jacket. But I had travelled to several places in Iran where, it later turned out, many cases of coronavirus were reported,” says Shakir.

On February 16, he crossed the Azerbaijan border, at a time when news about the spread of the virus in Iran started coming in. “Though borders with Iran were closed by most of the adjoining countries, Azerbaijan had kept one open. Gradually, cases were reported in Azerbaijan too. After a few days, when I was about to enter Georgia, they stopped me,” he says. Shakir then handed over his motorbike, a TVS Apache RTR 200, to the customs department and was stranded in Baku, where he soon billeted at the apartment of a Malayali friend.

“For four days, I was cooped up in a room. Then something scary happened. I came down with a cold and soon decided to come home as I realised perhaps there was no other way. I managed to buy masks and sanitisers, which by then, were already in short supply in Baku. There were at least five confirmed COVID-19 cases in Baku by then,” he recollects.

On March 5, he took a flight to Kannur, with a stopover at Dubai. “There, I tried to isolate myself as much as possible and sat in a different terminal. I knew that, perhaps, followers of my vlog would easily recognise me and come forward to take selfies and shake hands. Also, most of the people travelling in that corridor are usually from Kannur. I didn’t want to be noticed,” he says.

Shakir clicked a photo of the passengers seated near him for identification in case of an eventuality. As the flight touched down in his home town, he informed the airport authorities of his travel history and was soon taken to the hospital isolation ward in an ambulance. “All the airport staff were wearing masks and all counters and corridors were cleared for my carriage; I felt like a VIP,” he says with a chuckle.

Shakir had already disposed of most of the articles he was carrying in Baku, except his phone, laptop and cameras. He had also informed his family not to come to the airport and apprised them of his plans of getting himself admitted into an isolation ward.

“During my admission, I continued vlogging. The ward was much better than what I had anticipated, unlike the dystopian world many imagine it to be. It was hygienic and a safe distance was kept between the beds. However, interaction with other patients, all under observation, was not permitted. My blood and body fluid samples were taken for testing,” he explains. After the positive news that the test results were negative, he was discharged on Sunday (March 8).

Shakir, who is in the habit of video-documenting his daily life, says he wanted to show others what an isolation ward would be like in the time of such a pandemic. “I think it’s a mystery place for many. The truth is there’s no need to be apprehensive,” says the 30-year-old. He maintains the importance of staying positive, while at the same time taking requisite precautionary measures. In fact, Shakir’s prudent thinking and voluntary hospital admission later came in for praise from State Health Minister KK Shylaja.

Shakir, who previously gained notice with his vlogs on his pan-India hitch-hiking trips and travels in other countries, says he plans to resume his world odyssey from Baku at a convenient time later.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/gbj12y/article31048523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tvmShakircoronavirus1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-the-story-of-a-kerala-vlogger-who-documented-his-stay-in-isolation-ward-after-virus-scare-cut-short-his-solo-bike-trip-across-the-globe/article31048525.ece
443,2020/03/12,Coronavirus | Put your travel plans on hold,"How the novel Coronavirus pandemic is disrupting travel in India

Vishal Radhakrishnan, 31, last December, planned a 15-day Euro trip with his sister, who lives in the US. It was to be his first long vacation in nearly two years. Leave approved, flights and hotels booked, he was eager for his first visit to England, Spain, and Italy. He never imagined an epidemic would put an end to his plans.

As we go to press, according to the WHO, 463 people have died and over 9,172 affected by COVID-19 in Italy, which has the most serious outbreak after China.

Though the number of cases in Spain is comparatively less at 1,622 (according to Spain’s Health Ministry), it, definitely, is not safe for Vishal to vacation. “I hope to visit some parts of England at least,” he says, even as the number of cases in the UK rose to 323. With the US restricting travel, his sister has backed out of the trip. Vishal is now figuring out cancellations and refunds. “Help desks aren’t really helpful because they are flooded with calls. So, I might need to visit the airlines and travel booking agencies in person to sort this out,” he says.

Back home

India is monitoring its gates closely to curb the spread of the disease.

An advisory from the Bureau of Immigration announced the suspension of visas granted on or before March 3 to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan, who have not entered the country yet. The advisory also added that all foreign and Indian nationals entering India from any port are required to furnish a self-declaration form (including phone number, address in India, and travel history), to health and immigration officials. India, in February, had cancelled existing e-visas issued to all foreign nationals of China and advised Indians to avoid travelling to the country.

Meanwhile, airlines, hotels, tour operators and other travel-related offices are attempting to decrease the disruption caused by the disease. Travel operator, Ixigo, has announced a full refund for all flight bookings to China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Spain, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. The policy is applicable on both one-way and return bookings for travel dates upto March 31.

Its co-founder Rajnish Kumar expects the situation to improve in the summer travel season. He adds, “While we have seen a slowdown in the top countries impacted, there is still a demand to travel to other areas. On the international front, people are still actively booking their vacations for places like Sri Lanka, Maldives, Vietnam, Thailand and Bhutan.”

Airbnb is letting hosts and guests from severely affected regions cancel reservations without charges. Anyone who can’t complete their trip due to official travel restrictions, medical or disease control duties, flight or ground transport cancellation initiated by the provider due to COVID-19, or suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are also exempted from cancellation fee.

Air India, GoAir, IndiGo, Emirates among other airlines have announced full refunds on cancelled flights on select routes. But many passengers on social media, who cancelled their travel due to the fear of contracting the disease, expressed their displeasure on being charged a cancellation fee.

Emirates has asked its staff to take unpaid leave for up to a month, as demand for air travel has plummeted. Its Chief Operating Officer, Adel Al Redha, says, “With the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have imposed travel restrictions on entry for operating crew and passengers, which has resulted in Emirates having to amend its operating schedule by either reducing frequencies or cancelling flights to specific destinations.”

Vinay Malhotra, VFS’ Regional Group COO for South Asia, Middle East & North Africa, and Americas, says, “We are exploring steps to assuage the concerns of people about busy public areas due to the nature of the virus. For example, for visa customers who want to avoid returning to the visa centres to pick up their passports, we are considering discounted rates on courier return services so their processed passports can be delivered to their home or office instead. We are also contemplating lower fees for our Visa at your Doorstep service, for those customers who are requesting an alternative to visiting the centres to submit visa applications.

Increasing panic

Cindu Muthuvairavan works for a Danish company in Sharjah. “Business trips are not advised unless the situation is very important,” she says, “Working from home is encouraged.” The United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Health and Prevention said people entering the country will have to undergo medical check-ups. The country with a majority of expats has already shut daycare centres and instructed schools to close. Many of Cindu’s Indian colleagues’ plans to travel home during summer now appear uncertain.

Now, domestic travel is also being disrupted in India. Mayur Venkatesh, a sales engineer from Coimbatore, says, “My job requires me to travel extensively. Even the regular places (like hotels) where I stay, now seem to be a potential threat. You never know who was there before. This creates a roadblock for business plans. Some things can be discussed over the phone, but there are key decisions that can only be finalised in a face to face meeting. In such circumstances, the COVID-19 threat becomes a huge hindrance.”

April is usually the onset of summer vacation in India, but travel goals for this year will have to wait.
