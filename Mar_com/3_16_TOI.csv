0,['16/03/2020'],The audience forgot about coronavirus for some time during my recent concert in Bengaluru: Mir Mukhtiyar Ali,"‘Do take care of yourselves, but don’t give in to fear’

Maut se darna nahi chahiye



‘Even in fusion tracks, I try to retain the essence of traditional Sufi music’

‘Bollywood trying to commercialise Sufi music is probably not a good idea’

Mir Mukhtiyar Ali’s Karnataka connect…

Mir Mukhtiyar Ali, a well-known Sufi artiste from Rajasthan , serenaded Bengalureans recently with some soulful tunes. Amid the coronavirus scare, the folk artiste performed to a small set of audience in the city. Those who attended the show came wearing masks and even kept a distance from each other inside the auditorium. In a telephonic conversation after the concert, Mukhtiyar spoke to us about his experience here and shared his views on Sufi music and more. Excerpts:The coronavirus pandemic has got many people panicking. However, wherever permitted, artistes are performing in concerts and have been travelling around the world for the same. Mukhtiyar says that while he obeys the regulations in place, he also ensures that panic does not kick in. “One should just follow the rules put in place. Do take care of yourselves, but don’t give in to fear.. We should just keep faith in the almighty,” he says, adding, “During my shows in Bengaluru, I encouraged audiences to enjoy the performance as much as possible. And their applause proved that that they, too, were engrossed in the music. Those few hours, they almost forgot about coronavirus.”Mukhtiyar comes from a family known for their oral tradition of Sufi singing. So, in an age of fusion music, how open is he to collaborate with artistes from other genres. “I do worry about forsaking my traditional values in the quest for fusion music. It also makes me nervous, at times, because even while mixing genres, I would still want to do justice to the conventional format. Hence, whenever I collaborate with my peers, I try my best to retain the essence of Sufi music,” he says.Commercialising Sufi music to fit the Bollywood format may not always work out, according to Mukhtiyar. “It is important to retain the authenticity of Sufi music even in terms of lyrics,” he adds.Talking about getting youngsters interested in Sufi music, Mukhtiyar says, “We just need to create awareness about this genre of music in its traditional form and those interested will come forward anyway. For instance, when I perform a medley of poems by different artistes from different time periods and backgrounds, people do realise that the message they are trying to convey are the same. And that piques their interest. In fact, as the exposure has increased, more youngsters have been trying to learn Sufi music, of late.”In the past, Mir Mukhtiyar Ali has performed at multiple locations in Karnataka — Bengaluru, Mysuru and Hampi, to name a few. One might say that the language barrier exists, but he does not feel the same way. “The audiences understand the lyrics, and even applaud when a certain message in the song resonates with them.

The actress, who was seen in the Sonam Kapoor and Dulquer Salmaan-starrer ' The Zoya Factor ', also featured in ' Fanney Khan '. In the romantic web series 'Broken But Beautiful', she essayed the role of Porno, a fearless young woman. A Mumbai girl, Pooja started her career as a model and moved on to anchoring shows. The actress, who studied biotechnology before she joined the industry, also hosted the Pro Kabaddi League on television. Ask her if it has been tougher for her to land good roles in Bollywood because she doesn’t hail from a film family, and she says, “Yes, it is definitely tougher for an actor who comes from a non-filmi background to get a break in the industry. But, I also feel that talent never goes unnoticed. One needs to be aware of the fact that it’s a business and many factors play a part in an individual getting a role. I feel that this is the best time to be an actor owing to the number of avenues that have opened up. Short films, web shows, independent directors making interesting content… there is no dearth of work if you are good at your craft.”Talking about the kind of work that’s coming her way, Pooja says, “I am neither a Kapoor nor a Khan, so I can’t really be choosy about my work. I need to make the most of the opportunities that come my way. It is important to be careful about the kind of roles you add to your resume. Over the past few years, I have evolved as an actor.”Pooja wants to do interesting roles that will make a difference to the project that she is a part of. She says, “I am still finding my feet in the industry and am extremely excited to see how my journey, as an actor, pans out. Being an anchor instilled a lot of confidence in meand helped me be comfortable in front ofthe camera.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74637226,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-45318/74637226.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/pooja-bhamrrah-this-is-the-best-time-to-be-an-actor-owing-to-the-number-of-avenues-that-have-opened-up/articleshow/74637232.cms

Sanitisers are kept handy for all members of the crew

Makeup artistes now wear a mask at all times while applying makeup

Remember to wash hands thoroughly before and after the procedure

It is mandatory to clean the cases regularly with alcohol-based disinfectants

Sanitise makeup tools, particularly sponges, brushes and applicators

COVID-19 scare continues to cripple day-to-day activities around the world. While the usually-crowded spaces like malls, movie theatres, pubs, exhibitions and summer camps remain shut, for many of those working in the entertainment industry, the show still must go on. Even as shoot schedules for film and TV shows continue, necessary measures to ensure hygiene and safety on the sets are mandatory. The number of people on the set is more or less like a public gathering — considering the entire cast and crew required for the shoot. In addition to staying equipped with sanitisers, tissues and disposable applicators to keep germs away, the one aspect that requires a certain amount of physical proximity and extra caution has to do with the process of getting the actors and models camera-ready — namely styling and makeup.“Makeup artistes on the sets usually have their set of brushes and applicators that they use on artistes going in before the camera. Artistes often require regular touch-ups through the day as well, and using the same makeup applicator for all could be dangerous,” points out filmmaker and television producer Shruti Naidu.Special efforts are being made to ensure that makeup procedures for the actors remain clean. “Additionally, artistes have been asked to bring their personal applicators and products to ensure hygiene. The makeup artistes also wear masks while applying makeup for others, and sanitisers are kept handy for all members of the crew,” she explains.Independent makeup artists and stylists, too, seem to be leaving no stone unturned as far as maintaining hygiene is concerned. “Given the fact that physical contact is inevitable while doing makeup for someone, it becomes all the more important to maintain hygiene at every stage of the process — be it disinfecting the makeup tools such as the brushes and applicators or wearing a mask while applying makeup,” says Bengaluru-based hairstylist and makeup artist Romi Thokchom.City salons and parlours are also ensuring that staff members are taking all the necessary precautions to keep themselves and their clients safe. To make sure their clients do not have anything to worry about, salons have also sent across messages that assure their clients of the safety measures in place. “We continue to sterilise work stations and equipment, sanitise ourselves and our guests, using masks, gloves and disposable kits wherever possible. We also have in place thermal screenings and self-declaration forms for guests before they entire our premises,” states a message from Bodycraft, a spa and salon chain in the city.Further elaborating on precautionary measures, Romi says, “It is advisable to avoid sponges or beauty blenders if you are dealing with multiple clients and do not have the time to fully clean and sanitise each tool. Sponges not only absorb the makeup, but also the individual’s face oil. And with an infectious disease outbreak such as this, it is better to avoid this.”If you are one among those who prefer to test makeup or lipstick colours before you make a purchase, it is not really a good idea to continue to do so. Bangalore Times visited a couple of makeup and wellness stores around the city to check if the sales personnel in those places were still offering free trials using their testers. And it was found that their first instinct was to generously test colours on customers’ skin right away. It is only after you insist that you do not want a tester to be applied directly on your skin that the sales person follows the required hygiene protocol. They either apply the colours on a sponge that is closest to your skin tone or use the necessary alcohol disinfectant to wipe out the inside and outside cover of the tester before they hand it over to you.While a lot of the ongoing film productions have taken a week-long break from the sets, complying with the directive for a shutdown in the city, there are a few movie and TV units that have continued to shoot after reducing the overall number of people on the sets.Actor Vijay Suriya, who is currently shooting for his yet-untitled film based on the IT sector tells us, “I use my own makeup kit on the set. The sponge I use is washed and disinfected each time I use it. Everyone on the set wears a mask now, especially those who come in close contact with others — such as the makeup artist. All precautions are in place; the cast and crew are consistently using sanitisers before they touch equipmentor any other object on the set. Since we are shooting in an IT office, the number of people at the workplace, too, has not been an issue, as most people seem to be working from home here.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74637982,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-165999/74637982.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/actors-makeup-artists-and-stylists-take-strict-precautionary-measures/articleshow/74637995.cms

There was a time, when seeing a woman in khaki literally kick a** was a thing for the big screen. In fact, actresses like Vijayashanti and Malashree are best remembered for their fearless cop acts, bashing up goons and highlighting that women are just as good as men in a profession largely dominated by the latter. In reality, though, women were a rarity on the force then, and Kiran Bedi was the only name that everyone knew for a long time. That has, no doubt, changed over the years, with more women taking to khaki. In fact, Bengaluru City Police has as many as eight DCPs and two ACPs, despite the fact that gender stereotypes continue to be a major roadblock for women in the force, in general.

Bindra says that the young generation of today is far more competitive, not just in sports but in life too

'The society is much more competitive, which has translated into sporting performance'

Abhinav Bindra's visit to Gurgaon was all about business. He was here to launch a branch of his wellness and fitness centre. When we meet him at the rooftop of the building in DLF Phase 3 overlooking the city landscape, the former World No 1 and Olympic gold-medallist shooter tells us he has been meaning to come to the Millennium City for quite some time. He says, ""We were looking at two populations – the athletes and the non-athletes. Of course, there are athletes in the region but also, there are lots of corporates, and what we do here is well suited for them. I have always wanted to be here and I finally got a chance now.""Bindra's centre deals with physical fitness and wellness of people. But much of the conversation at the launch event was about a different kind of wellness threat – the global coronavirus scare. Increasing number of cases of coronavirus across the world, particularly in East Asia, has led to calls for the Olympic Games – to be held in Tokyo in July-August – to be either postponed or cancelled. Several events being held in the run-up to the Games are seeing athletes drop out as well. Bindra agrees that this isn’t the perfect environment for an athlete in the lead-up to the biggest sporting event in the world. ""It plays on every human being’s mind and an athlete is no different. It does (affect) to a certain degree but you just have to block it out and focus on your sport and your performance,"" he tells us.The ace shooter may find some parallels in the situation with the Zika virus scare preceding the 2016 Rio Olympics, where he participated, too. Back then, the World Health Organisation had issued an advisory for people travelling to Rio de Janeiro, the Games' host city, which had an increasing number of cases of the disease. Bindra recalls, ""I think the Zika scare wasn’t as bad. From an athlete’s point of view, you just have to leave it to the experts and prepare to the best of your abilities. Just focus on your preparations. An athlete’s life is all about adapting to situations, adapting to new scenarios that you haven’t thought may come by. That’s exactly what this current situation is as it is currently impacting qualification tournaments, scheduling. But that is the situation for everybody. My advice to all athletes would be to accept the situation, adapt to it, and be prepared.""For decades, India has produced several world-class athletes in various sports, who haven’t been able to translate their form and skill at the Olympics. Bindra believes this will change now. He says, ""At present, there is a very different lot of athletes that we have going into the Games. There are very young athletes in my sport of shooting but also in a variety of other sports. The young generation of today is far more competitive, not just in sport but in general. Society is much more competitive and that has also translated into sporting performance. We’ve been seeing these superb performances in many sports in the last few years and that is because of that element of competitiveness in the society. I’m hopeful that things will change and our rate of conversion of potential to actual medal will become better and we will come back with multiple gold medals.""",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74637681,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-118717,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/off-the-field/abhinav-bindra-on-coronavirus-and-olympics-an-athletes-life-is-about-adapting-to-unforeseen-scenarios/articleshow/74637666.cms

Namita Bhandare and Sahaya Sharma

Be it Amrita Sher-Gill or Frida Kahlo , there has been no dearth of talented women artists. However, throughout the history of art, women have only been represented as an artist's muse, instead of the creative force behind the art. So, when Delhi-based art curator Teesta Bhandare called for an exhibition titled 'Voices of Women' during Women's History Month, it was aimed at gaining better representation and visibility for women artists in India.The exhibition, which opened on Friday, showcased the works of 12 women artists from around India, which revolved around their experiences and perspectives of womanhood. ""I decided to use women as the framework as not only are they underrepresented, but also because of the diversity they bring in terms of the medium, the styles and the stories through these 37 artworks on display,"" said Teesta.The artworks, by artists like Anupam Sud , Bharati Kapadia and Parul Thacker, explored a variety of different mediums ranging from digital prints, water colour, oil colours to acrylic and 3D murals. ""The displaying artists also range from being critically acclaimed names in the industry to young millennials with a strong voice,"" explained Teesta.Recognised for her contributions to the growth of printmaking in India, Anupam shared her experience with the audience, saying, ""Our entire life is art. So, when you are with your work, you are one with it. You don’t even rationalise the experience. But once the work is over, you think about it and experience the outcome of it.""Kanchan's works celebrate women as an act of silent rebellion. ""These works had been done before but when Teesta approached me, they totally fit the theme. Being a woman, I have a soft corner for women’s issues and all the atrocities against them. I don’t want to come out on the street and shout slogans. So, this is my way of voicing out our stories,"" she said.

23,['16/03/2020'],The rise of latex style,"It’s been called everything from provocative to curve-hugging and sensuous. And not without reason. For sexy latex — once just a part of boudoir fantasy and fetishes — is going mainstream, with movies endorsing the slick outfits on screen and a bunch of A-list stars giving it their nod of approval, too. You had Deepika Padukone who returned from Cannes last year in shiny latex leggings, T-shirt and a denim overcoat. Sonakshi Sinha donned a strappy latex midi dress and shared a photo on Insta, Malaika Arora aced her style game in a little black bralette that she teamed with a long ochre coat and Ananya Panday channeled chic in her bubblegum-pink hued latex fitting dress. A few days ago, beauty mogul and reality TV star Kim Kardashian brought latex into the limelight again as she donned not one, but three full-body latex outfits in a single day! Sister Kourtney Kardashian matched her latex look. And singer Lady Gaga’s new video shows her in a pink latex two-piece outfit. What’s the draw about this shiny fabric?Designers reveal what gives it such a thriving appeal. Says stylist Sanjay Shnoy, “Latex garments were earlier only synonymous with the erotic as bondage outfits and it still gives that vibe. But now, they’ve jumped onto the ramp in a huge way. You can wear it to a party or an evening event. Some people even travel in it, for instance latex jeggings or tights. It can be worn in any colour. You can mix and match like Nicki Minaj tights or shorts in one colour and jacket in another. You could go head-to-toe in it like Kim Kardashian. If you can’t wear a bodycon dress, go for an A-line shirt or even a peplum. We may soon even see latex ghagras.”Stylist Mohit Rai brings up another advantage. He says, “Latex is very form-fitting, it literally leaves nothing to the imagination. Women who work out hard and have a toned figure want to show it off and this is perfect for that. The fabric is very fluid and looks like one is wearing next-to-nothing. I personally love the fabric. I have styled Sonakshi Sinha in a strapless red latex gown and she looked great in it. Not just Kim Kardashian, but a number of stars have worn latex of late and it’s so mainstream now, that you’re sure to see more of Bollywood adapting to it as well.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74639667,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-25586/74639667.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/the-rise-of-latex-style/articleshow/74639586.cms

While in restaurants, offices etc, anyone with a flu or cold is being asked to maintain a distance or go home, there's an industry that is finding it tough to keep their hands off their customers, literally.The beauty industry works in close contact with customers, and now, parlours are taking measures to ensure the spaces are sanitised. They're also ensuring that clients with the slightest cold or flu are not entertained. Customers, on the other hand, are opting out of parlour services unless absolutely necessary, and even then, they are relying on sanitisers to maintain hygiene while availing parlour services.Parlours and salons are constantly being sanitised, masks have been made mandatory for employees and receptions and counters of these spaces are stocked with sanitisers. Zakir Khan, who owns Creme Salon by Zakir Khan in South Extension, tells us, ""We are not taking appointments from people who are inquiring whether they can avail services while suffering from cold, cough or flu. If a staff member is feeling unwell, they are being asked to stay at home. It is not just for our safety, but also the safety of other clients.""Pushkaraj Shenai, CEO, Lakme Lever, says, ""In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are taking measures to ensure the safety of our team and guests at every level.

Every tool required for cutting and styling is sterilised before and after use and we are ensuring deep cleaning of all salons.""Seema Nanda, founder of Estetico – The Facial Bar and The Nomadic Spalon, which provides spa and salon services for women at home, shares, ""There is a decline in our business by 50% because people are preferring not to visit parlours. After Holi, people called to check whether we could send someone to provide beauty services at their home, but some of the clients seemed unwell, so we advised them to avail services once they feel better. We’re also ensuring that our employees wear masks while they’re attending a client.""Agreeing on how services have been hit, Deepak Jalhan, creative director of Looks, Prive Salon, mentions, ""We are washing our hands after every service and ensuring that people use sanitisers upon entering the salon."" Salon employees are also facing a tough time dealing with customers. ""These days, customers use a sanitiser upon entering the salon, and make sure we use it as well, even when we sanitise our hands in front of them. Then, they ask whether we have given services to a client with a flu or cold. Some customers also ask us to not to remove our masks while talking to them,"" shares Sonali Prakash*, an employee of a salon chain in Noida.Salon employees tell us that their regular customers, who are usually chatty, are preferring not to talk, and some are not even removing their masks while availing beauty services. ""People are thinking ki kuch bolenge aur saans le lenge toh kuch ho jaayega. So they are not speaking, and instead are gesturing us to not come too close while doing their facial or threading. Abb ussmein kaise distance maintain karein? Waxing karaate time bhi log masks laga ke rakh rahe hain,"" says Deepa Singh, an employee with a parlour in Janakpuri.Komal Sachdeva, a freelancer, recently visited a parlour where she found the conditions to be slightly unsanitary. She tells us, ""I had to attend a family gathering last week, so I had to get my threading done. Though I was provided a sanitiser when I entered, the attendant who was assigned to me kept rubbing her nose.

25,['16/03/2020'],SBI plans FIR over leaked clip of FM pulling up brass,"NEW DELHI: A day after a controversy erupted over finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pulling up SBI executives led by chairman Rajneesh Kumar , the country’s largest lender said it was initiating action — including lodging an FIR — against “mischievous elements” for unauthorisedly recording and circulating an audio clip over social media, while ministry officials defended the minister’s impatience.They described the FM’s comments as “justified and legitimate concern” over the functioning of state and locallevel bankers.“She was lamenting the insensitivity of local bank officials and pulled up the officers of the state-level bankers' committee (SLBC). In fact, their insensitive action had deprived almost 8 lakh tea garden workers of accessing their Jan-Dhan bank account dues for more than a year. The poor tea garden workers were unable to get their own DBT benefits withdrawn. They were suffering for no fault of theirs and the local bank officials, despite various attempts by the local and state administration, were not paying any heed to resolve this issue ,” a senior officer present at the meeting in Guwahati last month said.At the meeting, the issue was flagged by the Assam government, led by state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma . He complained that there had been no progress despite several meetings convened by him. Sarma told the Union FM that some of the senior executives did not attend these meetings.The issue came to light after the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation issued a statement criticising the FM’s comments, only to withdraw it later. After the audio clip started doing the rounds on social media on Saturday, Sarma took to Twitter to say that AIBOC did not understand the context.In the audio clip, Sitharaman is heard referring to SBI as a “heartless” bank, while telling bankers that their approach was unacceptable. She is heard saying she will approach the RBI to resolve the issue, although it is not her job. “What kind of SLBC is this?... I will speak to the RBI governor today. It is not my business. You should have approached the department and made it talk to RBI and you should have finished it before 24 months were exhausted. I am sorry to sound so harsh. I am not pleased, sir. I am not pleased, chairman SBI, SLBCs don’t function like this.”She instructed the bankers to start the work while she spoke to RBI and then added: “Nothing makes up for your inefficiency. Let me be blunt on this.”Sitharaman then demanded a timeline to fix the problem faced by the tea garden workers who could not access their accounts and instructed SBI chief to meet her in Delhi. Describing it as “utter omission of job”, the FM is heard telling the SBI chairman that she holds him “completely responsible for a failure” and would have a “detailed talk”.The minister then rapped a local executive. “You may be a senior official but I am sorry, you let the government down,” she is heard saying, after which the banker apologised.At the meeting there were also complaints of the absence of ATMs and branches, which resulted in tea garden workers being unable to access money lying in their accounts.On Sunday, Sarma seemed to strike a reconciliatory tone. “The government highly values spirited partnership of all banking institutions,” he tweeted.The 8 lakh accounts were opened by the Assam government in 2017 and an incentive amount of Rs 5,000 was transferred to each account. But due to the “half-hearted approach of local bank officials”, a sizeable section of these tea garden workers were being deprived of their rightful dues, the officer said.The senior finance ministry official said that Sitharaman had pulled up the local bank executives, including the one who was heading the state level bankers committee for ”being insensitive” to the plight of 8 lakh tea garden workers.“These local bank officers were giving some lame excuses. The finance minister did not agree to it and asked the issue of these tea garden workers be resolved on urgent basis,” the officer said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74643788,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-765530,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-plans-fir-over-leaked-clip-of-fm-pulling-up-brass/articleshow/74643782.cms

28,['16/03/2020'],DM: Ensure screening of visitors,"GAYA: District magistrate Abhishek Singh on Saturday held a meet with the hospitality and spirituality sector stakeholders as part of the exercise to create awareness about Covid-19 virus, including preventive and curative measures. The meet was held at Bodh Gaya in the conference hall of the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee.

Due to its importance as a tourist and pilgrim destination, Bodh Gaya is regarded as a vulnerable point for the virus spread. There are about 50 registered hotels and guest houses and almost an equal number of foreign monasteries that provide accommodation to visitors from abroad, particularly visitors from countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Myanmar. The on arrival visa facility for visitors from more than 100 countries available at the Gaya International airport stands suspended.

The DM advised the hoteliers and monastery managers to ensure the screening of all existing occupants as well as new entrants with the help of infra-red thermometers. Conventional thermometers require body contact between the health staff and person being screened, thereby making health staff more vulnerable to the virus. Infra-red thermometers, on the other hand, record body temperatures without any physical contact and need much less time as compared to conventional thermometers.

Maintenance of hygiene in the hotel and monastery premises including living rooms and wash rooms was all the more important. The advisory issued to the hoteliers and monastery managers explicitly states that anybody showing symptoms of Covid-19 virus as per protocol, must immediately be isolated. Detailed travel history of suspected cases must be recorded. Orientation of front desk employees of the hotels and monasteries must also be ensured.

Earlier in the day a mock drill was conducted at the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College (ANMMCH) hospital to tackle emergency situations.

Asked about the likely closure of shopping malls, DM Singh said a decision on the issue will be taken on Monday.

Magadh University Registrar Sidnath Prasad Deen, on Sunday afternoon notified suspension of biometric attendance of all teaching and non teaching employees of the university head quarters, PG depts and colleges. The employees will remain exempted from biometric attendance till March 31 2020.

32,['16/03/2020'],Vagh-Khel of Taide: Gratitude to the big cat,"Keri: Down the ages, inside the Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary, a hamlet in Tambdi Surla called Taide , the tiger was respected as the folk deity during festivities of the Shigmo festival. In continuation with the age-old practices and in reverence to the big cat, Vagh-Khel is performed by locals during this Hindu festival.

Sagun Gaonkar, 57, said, “When the kunbi community from Dharbandora came and settled in Taide, they were doing the slash-and-burn practice of agriculture, which is called the Kumeri. As the area was visited by tigers, we decided to perform the Vagh-Khel to express our gratitude to the big cat, and with the hope of getting protection to the farmers from our practice.”

Since the earliest ages villagers lived their life in the forests of Goa completely in tune with nature. The tiger was at the apex of the food chain, and people would consider the existence of tiger supplementary to their own survival and well-being. As such tigers were accorded the respect given to a folk deity.

In Surla village of Dharbandora taluka, there were 12 hamlets which were dominated by the Maratha community, and they collectively worship the goddess Gajalaxmi as Barabhumika. On the sixth day after the full moon, when representatives of hamlets surrounding Taide assemble at Brahmanimaya temple, they visit a sacred place called the ‘Fulaphator’ and invoke the mother goddess for her blessings.

After they return to the tune of the Ghumat and Kasale, reciting folk songs, artistes perform a folk drama called the ‘Ranmale’ which brings to life the socio-cultural life of bygone days. During the early morning hour of the seventh day, a man holding a wooden mask representing the tiger appears and enacts the ‘Vaghro’.

Taide is known for the unique temple of the Brahmanimaya that showcases the anthropomorphic figures (having human characteristics), erotic scenes, warriors, processions, zoomorphic images (representing animal forms or gods of animal form), inside the sacred grove. The Vagh-Khel is performed to consolidate the bond between man and the tiger.

PATNA: In a daring incident, three armed criminals shot dead a young garment shop owner and critically injured his father in the shop located at Barauni Chowk under the Phulwaria police station area in Begusarai district on Sunday evening. The injured, Bhushan Prasad Sah (45), has been admitted to the sadar hospital for treatment.

Taking a strong exception to the rising incidents of heinous crime in recent times, Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar has put the station house officer (SHO) of Phulwaria police station, Jyoti Kumar, under suspension and recommended departmental proceedings against him for negligence of duty.

The incident took place around 5.30 pm when the father-son duo was sitting in their shop. Three criminals riding a motorbike reached the shop and opened fire causing grievous injuries to them. While the son, Saurabh Kumar (30), died on the spot, Sah was rushed to a local hospital for treatment.

The firing led to closure of shops in the market in panic. On getting information, a police team led by Phulwaria police station SHO Jyoti Kumar, rushed to the site of occurrence and inquired about the incident. However, the assailants had escaped from the spot by the time police arrived there.

Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar didn’t rule out demand of extortion as the reason behind the incident. “Police have been informed that extortion was demanded from the victims but they did not inform the local police. We have taken the matter seriously and will crack the case at the earliest,” the SP said.

Meanwhile, Teghara sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Ashish Anand said police have got some clues in the case. “Raids are on to nab the culprits,” he added.

Though there has been no emergency situation in the village, the move has come as a relief for authorities.At present, no Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in this area though 45 are under observation. According to Rajeev N, panchayat vice-president, the home is in the perfect location to set up an isolation ward as it is in the middle of a five-acre land. Even during floods in 2018 and 2019, Varghese had converted his house into a relief camp.However, some people had objected to Varghese’s decision of converting his house into an isolation ward fearing disease spread. “Some people complained about it. But I convinced them that it would not affect anyone. It’s a relief to get an isolation room in this locality itself,” Rajeev said.Mathew Varghese, a Gulf returnee, is settled with his family in Thiruvananthapuram.

Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has summoned Kochi corporation secretary for hearing the local body officials before taking a final decision on closing it down.The slaughterhouse has been functioning without an effluent treatment plant for the past several years. Blood from the slaughterhouse drains into Thevara-Perandoor Canal and hence, KSPCB had issued a notice to the corporation to take urgent measures to improve the conditions at the abattoir.“We have summoned the corporation secretary.

SURAT: Two leopard cubs were found charred to death in a sugarcane farm at Pipariya village of Mandvi taluka in Surat district on Sunday. The charred remains of the two-month-old cubs were recovered by forest department officials and sent for postmortem.

Labourers busy harvesting sugarcane crop in the farm of Amit Patel spotted the charred remains of the cubs in the early morning hours. They immediately left the farm fearing attack by the mother leopard, following which villagers alerted forest officials.

""The cubs are too young and that a female leopard was spotted with them a few days ago. The farm owner and labourers were not aware that the leopard was hiding in the farm along with its cubs. The cubs had died accidentally,"" said Pratik Patel, a farmer from the village.

""The female leopard was seen moving around in the farm in morning. The leopard’s presence created panic among labourers. Villagers had spotted the female leopard with four cubs a few days ago. It is believed that she was able to save the lives of its two cubs,"" Patel added.

""The work to cut sugarcane began in my farm two days ago. Labourers, who are camping in the farm, never noticed the leopard and the cubs. The cubs died in a fire set to clear dried waste in my farm,"" said Amit Patel, owner of the farm. Two leopard cubs were rescued from Amit’s farm during harvesting of sugarcane crop in 2015. Meanwhile, forest officials are keeping watch in the area and also have placed a cage to rescue the leopard and its cubs.

""The mother leopard will return to the farm at night in search of its cubs. We will come to know about the other cubs on seeing her,” wildlife activist Jatin Rathod said.

""The cubs are suspected to have died in a fire at sugarcane farm. Our team has recovered the cubs’ remains. Forest department will get their postmortem done which will ascertain the possible cause of their death,"" said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat.

Dense sugarcane plantation makes it difficult for humans to enter the farm which the leopards prefer for breeding. In a traditional harvesting method, labourers set fire to the dried waste in the farm at night and start cutting sugarcane crop in the morning.

46,['16/03/2020'],Govt asks all districts to assess crop damage,"PATNA: State agriculture department has sought reports from all districts regarding crop damage due to untimely rain and hailstorm over the past few days. The inclement weather has destroyed standing crops, including pulse, oilseeds and even wheat in many districts.

State agriculture minister Prem Kumar said a meeting through videoconferencing was held with officials of all 38 districts on Sunday.

“Standing rabi crops, including pulses, potato, lentil and wheat have been damaged at many places in the state owing to untimely rain in the past few days. Accordingly, agriculture department officers as well as ‘kisan salahkars (farmer consultants)’ have been asked to visit the villages and talk to farmers. The district officials have also been asked to conduct survey to ascertain damages in their respective areas and submit reports within three days,” the minister said.

Rainfall at most places and hailstorm at a few places in the state were witnessed on several days during the last fortnight. This led to untimely accumulation of water in the agriculture fields and the hail directly damaged the standing crops.

Elaborating on the type of damages to the crops, Anil Kumar Jha, deputy director in agriculture department said, “Since the rainfall occurred along with high speed winds, standing crops fell on the ground at many places. This was also due to the fact that the crops had reached grain formation stage and their upper body or productive parts were comparatively heavier. Besides, crops like oilseeds and mustard got damaged at many places owing to accumulation of water.”

Meanwhile, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said the state government should provide necessary compensation to farmers. “Farmers should be provided compensation without any delay for the damages caused to rabi crops owing to untimely rainfall. Most farmers in the state are facing difficulties in earning their livelihood due to crop damages. Any delay, slackness or corrupt practice in giving compensation to the farmers will not be tolerated,” Tejashwi tweeted on Sunday.

Surat: The state government imposed Disturbed Areas Act on areas falling under the limits of Rander and Limbayat police stations on Sunday. The Act is already in force in some parts of Katargam, Chowk Bazaar , Mahidharpura , Lalgate and Athwa police stations since 2017. The demand for its imposition was being made by BJP MLAs from these areas for some time.

Rander and Limbayat areas have sizeable population of minority community and migrants. The Act restricts buying and selling of properties in these areas, but people belonging to different communities can still strike a deal with the approval of the district collector. The buyer and seller are supposed to provide various documents to get approval from the government for transferring the ownership of the property to a person from another community.

""We receive over 300 applications in a year at Surat collectorate for transfer of property ownership under this Act. We have a team of officers which has been authorized to undertake the process,"" Surat district collector Dhaval Patel said.

Limbayat is largely migrant-dominated area. Majority residents in Limbayat are employed in textile and chemical industries and have come from Maharasthra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha.

""There is sizeable population of minority community in my assembly area. Residents from many residential societies have been demanding for the last few years imposition of this Act. There are only 20 per cent homes of Hindus in many societies. Now, those planning to buy a house of a Hindu in my area will have to take permission from the collectorate,” said Sangita Patil, BJP MLA from Limbayat.

Purnesh Modi, BJP MLA from Surat West seat, too had demanded implementation of the Act in Rander. ""After my demand, I have been doing constant follow-up to get the approval. The Act will be updated in near future where a committee comprising district collector, municipal commissioner and police commissioner will give approval to property deals. It will be made further strict to transfer property ownership between members of two communities,"" Modi said.

""There is no need to impose this Act because people are living in peace and harmony in these areas. No major complaint or issue has been reported over transfer of property ownership from these areas,"" Congress leader Kadir Pirzada said.

53,['16/03/2020'],ABD area gets focus with scores of proposals,"Trichy: With Trichy City Corporation unwilling to spend the general funds as a part of its austerity measures, a majority of the infrastructure announcements made in the budget relies solely on Smart Cities Mission funds, which is focusing on the Area Based Development (ABD) zone. The key demands including Integrated Bus Terminus (IBT), satellite bus stand for Srirangam and foot over bridges were among the misses in the corporation budget.

The Smart Cities Mission has bifurcated the city into two zones namely ABD and pan-city zone. ABD zone covering 7 square kilometre area around the Rockfort hillock will get more focus compared to the pan-city area. Out of the 13 proposals in the budget made under Smart Cities Mission, nine proposals are in the ABD zone covering 4.2% of the city area including Melachinthamani, Thillai Nagar, Rockfort, parts of the Cauvery banks, Puthur, Woraiyur and Gandhi market. The corporation has proposed to revamp the existing pipelines to enable 24-hour water supply and renovate UGD lines in the ABD zone. Similarly, two multi-level car parking facilities in Kaliamman Koil Street and Nandhi Koil Street are also planned in the ABD zone.

""It is unfortunate that IBT and Srirangam bus stand plans were dropped in the budget,"" Subash Chandran, a resident of Woraiyur, said. The corporation said that the site chosen for Srirangam bus stand at Panchakarai was unviable for the project. Instead, it proposed to establish a science and technology park for children at the site. Smart roads are mooted in the budget using Rs 16.50 crore from the Smart Cities Mission fund. For the pan-city area, three smart toilets and battery-powered solid waste management vehicles were proposed in the budget.

Either the public were forced to rent additional vehicles or some of the vehicle owners ply without permit due to the practical difficulties in obtaining permit.

As he was suffering from throat ache, he came to the civil hospital on bike. However, when told that he would have been admitted in isolation ward, he escaped from the campus out of fear, leaving his bike in the parking.At around 11am on Sunday, the health department team found his address and traced him.Dr Manish Bhanderi, district health officer, told TOI: “After escaping from the civil hospital, he went to consult physician the same night. We circulated his name and looks. Based on that, the physician informed us about a person with the same name and matching looks.”When the health officers’ team reached his house, the man initially refused to cooperate and go with them. It was only after the physician convinced him, that he relented.“We have admitted him to the isolation ward and sent his samples for tests. We are also trying to find out other persons whom he got in touch with after fleeing the hospital. If he tests positive, we will require to quarantine him and all others whom he was in touch with,” Dr Bhanderi added.The incident, which left health department jittery, has raised serious questions about handling of suspected coronavirus patients at the civil hospital. According to sources, it was utterly negligent of the hospital staff that despite being a suspect with travel history to coronavirus-affected countries, the man was asked to carry out the formality of making an indoor patient case by standing in the queue. The businessman told the hospital staff that he wanted to inform his family as needed to go out as there was no mobile network inside. However, he fled immediately.When contacted, civil hospital superintendent Dr Manish Mehta said, “A patient or his relative is required to get indoor case made from the window. There was a critical case in the hospital at the same time when this man was there, so the staff was busy in handling that. He might have taken advantage of this situation and escaped.”“His other health reports were normal and he was complaining throat pain.

Menon added that the platform is also seeing a lot more new users and is now ramping up capacity including storage space, delivery van and personnel. Grofers’ founder Albinder Dhindsa said that while the platform had started seeing a spike of 5-7% earlier this week, demand has increased by 80% over the weekend.On an average day, Bigbasket does over 1.6 lakh deliveries for next-day shipments and 1.4 lakh for its micro-delivery business BBDaily, which delivers essentials like milk and bread every morning. Grofers, which only does next-day delivery, does about 90,000 orders a day.The spike in demand is also leading to delays in fulfilment of orders on these platforms, from typically within 1 day to 3-4 days. “Stock availability of essentials will not be an issue. It’s just that we got hit by the huge unprecedented surge and hence struggled with stocks for a day or two. We are getting geared on stocks now,” said Menon, adding that they are advising consumers to not buy more than needed.Dhindsa said the SoftBank- and Tiger Global-backed company has started implementing limits on hand sanitisers and masks, which have been deemed essential goods by the government. It also put dynamic restrictions on grocery items as it fears hoarding by some customers. “We are seeing hoarding behaviour come up, so we are figuring out how to stop that. It is better to be safe than greedy,” said Dhindsa, adding that Grofers has already started implementing restrictions on some grocery items as well.Grofers also saw a customer in Chandigarh run up a bill of Rs 52,000 on the platform, beating the previous record of Rs 24,000. Dhindsa said Grofers has also asked its delivery personnel, which number about 10,000, to take precautions, while giving each of them hand sanitisers. The Gurgaon-headquartered company is also “isolating” warehouses — not letting workers at one, go to the other — so in case there is an infection, multiple locations don’t stop working.Even offline retailers like Future Group , which owns Big Bazaar and Easyday, is seeing a spike of 20-25% according to industry sources. “The demand is significantly higher in select SKUs (stock-keeping units) like rice, daal, atta (flour), milk and ready-to-eat items like Maggi. This is happening over the last two-three days,” said a spokesperson of the Future Group.Supr, food-delivery major Swiggy’s micro-delivery platform, which sells milk and other essentials like eggs, bread, vegetables and fruits, has told consumers it will now deliver the products to consumers by 9am due to high demand.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU: The Tata Group and Wipro have recommended — in some cases mandated — work-from-home for their employees in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Tata Motors has mandated work-from-home for non-customer facing roles from Monday.

Across several Tata Group companies, employees in consumer-facing roles like sales, marketing and customer relationship management have been given guidance on flexible work arrangements. Pregnant women and employees with chronic respiratory and cardiac illness have been advised to work from home .

Tata Realty and Infrastructure will split its employees into two groups, of which one will work on the first three days of the week and the other will come in for the rest of the three days for uninterrupted operations. The conglomerate employs a big salesforce in the country.

The Taj chain has asked its corporate office staff to work from home for a week from Monday. However, the vast majority of its workforce have jobs that require them to be present in its 100-plus hotels.

The Group’s largest employer TCS hasn’t issued a guidance, and has left the decision to functional and business heads. However, its IT counterpart Wipro has advised all employees to work from home “wherever feasible and if their role allows them to do so”.

All support and non-billable employees (including those who’re not engaged in any project) will work from home after consulting their managers. Wipro said video-conferencing should be used to hire prospective candidates.

“Face-to face meetings with potential candidates must not be scheduled until further notice,” it said. It has prohibited group meetings of over 10 people and has put all travel on hold, except for those scheduled to return to their base location due to regulatory requirements (visa).

NOIDA: Some unidentified miscreants allegedly fled away with a BMW car after the man driving it pulled up to urinate on a roadside here, police said on Sunday.

According to officials, the incident happened on Saturday night in Sector 90 under Phase 2 police station limits, when Rishabh Arora , a stock broker, was returning in the car from a party in an inebriated condition.

The luxury car is owned by Arora's brother-in-law and there is a Rs 40 lakh loan pending on the vehicle, they said.

“Police force including senior officials had reached the spot after a matter was reported that a man's BMW car has been robbed,"" said deputy commissioner of police, Central Noida , Harish Chander .

Arora had stopped the car midway and came out to urinate. Meanwhile, some unidentified miscreants reached the spot and fled with the vehicle, Chander added.

Prime facie, it appears the robbery has been planned by somebody known to the car's owner, the DCP said.

An FIR has been registered against unidentified people and the police are probing the matter from all angles and would ensure recovery of the vehicle soon, the officer said.

Asked if the stock broker would be charged with drunk driving, DCP Chander told PTI: “The priority is to recover the BMW and ensure arrest of the culprits. It's a serious concern that somebody's car gets robbed like this on city roads.”

Arora has alleged in his complaint that the miscreants, who had arrived on a motorcycle, had put a gun on his back while he was relieving himself but that claim is yet to be verified since he was “highly drunk”, according to officials.

Arora was using his brother-in-law's BMW for about six-seven days now, the officials added.

Extraordinary circumstances demand extraordinary measures.” The note said: due date for advance tax to be deferred or alternatively defer the interest under Sections 234B and 234C of the Income Tax Act. It also sought deferring the due date for GST for March 2020, besides seeking restraint from the government with regards to recovery proceedings under CGST, given it will further choke an already gasping industry.. The memorandum said, “Given that all cargo is subject to significant examination and there are delays in clearance, there should not be any levy of demurrage or interest or port charges during this period.” It also sought relaxations under the bankruptcy code or IBC. “Defaults during these trying months of dealing and combating with a virus and the paranoia should not result in an IBC trigger. There should be a moratorium for next few months in the context of Section 7 and 9 of the IBC Act.

MUMBAI: Credit and debit cardholders that have not used their cards for contactless or international payments may find these features deactivated from Monday. These features will have to be activated using a text message, or mobile or internet banking .

Earlier this year, the RBI had asked all banks to ensure that at the time of issuance, cards are enabled only for payment in Indian stores. Only if the user requests for online usage or contactless usage can the card be activated for the same. Some lenders, like SBI, have already started alerting the customers based on their usage history. These norms are aimed at protecting those who are not familiar with online transactions or payment gateways from being defrauded.

The RBI had said in a circular that “...facility to switch on/off and set/modify transaction limits (within the overall card limit, if any, set by the issuer) for all types of transactions — domestic and international, at PoS/ATMs/ online transactions/contactless transactions” should be provided on a 24X7 basis through multiple channels.

The channels should include mobile applications, internet banking, ATMs, or interactive voice response. The RBI had further said that for existing cards, issuers may take a decision, based on their risk perception, whether to disable the card not present (domestic and international) transactions, card present (international) transactions and contactless transaction rights.

VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Sunday said state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar postponed local body polls on the instructions of ‘someone else.’

The chief minister also met governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan and complained that the State Election Commission ’s decision was unilateral and irrational.

The chief minister alleged that it was a conspiracy hatched by opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu since he knew that YSRC was going to sweep the elections to local bodies.

“Naidu is using his moles in the system and destroying all the institutions. If the elections were not completed by March 31, we will lose about Rs 5,000 crore from the 14th Finance Commission. Naidu does not want these funds to come and development to take place as he wants to take revenge on people for rejecting him in the recent elections,” he the CM alleged.

The CM said: “He (the SEC) might have got the job from Naidu. He might be from the same caste as Naidu’s but he should act neutrally as election commissioner. It has become a fashion for everyone to use the word discretionary powers.”

Jagan said the even the secretary to the election commission did not know that the order was coming.

He said the government had taken all measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. The situation in the state is normal and there is no need for panic. The indefinite postponement of elections citing the threat of Covid-19 is only a pretext as the SEC consulted neither the health secretary nor the chief secretary before taking the decision, said the CM.

He said that dealing with Covid-19 would have been easier and effective had the elections were completed at the earliest as it is in the stage-I only as far as AP is concerned. Moreover, if the elected local representatives are in charge, the government can take up the awareness and prevention programmes more effectively, the CM added.

The CM also slammed the SEC for transferring and suspending the officials. “Can such right be given to the election commissioner or can such right be taken by him. If such is the case, why should any government come in a democracy when the election commissioner is taking the decisions as if he is the chief minister,” he said.

The CM also found fault with the SEC for giving orders to district collectors to stop distribution of house sites to the poor and other welfare measures. “Quite interestingly a day after he gave the orders to collectors to stop house site distributions, the election commissioner postponed the elections indefinitely, I do not know what has changed overnight,” he said.

The CM said more than 80% of the infected persons have recovered across the globe and the percentage of fatalities among the infected was very minimal. “Life should not come to a halt because of the virus spread instead we have to learn to live with it by taking necessary measures which the government has already taken. Is there any guarantee that the virus can be contained in the next two weeks and if it continue to spread for the next one year and in all probability it will, is it correct to postpone the elections indefinitely,” he asked.

He also down played the issue of unanimous nominations. In 2013, many candidates from all parties were elected unanimously. “YSRC won the recent elections with huge mandate and in the past nine months we have implemented 90% of our promises made in the manifesto which is the reason why more than 2,000 MPTCs and ZPTCs were elected unanimously,” he said.

He said that no local body elections have been held without stray incidents of violence. “This year also there have been some incidents reported and I am proud that the police have acted swiftly by booking cases, including attempted murder cases, without looking at the party affiliations,” he said.

AURANGABAD: Cidco police were put in a tight spot after a video of two externed history-sheeters dancing with a sword during a pre-wedding revelry in TV Centre area of the city went viral on social media.

After the video went viral, Cidco police tried to find the accused duo — Kapil Ramesh Jogdand (23) and Imran alias Bablu Rauf Shaikh (22) — and arrest them, but failed.

Later, Pundaliknagar police, led by assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne , managed to arrest the duo on Sunday. Jogdand was arrested from near BSGM school ground while Shaikh was held from Vijay Nagar Chowk . Police have also seized the sword seen the video.

As many as nine cases, including a couple of attempt to murder cases, are registered against Jogdand, while Shaikh has five cases (all body offences) registered against him,

Jogdand is also the key accused in the 2018 Pundaliknagar riot that resulted from tearing of Shivaji Maharaj ’s poster. This incident had resulted in serious riots and law and order situation in the city.

Considering his involvement in series of offences, Jogdand was externed by deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) Rahul Khade on September 3, 2019 for a period of one year.

Shaikh too has a record of being involved in brawls at public places and was externed from the city limits on April 20, 2019 for a period of one year.

The video substantiates the fact that the accused duo, despite being externed, continued to live in the city without prior permission or knowledge of the police authorities. The authorities woke up only after the video went viral on social media.

“We were trying to identify the youths who can be seen dancing along with the accused duo following which their criminal records would also be scanned for initiating stringent action against them,” a police officer said.

BHOPAL: A day ahead of the Governor’s directive to the Speaker to conduct a floor test to prove Kamal Nath government’s majority, about 90 Congress MLAs loyal to chief minister, Nath and a couple of Independent MLAs, who were lodged at a resort in Jaipur arrived in Bhopal on Sunday morning. Unlike when they hurriedly left for Jaipur, the ruling party MLAs appeared relaxed and confident with some of them even flashing the ‘Victory’ sign to the waiting media.

MLAs claimed that the Congress government — which plunged into a crisis following rebellion by senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and the 19 MLAs supporting him— would prove majority in the floor test. The number of disgruntled MLAs, who resigned from the Congress has swelled to 23 by now.

Independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera who had made his intent clear by pulically expressing his desire to be home minister, claimed that Congress government is safe. “There is no crisis in the government. All is well, and we shall win the floor test,” said a beaming Shera.

Law minister PC Sharma alleged that the BJP is doing black magic (tantra- mantra) on the rebel Congress MLAs, who are holed up in Bengaluru.

Senior Congress leader from Uttarakhand , Harish Rawat , who accompanied the MLAs to Bhopal, exuded confidence that the party would tide over the crisis and said they were also in touch in rebel MLAs. “We are ready for the floor test and are confident of winning it. We are not nervous, BJP is. Those (rebel) MLAs are also in touch with us,” he said.

Even as they expressed confidence that Kamal Nath government would weather the storm and pass the floor test, some MLAs, who talked to media also hinted that budget session could be postponed in the wake of Coronavirus threat. “Health of legislators and everybody in the state is far more important than anything else and there is nothing more important than containment of coronavirus in MP”, said finance minister, Tarun Bhanot , who has been entrusted with the charge of health department after Tulsi Silawat was removed from the cabinet.

The possibility of deferring the budget session in the wake of Coronavirus threat was also discussed in the cabinet meeting, which took place soon after arrival of Congress MLAs, but a final decision on the issue was left to the Speaker.

After landing at Raja Bhoj airport, the MLAs were moved to a local hotel while ministers among them left for Mantralaya to attend the Cabinet meeting.

Following the Cabinet meeting, the chief minister went back to his official residence, where he was, later, joined by the former chief minister and senior party leader, Digvijaya Singh and eminent lawyer and party’s Rajya Sabha member, Vivek Tankha .

The MLAs were, later, taken to CM House, in buses in the evening to participate in the Congress legislative party (CLP) meeting.

In a statement, the state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar said the Government of India (GoI) has issued a health advisory to all states on March 14 to avoid large public gatherings. The GoI has classified coronavirus as a disaster and kept the nation in a state of preparedness.

On the allegations of not consulting with the health department officials on Covid-19, the SEC said the state election commissioner did contact national level functionaries before taking a decision on coronavirus threat posed. If the warning issued by GoI is de-escalated, the SEC will restart the election process without loss of a single day, the statement added.

On the issue of house sites, the SEC clarified that the high court in its observations in the recent judgment given said that the SEC was bound to follow guidelines of the ECI. As the issue of house sites to individual beneficiaries is covered under the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) an appropriate decision was taken according to the ECI guidelines on MCC.

The SEC stated that the violence in the ongoing elections is a matter that is engaging the attention of the commission and various political parties have been highlighting the surge of violence. This is also a subject matter in an ongoing litigation before the high court in which the SEC is a respondent. The SEC is affecting certain measures regarding government functionaries and acted as per the dictum of the Supreme Court contained in the land mark judgment in Kishan Singh Tomar Vs the Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad.

Finally the SEC stated that it is a constitutional body and the commissioner is at par with the judge of high court. All the safeguards available to a judge of the high court are applicable to State Election Commissioner. To attribute motives for the acts of a constitutional functionary are highly regretted and will only weaken the institution, the statement added.

Reacting to Jagan’s finding fault with the SEC for postponement of local and civic body polls, Naidu said the Centre had already declared novel coronavirus (Covid-19) as disaster and put the states on high alert in tackling the situation.

Naidu said the postponement of the elections was a wise move in view of coronavirus scare.

He told media that Jagan had “exposed his ignorance” by criticizing the SEC’s decision to postpone the election process by a few weeks. “Chief minister appeared bothered only about the politics and his political power. It is not only strange but shocking for a chief minister not taking the grim situation prevailing across the world following the outbreak of coronavirus into serious consideration,” Naidu alleged.

Naidu said that the SEC is a constitutional authority and questioning its decision is nothing but trying to blackmail the institution. He said that the CM should keep in mind that he could not do whatever he desires even if he has the mandate to rule the state.

“In fact, SEC Ramesh Kumar is not my appointee. My government had recommended the name of CR Biswas for the post of State Election Commissioner in 2016. However, then governor ESL Narasimhan had appointed Ramesh Kuamr has SEC,” Naidu clarified. He condemned the way Ramesh Kumar’s caste was being linked only to push the constitutional authority to the corner.

Naidu said widespread violence took place during the filing of papers across the state and in fact TDP had been demanding for taking corrective measures to uphold democracy since the process was started.

He said the state administration had not responded to the TDP’s initial complaints and it acted only after SEC exerted pressure.

He said that Macherla police let off the accused in the attempt murder case with station bail at the behest of the local legislator and they arrested the accused only after TDP’s pressure.

NASHIK: The Railways Board is weighing the option of a Samruddhi Corridor alignment for the proposed Nagpur Mumbai High Speed Railway (HSR), whose detailed project report is being prepared by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHRCL).

According to a senior railway officer, the project is facing a few issues including the land acquisition for the proposed high-speed HSR track. “It would be too early to comment on how the HSR would move through the Mumbai – Nashik – Nagpur route. One of the proposals being weighed is that of the Greenfield project. The land available with the Samruddhi Corridor cannot be ruled out,” said the officer.

The state-owned NHRCL, which is also looking after the construction of the Mumbai – Ahmedabad High Speed Rail service – commonly termed as bullet train – has been given the responsibility of preparing the detailed project report and the exercise is likely to take about a year’s time.

The officer further pointed out that a survey would be first carried out to finalise the best route between the two cities. “Since this will be high-speed corridor – where trains will run with speeds exceeding 200 km per hour — the existing alignment is of no use. That can best serve semi-high speed trains running in speeds in the range of 150 kmph to 180 kmph. Hence we have to go for fresh alignments,” the officer said.

When asked about possibilities, the officer said that the Samruddhi Expressway (Nagpur Mumbai Super Communication Expressway) could play a guiding role in the new HSR track.

Land acquisition is the biggest hurdle and in certain areas because of the ongoing government works there is hardly any space left to be acquired. “In such cases the Samruddhi Mahamarg has all the features required to run the HSR through it. If that was done, the land acquisition cost could be slashed down drastically. But that is just a possibility,” the officer said.

The officer hinted that at places where there is little scope for getting the land the alignment could be in proximity of the Samruddhi Expressway – whose median is 15 meters wide – enough for the train to run through. At other times the alignment could take its own course.

The victim was upset after the sudden death of his son earlier this year and his only livestock, a Buffalo, had also died four days ago due to disease.

SHO Meerganj police station Vijay Kumar told TOI, “A farmer has committed suicide because of debt in Meerganj. We have sent his body for autopsy and the revenue team has been informed about his death, so that they can carry the procedure of providing compensation to the family members of farmers under government schemes.”

Deceased Dharamdas is survived by his wife, three daughters and son Shivnandan (27).

Shivnandan told TOI, “This year has only brought only sorrow for us, as it started with sudden demise of my elder brother Rajveer in a road accident. We were already burdened with a loan of Rs 4 lakh and the rainfall and hailstorm destroyed our crops. Selling buffalo milk was another source of income, but our buffalo also died all of a sudden, leaving us with nothing. My father was a strong man but he had lost all hopes of revival and consumed poison. We did try to save his life and took him to the hospital, but he succumbed during treatment.

Now, our daily requirement would be 50% more on weekdays if IT workers start work from home,” he said.OMR has 400 apartment complexes, many of them highrises with several hundreds of houses, from Madhya Kailash to Tiruporur. It is home to more than four lakh people. Of them, 80% are employed in IT firms. About 3,000 private water tankers make 10,000 trips a day supplying around 120MLD of water to residential towers and IT parks. “This apart, more food delivery executives will come. We are planning to raise the number of security guards to enhance protection,” Koda added.In localities such as Sholinganallur, water auditing has started to check leakage. Sujatha, secretary of Central Park Apartment Owners Association, said hand sanitisers have been installed in every block of their apartment complex. “We are checking the recent travel history of both occupants and visitors. Water auditing has been advanced to March from May as fixing leakages would save water,” she said.Residents’ associations in other parts of the city have begun to take proactive measures to prevent spread of Covid-19. An association in Anna Nagar has put off celebrations and cultural events to avoid mass gatherings. K V Pari, president of Sivagami Nagar Public Welfare Association at Medavakkam, said an emergency meeting is likely to be called next week. “Though everyone is aware that frequent washing of hands is the need of hour, not many are doing it. We want to sensitise our residents regarding its necessity,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74644348,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-287978,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-prepares-to-work-from-home/articleshow/74642758.cms
97,['16/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh Bar Council’s panel issues orders to hold KBA election within three weeks,"Representative image

KANPUR: The two-member inquiry committee of UP Bar Council on Sunday ordered to conduct Kanpur Bar Association ( KBA ) elections within three weeks under two observers with certain conditions.

According to the conditions framed by it, the election will be supervised by a team of 50 persons, including a returning officer under close supervision of two members-- Madhusudan Tripathi and Jai Narayan Pandey to be assisted by two local members--Yogendra Swarup and Pankaj Mishra .

The committee suggested that immediately after constitution of the returning officers team, the election dates will be declared within two weeks.

The two-member committee, consisting of Ajay Kumar Shukla and Panchu Ram Maurya, strongly criticised the elders' committee and termed it as inefficient. The committee also indicted KBA's office superintendent for professional misconduct.

The inquiry committee members observed that inclusion of names after publication of the final electoral list, indicates that the persons who were given the responsibility to conduct election were not performing their duty properly. On the basis of several complaints against the elders' committee, an inference was drawn that it was not capable to conduct the election. The versions and allegation indicate that the office superintendent and the elders' committee had committed gross irregularities in the election process, the committee said.

In the present situation it would be unfair to conduct election under the supervision of the elders' committee, and, therefore, the election will be held under the close supervision of two observers of the Bar Council of UP, the committee added.

The observers would constitute a 50-member team including a returning officer between March 16 and March 19 and declare fresh election dates which would be within two weeks time from the date of this order. Voting would be held under the enclosed electoral list. No new addition will take place in it. The candidature of any contestant would not be cancelled, the committee stated.

Taking a strong view against Sriprakash Dwivedi , KBA's office superintendent, the committee stated that his role was suspicious. After getting registered at the Bar Council, he obtained the certificate of practice and concealed the fact that he was KBA's paid employee. Since it was a serious crime, the committee would recommend action against him in its separate order.

The committee in a letter written to the district judge, district magistrate and SSP, Kanpur, has asked them to provide adequate police force to the observers so that the election could be conducted in a free and fair manner.

102,['16/03/2020'],Changing colours of transplanted hands,"Kochi: Three years after Shreya Siddanagaowda had a double hand transplant from a brain dead male donor, she is excited as the transplanted hand is becoming “more feminine” and skin tone is also almost matching hers. However, her hand transplant doctors at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) called it a “unique situation” in which they don’t have enough scientific evidence to explain the changes.

“Since last few months, I have noticed changes in my hands. They are less bulkier, the fingers are turning more leaner like a woman’s and even the skin colour is now lighter. At first the hands functionality was my concern but now these changes are definitely a bonus,” said Shreya over the phone from Pune.

Shreya is happy that she is able to do most of the things with her hands. “This October, I also wrote my exams though after an hour my hands start to ache,” said Shreya, who is now pursuing BA (Economics) from Fergusson College, Pune.

Shreya, the only daughter of Suma Nuggihalli and Fakirgowda Siddanagaowda from Pune, had lost both her hands in a mishap involving a bus in which she was travelling in September 2016 to her engineering college in Manipal.

She was 19 then. She was rushed to a hospital where both her arms had to be amputated at the elbow.

Meanwhile, her doctors admit that there is not much research to show this change. “It is difficult to get evidence for the cause here as it is a unique situation and there is not enough understanding on the subject. We don’t know how much change has occurred, how much more will occur or why it has happened,” said Dr Subramania Iyer, who headed the team that did the hand transplant on her at AIMS.

Around 172 hand transplants have happened globally so far, of which most of the hand transplants are in Europe or China.

Dr Mohit Sharma, who is part of the hand transplant team, said that double hand transplants are few and male to female hand transplants above elbow are even rarer. “We are looking at possible reasons for the colour change. Maybe this could be because pigment cells of the recipient have now been replaced by that of the donor or the lightening could be due to steroids. However, further research is needed to get exact reason,” said Dr Sharma.

BHOPAL: The BJP legislative party in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday issued a whip to all its MLAs to remain present in the House during the assembly session that begins on Monday, and vote in favour of party during the trust vote. Earlier in the day, the BJP leaders also met Governor Lalji Tandon and urged him to ensure the floor test takes place and instruct changes in the process due to technical snag in electronic voting.

The whip was issued by BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra. “It has been instructed to all BJP MLAs to remain present during the assembly budget session beginning March 16 throughout the proceedings and vote in favour of the BJP during the floor test in the House,” read the letter issued by Mishra.

The Congress issued a whip to all its MLAs for the legislative assembly session which is scheduled to be held from March 16 to April 13.

Meanwhile, BJP LoP, Gopal Bhargava and chief whip in assembly, Narottam Mishra called on Governor Tandon on Sunday seeking instructions on the floor test in the House as per the schedule.

“We have urged Governor Tandon that floor test be conducted on Monday only. The Congress is trying to avoid the test,” Bhargava told reporters after the meeting.

Mishra also reacted sharply to the speculations that Congress government is trying to avert the floor test on Monday.

The BJP leaders have also urged the Governor two change the pattern of floor test from ‘pressing button’ to other practical methods like division or showing attendance in person. They said the assembly secretariat has pleaded technical fault on the functioning of the buttons. This could be changed by a more practical method as alternative, they said.

Later in the evening, Governor Lalji Tandon through another letter to chief minister Kamal Nath instructed to take up the trust vote by asking members to raise hands. “Since Annexure 10 (scheduled) is implemented in Madhya Pradesh, I instruct to conduct the trust vote by raising hands and no other method,” read the letter by Governor.

CHENNAI: Nanganallur and Adambakkam residents have urged the Tamil Nadu government to sanction funds for the Thillai Ganga Nagar bridge project. The announcement was made by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in 2016 at the state assembly under rule 110. Edappadi K Palaniswami, now CM, was the state highway minister back then.

“Subsequent to the announcement, there has been no mention about the bridge in the state assembly and no fund has been allocated. We expect a mention this year,” said V Rama Rao, secretary, People Awareness Association, Nanganallur chapter.

State highway department’s demand for grants is scheduled on March 18.

A senior official from the department said it would cost Rs 85 crore to construct the 1-km-long structure, with minimum six lanes, connecting Inner Ring Road with Grand Southern Trunk Road over the existing subway. The proposal has been sent to authorities for final approval for sanction of funds. At least seven lakh people will get benefited by the bridge.

There are four subways within a radius of 5km — Alandur, Thillai Ganga Nagar, Pazhavanthangal and Meenambakkam — in south Chennai. During monsoon, these get submerged on most evenings, making it difficult for motorists to commute. During the December 2015 floods, many residents from Adambakkam, Nanganallur and Madipakkam, who had left for work were unable to return home as the subways were flooded. They stayed back in hotels near their workspaces.

Since then, repeated representations were made to the government to construct a bridge over any one of the four subways. After studying the feasibility at all locations, the highways department choose Thillai Ganga Nagar as adequate land was available back then. But now that MRTS works are underway, the design might have to be altered although seamless connectivity will be ensured, the highway official said.

CHENNAI: The consumer grievances redressal forum has ordered Bharat Matrimony to pay Rs 1.2 lakh as compensation to a man from Kochi who had sued the site for not finding a right match within one year as promised.

The complainant, E V John, subscribed for ‘Elite Premium Package’ by paying Rs 1 lakh on May 5, 2015. The matrimonial firm in its email assured that if customers were not satisfied with their services and were unable to provide a suitable match within one year from the date of subscription, the amount would be refunded.

Between May and July 2015, John claimed that he was bombarded with a lot of “unsuitable profiles” which were not verified and some had incomplete details. John complained that the relationship manager had failed to look into details of profiles before forwarding them to him.

Though John received 23 profiles in the said time period, only one was suitable and there was no response from that profile too when contacted for further enquiry.

Irked with the quality of service, John asked Kerala Matrimony, unit functioning under Chennai-based Bharat Matrimony, to refund the subscription amount. But there was no reply from the firm. He approached the North Chennai consumer forum seeking compensation.

Bharat Matrimony in response said the complainant initially paid Rs 10,000 to get personalised assistance by using advances tools in finding matching members from thousands of profiles. Later he upgraded to ‘elite’ category which aimed at catering to needs to rich, affluent families from business or industrial background, professionals and similar customers who want to finish search for prospective life partners soon, said the matrimony’s counsel in response.

The counsel added that elite service neither guarantees positive responses from prospective brides all the time nor marriage within the service period. Their only obligation was to search, shortlist profiles based on members’ preferences and share it later and the same was done without any deficiency.

On hearing it, the forum on February 18 ordered Bharat Matrimony to pay Rs 1,00,000 towards subscription paid with 6% interest from complaint date (February 2017) to till date and another Rs 22,000 as compensation and litigation expenses.

According to the complaint filed by the woman, she, along with her sister and mother, had been to the jeweller’s shop on March 6 to sell her 40-gram gold chain as the family was in need of money.

The jeweller and his staff, after weighing the gold chain, promised the women Rs 1.28 lakh in return. But much to their shock, when the jeweller melted the chain, it turned out to be made of copper. The jeweller then refused to give the cash. The woman claims that her chain was made of real gold, and the jeweller is somehow involved in falsely making it out to be made of copper.

Based on the complaint lodged by the woman, an offence under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a person to commit breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC has been registered with the police.

Police-sub inspector Balasaheb Aher said none of the suspects have been arrested as the investigation is at its preliminary stage. “We are cross verifying the claims being made by the complainant as well as the suspects,” said Aher.

According to police sources, the jeweller has claimed innocence. “The police are checking the CCTV footage” said the source.

According to sources in the party, the CM said: “The smile on my lips, despite this crisis is your smile. I have full faith in my MLAs.”

Congress would overcome the “immoral and unconstitutional political crisis created by BJP”, Nath told legislators, adding that the party stands united. “The morale of every Congress worker is high as every one of them tries to save democratic values,” he added.

The CM said that the Congress MLAs who went to Jaipur were free to move around and use their mobile phones, but those in Bengaluru are “held hostage, and not being allowed to talk to their kin”. “Why are they not being brought to Bhopal,” he asked, adding: “If BJP wants a floor test, it should bring the Congress MLAs to Bhopal or else the floor test would have no meaning.”

AICC observer Harish Rawat said that toppling elected governments has become a “fundamental character” of BJP. “They did the same thing in my state, Uttarakhand. Congress MLAs can unitedly thwart BJP’s design to topple the government. The manner in which Congress MLAs are facing the crisis in is commendable,” he remarked.

The youth, identified as Gautam Raidas, 20, allegedly barged into the house with a knife and locked her inside. When the girl put up a fight against him, he allegedly slit her nose with the knife and raped her. After the assault, Gautam fled and did not return to his house.

The girl somehow managed to get help from her neighbours who called her parents.

She was then taken to the police station and an FIR was lodged.

Ajay Mishra, SHO of Kotwali police station, told TOI, “A minor girl belonging to the minority community was raped by a local youth and sustained injuries on her nose, We have booked Gautam Raidas under IPC sections 376 (rape), 326 (voluntarily causing hurt by a dangerous weapon), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and provisions of the POCSO Act. The accused is absconding but we will soon arrest him. The victim has been sent for treatment at a hospital. The girl’s statement will be recorded in front of the magistrate after she is treated.”

112,['16/03/2020'],Buldhana deceased tests negative,"Nagpur: Sunday brought partial relief to Vidarbha region as no new positive Covid-19 cases emerged. The total number of patients who tested positive remain at 6 — 4 from Nagpur and 2 from Yavatmal

Swab samples of the 75-year-old Covid-19 suspected man from Buldhana, who died on Saturday, tested negative on Sunday which means the man was not infected with novel coronavirus. Even the four-year-old girl, who was admitted in the isolation ward of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) tested negative. This girl had a travel history to Saudi Arabia.

However, there is still cause for concern. In GMCH, a junior resident doctor who was on duty in the isolation ward where three positive patients are under treatment, developed symptoms like cough, cold and fever. He was immediately admitted to the same isolation ward and his swab samples were sent to the IGGMCH for testing.

A senior official in GMCH told TOI that though the symptoms appear mild, “we are not taking any chances”.

In Yavatmal, where two positive patients are already under treatment, two more were identified with coronavirus symptoms on Sunday. GMCH Yavatmal now has two positive and 2 with symptoms. .

In Khamgaon (Buldhana district), a total of 12 tourists from Malaysia and Indonesia have been kept under observation as three of them developed mild symptoms. Chandrapur also reported three new cases. All of them were admitted to the GMCH, Chandrapur.

Nagpur divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar issued an appeal on Sunday that people who have been identified after talks with the positive patients should cooperate and submit their samples for testing. The administration is calling people who have been identified as high-risk contacts of the positive patients.

On Sunday, 19 such suspects reported to the GMCH and their samples were collected. All of them were admitted to the isolation ward. Officials at GMCH told that a total of 40 samples have been sent for testing at the lab facility in IGGMCH from Saturday (21 on Saturday and 19 on Sunday). Out of them, 39 have tested negative.

District collector Ravindra Thakre, and divisional deputy director (health services) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal visited both government hospitals on Sunday and took review of the facilities available at the isolation wards. They also visited the MLA hostel where quarantine facility is being prepared for cases coming from the high-risk seven nations.

At medical colleges, they were accompanied by deans and medical superintendents. They also interacted with the people admitted in the isolation ward and positive patients under treatment in separate rooms. The officials were seen wearing safety masks. They claimed to have maintained a safe distance from the patients as well as suspects.

“It was an effort to motivate the patients who are undergoing treatment. The collector interacted with them and told that all are with them in this fight against coronavirus. All patients and suspects shared their views about the facilities in hospital,” said Dr Sajal Mitra, the GMCH dean.

Meanwhile, the administration has made an important policy decision to not collect any samples from homes now, according to civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar.

It has asked students to go home and not assemble at the university. However, students of Jamia’s Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) sitting on protest for around three months outside gate number 7 have yet to take a call on if they would disband their congregation as part of social distancing.Two days after announcing that they are suspending classes till March 31, the Jamia administration came out with a notice on Sunday to announce the shutting down of student accommodations too.In their advisory, Jamia said that Covid-19 epidemic will enter into the phase of exponential growth, which is “highly dangerous in terms of magnitude and dimension as an infectious disease.” Stating that many educational institutes are now shut, the advisory said that it is beyond them to contain the danger.“Places of gatherings like hostels, dining halls, libraries, kitchens are highly vulnerable and susceptible to the threat. The best course of action is to secure the students, teachers, workers and non-teaching staff,” the advisory said.This has been seen by many at Jamia as an advisory for students sitting on protest. Responding to the advisory, JCC member Safoora Zargar said that “JCC will discuss on their course of action and decide on if they would continue the protest.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74645505,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147614,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jamia-fully-shut-students-asked-to-go-home/articleshow/74642890.cms

116,['16/03/2020'],Kukke temple ritual: Devotees asked to come in less numbers,"Kukke Subhramanya Temple

Mangaluru: Additional deputy commissioner M J Roopa has requested devotees visiting the state’s richest temple, Kukke Shree Subrahmanya, to perform the Sarpa Samskara puja , to come in less numbers . In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, she said, “Instead of a large group coming, the person who is offering the puja may be accompanied by one or two people.”

Killing of a cobra in their home territory is considered as a sin among Hindus, and is believed to bring misfortune (naga dosha). As a remedy to the sin, they mostly visit Kukke Shree Subrahmanya Temple, about 100 kilometres from Mangaluru, and offer pujas such as Sarpa Samskara, Naga prathishta or Ashlesha bali. Sarpa Samskara is the cremation ritual for the snake. It is performed only for cobras and no other snakes. This puja is performed in case the reptile is found dead in the property the devotee owns, or is accidentally killed by labourers, or is found run over by a moving vehicle.

M J Roopa, the administrator of the temple, said, “On an average 172-180 Sarpa Samskara pujas are performed at Kukke temple and about 100-120 Ashlesha bali is performed every day. I have directed the temple staff to call every devotee who has booked the puja, and request them to come in small numbers,” she said. An average 20,000 devotees visit the temple every day.

Other measures

Dakshina Kannada district has about 500 temples of which 40 are under the A category (that earn an annual income above Rs 25 lakh), 25 are under the B category (annual income of above Rs 5 lakh, but within Rs 25 lakh) and 435 are under C category.

The temples have been asked to set up help desks to provide information on general health issues, and announcements will be made on hygiene. Meanwhile, since most temples will be observing their annual festivities during this season, the administration has sought directions from the religious endowment department about the festivities. The rituals at most temples are going on as usual, and some temples even claim that there is not much reduction in footfalls for the time being.

Special pujas offered

Many temples in the coastal district offered special pujas so that the spread of Covid-19 is controlled and the world returns to normalcy. A special puja and mass prayer was held at Kadri Sri Manjunatha Temple in Mangaluru on Sunday.

Priests and devotees recited of Dhanwantari japa, Rudrapatana and Vishnusahasranama and later offered mass prayers in the Kadri temple premises, seeking relief from Covid-19. Japas and prayers were led by Dakshina Kannada District Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Pradeep Kumar Kalkura, Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyasa Kamath, VHP state working president M B Puranik and former MLA Yogish Bhat.

Special prayers were also held at Sri Kshetra Gejjegiri Nandana Bitthl, Badagannur near Puttur on Sunday. Shridhara Poojary, temple trustee, said, ‘apoorva shatlhoushadhi dravya kalashabhisheka’ was offered to Deyi Baidethi, the presiding deity of the temple. Pavamana homa, Dhanvantari homa and kalashabhisheka have been offered to the deity,” he added.

117,['16/03/2020'],Fleeing isolation ward may land one in prison for up to 2 years,"Nagpur: The four suspects who left the isolation ward of Mayo Hospital could suffer imprisonment up to two years if city police go ahead and register offences against them under relevant provisions of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for disobeying authorities at the government hospital.

Agra police became the first in the country to register an FIR in the Covid-19 related case on Sunday, against the father of a woman who tested positive in Bengaluru. Tehsil police are now waiting for legal opinion and documents from Mayo Hospital related to the four escapees to take a final decision on the complaint filed with it.

The complaint was filed by superintendent of Mayo Hospital at the instance of the divisional commissioner regarding the two male and two female suspects, who sneaked out of the isolation ward on Friday night without being discharged.

Though the suspects subsequently turned out to be coronavirus ‘negative’ in tests, the legal sword continues to hang on them, with the police receiving a formal complaint from a senior official of the government hospital on instructions of the chief of the revenue department in the division.

Legal experts, like high court lawyer Rajendra Daga and additional public prosecutor Vijay Kolhe, said citizens have no option but to toe the line of the government now as far as Covid-19 guidelines are concerned, especially with the Maharashtra Covid-19 regulations, 2020, under the Epidemic diseases Act, 1897, being enforced in the state. The archaic British law, enacted to tackle the bubonic plague in Bombay, gives sweeping powers to the Central and state government to set norms and regulations to contain the spread of the epidemic diseases. The power is delegated to officials, who are also protected against legal action under the Act.

Daga said the action of fleeing the hospital is generally covered under sections like 269 and 270 of IPC. “Section 269 IPC is applicable in the Nagpur case, where the suspect has a ‘reason to believe’ that their action could put lives of other citizens in possible peril, by spreading the infection they were ailing from. It has a prison term that may extend to six months or fine or both,” he said.

Daga said section 270 IPC may not be invoked as their act cannot be classified as a ‘malignant’ one, without criminal intent. “Section 270 IPC may not be attracted as the suspects had fled due to fear and not criminal intent,” he said.

Kolhe, former special prosecutor for CBI, said offences under section 188 IPC for disobeying government order can be invoked against anyone now, whether individual or organization head, for violating norms and guidelines related to Covid-19.

WHAT IS SECTION IPC 269

Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.

WHAT IS SECTION IPC 270

Whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

PRAYAGRAJ: A probe has been ordered into the case of a 22-year-old woman mysteriously falling from the terrace of her house in Georgetown during a police raid on Sunday morning. The woman is currently undergoing treatment at Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital.

Senior police officers ordered a probe into the incident after it was alleged that the woman had allegedly fallen from the roof of her house when a police team raided her house on Sunday to nab her brother, who was wanted for mobile theft.

SP (city) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava said the woman’s family has not yet filed a complaint regarding the incident.

According to reports, police reportedly detained one Shankar Lal from Allahpur area as they suspected him to be mobile phone thief. Lal was later handed over to Georgetown police for interrogation, but he managed to escape from the thana campus. After Lal fled, police raided his house and brought his father to the police station.

An hour later, police received the information that Lal’s sister had fallen from the terrace of her home and sustained serious injuries. Police rushed her to SRN Hospital.

However, senior police officials denied that any raids were conducted at the woman’s home and said that they were probing how the woman fell from the roof.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court lawyers will boycott judicial work on Monday to draw government’s attention to their long pending demand for more funds for welfare schemes for advocates.

The call for strike was given by Bar Council for Uttar Pradesh, the apex body for lawyers in the state. High court lawyers will be joined by their counterparts from district courts and other tribunals in the boycott.

Earlier on March 2, BCUP had called for a statewide strike of lawyers to protest against the government’s non-cooperation in providing sufficient finances for welfare schemes for advocates. BCUP chairman Hari Shankar Singh said, “As the government has continued to ignore our demands, we have no option but to boycott judicial work again.”

The other demands of the council include adequate security for lawyers in wake of the recent attacks on them across the state.

Outgoing secretary of Allahabad High Court Bar Association (HCBA) JB Singh said, “Following the call for protest by BCUP, HCBA has also passed a resolution to abstain from judicial work on March 16. Hence, lawyers in Prayagraj will abstain from judicial work on Monday.”

AURANGABAD: The Cantonment police on Sunday booked a man for duping a 38-year-old of Rs 1.8 lakh on the pretext of selling a used car on a social networking platform.

According to a police complaint filed by Shaikh Waseem, a resident of Aurangabad Cantonment area had opted to purchase a used car on the Facebook business page. Waseem found attractive car deals on the platform and contacted the mobile number mentioned on the page.

After finalising the deal, the suspect asked him to make an advance payment, before the car is delivered. Waseem agreed to pay the remaining payments in installments after successfully transferring the vehicle on his name.

Falling prey to the trap, Shaikh transferred Rs 1.80 lakh to his account through Paytm. But after taking the money, he failed to deliver the car. The suspect started demanding more money and when Shaikh refused to pay till the car is delivered, he threatened to block his account.

Suspecting that he has been cheated, Shaikh approached the police and filed a complaint.

The police booked the suspect on the charges of cheating and various other sections of the Information and Technology Act.

The time-space matrix on a daily basis, which was easily prepared for other two cases , could not be done accurately in this case simply because data had to be collected over a period of more than two weeks.A marathon mission by another team, which spanned over six hours on Saturday night, helped track down 117 passengers who travelled with him in the domestic flight from Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram on February 27.The team, which received the contact numbers of the passengers, were able to establish contact with more than 80 persons. All of them were advised to go on quarantine. However, as for 36 contacts, the number was either wrong or remained out of coverage area. The team is now in the process of tracking down these contacts as soon as possible.The prolonged period of exposure and his stay at Varkala posed numerous challenges in tracking. The team learnt that he visited multiple places; for instance during his stay he would have lunch, breakfast and dinner from different places. Being a regular, he visited friends’ places more than once in a single day. A narrow lane that runs from the resort he had stayed comprised many small shops and it was run mostly by non-Keralites. He was friends with all of them and he had spent time chatting at these shops since his arrival on February 27.The team could come across only two-three CCTV footages. However, even the length of footages over an extended period of time threw up another challenge. There was a money exchange centre he had been to but with no entry recorded on register. Chances were slim to pinpoint the exact time at which he visited the centre. Over 30 interviews were done by the team on Saturday and while some claimed that the Italian was cautious enough not to shake hands with them, the health team has not bought it completely because the officials suspect that they could be saying that to avoid being put on quarantine.In one case the team took a screenshot from a footage, took a print and showed it to the foreigner to confirm whether he had visited that place, however he said that he was not the person in the picture. The team, which came up with a route map on Sunday, is now finalizing the list of secondary contacts as a precautionary measure.

125,['16/03/2020'],"Yes Bank writes down Rs 8,415 crore AT-1 bonds","Mumbai: Yes Bank has said it will write down additional tier (AT-1) bonds worth Rs 8,415 crore of the Rs 8,695 crore issued. This could have implications for mutual funds , life insurance companies and pension funds that have invested in the scheme, and their investors.

The lender has also said it will issue fresh shares worth Rs 10,000 crore to boost its capital which has been largely wiped out after its record Q3 loss. The bank has limited its capital raising under a government-notified reconstruction scheme to Rs 10,000 crore with SBI bringing in Rs 6,050 crore as against the initial commitment of Rs 7,250 crore and IDFC First Bank joining with a contribution of Rs 250 crore.

The bank’s capital adequacy has been boosted by writing down Rs 8,415 crore of the AT-1 bonds . The write-down of the AT-1 (quasi-equity) bonds will also impact high net worth individuals who, drawn by the higher rates, had bought these bonds. The reconstruction scheme was notified by the government last week to enable the distressed bank to exit a moratorium on withdrawals.

In a letter to stock exchanges after the results on Saturday, Yes Bank said the lender is deemed to be “non-viable or approaching non-viability and accordingly the triggers for a write-down of certain Basel III AT-1 bonds have been triggered”. It added that in light of the provisions of the Basel III circular, AT-1 bonds worth Rs 3,000 crore issued on December 23, 2016, and another lot of Rs 5,415 crore issued on October 18, 2017 stand extinguished. In its results, the bank had said that Rs 8,695 crore of these bonds can be used to enhance the equity of the bank. It is not clear whether the difference of Rs 280 crore between the bonds issued and bonds written down has been converted to equity. Yes Bank did not respond to queries till the time of going to press.

The bank said its common equity (tier-1) ratio fell to 0.6% after the quarterly loss. The losses were due to gross NPAs jumping to Rs 40,709 crore from Rs 5,158 crore in the previous year and Rs 17,134 crore in the preceding quarter. By making a Rs 22,328-crore provision for bad loans, the bank has managed to restrict the ratio of net non-performing assets to 5.97%, just below the 6% level which triggers prompt corrective action by the RBI.

After considering a capital infusion of Rs 10,000 crore and write-down of Rs 8,415 crore of AT-1 bonds, the common equity (tier-1) ratio improved to 7.6%, which is just above the statutory requirement.

Yes Bank faces a major challenge in convincing bulk depositors to retain their funds. The lender has seen a flight of Rs 72,000-crore deposits in less than six months and is meeting the mismatch through borrowings. There could also be legal challenges from shareholders holding more than 100 shares, who have been forced into a lock-in under the scheme.

126,['16/03/2020'],"With 2 new operators, garbage reduces by 96-160MT/day","Nagpur: The city’s garbage collection has reduced by 96-160 metric tonne (MT) per day in the last four months, since the time the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) replaced 11-year-old operator Kanak Resources Management Limited (KRML) with two new operators — AG Enviro Infra Projects Private Ltd and BVG India Ltd. Though it is saving expenditure by Rs5 lakh per day, the civic body has started an inquiry to know the reasons behind such a drastic reduction.

The garbage collection from households was at an average of 1,255 MT per day during the tenure of KRML. The two new operators took over from KRML on November 16, 2019.

As per the NMC’s data, 13,507.03 MT garbage, which means an average of 900.46 MT per day, was collected between November 16 and 30. In initial days, the operators had struggled to ensure garbage collection from all areas of the city.

Between December 1 and 31, the collected garbage was 35,672.17 MT, an average of 1,150.71 MT per day. The figure between January 1 and 31 was 36,596.12 MT, an average of 1,180.52 MT per day.

The quantum of garbage collection reduced further in February and March. Between February 1 and 29, collected garbage was 33,219.59 MT (1,145.50 MT per day average). The quantum drastically reduced in the current month. It was 7,652 MT, an average of 1,093.14 MT per day, between March 1 and 7. This means that the average reduction in the last four months was 96-160MT per day.

During KRML’s regime, the NMC had exposed various types of scams which included inflation of quantum of garbage.

A KRML official told TOI, “The garbage quantum might have reduced as KRML used to also collect and transport construction and demolition waste. But the NMC exempted two new operators from collecting these wastes. The construction and demolition waste was over 150 MT per day. There is no issues of any irregularity on our part,” he said.

An NMC official said the exact reasons can be known only after an inquiry. “We doubt that the construction and demolition waste was over 150 MT per day. The process to appoint a new operator for collection and reuse of construction and demolition waste is going on,” he said.

The issue also raises a question mark as to where this huge quantum of construction and demolition waste is lying since last four months. As per average, such waste counts to 18,000 MT for four months.

The NMC official added that the two new operators are covering over 90% areas of the city as against 70% by KRML. “KRML had engaged 140 motorized and 550 rickshaws for garbage collection. The two new operators had roped in around 400 motorized and 150 rickshaws. Each motorized transport takes 800kg whereas each rickshaw takes 300kg. Thus, the garbage collection and transportation of two new operators is higher as compared to KRML,” he said.

If the data of past 11 years is taken into account, the quantum of garbage increases with each passing month.

The NMC is saving Rs5 lakh per day, which counts to Rs18 crore per annum. The average charges being paid to the two operators is Rs1,875 per MT. KRML used to get Rs1,436 per MT.

NMC official also said that the quantum of garbage reduced further since municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe visited Bhandewadi dumping on February 12, warned of stringent action in case of any irregularity and taking review on daily basis.

Lucknow: Learning begins at home, Padma Vibhushan recipient Teejan Bai said here on Sunday to underscore that India’s rich folk art and culture could be well preserved in this digital age if parents created an environment of awareness for children.

The leading exponent of Pandavani — a musical rendition of the saga of Pandavs from the Mahabharata — left Lucknow spellbound with her powerful performance based on the Kurukshetra war when Bhim, the second-born Pandav, defeated and killed Kaurav prince Dushasan.

She was awarded the Lok Nirmala Samman by CM Yogi Adityanath at his residence in the morning. Later, the award was conferred on her again at UP Sangeet Natak Akademi in Gomtinagar with a purse money of Rs 1 lakh at a function organised by Sonchirya Foundation , a nonprofit that honours folk artistes. Armed with her ektara and a peacock feather, Teejan unleashed her prodigious talent despite failing health. Born and bred in Chhattisgarh, she charmed one and all with her rustic rhythm and inimitable simplicity. Speaking to TOI, she said today’s generation was still drawn to folk music and just need a little push. “I teach more than 200 kids and meet more every day who want to take this culture forward.

They need assistance of both their families and the government,” she said. Teejan who trained in Pandavani under her grandfather made her first public appearance at the age of 13. A village show slowly made way for bigger cultural events and festivals. She received Padma Shri in 1988, Padma Bhushan in 2003 and Padma Vibhushan in 2019.

“Himmat to andar se aati hai (The strength comes from within),” said the woman who broke the glass ceiling. “Earlier, Pandavani only had male performers. When I learnt the art, I realised women were equally capable. They only need to believe they are,” she summed up.

130,['16/03/2020'],Croaker renamed corona by fishermen,"Mangaluru: When Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, the humble sardines coming from the Gujarat coast were called as ‘Modi Bhutai,’ similarly, when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussain was executed, ‘Neimeen’ or butterfish caught in the coast were rechristened after him. Now it’s the turn of large size croakers or koddai in the local language, which have found a new name—corona.

Recently, fishermen who ventured into the sea got lucky and caught a large black spotted croaker . It is also known as sciaenidae or Jewfish. The fish is costly because its dried air bladder is used as a clarifying agent in breweries. The fishermen who caught the fish rechristened it corona . A kg of the fish fetched somewhere between Rs 1,200 to 2,000, said a fishermen at Old Port Mangaluru. A large croaker usually weighs somewhere between 7kg to 8 kg. “A month ago, a fishing boat had netted a ‘corona’ fish worth Rs 2 crore. The fish is mainly exported to foreign countries and buyers come from Gujarat,” the fisherman explained.

Pratibha Rohit, principal scientist and head, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Mangaluru, says that though fishermen have named the fish as Corona but it’s the real name is croaker or koddai in the Tulu language. However, there is a fish called Melanotaenia Corona, which is a freshwater fish.

“It is common in the coast to name a fish according to the situation or after a person. Fishermen in Malpe dock call neimeen or butterfish as Saddam and it is still in practice for a long time. The trend started after Saddam Hussein was executed. A few years ago, large size sardines (bhutai) were named after him. These sardines, also called as Oman sardines, were transported here from Gujarat. It looks like fishermen have renamed croaker or koddai as corona, which is now declared as a pandemic,” she explained.

Another marine expert, requesting anonymity, said that croaker/koddai is very much in demand, and used for preparing fish maws or dried air bladder. Maws is a Chinese word and used mostly for purification of wine and beer. Its swim bladder and meat is expensive, which is used to prepare soups and home decor.

“The bladder of the croaker fetches about US $1,000 in Hong Kong and South East Asia. The fish is also used for medicinal purposes. The price is higher than shark fins,” the expert added.

131,['16/03/2020'],Rare mid-March fog takes Lucknow unawares,"City witnessed a rare phenomenon in mid-March

LUCKNOW: City witnessed heavy dew followed by shallow fog in the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, a rare phenomenon in mid-March.

Met officials attributed the unusual weather to heavy moisture in the air following two days of rain and thunderstorm coupled with north-westerly winds from snow-fed mountains.

The fog descended around midnight catching people unawares and was clear after sunrise. The day remained partly cloudy. Maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 26.8 degrees Celsius, five units below normal, while minimum temperature was normal at 17.3 degrees Celsius.

State Met director JP Gupta said, “Western disturbance caused thundershowers and hail in plains, including Lucknow, in past few days. It also caused snow in the hills of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The cold wind from hills condensed the moisture content in air leading to fog.”

“As western disturbance has fizzled out, sky will be partly cloudy on Monday and will remain clear from Tuesday. Possibilities of formation of fresh fog are remote,” he said. Gupta said though a rare phenomenon, fog has occurred during the month of March in the past. According to long term average (1981-2010) taken out by the Met department, the mean number of foggy days in March is 0.1, which means it has occurred once in a decade. Meanwhile, describing fog in March as an unusual phenomenon, director of Lucknow University ’s climate monitoring station, Prof Dhruvsen Singh said it could be an indication of climate change.

“Global warming due to climate change is not only melting glaciers, it is also affecting circulation pattern of currents in the ocean that have an impact on wind pattern and leads to formation of cyclonic circulations,” he said.

Senior leaders, including ex-MLA Milind Mane and leader of the house in NMC Sandip Jadhav, led a group of their supporters to Jaripatka police station to lodge a complaint against Raut for his alleged statement during a speech at a public gathering. Raut was criticizing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) when he passed the remark, stoking the controversy for which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to corner him.

Senior police inspector Khushal Tijare of Jaripatka police station said that a decision on the deputation submitted by BJP activists would be taken after due discussion with senior officers. “We are now looking into the allegations,” he added.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, BJP leaders Dharampal Meshram and Jadhav condemned Raut for “insulting Brahmins”. ""Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were Brahmins. Former party president Rahul Gandhi is a Brahmin. Is the minister calling them outsiders? He should clarify his remarks immediately,"" they said.

Meshram and Jadhav demanded that the minister should publicly apologize or resign from his post. They asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to sack him.

BJP MLA Krishna Khopde too, criticised Raut for the statement. Khopde, in a press statement, said that the Congress leader should not have uttered a statement which does not behove his position as a minister in the government. Congress’s communal face stood exposed with the statement of the minister targeting a community, he added.

Despite TOI’s repeated attempts to contact Raut, there was no response from the minister’s end.

VADODARA: A team of five policemen from the state vigilance team came under a massive attack from a bootlegger and his accomplices in Dahod ’s Jalat village late on Saturday night.

Police had to fire five rounds in the air after a group of around 30 people resorted to heavy stone pelting when they had gone to raid the house of notorious bootlegger Arjun Panda.

The vigilance team had received information that Panda had brought a huge stock of liquor and stored it in his house. When the squad began checking the house and seizing the liquor stock, Panda returned with a group of around 30 people and began pelting stones on the cops, who were caught unawares.

Though no policeman suffered injuries in the attack, the rioters badly damaged their three vehicles in an attempt to scare them away.

The squad members then fired five rounds in air to disperse the mob. When the rioters did not relent, the squad sought the help of Dahod police that rushed in to help. Panda managed to escape in the melee but the police seized liquor stock worth Rs 5.39 lakh from his house. Three cars and two mobile phones too were seized from the spot.

An offence has been registered against Panda and others under the Prohibition Act and rioting.

144,['16/03/2020'],"Sadanand Fulzele, an ardent Ambedkarite, passes away","Nagpur: Sadanand Fulzele (92), a prominent figure in Babasaheb Ambedkar’s historic conversion to Buddhism at the Deekshabhoomi ground in Nagpur on October 14, 1956, passed away on Sunday. The death will leave an irreversible loss in Babasaheb Ambedkar Smarak Samiti in the city.

Sadanand Fulzele was born on November 1, 1928. He contested the NMC elections in 1952 and was elected as corporator from Ambedkar Nagar. He himself took Deeksha with Babasaheb Ambedkar and nearly half a million followers, which was one of the biggest such events recorded in history.

Arvind Joshi, organizing committee member of Ambedkar College, mourned the loss, “It a big loss for the family and the samiti. Fulzele worked selflessly and was a source of inspiration to all.” Fulzele played an important role in building and designing the entire architecture of Deekshabhoomi, which is the main attraction of Orange city, he said.

Fulzele, an ardent Ambedkarite, was instrumental in building the stupa at Deekshabhoomi, the site of Babasaheb Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism in 1956. Fulzele, incidentally, was deputy mayor of Nagpur when the Dalit icon converted along with over 6 lakh followers. Fulzele was elected on a scheduled caste federation ticket in 1952, winning by just one vote. He was not only a witness to Ambedkar’s historical legacy but was also part of the Republican Party of India (RPI).

“We have lost our inspiration and guide. He was the ever-guiding light for us, the samiti will miss his presence,” said Kabir Rawelkar, vice principal, Ambedkar College.

Nitin Raut, state energy minister, expressed grief on his demise. “Sadanand Fulzele was an icon of Ambedkarite ideology and the face of progressive thinking. We hope to continue his mission, which focused on taking society ahead together. His loss is irreparable for not only Nagpur and Maharashtra, but the entire country.” he said

Fulzele’s body will be kept in Deekshabhoomi for people to pay homage on Monday from 3pm. Sudhir Fulzele, son of Sadanand Fulzele, said, “A huge procession will be avoided in public interest. The body will be later cremated at Ambazari Ghat around 5pm.”

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “Entire responsibility of the conversion was taken care of by Sadanand Fulzele. He dedicated his life for educational, societal and political field. He worked immensely for the education of backward children, and we must always remember his noble deeds, that’s our homage to him.”

“He personally took care of all the arrangements on the historic conversion day. He was very close to Ambedkar. We have lost a great human being and the pillar of Smarak Samiti,” tweeted ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis.

Nitin Gadkari, minister of road transport and highways, also expressed grief. “Sadanand Fulzele was an idol in the field of social work, politics and education. His contribution in social upliftment movement in Maharashtra was extraordinary. His demise is a personal loss for me along with an irreparable loss for the Ambedkarite movement,” he tweeted.

145,['16/03/2020'],DC’s office complex may require another year for completion,"Moodbidri MLA Umanath Kotian held an inspection at the new DC’s office complex site at Padil on Sunday

Mangaluru: The new deputy commissioner’s office complex, which is under construction at Padil , will require one more year for completion. The 2.3 lakh square foot three-storey building is being built on 5.8 acres.

The building will accommodate 38 departments and offices of MLAs and MP. The construction was initially planned at an estimated cost of Rs 41 crore, but the actual cost may cross Rs 55 crore, said Umanath Kotian, MLA, Moodbidri .

He told reporters, after inspecting the work on Sunday, that though the project was started in 2018, it suffered a financial deadlock due to the farm loan waiver, and the flood that resulted in huge losses in the state. Later, the cost of construction increased due to the hike in price of materials. The government will release funds and expedite the work, he said.

“Though the site for the construction of the DC’s office complex was identified in 2014, the project could not be taken up due to litigation related to the forest department. Within a month we will convene a meeting here which will also be attended by the eight MLAs from the district, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari and district in-charge secretary V Ponnuraj. The meeting will discuss initiatives to complete the project at the earliest, and a delegation will meet chief minister B S Yediyurappa seeking funds. We will make this DC’s office complex a model one for the entire state,” the MLA said.

The new DC’s office complex will sport a spacious parking facility and accommodate 175-200 cars.

Prabhakar Yeyyadi is the project contractor. In fact, the project, which commenced on February 9, 2018, should have been completed before August 2019. At present, Rs 32 crore has already been spent to complete the structural work of the complex. The government has already released Rs 24 crore, he said, adding that the remaining funds will be released in a phased manner.

He said there are plans to hand over the old DC’s office complex in the city to the Mangaluru Smart City Limited. However, discussion in this regard is still in the initial stage, he added.

146,['16/03/2020'],Vadodara: Teen detained for digital rape of 3 girls,"Representative image

VADODARA: A 17-year-old boy was detained by the Chhani police for allegedly sexually assaulting three four-year-old girls in the school van.

Parents of the girls had hired the school van service of the boy’s father who is a driver by profession. However, for the past few weeks, the boy had been driving them to the kindergarten school as his father was not keeping well.

“About a week ago, he began touching the girls inappropriately. He even digitally raped the girls when they used to take them home from school in his van. One of the girls told her mother about his acts two days ago,” said RS Dodiya, Chhani police inspector.

The girl’s mother went to the school next day and raised the issue with the management. Incidentally, the mother teaches in the same school. During the parent-teacher’s meeting, mothers of two other girls said that their daughters too had complained about the boy’s acts. The teacher then decided to file a complaint with Chhani police.

The boy, who has dropped out of studies, was detained by the police immediately and booked for rape.

“We will bring in a counsellor to examine the boy’s mental condition,” Dodiya added.

Police is now trying to ascertain if he has committed such crimes in the past.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

Asked what the legal position in this regard, he refused to comment, but one of his close aides said: “Article 175 (2) for the President of India and Article 86 of the Constitution for the Governor make it clear that any communication from the President to speakers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and from the Governor to the speaker of an assembly would not be a direction but a message.”

After the meeting, Digvijaya said: “We expect the speaker to decide on floor test according to set traditions of the House, procedures, and law.” Attempts to contact governor, Lalji Tandon , for a comment in this regard proved futile.

To add to the drama, the 22 rebel MLAs issued video statements on Sunday, urging the Speaker to accept their resignations just as he has accepted the resignations of the six who have been sacked from the Nath cabinet. If the floor test happens, and they are absent, BJP will have the upper hand with its 107 MLAs.

As of Sunday evening, the assembly strength is 222 — after six resignations and death of two MLAs — putting the majority mark at 112. If the 16 other resignations, in the wake of Jyotiraditya Scindia ’s shock quitting of Congress are accepted, Congress would be down to 92 members in the House, which would then have a strength of 206, putting the majority mark at 104.

Even with its allies, who have not said anything yet about withdrawing support, the ruling Congress alliance will fall short of the magic mark. BJP has the edge in the event of a floor test in the present circumstances.

On Sunday, Prajapati again waited for the summoned rebel MLAs to arrive and explain to him the circumstances under which they resigned, but no one came. Just as the previous two days. “Even after seeking clarification, none from the 19 MLAs appeared to reply in person. Why are they not contacting me when they have sent their resignations to me through somebody else,” he wondered.

“I am a constitutionally elected Speaker. I am also their patron, but now I am worried. What is happening to the members? I owe a responsibility to the House and also to all MLAs. I have been waiting for the members who have been held up in other towns, to present themselves for verification but, it was futile. I will now decide about the issue at an opportune moment,” said Prajapati.

Congress minister Pradeep Jaiswal exuded confidence that Congress will be able to prove majority in the House, and said that the floor test might not take place. “We have the numbers. The chief minister is also confident. We have to wait and watch. It is not necessary that the floor test will take place tomorrow, as we all are grappling with coronavirus pandemic,” said Jaiswal after the cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon.

P C Sharma also referred the coronavirus scare and said, “We are always ready for a floor test. In the previous test, two BJP MLAs increased our strength during voting. The given procedures and guidelines should be followed in conducting proceedings of Vidhan Sabha. The Speaker should take care of this.”

Even finance minister Tarun Barot told reporters that the Coronavirus scare is more concerning. “The Congress government is ready for floor test but the MLAs should return to participate in the test,” he said.

The BJP MLAs lodged in Manesar are likely to return to Bhopal on Sunday night. But what of the 22 Congress rebels? Former minister Umashankar Gupta , who is with the breakaway Congress MLAs in Bengaluru, told TOI, “I cannot say whether we will return or not.” tnn

151,['16/03/2020'],"Ganga Mela festivities beat coronavirus scare, ‘Rangon Ka Thela’ taken out","Ganga Mela festivities beat coronavirus scare, ‘Rangon Ka Thela’ taken out

KANPUR: The coronavirus scare failed to dampen the spirit of the devotees visiting the Ganga Mela held here on Sunday. Several locals paid tributes at various city ghats, including Sarsaiyya and Massacre Ghats, to the revolutionaries who fought for the country’s freedom struggle on this occasion.

Ganga Mela is celebrated every year after Holi on ‘ Anuradha Nakshtra ’ in memory of the revolutionaries who were released by the British government after being made captive during the 1857 War of Independence.

During the day time, people after smearing each other with colours, head towards the banks of Ganga for a dip, and because of this unique trend, the festival got its name ‘Ganga Mela’. The localities known as ‘Purana Kanpur’ like Hatia, Nayaganj, Birhana Road etc are the places where Ganga Mela celebrations are organised at a grand level.

Continuing with the tradition, the locals took out processions, which culminated at various city ghats. In these processions, the people, carried big sized drums filled with colour on ‘thelas’ pulled by buffaloes with people dancing and playing with ‘rang and gulal’ on the tunes of popular Holi songs and Bollywood numbers.

Since early morning, a crowd was seen in the Old City areas like Birhana Road, Hatia, Maniram ki Bagia etc palying colours.

The procession started from Rajjan Babu Park from Hatiya and as it reached Birhana Road, the residents of the area threw colours from rooftops on the revellers. The ‘matkis’, filled with colours, hung on Birhana Road, were broken by youths.

Meanwhile, the biggest attraction of the day was at Sarsaiya Ghat which wore a festive look. Several representatives of political parties and the district officials also took part in the Ganga Mela and the Holi Milan function.

People were seen hugging and wishing each other. The administration had deployed a large number of policemen at the ghats. District magistrate Brahmadeo Ram Tiwari , DIG Anant Deo and other administration officials also exchanged Ganga Mela greetings.

Pushpendra Jaiswal, a local claimed, that origin of the Ganga Mela could be traced to 1942 when the Britishers imposed a blanket ban on playing Holi, but residents of Hatia, performed the ‘ Holika Dahan ’ and played with colours to mark the protest against Britishers and to save their tradition. This led to the arrest of around 72 people for disobeying the British decree.

Enraged over this, the denizens played Holi continuously for seven days until all the captives were released by the Britishers.

“It is for this reason, that this day is not a mere festival for the people, but is a celebration to commemorate the victory of Indians over the British rule,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Two women thieves from Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh have been arrested for stealing Rs 5 lakh from a woman after engaging her in a conversation at a stationery shop. The incident took place in West Delhi’s Tagore Garden area.

The victim was preparing for her entrance exam, and had withdrawn the money to pay her coaching fees and for some other expenses.

The accused have been identified as Nargis (35) and Anjali (23). Both of them are married and hail from Kadiya village in Rajgarh.

On March 7, Garima approached police informing them about the theft. She told the cops that she was preparing for GMAT exam. She had gone to a bank at Tagore Garden shopping complex and withdrawn Rs 5lakh. Two women later followed her till the stationery shop where Garima went to get some photocopies done.

“While one of the accused engaged her in a discussion, another one managed to open the zip of her bag and steal Rs 5lakh from it,” said Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police, West Delhi.

The accused then left the shop immediately. When Garima checked her bag to pay for the photocopies, she realised her money was missing.

“We identified and tracked the women and the auto driver with the help of the CCTV footage. The accused duo would usually live on the city outskirts and travel by autorickshaw. They have ten cases registered against them in Rajgarh and three in Delhi,” said a police officer.

The arrested auto driver was later identified as Pramod Podar. He told the cops that he charged Rs 2,000 to ferry the women to various malls and shopping areas. The gang members would later meet in Gurgaon.

They had handed over the stolen money to Geeta Bai, Anjali’s mother, who left for Rajgarh a day after the incident.

“The gang members from Madhya Pradesh have committed similar crimes in other states as well. They dress up well and enter wedding venues, banks and shopping complexes to look for possible targets,” the officer added.

156,['16/03/2020'],AMU VC writes to CM Yogi demanding continuation of property tax exemption,"Agra: With the Aligarh Municipal Corporation (MC) raising a demand of Rs 13.77 crore from the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on account of outstanding dues towards property tax payments, vice chancellor Prof Tariq Mansoor, has written a letter to UP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, urging him to continue the tax exemption that the varsity was getting earlier. He also pointed out that no such tax is being charged from the Banaras Hindu University (BHU).

Incidentally, the MC has threatened the varsity with seizure of its bank accounts, if they fail to pay the outstanding property tax and the interest accrued on it since 2005, immediately. The VC said that the university had written a letter to the university grants commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) demanding a budget allocation for payment of the outstanding tax dues, but they had received no response from them.

Talking to TOI, the university’s registrar, Abdul Hamid, said that the varsity classes, lab and library were exempted from the tax but the municipal corporation now claims that the earlier order was applicable only during the tenure of the Nagar Palika.

“This is a central university and funds are allocated by the Centre for every purpose and we cannot pay this huge amount until the ministry approves the same,” he said, adding that they will be in trouble, if MC seizes their bank account, as all projects and salaries will be stopped.

Chief tax officer Vinay Rai told TOI that the university officials are giving incorrect logic. He said the letter they are showing was of 1990 during the period of Nagar Palika and the corporation had already clarified to them that this was the new assessment by the corporation since 2005 under UP Municipal Corporation Act, 1959.

“UP government has already given its nod for recovery amount of Rs 13.77 crore including Rs 7.33 crore interest from the AMU,” he said, adding that “a warrant in this regard will be issued soon and movable and immovable property of the varsity will be attached, if required”.

AURANGABAD: A woman gram panchayat member in the Latur district and her husband were recently disqualified by the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court from contesting any election for having more than two children after the prescribed cut-off date.

The cut-off day for the implementation of two-child rule in panchayats was September 12, 2000 and the couple had twins in 2005. The twins were disowned by the couple for which the court took them to task for lying and suppressing information.

Lalita Nagnath Patil of Koraliwadi in Nilanga taluka of Latur district was elected to gram panchayat as member, but her election was challenged by Bhaskar Birajdar and others.

Additional divisional commissioner had disqualified her on December 18, 2019, concluding that two 2 biological children (twins) were born on March 30, 2005 to the petitioner and her husband, Nagnath, and this information was suppressed by them.

Lalita then moved high court challenging the additional divisional commissioner’s orders stating that she was ready to file an affidavit on the next date declaring that these two children are not her biological children.

She was also willing to undergo a DNA test if these two children are produced and if their DNA matches, both are willing to deposit an amount of Rs 5 lakh each in this court as costs and willing to face permanent disqualification as well as criminal prosecution.

Government pleader Suresh Munde said the couple stated that they did not know about the twins, while one of the respondents, Birajdar, pointed that the twins were studying in an English-medium school.

“The court had even granted the petitioner one opportunity before fling their individual affidavits, to reconsider their stand and if they want to resile from their stand, they would be at liberty to make a statement before the court on March 7, 2020,” he said.

The court later directed Latur superintendent of police to immediately embark upon a search for the two children by interrogating persons or relatives of the petitioner as deem fit and proper and shall follow all lawful methods for carrying out such interrogation and shall endeavour to produce two children before the court on March 7, 2020 at 10.30 a.m.

The petitioner and her husband were also directed to remain present in the court on the said date. When the matter came up for hearing before justice Ravindra Ghuge on March 7, the petitioner and her husband submitted that they are tendering an apology and desire to withdraw this petition.

During the course of hearing on the petition, the court also came across five birth certificates issued to the petitioner’s husband on a single day in support of their claim.

While dismissing the petition, the court imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioner, and directed the amount be deposited in this court on or before April 15, 2020, failing which, this court would initiate suo-moto contempt proceedings and would also direct the Latur district collector to initiate proceedings for recovery of Rs 1 lakh with an additional fine of Rs 50,000 as arrears of land revenue.

The court also directed Kasar Sirsi police station to register an FIR against Nagnath for manipulating the records of the birth dates of the five children. The court directed the district health officer to “locate the person, who had issued the birth certificates on December 22, 2016 to Nagnath and initiate disciplinary action against him for manipulation of records”.

After being discharged, one of the family members said that doctors have asked them to “avoid social gatherings for a few days and maintain a high level of hygiene and sanitation”.

The four members returned home on Saturday evening. Notably, six members of the family who had returned from Italy in the last week of February were quarantined on March 3. Two other members of the family are still at the hospital.

Recalling the experience of their 13-day recovery, the family members praised the arrangements made by the doctors along with efforts of the Centre, the state government and district administration to control the spread of the virus.

Six members of the shoe exporter’s family were recently transferred to the hospital in Delhi from Agra district hospital.

Aditya Constructions, through its authorised signatory Thota Satyanayana, moved the contempt plea on behalf of the pattadar farmers against Najeeb Ahmed, Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, Vellore Venkat Kamal Kumar, Narasimharao Bandaru and NRVSV Koteswara Rao charging them with violating the status quo order granted by the apex court on October 1, 2018 in respect of the land in survey number 1007 situated in the erstwhile Rangareddy district.

Aditya Constructions, in its plea, contended that despite a categorical order from the top court of the land asking the parties and the authorities to maintain status quo in respect of possession of the land, the respondents had without any right or title in their favour, executed certain documents on behalf of certain private companies.

The rightful owners, Pilli Mallaiah and six others, who entered into an agreement with us, had possession of this land for the last 60 years,” Thota Satyanarayana said.

Aditya Constructions also filed a separate plea before the apex court informing it about an earlier order of the high court that directed the authorities to update the names of Aditya firm owners in the digital revenue records since they happen to be the authorised persons for a portion of the land in survey number 1007. “But a bench of the high court recently heard a third party appeal filed by a company called Prime Properties and stayed the ‘digital direction’ without hearing us,” the company said, adding, “We want this order to be nullified because it was passed without following principles of natural justice.”

Rai said BEE wants to provide an international framework for industrial plants for good energy management and prioritise new energy-efficient technologies that help industries to use energy more efficiently. In view of AP’s potential, effective implementation of these standards will help the state reduce energy costs, improve cost effective productivity, profitability and promote industrial development.

Rai said the industrial sector was the highest energy consumer accounting for 40% of the total consumption in the country. The energy consumption is expected to reach 443.4 million ton of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2031against the present total energy consumption of 347 Mtoe in industrial sector due to which the ISO 50001:2018 would be implemented initially in industrial plants, identified under PAT (Perform, Achieve and Trade) scheme, he said.

The strike was called off after receiving assurance from the state government that an empowered committee will be constituted to resolve their issue. The farmers, however, announced to protest on land till their demands are met. But, they will not sit inside the pit.

The decision was taken after the chief whip of Congress, Mahesh Joshi, assured the farmers on government’s behalf.

After the talks turned futile and their three demands, including compensation as per Land Acquisition Act 2013 were not met, the move was taken to catch the government’s attention.

Samiti coordinator Nagendra Singh said, “We were forced to intensify our protest in peaceful manner as government did not take concrete steps to resolve our issues. The protest will continue till the time decision on the scheme is not taken. But we will not sit inside the pits.”

CMO Narendra Agarwal has ordered an inquiry into the alleged leak, saying strict action would be taken against anyone found guilty.The crank call victims are all relatives of the Toronto-based doctor who tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. The CMO’s office had prepared a list of the doctor’s contacts, including their names, age, address and phone numbers for collection of samples and other precautionary measures.“We have been receiving 150-200 calls a day.

173,['16/03/2020'],Bombay high court asks Parbhani ZP to consider job claim of man who lost father at six,"Bombay high court asks Parbhani ZP to consider job claim of man who lost father at six

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court directed the chief executive officer (CEO) of Parbhani zilla parishad to consider the claim of a man, who lost his father — a primary teacher with the ZP — when he was six, for appointment on compassionate ground at a post commensurate with his qualifications.

The man’s father was a confirmed employee of the ZP working as a primary teacher. He died on September 6, 2005. The petitioner — Dnyaneshwar Musane (21), a resident of Vitthalwadi in Ahmedpur taluka of Latur district — moved court when his application was rejected by the CEO citing a government resolution. His mother had earlier applied for a job on a compassionate ground, but his grandparents objected. The then CEO held a hearing in 2013 and added his mother’s name to the waiting list.

However, at the time of hearing, his mother gave up the claim for appointment and requested that Dnyaneshwar be given an appointment instead. The petitioner was a minor then.

After becoming an adult, Dnyaneshwar submitted a fresh application on June 18, 2015, seeking appointment. His application was rejected by the CEO on the ground that the name of the petitioner cannot be substituted in place of his mother’s name in the list of persons seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The CEO cited a government resolution dated May 20, 2015, that states that name of any legal representative of a deceased employee would not be substituted in place of other legal representative in the list of persons seeking appointment on compassionate ground.

While allowing the petition, the bench, comprising justices Z A Haq and S M Gavhane, termed the resolution to be arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable and violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

The bench held that the restriction imposed by the GR dated May 20, 2015 is unjustified and directed it to be deleted.

The bench observed that: “We hold that the petitioner is entitled for consideration for appointment on compassionate ground with the zilla parishad. We direct the CEO to include the name of the petitioner in the waiting list of people seeking appointment on compassionate ground, substituting his name in place of his mother’s name’’.

The court also asked the CEO to consider the claim of the petitioner for appointment on compassionate ground on the post commensurate with his qualifications and treating his seniority as per the seniority of his mother.

175,['16/03/2020'],"Madhya Pradesh floor test: Suspense on floor test, return of rebel MLAs","Independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera shows victory sign as he leaves Bhopal airport after returning from Jaipu... Read More

BHOPAL: The political drama in Madhya Pradesh seems headed for another twist. Law minister P C Sharma said on Sunday evening that the Governor’s directive to the Speaker to hold a floor test on Monday is “only a message and not a direction”, indicating that the make-or-break division may not happen on the opening day of budget session.

CM Kamal Nath called on Governor Lalji Tandon at midnight on Sunday. After a 40-minute meeting, Nath said: “The Governor wanted to meet me, so I visited him.” On the issue on floor test he said, “It will be conducted by the Speaker. The Speaker will do his job and I’ll do mine. I have told the Governor that I am ready for the floor test, but 21 of my MLAs are being held captive” said Nath.

The agenda of the assembly, released around 9pm on Sunday, doesn’t mention floor test. It only lists the Governor’s address and motion of thanks.

Floor test is not the only thing uncertain. There’s suspense over whether the 22 breakaway MLAs of Scindia faction, lodged in Bengaluru since March 9, will return on Monday.

Speaker N P Prajapati sparked speculation by saying he wouldn’t reply to “hypothetical questions on the floor test” and will take decision in the House.

Congress ministers and even the Speaker have expressed concern over Coronavirus. “It has been detected in several parts of the country and spreading every moment. In such circumstances, as I mentioned earlier, the priority of any democracy or country is towards health. In the present situation, everyone is worried, so am I,” said Prajapati.

As an indication, the 86 Congress MLAs, who returned from Jaipur on Sunday, were screened for Coronavirus. Asked if he would carry out the floor test in the House, as directed by the Governor, the Speaker said, “This will come tomorrow. I cannot answer hypothetical questions or be a part of any fluke. I had spoken about established procedures and have read out the power of a Speaker. The answer lies in it,” he said.

Governor Lalji Tandon had late Saturday night directed CM Kamal Nath to seek a trust vote in the assembly on Monday after the Governor’s address in the House. Following this, Nath called a cabinet meeting at Mantralaya on Sunday afternoon, where the Governor’s letter — which says the Congress government has “lost majority after the resignation of 22 party MLAs” — was discussed.

Advocate general Shashank Shekhar attended a meeting with CM Nath, Digvijaya Singh and Congress leader and eminent lawyer Vivek Tankha at CM House on Sunday evening.

Asked if it was mandatory for the Speaker to hold the floor test on Monday, Shekhar told reporters: “It’s the exclusive domain of the speaker. What the Governor has written to the Speaker is between the two of them.”

Asked what the legal position in this regard, he refused to comment, but one of his close aides said: “Article 175 (2) for the President of India and Article 86 of the Constitution for the Governor make it clear that any communication from the President to speakers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and from the Governor to the speaker of an assembly would not be a direction but a message.”

After the meeting, Digvijaya said: “We expect the speaker to decide on floor test according to set traditions of the House, procedures, and law.” Attempts to contact governor, Lalji Tandon, for a comment in this regard proved futile.

To add to the drama, the 22 rebel MLAs issued video statements on Sunday, urging the Speaker to accept their resignations just as he has accepted the resignations of the six who have been sacked from the Nath cabinet. If the floor test happens, and they are absent, BJP will have the upper hand with its 107 MLAs.

As of Sunday evening, the assembly strength is 222 — after six resignations and death of two MLAs — putting the majority mark at 112. If the 16 other resignations, in the wake of Jyotiraditya Scindia’s shock quitting of Congress are accepted, Congress would be down to 92 members in the House, which would then have a strength of 206, putting the majority mark at 104.

Even with its allies, who have not said anything yet about withdrawing support, the ruling Congress alliance will fall short of the magic mark. BJP has the edge in the event of a floor test in the present circumstances.

On Sunday, Prajapati again waited for the summoned rebel MLAs to arrive and explain to him the circumstances under which they resigned, but no one came. Just as the previous two days. “Even after seeking clarification, none from the 19 MLAs appeared to reply in person. Why are they not contacting me when they have sent their resignations to me through somebody else,” he wondered.

“I am a constitutionally elected Speaker. I am also their patron, but now I am worried. What is happening to the members? I owe a responsibility to the House and also to all MLAs. I have been waiting for the members who have been held up in other towns, to present themselves for verification but, it was futile. I will now decide about the issue at an opportune moment,” said Prajapati.

Congress minister Pradeep Jaiswal exuded confidence that Congress will be able to prove majority in the House, and said that the floor test might not take place. “We have the numbers. The chief minister is also confident. We have to wait and watch. It is not necessary that the floor test will take place tomorrow, as we all are grappling with coronavirus pandemic,” said Jaiswal after the cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon.

P C Sharma also referred the coronavirus scare and said, “We are always ready for a floor test. In the previous test, two BJP MLAs increased our strength during voting. The given procedures and guidelines should be followed in conducting proceedings of Vidhan Sabha. The Speaker should take care of this.”

Even finance minister Tarun Barot told reporters that the Coronavirus scare is more concerning. “The Congress government is ready for floor test but the MLAs should return to participate in the test,” he said.

The BJP MLAs lodged in Manesar are likely to return to Bhopal on Sunday night. But what of the 22 Congress rebels? Former minister Umashankar Gupta, who is with the breakaway Congress MLAs in Bengaluru, told TOI, “I cannot say whether we will return or not.”

Sunday witnessed a sharp fall of 50% in the sale of tickets, as compared to normal weekends.

The numbers may fall further in coming days due to restrictions on travel visas imposed by India along with shutdown by governments in various states across the country, said officials.

According to data provided by the Archaeological Survey of India, the overall number of tourists has been declining for the past few days. A total of 16,428 visited the Taj Mahal on Thursday and 15,313 on Saturday. On Sunday, the numbers fell further to 13,186, as compared to the usual weekend sales of over 25,000 tickets.

The number of foreign tourists fell down to a mere 1,274 on Sunday.

Just 2,091 and 3,455 foreign tourists had visited the Mughal-era monument on Thursday and Saturday. The monument remains closed on Fridays.

When contacted, ASI superintending archeologist (Agra circle), Vasant Swarnkar expressed apprehension that these numbers would fall further as people are avoiding to visit places of mass gatherings.

Last Sunday, only 12,304 tickets were sold, but that was due to the fact that women’s entry to the monument was made free on the International Women’s Day. An estimated 10,000-plus women had visited the monument on March 8, said an ASI official.

Agra Tourism Guild vice-president Rajiv Saxena said, “It’s sad to see the numbers of tourists declining at the Taj each passing day. But we hope the government’s efforts to arrest the outbreak of the Covid-19 succeed and tourists are back in Agra soon.”

181,['16/03/2020'],Local bodies may miss out on Centre’s largesse,"Vijayawada: The state election commission’s decision to postpone elections may cost local bodies Rs 5,000 crore.

The grants being extended under the 14th Finance Commission to the local bodies are devolved into two components – basic grant and performance grant. While the basic grant is provided to every local body by the finance commission for delivering basic services, the performance grants are given to only those local bodies which shore up their revenue over the preceding years as reflected in the accounts.

But the Union government has made it clear that the grants under the 14th Finance Commission cannot be released to a particular local body without having an elected council before the start of a financial year.

For example, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation lost Rs 300 crore in the last three financial years, including 2019-20, in the absence of the elections. Similar is the case with the thousands of gram panchayats of the state as the tenure of the elected members ended in 2018.

If the new councils do not assume offices before March 31, it may hamper the grant releasing process for the 2020-21 financial year, including nearly Rs 100 crore to GVMC. The delay in the process has kept the release of Rs 3,700 crore grants to gram panchayats and Rs 1,400 crore to urban local bodies pending in the last few years.

The threat of losing the 14th Finance Commission grants is one of the prime reasons for the government rushing through the election process. It made sure of scheduling the elections before March 31 to make the local bodies eligible for the devolution of finance commission grants.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy said that state would have got about Rs 5,000 crore, if the election process was over this month. “The conduct of local body elections will lead them to a growth path. But former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu by using his moles in the system has made the SEC postpone the elections,” said Reddy.

182,['16/03/2020'],"One kg nails, billboards removed from trees","Trichy: Youths belonging to a forum on Sunday launched an initiative to remove the steel plates, nails and advertisement hoardings nailed to trees on the roadside in the city. Native breeds like Pungai (Pongamia) and Peepal trees are most commonly targetted for nailing the advertisement hoardings.

Around 10 youths belonging to Tamil Nadu Veera Vivekanandar Ilaingar Peravai, removed the nails weighing almost a kilo and the metal advertisement plates in the Cantonment locality covering Heber road and Bharathiyar road. The volunteers said that they were able to remove nails from only 15 trees as it was difficult for them to pluck the nails that were hammered so deep into the barks.

“We had to use a ladder and crowbars for removing the thick nails without breaking them. There were a minimum of 10 nails in each of the trees,” VC Ranjith Kumar, coordinator of the forum. Majority of the advertisements were for mobile shops, property sales and job vacancies. In order to ensure that the advertisement boards stay put, some of them have wrapped with the trees using metal wires.

“Planting trees is fine but the authorities should also make sure that the existing tree cover is protected,” Ranjith added. The youths said that the trees hammered with nails were prone to pathogenic infections. To avoid the infection, they applied the neem and turmeric paste on the cavities formed in trees after the nails were removed.

She didn’t know of her husband’s infection when she travelled from Bengaluru.The FIR, based on a complaint by additional chief medical officer Dr Vinay Kumar, said that the woman’s father, a railway employee, “did not cooperate with medical authorities and lied to DM about daughter’s whereabouts”.He’s been booked under IPC’s sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life). The charges carry provisions of a prison term up to two years, or fine, or both.Agra senior superintendent of police Babloo Kumar said, “We will add more names in the FIR as the investigation proceeds.”Meanwhile, the woman’s father told TOI, “My entire family is in deep stress.

187,['16/03/2020'],Vadodara: Lok Rakshak Dal cop arrested for raping college girl,"The site of the crime

VADODARA: A Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) constable was arrested for rape after he allegedly forced a 21-year-old college girl to perform oral sex on him on Gotri-Ankodia road on Saturday.

Along with constable Surajsinh Chauhan, the police also arrested the driver of police control room (PCR) van, Rasik Chauhan, who allegedly took bribe from the girl’s boyfriend.

At around 8.30pm, Chauhan, who is posted in Laxmipura police station, and Rasik passed an isolated spot near a canal on Gotri-Ankodia road while they were on patrolling duty.

Seeing the girl and her boyfriend there, Chauhan got off the van and started questioning them. He threatened to make their relationship public by informing their parents. Scared by the threats, they started pleading to let them off.

“Chauhan then demanded a bribe of Rs 5,000. The girl’s boyfriend told him that he didn’t have so much cash and offered to transfer money from his Paytm account. But Chauhan then asked van driver Rasik to accompany the boy to a nearby petrol pump. The boy paid the petrol pump using Paytm and Rasik collected the cash from the pump,” said B A Chaudhary, assistant commissioner of police (ACP).

When Rasik and the boy left, Suraj started touching the girl inappropriately. He then took the girl to an under-construction house and forced her to perform oral sex on him. “This lasted for a few minutes. When Rasik and the boy returned, Suraj let off the girl and left the spot in the PCR van,” said Chaudhary.

Chauhan was inducted as LRD jawan three years ago

The traumatized girl returned home and immediately narrated her ordeal to her family. They rushed to Laxmipura police station along with other people and demanded registering a complaint against the accused duo. The couple had noted the vehicle registration number of the PCR van.

“We lodged a complaint of rape and Prevention of Corruption Act against the accused. Both Suraj and Rasik were arrested at 4am on Sunday,” B A Chaudhary, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) told TOI. The boy works with a private firm.

Chauhan has been posted in Laxmipura police station since 2017 when he was appointed in LRD.

The accused were remanded to police custody till Monday. They have been booked under IPC sections 376 (2) A (1) (police personnel committing rape) and Prevention of Corruption Act 7 (A).

City police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut admitted that that such crimes sully the image of the police department. “We will take strict action against the accused,” he added.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

This doctor had gone to Spain for a conference and had returned to the state capital on March 2. He joined duty and worked at the hospital till March 8. However, he developed fever symptoms after that and he was asked to go on leave for 14 days.

The doctor later contacted the health department and informed about the travel he had made to Spain. His swab sample was taken on March 11 and the result had come on Saturday night. He has been on self-isolation ever since he had gone on leave from the hospital.

However, the authorities at the hospital where he was working made it clear that there was nothing to worry even though he was not in quarantine till March 8 after coming back from Spain.

“He was in the radiology department and he never had direct interaction with the patients. However, he had contact with the four other people who have been working in the same department,’’ said an official of the hospital.

Since Spain was not in the high-risk category the doctor was allowed to join for duty. It was only on March 11 that Spain was included in the list of worst-hit countries. “But we conducted a test on him soon after he showed the symptoms of fever. After this he was asked to go on leave,’’ said a doctor from the hospital.

At present those who had been working with him in the same department and also the people who had mingled with him have been asked to go on self-isolation. Four people have been identified as primary contacts. But the hospital authorities made it clear that no one has shown any symptoms.

190,['16/03/2020'],"Farmers seek 50,000 connections under SF scheme","Representative image

TRICHY: Delta farmers have appealed to the state government to enhance the number of power connections allotted to those registered under ordinary and self-financing schemes to 50,000 this year, from the 25,000 announced by the power minister in the assembly recently. The announcement has come as a shocker for lakhs of small and marginal farmers who rely only on groundwater and have been waiting for power connections since 2000, they said.

The government had introduced a self-financing scheme after stopping the free power supply for agriculture purpose in 2001. For this, farmers have to remit Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 under the self-financing scheme and Rs 10,000 for the normal scheme. The farmers say about 4 lakh farmers have been waiting to get connections under the schemes for nearly two decades after remitting the money. It was in this context that the AIADMK government introduced the tatkal scheme. According to it, farmers have to remit Rs 2.5 lakh for a 5HP motor connection, Rs 2.75 lakh for a 7.5HP motor, Rs 3 lakh for 10 HP power supply and Rs 4 lakh for 10 HP motor. Power connection would be given within 6 months of remitting the money.

Despite stiff resistance by the farming community, the government launched the scheme and it was well-received as a number of farmers opted for it. However, farmers alleged that thereafter the government completely ignored the normal and the self-financing scheme.

Electricity minister P Thangamani himself said in the assembly that 4.25 lakh farmers were waiting for free power connection. “The government totally ignored the plight of small and marginal farmers,” said S Dharmarajan, a farmer from Nedar village in Thanjavur.

“I remitted Rs 50,000 in August 2000, Rs 25,000 in 2009 and again Rs 25,000 in 2012 for three separate connections. However, till date I am yet to get even a single connection as the government is concentrating on farmers who can spend money for tatkal”, he lamented.

Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said that despite their appeal to increase the allotment of power connections under normal and self-financing schemes, the government was unmoved.

N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam, said that delay in providing power connection was due to absence of required poles, transformers and cables. “The infrastructure established to provide connection under tatkal should now be used to give connections to those waiting under self-financing scheme”, he said.

The evaluation process begins on Monday.

RK Trivedi, Lucknow district president, UP Madhyamik Shiksha Sangh, said, “At a time when the state government has closed all the schools and colleges until March 22, teachers are being called for evaluation purpose. There is a huge risk of getting infected by the virus in a large gathering.”

Rajesh Tyagi, a teacher in Meerut, said, “At least 500 teachers will be assembling at the evaluation centre and it increases the risk of coronavirus infecting all teachers at the spot.”

To check the virus from spreading, an advisory has been issued to people to avoid crowded places such as cinema halls or malls. While movie theatre officials have been asked to check the temperature of every person who comes to the cinema hall via thermal scanning, others have been asked to disinfect their surroundings from time to time to make sure that nobody catches the infection.

In this context, authorities in Agra have decided to sanitize the five evaluation centres in the district before work begins. Disinfectants will be used for mopping and cleaning the centres every day. In Agra alone, 3,500 teachers have been assigned evaluation duty.

Joint director (education) of Agra division Mukesh Agarwal has issued orders to the effect to all district inspectors of schools (DIOS).

Ravindra Singh, DIOS of Agra said, “All the centres where the evaluation process is planned will be sanitized. Teams of the civic body and health departments will be conducting chemical mopping at the exam centres. In this regard, a request has been sent to the district administration.”

The Secondary Education Council has directed that there should be at least one meter distance between each examiner. Special care be given on maintenance of sanitation and hygiene at each centre. The DIOS have been directed to ensure availability of sanitizers at the centres.

Arun Kumar Singh, principal of Government Inter College in Shahganj (Agra), where the evaluation will take place, said, “High level of precautions will be followed at the evaluation centres to prevent any possibility of the spread of coronavirus. Teachers having a cold, fever or any other health complication will not be allowed to evaluate answersheets without approval of the chief medical officer. Besides, high level of cleanliness will be ensured.”

Nainital: Due to good rain spells in February and March, the water level in the Naini Lake has touched a ten-year-high at 14 feet.

Experts have welcomed this rise in the level of water in the lake, which is the main source of water for Nainital.

“The rise in water level of Naini Lake is always good news. As the use of water increases during summers, the administration will not have to worry about supplies,” Ajay Singh Rawat, a Nainital-based environmentalist said.

The present water level in the lake is six-feet higher than the usual. Prior to this, the water level in the lake had touched the 14-feet mark in 2010.

The rise in the water level is significant as eight lakh litres of water (on an average) from the lake is used daily through 11 tube wells. Besides, the lake is a major tourist attraction and gives a picturesque view to the town.

Meanwhile, officials say that they are looking at ways to conserve the water in the lake. “The demand for water peaks during dry months like May and June. Thus, it is necessary that the excess water in the lake is preserved.”

198,['16/03/2020'],Two-day wild life census concludes at Point Calimere sanctuary in Nagai,"Trichy: The two-day wildlife census conducted at Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary in Kodiyakarai forest of Nagapattinnam concluded on Sunday. Conducted by the forest department, volunteers from a few colleges were roped in for the census. The team members were led by members of biodiversity conservation foundation (BCF), Trichy.

The sanctuary, spread across 21.47 sq km, is a unique blend of terrestrial, mangrove and sea shore ecosystem. While the sanctuary is known for its black buck population, estimating its numbers is crucial for the sanctuary managers to plan future conservation.

The main objective of the census was to enumerate quantitative population of large mammals and population diversity of mammalian species. The census will help the sanctuary managers know whether the habitant improvement activities are having a positive impact on the wildlife population. “For instance, prosopis juliflora – the exotic weed was removed from the area during the past 5-6 years improving the growth of grass lands. Whether it has impacted the population of black bucks and spotted deer has to be seen in the outcome of the census,” said S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forests, Thanjavur circle.

“While we have carried corrective measures, we cannot expect phenomenal increase in the population within a year as it is a continuous process. But we need to create conducive atmosphere in the sanctuary. The outcome of the census will help us plan our activities,” he said.

At present, there are 600-800 black bucks in the sanctuary. About 25 of them were trapped in the storm in 2018 and swept away to Karaikal and were washed ashore in the subsequent days, said the forest officials.

“Large-scale deaths were reported in the sanctuary in November 2018 when Cyclone Gaja lashed the area,” said founder-director of Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (BCF) A Kumaraguru. The census also enumerates the population of other wildlife species such as mongoose, pangolin, spotted deer and jackal in the sanctuary, he said.

202,['16/03/2020'],"SCR to levy fee on cabs, autos at railway stations","Secunderabad: South Central Railway (SCR) introduced auto and cab fee, with separate earmarking of areas at railway stations. According to official circular by SCR, the move is to provide last-mile connectivity and to streamline existing parking system at station premises.

“There will be separate area for autos and taxis depending on the requirement. After identification, vehicles will be given an area to park. Autos will be charged Rs 3,500, and taxis Rs 5,400 on Hyderabad and Kacheguda (non-suburban railway stations grade-2 and 3) railway stations. An amount of Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,500 will be levied on auto and taxi drivers respectively on non-suburban grade four stations,” read the circular. It requires all cab drivers to apply with necessary documents. The system will not apply to Secunderabad station.

“The demarcation will allow separate space for autos and taxis which are now forced to park outside stations due to the space issue,” said a senior railway official.

The decision, however, has not gone down well with auto and taxi drivers.

“An fee will eat almost half our income,” Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary of the Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers told TOI. “There is already much less space on stations already crowded with cab-aggregator services’ vehicles and now even if we don’t park there due to unavailability of space, we will still have to pay the amount which is unfair,” he added.

Even as YSR Congress candidates demand that the state election commission (SEC) conduct polling as per the old schedule, candidates of opposition parties have raised calls for the SEC to cancel the nomination process and issue a fresh notification.

A total of 801 nominations were filed for the 64 wards in the city, of which 733 nominations were declared valid after scrutiny. However, the delay of the election process has raised concerns around campaigning. A majority of candidates who spent large sums on rallies are now worried about continuing their campaigns for six weeks.

“Postponement of elections is both an advantage and a disadvantage. We get ample time for the campaign. But it needs a lot of resources. It will get tough for us to convince the voters,” said Ganduri Mahesh, a TDP candidate from Satyanarayanapuram.

YSRC candidates, however, have alleged that the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is behind the deferral of the elections. “Postponement of elections will have a severe impact on us. Coronavirus is in the initial stage and completing local body elections at this time will help fight Covid-19. Elected representatives at the ward level will help identify positive cases,” said Kondayagunta Malleswari, a YSRC candidate.

Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz said the model code of conduct will be in force for another six weeks.

While the district rural police have tightened security at all the 14 check posts on Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, the city police have intensified vehicle checks in their jurisdiction by deploying more police personnel.

Earlier, the intelligence input from the state police has warned both the rural and city police of a possible infiltration of an armed group into the city or rural areas from the neighbouring state to assault select targets or make acts of sacrilege at religious places. There was also a direction to beef up security apparatus on border check posts by deploying a team of at least six cops each in two shifts at every check post.

Subsequently, the rural police have deployed a total of 168 cops at the 14 check posts and they would work in two shifts. They are armed with a short-range gun and long-range gun to face any eventuality.

The cops, who are posted at the check posts, would check the passengers in the public and private transport and their luggage. In addition, CCTV cameras would be fixed at all the check posts to monitor the incoming vehicles. An official said each check post would require a minimum of three CCTV cameras. “We have also been directed to conduct a meeting with omnibus, bus, taxi operators.”

District superintendent of police Sujit Kumar said he has been visiting at least four border check posts at Anaikatti, Walayar, Meenakshipuram and Gopalapuram daily to take stock of things. “Police protection has been given to the people, who are facing threat to life in both the (Hindu and Muslim) communities. In addition, we have deployed more than 1,100 cops in the rural areas for the night patrol. There will be police presence in every 5km radius.”

The officer said another 1,000 police personnel have been deployed in the city limits. “They would conduct vehicle checks at 40 places in the city.”

The city police would also sensitize the Government Railway Police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force (RPF) on ways to identify suspicious elements.

Before Yogi, Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta and Rajnath Singh of the BJP had served as UP chief ministers but none could complete three years. Before him, Kalyan Singh, in his second stint, had the longest tenure of a little over two years between 1997 and 1999.

Kalyan Singh had held the high office twice. He became the CM for the first time on June 24, 1991 and held the post till December 6, 1992 when Babri Masjid was brought down. His second stint was from September 21, 1997, to November 12, 1999. He was succeeded by Ram Prakash Gupta, who was held thfrom November 12, 1999, to October 28, 2000. Rajnath Singh occupied the office from October 28, 2000, to March 8, 2002.

Yogi’s completion of three years is seen by BJP leaders as a big accomplishment. ""Yogi Adityanath is one such leaders who broke many jinx, including the one going to Noida. He is also one of the few CMs who toured almost all the states and took various public centric steps,” said UP BJP spokesperson, Rakesh Tripathi.

BJP leaders said that Yogi has been carrying the image of a clean administrator whose tenure remain unblemished off corruption. “His government has worked for all section of society including farmers, youth and underprivileged,” said a senior BJP leader. The BJP leader said that the Yogi’s popularity was not only restricted to UP but also in other states where he was roped in as star campaigner during assembly elections.

The opposition, however, rubbished BJP’s claim about Yogi’s achievement as CM. “The three year rule has been full of law and order crisis. Innocent were shot down at a drop of hat. Farmers are not getting their due and youth are jobless,” said SP legislator Udaibir Singh, who is considered close to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav .

The Mayawati-led BSP also called Yogi’s tenure a failure. “The state government is only limited to set targets but not achieving them,” said a senior BSP leader.

UP Congress committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said that the party would release a booklet detailing about failure of the ruling BJP government on March 19.

Summer has already set in in the city and daytime temperatures are steadily rising.

With elections being deferred for at least six weeks, it will be early May—the peak of summer—before polls are held. The revised schedule will be released based on the severity of the coronavirus crisis, however, candidates fear that maintaining the momentum of campaigning will be difficult with the progress of summer.

Historically, May has been the hottest month in the state and temperatures are likely to go above 40 degree Celsius from April. Further, campaigning in summer is expected to involve large expenses for candidates, even with restrictions on election expenditure, besides posing a physical challenge.

Candidates contesting in MPTC, ZPTC and panchayat elections are more worried than the urban contestants. “With the fight between political parties is so intense in the villages and margins between winning and losing being very narrow it would be very hard for us to sustain the momentum for six weeks. Keeping the flock together for such a long period would be a costly affair as it is an undisputed fact that there will be a lot of money influence in the elections,” said a contestant for an MPTC seat in Krishna district.

In his first visit to the city after becoming the state BJP chief, Murugan said while two men have been arrested for attacking a Hindu Munnani functionary a few days ago, police were yet to nab another duo who assaulted Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionary Suryaprakash.

“All the extremist elements should be arrested and put behind bars to restore peace and harmony in the city,” he told reporters. The BJP leader also urged police not to show any leniency towards anti-social elements since such attacks were continuing without an end.

Murugan, who was given a warm welcome by the BJP cadres at the city airport, said he would strive hard for the party’s growth in Tamil Nadu. “We have had MLAs, MPs as well as union ministers from Tamil Nadu in the past. We would work towards increasing the numbers of such public representatives.”

Vowing to intensify the efforts to enhance the party’s presence in Tamil Nadu, he said the BJP would embrace people from all sections of the society, irrespective of caste or religion.

AJMER: In the wake of the coronavirus, the district administration has directed Brahma Temple Trust and Dargah Committee to arrange continuous cleaning of Brahma Temple in Pushkar and the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. They were also asked to use sanitisers to clean walls and doors of both the religious places.

District collector Vishwa Mohan Sharma asked subdivisional officer of Pushkar to manage cleanliness on religious places and also make devotees aware about cleanliness and precaution against this virus.

The administration also asked Ajmer Municipal Corporation to keep the adjoining residential areas of dargah clean. This region is congested and hundreds of devotees throng the area right through the day. AMC chief Chinmayee Gopal formed a task force to keep the region clean. She also directed the cleaning staff to spread awareness among local residents.

Sources said though the number of devotees coming to Pushkar and dargah declined on Sunday, there were still hundreds of people coming there.

The district administration has also launched a 24-hour control room and anyone can provide information about the infection so officials can send a rescue team.

The district collector also directed shutting down of anganwadis till March 31. He directed anganwadi officials to distribute food to children at their homes.

235,['16/03/2020'],"Lucknow: Chandrashekhar Azad launches Dalit party, double whammy for BSP","Chandrashekhar Azad addresses during the launch of his political party

LUCKNOW: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad launched his political outfit, Azad Samaj Party, on Sunday on the birth anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram. Before launching his party at Safai village in Noida, the 37-year-old Dalit leader made Kanshi Ram's photograph his Twitter profile picture and launched the party flag — a white band between two blue strips with Azad Samaj Party inscribed in middle. He said the Bhim Army will run parallel to the party and continue to fight for Dalit rights and enroll members.

And for BSP, which took forward the Kanshi Ram’s legacy, the birth anniversary of its founding president could not have come at worse time, not just because of exodus of its foot soldiers, but also the heralding of Azad’s Dalit party, which threatens to nibble into its vote-bank.

On Sunday, a battery of Kanshi Ram loyalists who were associated with him since the days of DS4 (Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Sangthan) and nursed BSP with “blood and sweat” joined Samajwadi Party . “I sacrificed my youth to build BSP and unite the Bahujan Samaj . Then we were thrown out of the party,” said Tilak Chand Ahirwar , former BSP MLC, who said he joined the party in 1984 on Kanshi Ram’s clarion call to uplift Dalits in Bundelkhand.

Former BSP MP from Azamgarh Balihari Babu was equally emotional. While fondly recalling Kanshi Ram, he avoided an attack on Behanji even though he was sacked from BSP along with Ahirwar. “We don’t know what is our crime,” he said. This was the refrain of all those who joined SP under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav .

Prominent among those who had quit BSP included Ghoora Ram, Indrajit Saroj , both former ministers, and former MP Ram Prasad Chaudhary. Former IAS officer and once a BSP loyalist, Kunwar Fateh Bahadur , too had rebelled against the “Brahminisation” of BSP by Mayawati. The cadre is watching helplessly the exit of commanders and the fading away of Kanshi Ram’s mission of socio-economic uplift of Dalits, he said.

SP president Akhilesh Yadav is happy poaching on Mayawati’s camp even as he played out a film on the life and times of Dalit icons at the party national executive. With an eye on expanding SP’s social base beyond the Muslim-Yadav arc, Akhilesh Yadav had invited the once influential faces of BSP — Ghooram Ram (Jatav), Indrajit Saroj (Pasi) and Ram Prasad Chaudhary (Kurmi) — as special guests to the party national executive.

The decision of the SEC to also temporarily relieve and suspend some poll officials, including police personnel, most of who are from the four Rayalaseema districts, has cheered opposition parties that have alleged that the YSRC has instigated violence during the poll season.

Addressing the media in Tirupati on Sunday, former TDP legislator M Sugunamma hailed the intervention of the SEC. “The ruling party had bulldozed all the guidelines with only one intention which was to win unanimously as many wards as possible. If the state election commission had not intervened, there was no one to stop the ruling party leaders, who threatened and kidnapped many opposition party candidates to stop them from filing nominations,” she said.

“Is it fair for the ruling party to obstruct candidates from opposition parties from filing their nominations? With the help of police support, false cases were also being slapped against TDP candidates,” said Sugunamma.

Data released by the district administration show that of the 65 ZPTC seats and 858 MPTC seats in Chittoor district, single nominations by the YSRC have been filed in 29 ZPTCs and 323 MPTCs, while in 19 MPTC seats, only the TDP has filed nominations.

In a press conference, Chandragiri MLA Dr Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy said he had advised followers and party activists contesting the elections to maintain peace until the election process is restored.

237,['16/03/2020'],"New orders for exporters drying up, may lead to job losses","Jaipur: Garment and handicraft buyers from European countries have started putting on hold the orders they had placed with exporters in Rajasthan. Similarly, buying agents, who act as middlemen between buyers and suppliers, have also started asking them to extend the payment cycle from 30 days to 90 days, exporters here said.

With finished goods starting to pile up at the factory-end and many manufacturers looking to reduce their capacity utilisation, pressure is mounting to undertake cost-cutting measures which may lead to employee layoffs.

Many exporters said new orders are drying up to the extent of 50%, while existing supply contracts are increasingly getting frozen. “We are actually clueless as to what is going to happen. This is for the first time we are facing such a dramatic disruption to our businesses,” said Dileep Baid, a leading handicraft exporter in Jaipur.

Baid said handicrafts is a manpower intensive business and if the situation does not show signs of improvement within a month, the inevitable will happen. “The industry will have to scale down operations and that would impact large number of jobs,” added Baid.

The garments exports industry is also in a similar predicament. Buying agents have already asked for rescheduling the payment period to 90 days from the general 30 days.

“Buyers are now telling us to put the orders on hold and such requests are increasing by the day after the lockdown in many European countries. Buying agents and buyers are now telling us to extend the payment period to 75-90 days,” said Aseem Singla, General Secretary of Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan ( GEAR).

But Baid said the bigger risk was that the default of buying companies in the absence of business. “If the companies in Europe or other parts of the globe go bust in the absence of demand, they would lose the money pending with them,” said Baid.

Already many handicraft exporters are suffering because of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Pier 1 imports and if this happens because of corona contagion, they would lose all the money.

238,['16/03/2020'],Election process in Macherla may come under SEC scanner,"Guntur: The nomination process for elections to local bodies in Macherla assembly constituency has stoked a controversy as single nominations have been received for almost all posts, including MPTC, ZPTC and ward councilors in Macherla municipality.

All posts will be secured uncontested by YSRC candidates.

In Macherla, the nomination process has been a one-sided affair with candidates of opposition parties who filed their papers for MPTC elections in some villages withdrawing their nominations by Saturday, the last day for withdrawals.

The State Election Commission (SEC) has placed a caveat on seats that will be secured uncontested, declaring that all those elected unopposed will take charge along with other elected representatives, but the SEC will review the conditions that led to their being elected unanimously.

The SEC’s decision, experts said, might lead to countermand of the elections. “The SEC might go for fresh elections if someone approaches it with the complaints that they have been restrained from filing the nominations or threatened to withdraw the papers,” said a senior official.

Data made public by the SEC show that 14 MPTCs each in Rentachintala, Macherla, Karampudi and Veldurthi mandals in Macherla assembly constituency have a single candidate contesting the polls. In Durgi mandal, candidates in 13 of 14 MPTCs will be elected unopposed.

The YSRC will corner 69 of the 70 MPTC seats in Macherla constituency as no other candidate is in the fray. Similarly, elections to the five ZPTC seats will be uncontested as the TDP has not fielded any candidate.

Elections to the 31 wards in Macherla municipality will be uncontested as well, with single candidates contesting in all 31 wards in the town. The TDP has been faced with a lack of leadership in the constituency for over two decades.

Chief engineer RN Tripathi said the green crematorium system would comprise a burning chamber equipped with a body tray, two exhaust pipes or chimneys and a water tank to “neutralise” the fumes.“The body will be placed in the drawer-like pyre and covered with wood. It will be lit and then pushed into the chamber, which will be then closed. The toxic, black smoke will be passed through the first chimney and a water tank before being released as white smoke through the second chimney,” Tripathi explained.The ‘greenatorium’ has several advantages over a traditional pyre. One, it will require only 75kg of wood instead of around 350kg used in last rites. Two, the cost of burning a body will come down to Rs 300-500 against Rs 4,000-plus. Three, the system can bring down air pollution levels, besides aiding conservation of trees.The LMC has allocated a budget of Rs 1.35 crore from the 14th Finance Commission for these eco-friendly crematoriums in Kudiya Ghat, Baikunth Dham in Gomtinagar and Alambagh. A Gorakhpur-based private company has been roped in and installation work is expected to begin from the first week of April.Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said Lucknow would be the first city in UP to boast green crematoriums. “The ‘greenatoriums’ will offer people the opportunity to light a traditional wood pyre without damaging air quality,” she added.Taking its environment concerns farther, the LMC will set up smart dustbins in 12 prominent areas of the city. Each sensor-equipped bin will send an alert to the command centre as soon as it reaches capacity. A budget of Rs 1 crore has been set aside for this project.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74644174,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-650045,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/green-adieu-to-pyres-city-to-get-three-eco-friendly-crematoriums/articleshow/74643554.cms

LUCKNOW: Questioning the government’s haste in promulgation of UP Recovery of Public and Private Property Ordinance, 2020, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the move is an admission that its act of putting up hoardings of anti-CAA protesters was unlawful.

“Countering a court order in this manner amounts to grave contempt of the court. Those who are enacting draconian laws today should note that the same laws may also apply on them as they have been involved in rioting and arson in the past,” Yadav told reporters at party headquarters.

“In fact, the SP government committed a blunder by not recovering compensation from rioters in the BJP. Yogi Adityanath is the only chief minister in the country to have withdrawn criminal cases against himself,” he said.

On his recent telephonic conversation with the CM, Yadav said: “I objected to the manner in which the BJP government is implicating senior SP leader Mohammed Azam Khan in fabricated cases.”

“I have directed my rank and file not to create disturbance in the Prime Minister’s public meetings but my rallies should also not be disrupted by BJP workers,” he said.

On the completion of three years of the Yogi Adityanath government, the SP chief said the BJP government had only changed the names of cities and SP’s development projects.

“If the BJP government really wanted to glorify former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was a great statesman, it should have set up a university in his memory on the lines of Cambridge or Harvard instead of renaming the international stadium built by SP government,” he said.

Yadav said he would see if the CM was able to fulfil his commitment of dedicating Purvanchal Expressway to the people by Diwali. “It will not be completed by then. It will be completed only when we will come to power and celebrate Diwali in 2022,” he said.

Meanwhile, senior leaders from various political parties including ex-MP Balihari Babu, Dilip Chand Ahirwar of BSP and former BJP MLA Indrapal Pal joined the SP on Sunday.

Analysis of the incubators also suggested that over 60% of the Indian setups were housed within educational institutes. The rest were supported by businesses, industry bodies, or ministries.“Gujarat followed a similar model. The majority of universities/institutes have an incubation centre, most affiliated to government schemes,” said Vohra. “Many of them are channelling the state government’s support such as the availability of Rs 10 lakh for product development and an equal amount for marketing products.” Vohra went on to say: “Our estimates tell us that there may be over 180-200 startups that received such support. In terms of sectors, we see startups in pharma, industrial manufacturing, education and energy sectors among others supported by these centres.”Sharma said there is value in enabling potential entrepreneurs get a closer brush with the process of setting up and running a business — without the glamour or heroism attached to it.“We find initiatives like SSIP hold immense promise as they enable students/alumni experiment, build and fail fast while pursuing their degree/course,” she said.Of the 284 incubators covered in the study, 90% were set up after 2000 and 70% of them were set up between 2008 and 2018. Government and sectoral push along with favourable business climate could be the possible reason for the spike, said researchers.Business advice, connection with mentors, domain experts and assistance with fund-raising were found to be the most common services whereas assistance with branding and support with physical infrastructure were the least common. The study found wide disparity between incubators in terms of activities, policies and support.What startups wantThe researchers interviewed startup founders to understand their needs in the incubator ecosystem. Some of the needs included connecting with specialized mentors and subject experts, help in connecting to customers and vendors, and advice on branding and brand building and better processes to remain engaged. The study also found the presence of incubators lopsided and recommended more in northeast, east and central parts of India.Need for better assessment‘Given the diversity among incubators, relevant performance metrics need to be devised to measure the performance robustly by incubators, policy designers, and researchers of incubators. New ones can be assessed on startups they are able to attract whereas mature ones may be evaluated on the success of supported startups as well as the ability to generate resources and become sustainable, the study said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/study-gujarat-among-indias-startup-incubator-champions/articleshow/74643142.cms

As commuters stop for a while to appreciate the work, the residents are filled with happiness. For, the paintings have not only beautified the buildings, but also have boosted their spirits. The murals are done by St+art India Foundation.

“The painting of elephants on the walls of my block is very attractive and I really like it. I have been telling about the murals to the friends ever since they started painting. But they think I am just lying about it. May be, I should bring them to my place one day to make them believe it,” said a 10-year-old resident of the housing unit, Devendran. He said despite several requests, none of his friends had visited him at his house.

Pointing out that the residents of the housing unit generally have a low self-esteem, Rishwana, a college student, said, “We always feel that outsiders are looking down on us and that we are being judged by our living environment, which we think is substandard. The housing unit is not only surrounded by piles of garbage but also filled with foul smell. Now, the paintings have not only beautified the housing unit but also have boosted our self-esteem. We feel proud every time the public look up at the murals.”

Another resident Deepa Ramesh Kumar said people from other parts of the city have been flocking to their area just to appreciate the work. “Even those who were not aware of the housing unit earlier have been coming to our place to take photos. There is also a perceptible change among the residents, who were earlier hesitant to call it their home. Today, they are going around telling about the paintings at the housing unit. However, we could continue to be proud only if we keep the murals and surroundings clean.”

After Kannagi Nagar in Chennai, it’s the second destination in the state to be transformed into an art district by the St+art India foundation. About a year ago, they had painted the walls of government buildings, including that of Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, and created an art trail in the city.

“We had two reasons for selecting the place. First, the buildings have huge beautiful walls and second, the place was neglected. With the murals in place, public would start keeping the place clean and stop littering around. The public attention in turn would pave way for development,” said Ritesh Sharma, project manager of the foundation.

He said they would visit the place again next year to paint the remaining walls. As of now, they have completed three murals and the remaining one is expected to be completed in another week.

The credit for beautifying the walls goes to artists Amitabh Kumar, Avinash Kumar, Jeeva, Munir and Chifumi. The project is sponsored by Asian Paints and is supported by the city corporation.

Speaking to the media here on Sunday, former minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao criticised the SEC for not cancelling the elections to seats where candidates have been nominated uncontested. This despite admitting to a large-scale violation taking place during the filing of nominations. He said the SEC should evaluate the entire process and issue fresh notification for the local body elections.

Earlier in the day, SEC confirmed that all those who were deemed to be elected unanimously would be sworn in along with the other elected representatives after the completion of the election.

The SEC was also quick to clarify that the elections had only been deferred and not cancelled. “We have neither suspended nor cancelled the elections. The process completed till now holds good. There is no change to it. The election of all the candidates who are bound to be declared winner from uncontested seats are also valid,” said state election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar.

However, TDP leaders flayed the move stating that the SEC’s decision to look into the conditions, which led to candidates being selected uncontested, would be defeated if the elections were to go through.

TDP MLC P Ashok Babu said they would approach the high court if the elections were to go through with the current set of nominations. Ashok Babu accused the SEC of failing to take proper action despite complaints by candidates.

TDP MLC Deepak Reddy demanded that SEC should immediately suspend the entire process carried out till now and go for fresh elections. “The process should begin afresh with issuance of fresh notification. We will not accept the SEC’s decision to merely defer the elections,” said Deepak Reddy.

He alleged that not even a single nomination was filed in Pulivendula constituency, the home town of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy.

He also alleged that the YSR Congress leaders in Macherla, Dhone, Punganur and other areas have threatened rival candidates and forced them to stay out of the race or withdraw their nomination papers.

JAIPUR: After collectors of Jaipur and Kota urged department of local self government (LSG) to reschedule and postpone the elections to the six newly-formed municipal corporations in the wake of coronavirus, the department on Sunday wrote to the state election commission (SEC) requesting it to consider the same. Hence, the commission, instead of taking a decision on deferring the elections, will urge the state government to move the High Court and get the elections postponed, according to sources.

Rajasthan High Court had directed the state government to complete the elections to the municipal corporations in the state by April 18.

Jaipur collector Joga Ram and Kota collector Om Prakash Kasara on Saturday wrote to secretary local self government department (LSG) Bhawani Singh Detha urging him to postpone elections scheduled for April 5. The elected ward members will elect the mayors on April 16. ACS (health) Rohit Singh had also written to state election commission to postpone the polls.

Meanwhile, minister of state for women and child development (independent charge) Mamta Bhupesh issued directions to keep all Anganwadi centres and mini Anganwadi centres closed till March 31, as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus. The Rajasthan government decided on Friday to close schools, colleges, coaching centres, gymnasium, movie theatres and theatre halls till March 30.

246,['16/03/2020'],AMC lets utility companies’ rents sink,"Ahmedabad: Just how much do utility companies — gas, telephone, optical fibre cable, and electricity — owe the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) as rent after digging our roads to lay their service lines?Interestingly, the AMC is yet to evaluate this amount. The AMC is being directed by the state government since 2010 to compulsorily collect an annual rent.Standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt had admitted in a press briefing on Thursday that the tax and estate departments are yet to provide an estimated sum. Today, about 13,000km of utility lines of various companies criss-cross Ahmedabad’s roads, which are often dug for repairing utility lines.The state urban development department had asked the AMC to not only claim the restoration charge from these companies — which is the cost of repairing the dug-up portions of roads — but also claim an annual rent. Today, this rent runs into crores. “Close to 90% of the companies do not pay this annual rent, leading to a huge loss to the municipal corporation,” said a senior AMC official. “Except for one type of utility company, all are supposed to pay a rent to the civic body.”TOI has a copy of the state government’s direction dated 25 April 2008. Under this, the AMC had to increase rent and restoration charge at a rate of 10% each year. The restoration charge and the rent depended on the types of roads: asphalt, WBM, earth road, footpaths, CC road, internal roads, and road junctions. Take for instance the case of asphalt road. The AMC in 2010 was to charge Rs 781 for restoration for every metre while the rent was Rs 22 per metre for regular roads and Rs 55 per metre for crossings.“Neither the estate department nor the tax department has been able to extract rent out of the companies,” the official said. “Each time the issue is raised in our board meetings, there is political pressure not to levy the charges. This is a huge loss for the municipal corporation.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-lets-utility-companies-rents-sink/articleshow/74643163.cms

However, the invocation of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, has put the health department in a better position to tackle the situation.Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC) dean Dr S M Bandekar said that there are 3,500 beds in the private hospitals in the state and if need arises those can used. “All patients don’t have to be in GMC. If the need arises, private beds can be used. The invocation of the Epidemic Diseases Act allows us to do this,” he said.GMC has 30-beds in ward no. 113, which is an isolation facility. The hospital has six ventilators and is likely to receive 12 more this week. Bandekar said that “not all cases of Covid-19 need to be put on ventilator”.With Covid-19, the risk of patients developing acute respiratory problem remains high. Goa has over 90,000 senior citizens, this segment is vulnerable to contracting the disease as is observed in other countries that have reported a spurt in Covid-19 cases.State government-run facilities itself may have few ventilators, but the Epidemic Diseases Act allows the state to utilise the facilities available with the private healthcare to combat the disease, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said. With this, there is lesser possibility that the healthcare of senior citizens may be compromised if there are Covid-19 cases, he said.The Goa Epidemic Diseases, Covid 19 Regulations, 2020, mandates that all hospitals — government and private —have flu corners. The areas for screening of suspected cases of Covid-19 should be away from common out-patient departments (OPD).Even before the act was invoked, the state had made efforts to rope in private healthcare facilities. A targeted workshop on Covid-19 was recently conducted for Indian Medical Association (IMA) members of Goa branch. The association has over 1,400 members.Indian Medical Association (IMA) Goa branch president Dr S Samuel Arawattigi said they are committed to help the government.Betodkar said they are putting in all efforts, but the next two months will be crucial. “People should avoid travel for the next two months,” he said.He said that India cannot be complacent even if there is a decline in cases during next few days.

Doctors from Jodhpur Medical College were deployed at the civil airport here when the passengers were taken to the wellness centre of army’s military station in four buses.

Two flights carried 118 passengers each, out of which 139 were students and 97 pilgrims. Airports Authority of India director B S Meena, district collector Namit Mehta, SP Kiran Kung and other officers were present along with the doctors at the airport.

One more flight carrying Indians airlifted from Iran is expected to arrive at Jaisalmer on Monday.

Meanwhile, two of the 236 Indians were found to be suffering from cough and cold. They have been admitted to the Airforce Hospital and their samples will be sent to check for the virus. Both are under medical observation.

Meena said the Indians arrived in Delhi from Iran in two flights at 3am, and after immigration and customs clearance, they reached Jaisalmer at 7.30am and at 8am. Meena added that the SOP was made in such a way that they did not need to come to the main terminal and were screened at the apron and were made to sit directly in the bus and were sent to military station.

District collector Namit Mehta said that these Indians were tested coronavirus-negative and there is no need to be scared and that they are kept at the military station as a routine medical process. The district administration and the army have been coordinating in this regard.

SP Kiran Kung said that security arrangements were made so that no nuisance takes place and the buses were sent to the military station under security cover. World-class arrangements have been made at the centre in military station.

Army official said, “As a precautionary measure, these evacuated persons are to be kept under quarantine for a period of fourteen days. The Indian Army has set up a wellness centre at various locations to provide a credible response to Covid-19.”

Defence spokesman said, “The wellness centre at Jaisalmer is fully equipped to help the Indian citizens undertake the mandatory quarantine period under the supervision of skilled medical authorities. Soldiers have volunteered to provide care and support to our countrymen returning from overseas.” The source added, “The wellness centre is working in total synergy with the civil administration, airport authorities and Airforce, to ensure proper care is provided to all evacuated citizens.

TIRUPATI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will lay the foundation stone for a temple of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ) at Chennai on April 9.

TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy, executive officer (EO) Anil Kumar Singhal and special invitee to TTD trust board J Sekhar Reddy met Palaniswami in Chennai on Sunday and requested the chief minister to lay the foundation stone for the new temple.

This will be the second TTD temple in Chennai to be dedicated to Goddess Padmavathi, the consort of Lord Venkateswara. TTD had established a temple and information centre at T Nagar in Chennai several years ago.

Speaking to reporters after meeting the chief minister, YV Subba Reddy said the TTD trust board had resolved to construct Sri Padmavathi Ammavari temple in Chennai based on requests from devotees in the city.

“During our meeting with chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, we requested him to speed up the process of handing over the 11 acres of land which the TTD has identified as suitable for the construction of the TTD temple located on the OMR-ECR road in Chennai. The chief minister responded favourably and has consented to extend all support needed to speed up the process. CM has also consented to take part in the ground breaking ceremony of the new temple scheduled on April 9,” added the TTD chairman.

The TTD chairman also requested the chief minister to grant tax exemptions for construction activities by the TTD in Tamil Nadu.

“TTD is a religious and charitable institution performing dharmic activities as per the Andhra Pradesh Endowments Act. Hence we requested the TN CM to grant tax exemptions to TTD, to which he agreed,” said Subba Reddy.

257,['16/03/2020'],Chennai metro rail phase 2 may offer ‘Monroe’ moments,"Representative image

CHENNAI: You could find yourself having a Marilyn Monroe moment in the underground metro stations that are to be built in phase-2 as ventilation shafts in the premises could blow up your skirts or dhotis.

CMRL will be building ventilation shafts closer to the ground level, instead of tall concrete structures like those in phase-1 stations. For commuters and pedestrians, these road level shafts could be good selfie spots. For CMRL, building smaller shafts is one of the design changes to be introduced in phase-2 stations to save space and reduce construction cost and time. It means much of the structures that are jutting out of the phase-1 underground stations will disappear in phase-2.

A metro rail official said the shafts may either be louver grates made of iron grills or as a slightly raised platform covered with a glass panel with provisions given on the sides for air circulation. Since it will be on the street level, walkers or vehicles could pass over it.

“We have already attempted one at Central Metro on top of which we have laid a glass panel. Though people can walk on top of it, we do not allow that right now as passengers walking under the glass pane could see those walking above and we do not want to cause any inconvenience,” a metro rail official said. “But the tall shafts will not be there in phase-2 stations,” the official added.

In phase-1 underground stations, CMRL has built tall concrete structures with louver type grill on all four sides for ventilation. These structures are 14m tall and stations have exhaust fans for air circulation.

Metro rail and subway networks in Seoul, Los Angeles and London have ventilation shafts on the footpath that blow out air every time a train passes by.

In addition to the changes planned for design of the shaft, there will be fewer shafts for each station. Compared to eight ventilation shafts for each station in phase-1, there will be only three shafts linking the tunnels and the two levels of the station in phase-2.

In phase-1, shafts are built on either side of an underground station closer to large exhaust fans to allow air circulation in the tunnels, platform and concourse levels of the stations and the mechanical equipment room of the stations. An emergency shaft also has been built with doors in the tunnels between Central Metro and Government Estate station as the stations are nearly 2km away instead of the less than 1km distance at which other stations are built. “But these shafts take up about 20sqm. Now it will take up very little space,” an official said.

Health authorities said that anyone returning from China, South Korea, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Iran, irrespective of their symptoms can end up spending 14 days in isolation.

Passengers have been categorised into A, B and C categories depending on their risk levels.

Asymptomatic passengers coming from any coronavirus-affected country, but having co-morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension fall in category ‘B’ (moderate risk), while asymptomatic passengers without any health condition fall in category ‘C’ (low risk).

So far, category ‘A’ (high risk) passengers with symptoms and those under category ‘B’ have been place under hospital isolation, while category ‘C’ passengers have been advised self-isolation at home.

“Many passengers do not follow our guidelines and this increases the risk of spreading the virus. Instead, we want to quarantine all of them at hospitals,” said a senior official from the state health department.

Health department officials, on Sunday, discussed how to handle unruly passengers who refuse to cooperate with health authorities with top police officials. “The modalities and the role of the police was discussed. It is important to prevent the spread of Covid-19 before it goes out of hand,” said an official on conditions of anonymity.

It took more than six hours for Chandru to come up with a sculpture of the woman, covering his eyes with a thick cotton cloth. “We think ‘visual’ means only those that can be seen through our eyes. Our five senses have got a sense of visualisation. Even a touch can give us a visual feeling. A blind person who feels the warmth of a touch can visualise that touch. This is what I was trying to explore while creating the sculpture blindfolded,” said Chandru, who has made many sculptures, including the one of revolutionary communist leader Vladimir Lenin in Tirunelveli.

“When we hear ‘cow’, we get the image of a cow in our mind. Similarly, on feeling warmth, one can visualise something that can be corelated with that feeling,” he said. “When I worked blindfolded, I touched upon the subject and I visualised something I could correlate to my touch. By the time I opened my eyes, I had fully transferred that feeling into sculpting.”

“We shot this work for a whole day. Sir (Chandru) worked for almost six hours with three small breaks. We will exhibit it in the art exhibitions soon,” said Narendran, a city-based artist. “We know what is around our house even in darkness. Whatever place is very much familiar to one, can be visualised even when blindfolded. This is the thought that sparked the idea. I am also influenced by Derrida, who interpreted the connection between blindness and art,” he said.

260,['16/03/2020'],26 more Gujarat MLAs arrive in Jaipur,"JAIPUR: With four Congress MLAs tendering their resignations in Gujarat, the party shifted a batch of 26 more MLAs to Jaipur on Sunday fearing horse-trading by the ruling BJP ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in the state.

A batch of 15 Congress MLAs from Gujarat arrived in Jaipur by a flight on Saturday night. They were being lodged at Shiv Vilas resort on Jaipur-Delhi Road. According to Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, “With around 26 MLAs having arrived on Sunday, the total number of MLAs would be 41.”

Of the total, 19 MLAs have come from Ahmedabad, 4 from Surat and 3 from Delhi. Earlier, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president Amit Chavda said, ""Around 20 MLAs will be shifting to Jaipur today. MLAs will be reaching Jaipur from different directions including Ahmedabad, Surat and New Delhi. Some of the MLAs will stay back as the assembly session is going on here.""

While the BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramila Bara and Narhari Amin for RS election in the state, Congress party has fielded senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki. With 103 MLAs in the state assembly, the ruling BJP can win only two seats unless it manages cross-voting from the opposition camp. The strength of the Congress party in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly has reduced to 69 from 73.

Congress, which was caught off guard after a section of MLAs loyal to former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia sending their resignations to the speaker putting the Kamal Nath government on the brink of collapse, acted fast on Gujarat.

Hyderabad: From damp walls to garbage bins overflowing with putrid matter left in the corridors, state-run hospitals in the city seems to have turned into a nightmare for both patients and doctors.

While hygiene is maintained in isolation wards set up to quarantine suspected Covid-19 cases, patients point out that other wards in government hospitals are in a bad shape.

The Gandhi Medical College, where the first Covid-19 isolation ward was set up, is perhaps the worst in terms of hygiene and sanitation. Patient and doctors complain of overflowing bins, flooded washrooms, tobacco-stained walls and a nauseating stench everywhere.

“Unless an official is scheduled to visit or there is constant media presence, the sanitation staff do not clean the premises or dispose medical waste regularly. The garbage bins are left open in the corridors,” said Dr Lohit Reddy, president of Junior Doctors Association (JUDA), Gandhi hospital.

Osmania General Hospital paints a similar picture. “You cannot walk through the hospital corridor without feeling nauseous. The toilets are also in a bad shape. There is no proper water supply and the taps have been stolen,” said Dr Srinivas, a junior doctor at the hospital.

The chief justice of Telangana HC, while hearing a plea on the hygiene and structural stability of OGH recently, had asked the director of the health department if he would admit his kin in the hospital

Shenaz Sultana, a 31-year-old patient at Gandhi Medical College, said, “I went to Gandhi a couple of days ago for an x-ray. I could not even lean on a wall in the out-patient ward because of all the tobacco stains. Every time I go there, I am scared of getting an infection.”

While the superintendent of Gandhi Medical College was unavailable for comment, OGH superintendent Dr B Nagender said, “I went for rounds this afternoon and got the corridors and other areas cleaned. Timely cleaning is being done but since it is an old building there are a few issues. It is sometimes not possible to meet all expectations.”

BENGALURU: With people from the neighbourhood dumping garbage next to their house, a gynaecologist’s family from south Bengaluru hit upon a novel idea to fight the menace.

They cleaned up the place and kept a few idols of gods at the spot. But realised that the fear of gods may not deter the littering neighbours, they installed a public address system and announced that those dirtying the place would be fined Rs 5,000.

On Friday, gynaecologist Dr Kavitha Rani ’s family residing near 5th Main of Kempegowda Nagar, off Bull Temple Road, got a truckload of muck dumped next to their compound wall cleared. The same day they also kept some idols at the spot.

Fine threat

Soon after, Mahadevamma, who works as a cook with the family, was given a megaphone to make a public announcement that dumping garbage at the spot would attract Rs 5,000 penalty.

“I sit there for two hours in the morning and in the evening to make an announcement. That’s the time people walk in with dustbins and bags to throw garbage,” said Mahadevamma.

“We hope the menace stops with this,” said Dr Kavitha. She said the local BBMP health inspector helped them clear the black spot and was supportive of the initiative. The area has been wearing a clean look since Friday.

Urban development minister Madan Kaushik and mela officer Deepak Rawat met Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chairman Swami Narendra Giri to discuss Kumbh preparations. After the meeting, Giri said, “It has been decided that no permanent structure, including temples and ashrams on the mela land in Bairagi camp, will be demolished.”

He explained that encroachments here are only those structures which come in the way of “peshawai” or royal procession of akharas during Kumbh. “It also hinders movement of people on the roads. Only these should be removed,” he said.

On the pace of Kumbh work progress, he said, “The speed at which various projects are being executed is an indication that all preparations will be completed.”

Giri also said that permanent construction in akharas, which they have been demanding, will take time. As such, the administration should begin it as early as possible.

Meanwhile, Kaushik told TOI that he will talk to the chief minister about the matter and a decision will be taken soon. Steps will be taken to remove encroachments on all main roads, he said, adding that other encroachments will not be such a problem for the Kumbh as about 90 per cent of the mela will be held outside the city.

On encroachments at Bairagi camp, he said, “No action is being contemplated against concrete structures.”

266,['16/03/2020'],Bengaluru: Man held for forging Sudha Murty's signature,"Representative Image

BENGALURU: A 23-year-old mobile app developer was arrested on Saturday for allegedly forging the signature of Infosys Foundation chairperson Sudha Murty to rope in Telugu actor Vijay Devarakonda as an app’s ambassador.

The arrest of Laveti Sai Krishna alias Krishna ML, a resident of Nidamanuru, Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, comes a year after the case was registered. Jayanagar police registered a case against Krishna on February 26, 2019 based on a complaint filed by Lt Col (retd) M Ramesh, representative of Infosys Foundation. The complaint was filed after the forged letter didn’t reach Devarakonda and came back to Infosys Foundation instead.

App developer is a B.Pharma holder

“We conducted an investigation and traced the app designer. We caught him and based on information provided by him, we learnt that Krishna was the brain behind the forged signature,” a senior police officer said.

Krishna confessed that he developed a mobile app — ‘Offer nearby’ — and planned to launch it in a big way. He wanted Telugu actor Vijay Devarakonda to be the app’s brand ambassador and tried contacting him. Krishna, however, was unable to meet Vijay.

Krishna then thought he could easily reach the actor if he sent a recommendation letter in the name of Sudha Murty.

“He forged the letterhead of Infosys Foundation and Sudha Murty’s signature. We are verifying his antecedents to know if he committed any other offence earlier,” said Rohini Sepat-Katoch, DCP (south). Rohini said Krishna is a B.Pharma holder and worked with an advertisement firm. Later, he planned to develop an app that provides details of offers for retail customers. He floated Laveti Technologies, and with help from a friend, developed ‘Offer nearby’.

As per the complaint, Krishna created a fake letterhead in the name of Sudha Murty and wrote to Devarakonda, asking him to become the brand ambassador/ partner for his mobile app. Krishna sent it through SpeedPost mentioning the sender’s address as Infosys Foundation. Krishna’s game was up when the letter, which wasn’t delivered to Devarakonda, came back to Infosys Foundation.

267,['16/03/2020'],74% of Bengaluru’s major road network two-lane: Survey,"Representative Image

BENGALURU: With 80 lakh registered vehicles, Bengaluru’s roads are bursting at the seams. However, while the number of vehicles is growing, road capacity remains the same, causing severe traffic congestion.

A survey conducted by RITES, an engineering consultancy firm, covering 2,537km of the city’s major road network, revealed 1,871km (74%) has just two lanes.

It is also found that 320km (13%) are four-lane roads and 161km (6%) are three-lane ones. Only 186km (7%) have six or more lanes. These were the findings of a report prepared to identify Phase 3 corridors of Bengaluru Metro.

The report finds that only 5% of the surveyed road network has service lanes. Of the total kms surveyed, 2,420 doesn’t have service roads. “Almost all primary roads in the city don’t have a service road. This affects their capacity adversely due to intervention from activities on the roadside,” said a senior urban development official.

Though government agencies proposed several road-widening projects, most remain on paper due to the delay in acquiring land from private individuals. Experts say widening roads by acquiring expensive land parcels will be a threat to trees and only encourage more private vehicles.

Traffic expert MN Sreehari said: “Bengaluru isn’t a planned city. It was a sleepy village, which turned into a town and later into a city. Majority of the roads are narrow as buildings came up first. It’s now difficult to demolish buildings to widen roads. There should be a crackdown on illegal parking along both sides of roads.”

“Only 20% of the road network has four lanes or more. However, when effective width available is considered, the length is very less. Ring Road network is weak or discontinuous at many locations. Parking interference has been observed at many locations in almost all major roads, resulting to reduced effective width available for traffic movement...,” an urban development department report said.

It’s also found that about 43% of roads have Right of Way (RoW) up to 10m and 13% has RoW between 20m and 30m. “This indicates the limitations of widening in case of most roads,” said an official. This means majority of the road network doesn’t have footpaths. In fact, several road-widening projects taken up in the city have resulted in the reduction of pavements.

Road expert Advait Jani said adding more lanes or flyovers won’t solve snarls. “We have examples in Delhi and Mumbai. The more sustainable solution is to invest that money to encourage public transport, including cycling and walking.”

Average speed on the city road network is less than 20 kmph and below 11kmph during peak hours in core areas. Bengaluru’s road network (around 14,000km) consists of ring roads, major roads (arterial, sub-arterial) and residential streets. They are managed by agencies like BBMP, BDA, PWD and KRDCL.

Interacting with the media, he said the Indian government has responded quickly on the spread of the virus, and crucial announcements on precautionary measures may be announced on Monday. The minister said that currently, the ITBP is operating a quarantine camp, which can house about 500 people near Delhi. Two batches of people have been released from these camps so far.

He said the Union government has identified certain places for the camps and they are ready. They can accommodate any number of people as being directed by the health ministry, the nodal agency for coronavirus. The central health ministry is reviewing and directing state governments on the virus and measures to be taken, he said.

The minister expressed confidence that India is handling the situation well, and there is no need for any panic. “Our country shares a large border with China, the epicentre of coronavirus. Since we have been very alert, the presence of virus in the country is very less,” Reddy said.

Explaining the measures taken by the Centre, he said Indians stranded in Italy faced problems as the country was not allowing them to board the flights. “Even after the Indian government sent medical teams with equipment, they were not allowed to take the samples. The central government pursued the issue with embassy officials, and the samples have now been taken, and will be tested at NIV, Pune,” he said.

But blaming drivers will not improve the situation. Stakeholders such as the traffic police, civic body, private contractors who provide drivers and citizens each play an equal part to ensure public safety. While drivers need to be trained to follow traffic norms, motorists also need to adhere to the rules. The civic body must ensure that drivers are not overburdened and at the same time traffic police should penalise drivers who violate rules.

JAIPUR: The menace of low-floor buses continues unabated in the city, with untrained drivers turning the buses into killer machines. The traffic police claims it has been penalising the drivers of these buses to rein in the number of accidents in the city, but with regular instances of mishaps involving low-floor and government buses, the effect is yet to be visible.“In majority of the accidents, it is the mistake of the drivers. The bus drivers are locked in stiff competition to get maximum number of passengers on board. Therefore, they are in a rush to reach the bus stops before other buses and pack as many passengers as they can. Rash driving is one of the reasons for the accidents,” said a police official.Traffic department also claimed that they are focused on curbing rash driving and have penalised many such drivers. Rahul Prakash, DCP traffic told TOI, “The drivers of these buses are not trained properly and often drive without paying heed to other vehicles. They break signals and also block traffic. I have instructed the traffic personnel to catch all the bus drivers violating traffic norms as well as to penalise as many as possible. We have been running campaigns to curb such violations. However, at times it is also the fault of the two-wheeler riders who also do not have proper training and do not even wear helmets. Awareness has to be raised among the citizens as well.”Traffic department had also spoken to the department concerned to train these drivers but nothing materialised. According to the data available at the traffic department, last year, 213 roadways bus drivers were fined for violations between May 2019 to October 2019, and in the same period, 45 low-floor buses have also been penalised. Apart from this, action was also taken against 11,106 mini-bus drivers for breaking traffic rules.An official also pointed out another issue and claimed that in majority of the buses, there are no speed governors, which is compulsory in commercial buses, because of which the drivers tend to speeding.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74645838,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-205932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-blame-errant-bus-drivers-careless-citizens-for-mishaps/articleshow/74643235.cms

275,['16/03/2020'],3 years of BJP govt in U’khand: How did CM Rawat fare?,"Dehradun: The Trivendra Singh Rawat-led BJP government in Uttarakhand will mark its third anniversary this Wednesday. After having completed three years in office, has chief minister (CM) Rawat delivered on the expectations that voters had of his government that was elected with a massive mandate in 2017?

The jury seems divided on this point. Political analysts say that while efforts have been made by the state government, the results are yet to show comprehensively on the ground as many of the government’s projects are still to be implemented properly. Terming the tenure of Rawat as “a mixed bag”, Doon-based analyst Udit Ghildiyal said, “If we look at the positive side, Trivendra Rawat has been successful in ending corruption within the CM office and other ministries. Now, you will not find middlemen hanging around who will claim to get official work done through their contacts, which is a positive move.”

On the flip side, he added, not much work is visible on the ground to improve health and education facilities in the hills. “People in the hills continue to migrate. Primary schools are closing at a rapid pace and owing to poor health services, people of the hills still prefer to bring their patients to hospitals in Dehradun and Haldwani, adding to the pressure on these cities,” Ghildiyal said.

The chief minister while highlighting the work done by his government, had told TOI that to check migration and encourage reverse migration, the state government has opened 83 growth centres in the last three years. “We are also encouraging homestays. Presently, the state has 2,100 homestays. Also, the ‘13 districts-13 destinations’ project has been launched to boost tourism in the state.”

Coming to the health sector, the CM said that the number of doctors in the state has doubled since he assumed office. “There are 2,045 doctors in the state against a total of 2,735 posts. As many as 253 health sub-centres have been upgraded in rural areas and 1,030 more such facilities would be upgraded by the end of this year,” the CM told TOI adding that under the Atal Ayushman Yojana, which provides for a health cover of Rs 5 lakh, 1.3 lakh people have received free of cost treatment.

While terming the measures taken by the CM as “positive”, analysts say that much more focussed attention needs to be given to the pressing issues facing the state. Doon-based political watcher Jay Singh Rawat said, “A big issue facing the youth in the state today is unemployment. Though the CM recently said that new industrial units have provided employment to over 50,000 youth, the bitter reality remains that people of hills are not getting adequate employment opportunities.”

He added that the government’s priorities need to be right. “The CM had earlier said that his government will reduce dependence on liquor sales for getting revenue but the excise revenue target has been constantly increasing and has now shot up to over Rs 3,600 crore this year. So this comes as a surprise,” said Rawat.

Noted environmentalist Anil Joshi while evaluating the CM’s performance, said, “Uttarakhand was created with the view to develop the hills, but is has not happened in the past or the last three years. I find CM Rawat an honest and sincere person but his performance has been average till now. His announcement on Gairsain as summer capital of the state is a welcome move, but only if some development is carried out in the area. Otherwise, it will be seen as just a political declaration.”

This is the first in a series of articles on how the Uttarakhand government has performed in the past three years

276,['16/03/2020'],Decoding the pathway to a memorable victory in Kargil,"SECUNDERABAD: If there were those at the forefront in the Kargil war driving out the enemy, there was an unseen and unheard of army in the background facilitating every move and manoeuvre. The backroom boys had the task of deciphering secret messages that were being exchanged by the enemy and pass on the decoded messages that helped in making strategies for the war.After having served 37 years in the Indian Army and retired, Lt Col Parvathesam can only say how greatly satisfying his job was – of encoding and decoding messages as a cryptographer and then a cypher officer.Operating from Delhi during the Kargil war, the challenge was to do a quick job and clear a pile of messages. For demonstrating excellence in that, he was also given an award by the vice chief of the Indian Army.As an 11-year-old, Parvathesam, who hails from Polavaram in Andhra Pradesh, had heard of the Chinese aggression and war. He decided he would join the Indian Army. Having joined as a radio operator in the army in 1970, he served at the border area near Punjab and subsequently got selected as cryptographer. The job meant monitoring suspicious calls and decoding secret messages. “This was something I enjoyed doing,” he recollected.Thanks to a friend who guided him, he took the necessary examination, got selected as a cypher officer and was trained at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. His job took him to Bhutan where he spent two-and-half years with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) as a cypher officer as well as an administrator.The then-King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuk, even visited the headquarters where he was posted in Bhutan. “The stay in Bhutan was memorable. We used to build roads for the people, provide medical care and had good interaction with the locals,” he recollected.There is more than one reason for Parvathesam for choosing to join the army. Since his childhood he was a sportsperson and he knew being in the army would give him the opportunity to engage in sports and enjoy his spirit of adventure. “Someone also told me that it is only in the army that one does not demand, give or take bribes. For this reason too I was attracted,” he said. His father, a forest guard, was open to his son joining the army though it took some time for his mother to understand his decision.“I have had a fulfilling life in the army. That is the best place to be,” Lt Col Parvathesam, who retired in 2008 said. He may have retired from the army but continues his sports activities as he goes to RSI in Secunderabad from his home at Yapral to play. “Happy to be winning even now,” he says with a sense of pride.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74645788,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-464527,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/decoding-the-path-to-a-memorable-victory-in-kargil-war/articleshow/74643242.cms

ALWAR: In separate incidents, two farmers committed suicide in Bharatpur allegedly over damage to crops due to rains and hailstorms in the state recently. This is the third case of farmer suicide in the district in less than a week.

Suresh Kumar, 45, a resident of Uptela village in Udhyog Nagar police area, committed suicide on Saturday late night after returning home from his fields by hanging himself. His body was handed over to the family on Sunday. The deceased had less than half acre land on which he had cultivated mustard.

Minister of state for health, Subhash Garg, under whose constituency Uptela falls, said, “This is an unfortunate incident and the state government is constantly taking measures to support the farmers.

280,['16/03/2020'],How beats of parai turn sound of empowerment,"Parai artists of Tamilnadu Theological Seminary in Madurai

CHENNAI: It has been 15 years since former professor at Tamilnadu Theological Seminary (TTS), Rev. James Theophilus Appavoo’s demise. But to this date, ‘Parattai Annan’ or ‘brother with wild hair’ — as his loved ones knew him — remains immortalised by the humble drum he embraced and refashioned from a symbol of cultural subjugation to one of individuality, pride and emancipation.

Almost five decades since Appavoo set the precedent of using the parai as an instrument of glory and worship inside the church , its beats have changed worship traditions across Tamil Nadu’s Christian institutions. More importantly, it has endowed long-oppressed communities with the art forms of their birth and celebrated their roots.

""Appavoo, who then was also the minister at the church, used the parai in the middle of the liturgy, and sang every section — the greetings and praise, the Lord’s Prayer, the confession — in the Tamil folk songs he had composed,"" says Zoe C Sherinian, professor of ethnomusicology at University of Oklahoma. Twenty years ago, as a student of anthropology, Sherinian flew down and stayed back at TTS in Madurai to study this unique practice employing native folk music as a means of cultural and social empowerment of oppressed castes in rural Tamil Nadu. ""Missionaries and upper caste Christians rejected folk music. And here it was, becoming the language of ‘liberation theology’ among dalit Christian communities,"" says Sherinian, who went on to start a parai drumming ensemble at the University of Oklahoma.

Today, this revolutionary model of worship and ethnomusicology is part of the four-year Bachelor of Divinity curriculum at TTS. And among a whole generation of students, many of them now ordained priests and bishops across the state, who have imbibed and popularised it, is Rev. C R Samson Rasa of CSI Diocese of Madras.

""For most of us, parai is a legacy that runs in our veins. My community members played it for funerals and temple festivals in my village in Chittoor. However, in spite of its unparalleled importance in these ceremonies, it was looked upon as a symbol of what the caste system perceived to be our ‘contaminated identity’ (associated with certain oppressed caste members working with animal hide),"" says Rev. Samson. And his uprising – as that of Appavoo’s and many others of their league – has been to fundamentally revolutionalise the parai’s identity from a representation of the subaltern classes to a musical language that could result in individual and spiritual freedom. And so, he brought the first waves of this movement to Chennai at a youth retreat in 1998.

""We trained a group of youngsters in the percussion and Tamil folk compositions, and tested the waters at a public service at St Paul’s Higher Secondary School grounds in Chennai. Our performance was initially met with murmurs from orthodox and dominant caste Christians. But by day three, our dynamic youth board director announced that these songs were ‘vazhipaatu kudiya paadalgal’ (songs of worship), and a language of liberation,"" recalls Rev. Samson. The team went on to play at a CSI Madras pastor’s conference, and later at workshops with youngsters across the city.

Striking a similar chord at Dindugul, two Catholic nuns — also the subject of Sherinian’s work-in-progress film — have been using the parai as a tool of reclamation and empowerment of young scheduled caste women in the village. At her Sakthi Folk Cultural Centre, Sister Chandra uses native folk art forms as a campaign against gender, class and caste discrimination for the girls, who have performed to audiences across Tamil Nadu, as well as the US, Japan and South Korea.

Director of Dalit Resource Centre at TTS, Cruz Durai, says the aim is also to revive celebratory parai traditions that popular narratives have kept out. ""The parai is believed to be one of the earliest discovered instruments by hunter-gatherers out of leftover animal hide,"" he says. ""The word ‘parai’ also translates to the act of speaking. It was played to make important announcements in the village, and also in the battle cry to invoke the warrior spirit in soldiers. But in today’s counterculture movement, the parai’s role and essence surely lies in the celebration of all that was once shunned as tainted — from the music of death, to an ode to life, from a symbol of ‘polluted identities’, to one of holiness, union and brotherhood.""

282,['16/03/2020'],Golden jubilee of a golden voice with golden heart,"UNNIKRISHNAN NAIR

1970s was the golden era for Indian film music. Live performances used to be relished in those days and orchestra groups of stalwarts from city like Ahmed Kadir and Yogesh Thaker would see full houses.

A young boy in his mid-20s, hailing from Mannarkad town of central Kerala, used to stand in the last row and enjoy these shows. He was trained in basic classical music and was confident enough to perform on stage. But it was hard for part-timers or amateurs to get an opportunity.

With his love and perseverance for music, Unnikrishnan Nair not only created opportunities for himself but also brought 600-plus amateur singers like him on the stage during his five-decade long musical journey. They include well-known doctors, engineers, teachers, bureaucrats, builders, politicians, advocates and many young students from city.

Over the years, his ‘Sargam’ group has groomed those gifted with musical talent but could not follow it academically or professionally due to various reasons.

“My story is no different. Being the eldest among siblings, it was necessary for me to find a job and earn. As soon as I completed my pre-degree course, my father asked me to go to Nagpur and find a job. He was aware that I was learning classical music at that time. And like most fathers, he was not willing me to waste my time in it,” recalls Unnikrishnan who came to his uncle in Nagpur and later got a job as a typist in the Coal Mines Authority Ltd.

“I continued with my singing in Nagpur too. Earlier, I used to sing only in Malayalam. My first attempt to sing a Hindi song was when movie Chitchor was released (1976). My idol, legendary singer KJ Yesudas, made a Hindi debut with this movie,” says Unnikrishnan who cherishes his identity as ‘Nagpur’s Yesudas’.

The man has much more to present than the trademark ‘Yesudas’ style. He sings in all genres — right from bhajans to film songs — in eight languages. He single-handedly organizes several innovative musical events throughout the year.

“Today, so many musical events are organized. Organizers charge money from singers to perform on stage. One who contributes more gets to sing more number of songs. But, at Sargam, we have never charged even a rupee from singers. Only talent works here,” says Unnikrishnan.

Raising funds for such ‘open for all’ events is challenging, and many times he has to pay from his own kitty.

“Music is an universal language of the heart and I am always in search of new talent,” says Unnikrishnan who has recognized many talented singers from city and gave them their first public platform at a tender age.

Aniruddha Joshi, Manjiri Vaidya and Parvathi Nair are only a few names that have taken a bow on Unnikrishnan’s stage.

Since this is 50th year of Unnikrishnan’s musical career, singers he introduced had planned a big event to celebrate this occasion in March. The novel coronavirus outbreak has postponed this for now. But the music scene of Nagpur will continue to celebrate this golden voice with a golden heart forever.

PUNE: The PCB and the Local Military Authority (LMA) will start a two-day door-to-door survey from Monday in the Cantonment’s bungalow area to identify people who show symptoms of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection.

There are around 240 bungalows (old grant bungalows) in the area. The properties are occupied by senior Army officers and civilian families with a history of frequent domestic and foreign travel.

“We are taking all the possible measures to prevent the virus in our limit. The drive is aimed at identifying people suffering from cough, fever, among other symptoms and screen them at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital. If required, we will also take their samples to test,” Amit Kumar, the chief executive officer of Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), said.

A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting chaired by Sub Area Commander Major General Navneet Kumar of the Dakshin Maharashtra and Goa Sub Area (DMGSA) on Saturday evening.

According to the Cantonment authorities, over 1,000 people are estimated to be residing in these properties. A team of officials from the station cell and health officials from the Cantonment will be involved in the drive. “Our staffers will visit each house and screen those who had recently travelled abroad and to other cities in the country. We will maintain their records and will be in contact with them for the next few days. If any individual faces any health issue, s/he will be immediately tested at our ward. If required, the person will be sent to Naidu hospital,” VD Gaikwad, resident medical officer of PCB, said.

“Our members will also keep records of the surrounding people who reside in the vicinity of unwell or suspected persons. This is for our reference so we can control the situation if we find someone who tests positive for the virus in the future,” he added.

The Cantonment authorities have been focusing on creating awareness among residents through posters and pamphlets for the last few days. “Our officials are working in tandem with the Army as well as district administration to take the necessary measures to tackle the situation. We will soon conduct special awareness drives and medical check-ups in each ward. We will chalk out a comprehensive plan in this regard by taking help of the elected members,” Kumar said.

The Cantonment authorities have urged people to come forward if they have symptoms such as cough, fever, among others. “These patients will be screened at our hospital on priority and will be provided necessary medical care. The people who frequently travel to different places, even within the state and country, should visit the Cantonment hospital,” Kumar said.

The Army authorities too have taken counter measures and told officers, personnel and their family members to avoid gatherings. “They have been sensitized about the virus in the last few days. Activities such as weekly movie, social gatherings at clubs and mess, among others have been cancelled temporarily at all military stations. People have responded positively to our calls,” a senior Army officer from the Southern Command said.

PUNE: People from all walks of life — youngsters, especially students of different institutions, working professionals and even actors — are posting selfies while wearing masks on the social media platforms with trending hashtags such as “maskselfie” or “coronaselfie”.

Social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook , Instagram and even WhatsApp are being increasingly flooded with such photographs taken at homes, work places and housing societies. The trend is swiftly taking the form of a fashion statement.

College student Krishiv Sharma said, “There is a variety of masks available in the market. My friends decided to buy four varieties and we took a selfie with those masks.”

Not only common citizens, but actors have also been posting selfies, which have been trending on the sites.

On Saturday, actor Abhishek Bachchan took to Instagram and shared a selfie wearing a face mask with a caption “stay safe”. His picture received over 1.3 lakh ‘likes’ in about 24 hours.

Netizen Vinaya Nair said, “My college friends and I decided among our group to post each of our selfies and share it with one another. Masked selfies are trending so we decided to join the bandwagon.”

Apart from the three-layered surgical masks, the N95 one and other colourful netted varieties are in high demand. Many chemist shops are facing a shortage in the wake of a spurt in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus.

Software professional Ketan Walimbe took a group selfie with office colleagues on Friday after they received free masks from the HR department. Walimbe said, “I took a selfie with some of my colleagues for memory’s sake to keep in mind the ongoing coronavirus crisis. We shared it on our social media handles and the picture was liked by many.”

IT professional Ketaki Bhajan said, “On Sunday, my husband and I had invited my parents at our place for lunch on my birthday. Since large gatherings are not allowed we decided to celebrate it with my parents. We were surprised to see both of them reach our home with their masks on. Of course they had worn it as a precautionary measure but we decided to click their picture anyway to frame the moment.”

288,['16/03/2020'],"Teachers too demand holiday, associations advise ‘balance’","Nagpur: As soon as the state education department issued a circular confirming closure of schools and colleges across the state, both teachers and parents heaved a sigh of relief. But with the academic work pending, some state board and CBSE schools have asked their teachers to report for work.

As per the government directives, board exams need to continue as per schedule. Hence, it’s the teachers not involved with board work who feel that the holiday notice should apply to them as well.

One such CBSE school teacher said, “When it has been categorically mentioned that schools and junior colleges must be shut till March 31, I wonder how we can be called for work.”

Another teacher from a state board school said “Our principal has asked the entire staff to be present on Monday. He claims that teachers are not exempt.”

She added that students have been given a holiday, but teachers called till the local education department provides clarity.

TOI spoke to two principals from each of these schools. They said that with the official letter from Mumbai coming on Saturday night, there was not much time to go over the logistics.

One principal, whose school is on the outskirts, said, “There is some academic work which needs to be done and teachers will be briefed on Monday. The best part is that with no regular classes, teachers can work without distraction and get things done faster.”

The state board’s principal said teachers need to be ‘realistic’. “Lesson plans can be made in advance and there are preparations to be made for pending exams and evaluations for recent internal exams. This can be wrapped up quickly now with students not coming,” said the principal.

Even teacher association leaders say a balance has to be maintained. Rajendra Zade of Shikshak Bharti said “Teachers will be called when it’s absolutely necessary because and we will also try to discuss this issue with principals. I am sure on Monday when everyone sits together these things will be clarified because the decision itself came when schools were already closed.”

Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJCTA) said that a balance has to be maintained. “See we cannot have a situation where no teacher turns up. It’s fine for a day or two, but two weeks is a very big gap. The basic purpose for closure is to control the crowd, which was mostly students. Hardly a few teachers are there in every school or college,” said Gavhankar.

He added that the balance will have to maintained by adjusting the timings. “If colleges cannot give teachers holiday, then daily work hours can be reduced. I think three hours a day will suffice for all major work,” said Gavhankar.

Rumour mills result in police complaint

A day after rumours spread about GHMC deputy Mayor Baba Fasiuddin being attacked and beaten up in front of his house, his staff lodged a complaint at Jubilee Hills police station and SR Nagar police station on Sunday, surprising Fasiuddin himself. It turned out that the deputy mayor had mentioned on a lighter note to Arekapudi Gandhi, the Serilingampally MLA, that he hit his head on the bathroom tap and got injured, triggering rumours about an attack on him. With rumour mills doing the rounds about Baba Fasiuddin’s injury on social media, it seems his staff did not take a chance.

Fake orders, confusing orders

With the state government taking its own sweet time in releasing GOs regarding closure of educational institutions and public places until March 31, quite a few people, including a few officials, have started sharing orders released by other states. In fact, they have tactically cropped out the name of the state from the order to make it look authentic. But, what they forgot was that it had the neighbouring state official’s name on the order.

KOLKATA: One street each in New Town and Sector V will be developed as model pedestrian-safe streets by the New Town Kolkata Development Authority ( NKDA ) and Nabadiganta Industrial Township authority ( NDITA ) respectively following the recommendations of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers ( SIAM ).The two streets, on which SIAM has conducted an extensive survey, are street No. 13 in Sector V that connects Wipro with the Ring Road via College More and street No. 165 in New Town. The survey was part of their CSR activities to carry out a pan-India study in Kolkata and four other cities for the National Road Safety Year 2019-2020 regarding how streets can be safer for pedestrians.Instead of major arterial roads, these two streets were chosen for the survey so that the research team ’s recommendations for pedestrians’ safety can be applied to other roads across Sector V and New Town.Hidco, NKDA and NDITA officials, along with traffic police inspectors of New Town and Sector V, attended a workshop recently on model safe roads where the study was discussed. “Engineers of NKDA and NDITA have been asked to ensure that all the recommendations are followed for a model streets in each of the two townships. The model can be applied to other streets in the future,” said a Hidco official. The research team worked on the two streets for several months to find how small interventions can make roads safer for people. They made over 300 location-specific recommendations. For examples, they found that traffic signs have faded in some spots while branches of trees obstruct traffic signals in some other areas.The team pointed out that in some areas, zebra crossings lead to a blocked end on the road median. In some areas, pedestrians were seen crossing the road divider or median in between traffic movement while motorists have low visibility there due to the garden hedges spreading into the road. There were also some instances of obstructions faced by pedestrians due to trees, shrubs, pillar boxes and encroachment by hawkers. In some places, the height of the footpath on the main road was found to be too high for pedestrians. The research team has recommended an optimum speed limit of 40 kmph for the two streets.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74647376,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21306,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pedestrian-safe-model-street-plan-for-sector-v-new-town/articleshow/74643274.cms

K Mariyayee, saleswoman at the Thirukampuliyoor primary agricultural cooperative credit society in Karur district, was dismissed from service in 2012. The society said she stole the gold jewellery pledged by customers, replaced them with fake ones and re-pledged the original ones at a private finance company for monetary gain. She moved the high court Madurai bench in 2012 seeking to quash the dismissal order and to reinstate her.

The petitioner’s counsel submitted that her duty as saleswoman was only to sell commodities at the fair price shop and she had nothing to do with the jewellery pledged in the society. The counsel further submitted that the inquiry officer had obtained signature from the petitioner forcibly without providing proper opportunity to her to explain. The authorities countered this saying the petitioner herself had accepted her guilt during the inquiry, redeemed the re-pledged jewellery and handed it over to the inquiry officer.

On perusal of the submissions, Justice V Bhavani Subbaroyan observed that since the petitioner herself had admitted her guilt before the inquiry officer, the disciplinary authority had rightly dismissed the petitioner from service for her misdeeds. The judge further observed that though the only remedy available to the petitioner is to file a statutory appeal before the competent authority, the petitioner had filed the petition which is not sustainable in law.

“We demand that the rates of petrol, diesel and LPG be reduced by at least 35 to 40%,” party spokesperson Trajano D’Mello said on Sunday.

Congress condemned the increase of excise duty on petrol and diesel.

“BJP’s strategy has always been to first get the common man used to pin-pricks and then, in due course of time, pierce them. This is clear from the high inflation rates of all commodities,” D’Mello said.

Congress said that since coming to power in 2014, the Modi government has hiked excise duty over a dozen times.

“The increase by 15% on petrol and over 400% on diesel by the NDA government has been the major cause of hikes in various transportation costs, resulting in high inflation,” D’Mello said.

The government is crushing the lower middle class which constitute 80% of the nation’s population, he said.

However the plantations were raised only on 111.20 hectares thereby causing monetary loss to the government. The memo was issued after the conservator of forests inspected the nursery and found insufficient number of saplings to raise cultivation on 180 hectares.

Thereafter, the petitioner was promoted as deputy conservator of forests and permitted to retire on attaining superannuation in 1996. After the inquiry, punishment of pension cut of Rs 300 for three months and recovery of Rs 11,396 was imposed on the petitioner in May 2008. Nair moved the high court in 2009 seeking to quash the punishment order and also sought disbursal of his gratuity amount.

The petitioner’s counsel submitted that the incident took place during 1994-95 and Nair had issued a charge memo to the forest ranger who failed to maintain the nursery. He noted that a few days after issuing the memo, the petitioner was transferred to the social forestry division in Madurai.

Nagpur: Be it temples, mosques, churches or gurudwaras, the faithful are flocking to seek divine blessings, but religious leaders say there is definitely a growing awareness among their members about coronavirus.

Gurvinder Singh Dhillon, president of Baba Deep Singh Nagar Gurudwara, said that pecautionary steps are being taken during langars (community meals). “We are washing the cloth mats in hot water ever since this coronavirus scare started. We have also advised friends and family to use masks on the road. These masks can be made from old turbans,” said Dhillon. He added that this is only about taking precautions and in no way related to diluting religious beliefs.

“When it comes to health and life, the final word is always the almighty’s. We can only take precautions as per directives of the health department,” said Dhillon.

Fr Patrick, a Catholic priest with the Nagpur Archdiocese, said, “Though church services are being held as per schedule, we have postponed an outdoor gathering as per the government directives. As a regular practice, we have advised our members to ensure sanitizing of hands and maintaining cleanliness to ensure that there’s no spread of any kind of infection. People will come to church because of their faith in God.”

He added that there is no visible drop in the attendance at church services due to the virus scare. For Christians, the holy period of lent is under way and will end on Good Friday in April. During this period, there are prayer meetings at homes.

Rachna Singh, a member of the All Saints’ Cathedral, said, “Church services and meetings are being held as per schedule. Church leaders have advised people about precautions to be taken due to the current situation.”

Sarabjit Kalsi, a prominent member of the Sikh community and member of Gurudwara Gyanprakash Prabandhak Committee, said there is an increased awareness among people about Coronavirus.

“People themselves are taking a lot of precautions like wiping hands and greeting each other in a traditional way by saying Sat Sree Akaal, which is similar to namaste,” said Kalsi.

He added that though devotees can come anytime during the day to pray, more crowds are present during prayers. “Ardaas is held in the morning and evening and usually more people come at these times. We keep advising people about health protocols in the backdrop of the virus scare,” said Kalsi.

Even in mosques there is no visible sign of drop in attendance. A Muslim cleric, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Friday prayers are going on as per schedule and even on a daily basis we see that the numbers have not dipped. People who come to pray anyway come after washing themselves, so the basic guidelines of personal hygiene are already followed.”

A division bench of Justices P N Prakash and B Pugalendhi passed the order on a petition by N Rajesh Kannan seeking to cancel the quarry licence issued to P S K Balasubramanian claiming that he is illegally quarrying sand in violation of the licence conditions. The judges observed that the petitioner has stated in his affidavit that he had earlier filed another petition seeking a direction to the revenue authorities to stop Balasubramanian from quarrying sand.

Balasubramanian’s counsel submitted that in the earlier petition, Kannan had made his client and another person respondents and averred that quarry licences were issued to them. However, in the present petition, only Balasubramanian has been impleaded as respondent.

The judges observed that according to the affidavit by the petitioner, he is a resident of Madurai district whereas the quarry in question is located at Ilayankudi in Sivaganga district, over 100km from the petitioner’s residence. The judges observed that these facts clearly showed that there is no public interest involved in the case and the litigation appeared to be motivated.

MADURAI: It was not an easy job for officials from the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) and the Special Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU) to stop the marriage that was arranged for an underaged couple at Melapalayam in Tirunelveli city on Saturday. After putting in efforts for nearly six hours it was stopped around 9.30 pm.

Marriage between the girl aged 15 and the boy, 20, was arranged by their parents on Saturday evening. Since the girl is below 18 and the boy below 21, personnel from the SJPU reached the place around 3 pm to conduct an inquiry and stopped the wedding.

It is learnt that the girl attended school till class X and the boy assists his father in a juice shop. The girl lives with her mother who is separated from her father. The bride and the groom are residents of adjacent streets. “Their families initially claimed that a wedding was not taking place,” district child protection officer B S Devananth said.

The officer said the representatives of the Jama-at and their families stated that they have a separate law and that the marriage is legal. “We made it clear that such a marriage is illegal under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, and that it does not differentiate minors on religious grounds,” he added.

Both the bride and the groom could not be questioned by the officials as the parents claimed that the duo was not available. After a series of arguments, the girl’s mother and the boy’s father gave it in writing that they will not arrange the marriage till the girl turned 18.

The accused has been booked under Section 66 of the IT Act and under provisions of the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

On Thursday, Maina Curtorim police had arrested 23-year-old Melvin Antonio Fernandes, a resident of Moll, Sao Jose de Areal, for abducting and raping the minor.

On Wednesday afternoon while the survivor was walking home from school, the accused, a seaman, offered her a lift on his motorcycle. As he was an acquaintance, the survivor didn’t suspect anything amiss and accepted his offer. However, the accused, instead of dropping her home, took her to a hillock in distant Ambaulim, and raped her.

305,['16/03/2020'],Govt rolls up its sleeves to boost use of electric vehicles,"Panaji: The state is hoping to set an example for the rest of the nation by emerging as a frontrunner in electric vehicle standards.

To accomplish this, it has some ambitious plans. By 2020, 30% of vehicles registered annually will be electric and by 2025, there will be 10,000 direct and indirect jobs created in the sector.

To this effect, the government has drafted the Goa Electric Vehicle Promotion Policy which proposes world-class infrastructure and ecosystem across passenger and commercial segments.

The objective of the policy is to encourage startups and investment in the field of electric mobility and associated sectors such as mobility as a service (MaaS), autonomous vehicles, data analytics and information technology, to promote service units which would include electric vehicles (EV) and battery repair and maintenance stations and to promote R&D, innovation and skill development within the EV sector.

The government plans to have charging stations every 25km on highways and every 3km within city limits. Battery swapping and fast charges are also included in the ambit of this policy.

All EV charging stations, both private and public, will adhere to protocol approved by the government of India, as updated on October 1, 2019, that is Bharat EV charger AC-001 and Bharat EV charger DC-001, and any other protocols as and when notified.

In keeping with the government’s green initiative, solar-powered stations will be given priority and encouraged in the case of both private and public charging stations. “Adoption of EVs for daily commute is essential for a wide range of goals, including better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security along with lowered carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. With vehicular pollution being a persistent source of reduced air quality within the state, rapid adoption of zero emission vehicles is of great importance,” the policy states.

If the state approves the policy then it will be applicable for four years, following the notification after which it may be revised or extended.

The policy will be applicable to all classes of EV, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, passenger cars and commercial light/heavy vehicles that are operated in the state with a Goa-based RTO passing.

KOLKATA: Metro services were disrupted for over half an hour between Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Maidan stations around 10.35am on Sunday after a man attempted suicide at Rabindra Sarobar. The man was injured and taken to a hospital. Truncated services were run between Kavi Subhash and Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Maidan and Dum Dum stations though. Normal services resumed at 11.18am.

Had it been a weekday, thousands of commuters would have suffered due to the disruption.

“The man jumped in front of a Dum Dum-bound train at Rabindra Sarobar station. The motorman applied emergency brakes but the train stopped only after a few coaches passed the point where the man had jumped. It took a while for rescue operations to start as the rake had to be evacuated first and then reversed to avoid any further injury to the man,” said Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee.

Power to the third rail could only be switched off after the rake was reversed. Metro staff got down on the tracks and brought the man to the platform. He was injured but alive when shifted to hospital with the help of Kolkata Police .

He inspected archaeological sites at Keeladi including Agaram, Manalur and Kondhagai villages along with minister G Baskaran. Talking to reporters, K Pandiarajan said that while the sixth phase of excavation began in Agaram, Kondhagai and Keeladi villages on February 19, it will start soon in Manalur.

“Evidence suggest that Agaram and Manalur were habitation sites while Keeladi was an industrial site and Kondhagai a burial site. Six complete urns have been excavated from the sites since the work started last month. Around 150 to 160 people are involved in excavation works at these sites,” he said.

“Work on the on-site museum in Kondhagai, at an outlay of Rs 12.2 crore, will commence soon as tendering process nears completion. It has been planned to complete the work by January 2021. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will inaugurate the construction work either by making a visit or through video-conferencing,” he said.

The three-storey museum will house 15,000 artefacts including around 8,000 artefacts belonging to the Archeological Survey of India.

“Although excavations have been made at many places in Tamil Nadu, only Keeladi has kindled interest of the masses. More than 55,000 copies of a book printed on Keeladi excavations have been sold so far. A large number of people visited the archaeological site during earlier phases of excavation. The tourism department will arrange amenities for more visitors,” the minister said.

When asked whether Chola era paintings from Thanjavur Big temple had got damaged during recent cleaning works taken up by ASI recently, the minister said that he checked with the department but they denied of any such incident, adding he will look into the issue.

Both the deceased were artists and initial investigation says that they were not wearing helmets and one of them was wearing a turban. Elaborating further, the official added, “As of now, the exact cause of accident is not confirmed and it is difficult to ascertain as to who was at fault. We are trying to obtain the CCTV footage but the cameras are placed a bit far from the accident spot and it is difficult to say if we will get a clear picture of the incident.

312,['16/03/2020'],Bhopal Municipal Corporation plans to privatise water supply operations,"Representative image

BHOPAL: The Bhopal Municipal Corporation is planning to transfer the operation and maintenance of Narmada water supply project in the state capital to private players. The decision is being seen as a means to try and streamline piped water supply in the state capital.

Officials said installation and maintenance of 185 MLD facility pumps is key to water distribution in the state capital. About 30% of Bhopal’s water supply is linked to Narmada project.

BMC would sublet manning, operation and maintenance of 185 MLD Narmada water supply project comprising water treatment plant at Khatlapura and its other nodes. Corporation is expected to shell out more than Rs 2 crore for a yearly contract.

Earlier in February, district administration sought a detailed plan from the BMC and other agencies for ensuring uninterrupted water supply during the summer season in Bhopal. Activating all Narmada project linked overhead water tanks and other system is a key challenge for the BMC. It also includes SCADA is a system operating. It will be added to Narmada monitoring too, said a BMC official.

The system uses ultrasonic transmitter with flow measurement capability is installed right at the process measurement point. It is designed specifically for municipal applications such as water, wastewater and sewage.

The system is compatible with a remote water monitoring system for water quality testing including chlorine level in water. Many of the areas in the state capital report water shortage during summer season. To ensure proper availibility of water, BMC has to rely on dozens of private tankers. Besides areas with piped water supply lines also report of frequent damage and leakage to supply lines.

Despite a good monsoon, last year, several areas in the state capital have started feeling the crisis of water. BMC has identified areas with water scarcity and are devisiong plans to ensure regular supply to these areas.

The areas identified include, Koh-e-Fiza including Khanugoan, Aishbagh, Kolar, Idgah Hills, Mata Mandir, Saket Nagar, Pancsheel Nagar and some parts of Karond, Damkheda and Kolar areas.

313,['16/03/2020'],"Corona scares, still people venture out in city markets","Footfall increased in Sitabuldi market by evening, though it was not as much as regular Sundays

Nagpur: At Sitabuldi Main Road, Mohammed Hussain walked quickly, holding a scarf to his face, trying to keep away from passers-by. Though the coronavirus scare was evident at the street market here — arguably the most crowded place in the city — many others like Hussain were treading about cautiously.

As the city woke up to the first day of the implementation of the British era Epidemic Act, it appeared to be a dull Sunday. The Sitabuldi market, which is clogged with people as the day begins, was clear enough for even cars to navigate. Hopes lit up for the hawkers after sundown as footfalls increased, though they were not as much as the regular Sunday crowds at Sitabuldi.

“My agents sell hosiery items in the street market here. I am here to monitor them but the crowd is not even a quarter of what is expected on a Sunday evening,” said Hussain.

As TOI moved around the town, major malls were seen closed, though there were a few exceptions too. A complex and mall on West High Court Road and one on Wardha Road were open. Back on Sitabuldi Main Road, the word corona could often be heard amid the din of street vendors hard-selling their wares.

The news of patients testing positive in the city has only added to the slump here. Crowds began receding a couple of weeks ago, due to the scare. Today, business is less than half, said traders. Earlier, the outbreak’s impact in China had hit business here as vendors largely sell cheap goods imported from China, said traders.

“Most of the goods sold here come from China. Since a month we have not been able to procure fresh stocks due to China shutting down. Now, people are scared of venturing into crowded places, so footfalls have come down drastically,” said Gopi Ambhore, president of Sitabuldi Welfare Association — the union of street vendors.

“It’s my child’s birthday so I could not avoid shopping, but yes even I am scared of being infected,” said Manoj Nikule, a contract worker in the ordnance factory.

The streets of the otherwise crowded Mominpura too had sparse traffic. Some people were moving around with masks on their faces but business is as usual, said shopkeepers here. The Boipura pocket of Mominpura locality shares its boundary with Mayo Hospital, where patients have been kept in isolation ward. The mood at Boipura was nonchalant. “We are tough people and prayers will shield us from corona,” said residents here

“There is no scare at all. People venture out of the homes after offering prayers. Clerics are going to people’s homes to offer prayers and we are confident that everything else will be taken care of after that. Of course, we are also taking other precautions, like abstaining from non-vegetarian food,” said Mohammed Vakil Ansari at a shop nearby.

The Shaheenbagh-like protest at Farooq Nagar grounds at Teka continued as usual despite the scare, said organizers.

314,['16/03/2020'],BJP eyes 3 Gujarat Rajya Sabha seats as 4 Congress MLAs quit,"Rajya Sabha (file photo)

AHMEDABAD: In a major setback to Congress in Gujarat that could end its dream of winning two of the four Rajya Sabha seats from the state in the biennial elections, four of its MLAs have resigned, reducing the party’s strength to 69 in the 182-member assembly. Consequently, Congress is assured of winning only one seat while BJP is poised to win the remaining three.

Speaker Rajendra Trivedi said on Sunday that he received the resignations of four Congress MLAs “between 5pm and midnight on Saturday”. None of the four MLAs who quit and whose resignations were accepted — Somabhai Patel, J V Kakadiya, Pradyumansinh Jadeja and Pravin Maru — could be reached for comment.

Before the resignations, Congress was hoping to win two RS seats as first preference votes of 37 MLAs were required to win a seat. With the support of Independent MLA Jignesh Mevani, the tally of the Congress camp before the resignations stood at 74 — just enough to win two seats. But in the changed scenario, one of the two Congress candidates — Bharatsinh Solanki and Shaktisinh Gohil — could face defeat.

Sources do not rule out the possibility of more Congress MLAs resigning before the elections scheduled for March 26.

After the resignations, the assembly’s strength has been reduced to 176, which means a candidate will require 36 first preference votes to win the RS berth.

Despite himself contesting the RS election from Maharashtra, AICC Gujarat in-charge Rajeev Satav rushed to Ahmedabad on Sunday afternoon and held a series of meetings to assess the situation arising out of the resignations.

Gujarat PCC chief Amit Chavda put up a brave face, saying his party was hopeful of winning both the seats. No decision has been taken yet to withdraw the candidature of one of its two nominees, Chavda said. “The speaker has not spelt out names of MLAs who resigned, so we will wait until Monday,” added Chavda.

Leader of the opposition Paresh Dhanani said, “We enjoy the support or NCP, BTP and independents and we are in a position to win two RS seats.”

State BJP president Jitu Vaghani said Congress has already lost the numbers game and some of the MLAs flown to Jaipur will also vote for BJP candidates. “There is a tussle among the two Congress candidates over who should withdraw his nomination,” Vaghani added. Congress had on Saturday moved 15 of its MLAs to Jaipur, fearing attempts by BJP to influence them for votes.

The term of four RS members from Gujarat — Chunibhai Gohel, Lalsinh Vadodiya, Shambhuprasad Tundiya and Madhusudan Mistry — ends on April 9. While Mistry represents Congress, the remaining three are from BJP.

315,['16/03/2020'],State govt to challenge CAA in SC today,"Jaipur: The Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government will move the Supreme Court on Monday to challenge the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was passed by the Centre in December last year.

“The state government will file a suit against CAA in the Supreme Court tomorrow (Monday),” said the state government’s additional advocate general (AAG) Manish Singhvi on Sunday.

Gehlot had earlier announced that his government would not implement the Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state.

A resolution against the CAA was also passed in the state assembly on January 25. The resolution, which was passed by a voice vote, also asked the Centre to withdraw the new questionnaire framed for preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) on grounds that it “would cause huge inconvenience” to people.Gehlot has been quite vocal about the issue and had repeatedly attacked the BJP government at the Centre over the controversial legislation. “We have urged the Centre to repeal the law as it discriminates against people on religious grounds, which violates the secular principles of our Constitution. This is the first time in the history of the nation that a law has been enacted which discriminates on religious grounds,” Gehlot had said after the passage of the resolution.

The CAA, passed in Parliament on December 11, 2019, allows Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities who fled from the neighboring Muslim majority countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December 2014 due to “religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.” However, the Act excludes Muslims.

Under CAA 2019 amendment, migrants who entered India by December 31, 2014 and had suffered “religious persecution or fear of religious persecution” in their country of origin, were made eligible for citizenship by the new law. These type of migrants will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. The amendment also relaxed the residence requirement for naturalization of these migrants from eleven years to five.

However, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Sunday said that the Mhadei issue will not be a major poll plank and expressed confidence of winning both the districts.

Defending the government, Tanavade said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has already met Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Mhadei issue and that he has assured Sawant of protecting the state’s interest. He also blamed Congress for the Mhadei as well as mining issues.

“The opposition criticised the government for not doing enough on Mhadei. But when the chief minister recently met the PM, there have been no complements from the opposition. They are only looking for excuses to criticise the government. People of the state are aware of this, and will vote wisely,” Tanavade said.

Though the state BJP president acknowledged MGP’s visibility through their election campaign led by former deputy chief minister and Marcaim MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar who has been raising the Mhadei issue, Tanavade exuded confidence of a good showing by the BJP for the polls. Tanavade said that he has covered around 22 constituencies and has been getting a good response.

“The opposition is only restricted to press conferences. They are trying to create a perception that they are winning the elections . Congress candidates are waiting for their state party president Girish Chodankar and leader of opposition Digambar Kamat to visit their constituencies and campaign for them,” he said.

The price of fish has increased by around 20% due to the increased demand in the last one week.M Ashraful, a chicken vendor from Anna Nagar, said that he used to sell at least 50kg of chicken every Sunday, but it came down to 20-30kg this Sunday. “One kg of chicken, which was sold for not less than Rs 160 until a couple of weeks ago, is now being sold at Rs 100. However, there are only a few takers for it. We hope the government will take measures to inform the right message to the people,” said Ashraful.This is similar to the formalin scare a few weeks back after a check was conducted food safety officials at Karimedu market, following which the demand for fish came down. “The price has picked up in the last one week. The price of all varieties of fishes has gone up by at least 20% this weekend,” said K Vinayagam , a seller from Nelpettai fish market.A source from the prison department said that the demand for mutton sold by the inmates has increased this week as the crowd was bigger than usual this Sunday. Many, who came late, had to return empty handed as it was sold out.V Chandru, a mutton stall owner, said that they have not increased price of mutton despite increased demand and continue to sell it for Rs 750/kg.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74652442,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-rumours-bring-down-demand-price-of-chicken/articleshow/74643305.cms
319,['16/03/2020'],From ridicule to empathy: Shabana Azmi charts portrayal of LGBTQ community in cinema,"Veteran actor Shabana Azmi is glad that the discourse around the LGBTQ community is a lot more open today, with even mainstream cinema portraying them with compassion. Azmi starred in filmmaker Deepa Mehta 's acclaimed 'Fire' (1996), about a lonely woman in love with her sister-in-law, played by Nandita Das The actor recalls how the trio were asked if they were lesbians at the London Film Festival because they had done 'Fire'.""Today, it's fine. I must give credit to the mainstream industry that instead of making them a subject of ridicule, they are watching them with empathy,"" she says.In an interview with , the actor says she was aware during 'Fire' that some would be ""outraged, moved and shocked"", but at least a dialogue would start in a society, which was so afraid of the ""other"" that it hated them and was quick to stigmatise.""Starting a dialogue is the maximum you can do with a part or a film. I felt if the audience could empathise with the two sister-in-laws, then they would be able to extend that empathy to the other race, nation, colour, the other choice. You demonise the other because you don't know them.""The actor now features in 'Sheer Qorma', an upcoming love story between two queer women, played by Swara Bhasker and Divya Dutta Azmi says doing 'Sheer Qorma', directed by Faraz Arif Ansari, was a logical move forward after 'Fire'.""There has definitely been a great change in society as there should be. It is far more visible now, there's far greater acceptability, considering that even in mainstream cinema you get to witness it. Earlier it would just be a subject of ridicule, but it's shown with empathy and compassion.""The notion of family is changing today. It's no longer the heterogeneous family of man woman child. Now two women have children, two men are having children, single mothers are having children. So the notion of family is expanding, which is healthy.""The 69-year-old actor says her character in the film, that of a mother trying to adjust to the revelation of her daughter's sexuality, represents many people, who have difficulty facing the truth.""She's a woman who doesn't say, 'This is just unbearable.' She tries to cope with it but feels really stretched because as long as it was abroad, it was there, but she has brought this home. When she's confronted by her daughter, that makes her realise.""I see so many people who have had troubles accepting this of their children but finally they come around because the mother's love wins.""While Bollywood films have been often criticised for an inaccurate or caricaturish representation of the LGBTQ community given its huge impact on the mindset of masses, Azmi believed it would be a stretch to say that films alone have played a role in othering the community.""Anybody, who strikes out as looking different, who's more visible, the society in any case finds it difficult to adjust to the LGBTQ community. Anyone who wants to look different is looked at (strangely).""To give perspective, the actor recalls an incident where a gay friend of hers arrived to pick her up in the US, dressed in a faux fur long jacket, diamond necklace, with an eyeliner, and she had remarked, ""If he could have dressed up soberly.""""And he said, 'Excuse me for breathing!' I said no, it wasn't about breathing but attracting attention. He said, 'You think it's about attracting attention but this is the way I want to be.' That really started for me the feeling that we are so conditioned that we are easily outraged by anyone who doesn't fit the norm.""Azmi says it's important to understand that minorities and oppressed communities have to take dramatic steps for their identities to be seen and included. This is why, she says, she understands why people from LGBTQ community developed their own fashion sense, art and culture.""When there's this kind of social shift and change, you have to do something dramatic which captures people's attention. So the LGBTQ community, dressing in a way which brings visibility to them, is a way of seeking comfort. Why should they have a problem of, first, coming out in the open, then dressing the way they feel like.""Another criticism against Hindi cinema over the representation of LGTQ community has been that often such characters are one-dimensional with nothing apart from their sexuality given any importance.Azmi says it's a fair argument that members of the community shouldn't only be represented for their sexuality.""You can't define a person from the LGBTQ community only by that. There are so many aspects to them and that's fair to demand, that you don't see me only as this.""With 'Sheer Qorma', scheduled to be premiered at BFI, London on March 21, Azmi hopes the conversation moves ahead and her character resonates with people..""I hope when the mother accepts, she represents the people who have troubles with it. She comes with her own sets of conditioning and prejudices, to finally realise-which I hope people do too-that love is not a sin.""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74643878,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-81226/74643878.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/from-ridicule-to-empathy-shabana-azmi-charts-portrayal-of-lgbtq-community-in-cinema/articleshow/74643874.cms
320,['16/03/2020'],Youths geo-tag trees on city outskirts,"Madurai: A youth forum from Thirunagar, on the city outskirts, has taken up an initiative of geo-tagging trees to create a database in order to stop rampant felling of trees.

On Sunday, a team from Thirunagar Pakkam geo-tagged around 75 trees located on a stretch of around 500 metres.

They are planning to cover entire Thirunagar area, consisting of more than 30 streets, in a week’s time by taking up the work daily.

The members said that in the geo-tagging process, the geographical positioning of each tree is recorded along with details like photograph and variety of the tree.

It is done by capturing photograph of the tree using a mobile application, which is increasingly being used in various areas for sighting of animals during annual surveys carried out inside forests.

P R Vishwanath of Thirunagar Pakkam said that they have previously used the App while taking part in forest surveys and during snake rescue activities to keep a record of the spots where they are set free.

Geo-tagging is being used by various departments for various purposes. Recently, waterbodies were also geo-tagged by public works department. This could be probably the first-time that geo-tagging is being done for trees in this part of the state, Vishwanath said.

“The database can be used to trace if a tree has been felled illegally. Often, roadside trees are chopped down whenever there is a construction of a house or a commercial building. The database can also be used for a comparative study a few years later to ascertain whether number of trees has increased or decreased,” he said.

Works will be speeded up as volunteers have now got used to the process, youths said.

They said that a copy of the data will be submitted to district collector and corporation commissioner once the work is done.

His wife, who was the first to recover, has been shifted to RUHS College of Medical Sciences for observation in keeping with the recommended protocol.The third patient, an 85-year-old man who returned from Dubai on February 28 and tested positive on March 10, also remains under observation after testing negative in post-treatment investigations, the hospital said.The couple came to Jaipur on February 28 after touring major tourist destinations of the state as part of a 23-member Italian group which landed in Delhi on February 20.TOI was the first to report ‘Italian coronavirus patient being treated with HIV, swine flu & malaria medicines’ on March 5. While the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 as pandemic, SMS Hospital doctors achieved a major success by curing all three patients with some of the common anti-viral drugs.Currently, a 24-year-old youth is undergoing treatment for Covid-19. He tested positive on Saturday.“All the three Covid-19 patients were given the same treatment, which is a combination of anti-viral drugs — lopinavir and ritonavir. The doctors provided two tablets of 200/50mg of lopinavir and ritonavir twice a day,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health).Apart from lopinavir and ritonavir, the two drugs useful in HIV treatment, doctors gave them oseltamivir, a medicine useful in the treatment of swine flu, and chloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria.Age factor and co-morbidities made the task even more challenging for the doctors. The 69-year-old Italian tourist has an underlying lung disease. The 85-year-old patient, a resident of Jaipur, is suffering from diabetes, hypertension and renal kidney failure. “It was a difficult task for doctors. But, we used anti-viral medicines, which are safe for even pregnant women. It was the hard work of doctors and healthcare staff who worked round-the-clock and helped the patients in their recovery,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College.SMS Hospital’s senior professor (medicine) Dr Prakash Keswani is a happy man as he was the one under whom all the three Covid-19 patients defeated the disease. “We first conducted tests on Saturday. They both tested negative in the first test. For confirmation, we conducted re-test on Sunday and they both tested negative again. It is a proud moment for all of us as we used some common anti-viral medicines which helped in their treatment. We did not use any new medicine. The medicines are available in the market,” Keswani said.“The Italian tourist has lung disease and he still needs oxygen support. He has recovered from Covid-19. But, for lung disease, he still requires treatment. The 85-year-old has the same situation. He still needs treatment for chronic kidney failure, diabetes and hypertension,” said Keswani.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74644875,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106018,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-patients-in-raj-curedcombination-drugshelped-claim-experts/articleshow/74643325.cms

Biomining is the process of using microorganisms to extract metals of economic interest. The move will give relief to the residents of the area under the South Dum Dum municipality from pollution.

State urban development minister and KMC mayor Firhad Hakim on Sunday said, “Many have suffered for long due to this huge dumping ground. The waste of five municipalities is dumped here.”

Hakim was speaking at the inauguration of a 30 MLD sewage treatment plant set up by KMDA for South Dum Dum municipality.

“There are three ways to improve the waste disposal system — door-to-door waste collection through segregation, using dry waste as fuel and separating garbage that can be crushed and used for road construction. The problem of Pramod Nagar will be solved within the next three years,” Hakim added.

An animal crematorium is also coming up in the area. The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation is also using biomining to dispose of the waste at Mollar Bheri.

324,['16/03/2020'],Extend holidays up to class IX: Teachers,"After the Tamil Nadu government on Sunday announced holiday for LKG to Class V till March 31 as part of precautions against Covid-19, teachers and principals of various government and private schools in the district have called to extend the same for students up to Class IX.

“We welcome the government’s move to ensure safety of kindergarten and primary school students who are most vulnerable. However, it is appears the government is doing it half-heartedly, as the holidays should be declared for all school students,” said the principal of a government school. Teachers said that even if middle and high school students can manage their own hygiene, it will be still tough to monitor them.

Teachers however said that public exams could be easily conducted, adding that since students of Classes XI and XII have already completed half their exams, it would be unfair to stop mid-way and stress them out. “Public exams are only for a few hours and held on select days. This can be harmlessly handled. On the other hand, with most of their portions also complete by now, students of Classes VI to IX don’t have any urgent need to come physically to school and exams can always be scheduled later accordingly,” said a Class VIII teacher from a private school.

“The government has said to avoid large gatherings as much as possible. It would be hypocritical to keep schools open then. If adults are being asked to work from home in some places, why should children be under pressure to come to school?” said the head master of a private school. City schools also have zero control over monitoring if their students have been in contact with someone who may have recently returned from abroad, even in case of a family member.

Staff at the Louvre in Paris forced the museum to close following fears over the spread of Covid-19 after the French government banned large gatherings. In Italy, too, sweeping shutdown included the Vatican Museums, Galleria Borghese in Rome, and the Uffizi in Florence. In Venice, François Pinault’s private museums, the Palazzo Grassi and Punta della Dogana are also shut.Jayanta Sengupta, curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, was the first to take a call on the closure. He said the decision was prompted by concerns about safety of both staff and visitors to the marble edifice. “We get around 150 foreigners daily. Though we had taken measures like providing masks to the staff and hand sanitizers at multiple points, we were uneasy as the security had to conduct manual frisking of 12,000-13,000 visitors daily. On March 11, I had written to both the cultural ministry and Raj Bhavan. The nod to shut down the facility arrived on Saturday evening,” said Sengupta.This is the first unscheduled closure at VMH in a century. The VMH had opened in 1921. The shutdown will be reviewed on March 31 and either lifted or extended, depending on the scenario.The VMH closure also prompted Indian Museum authorities to follow suit. Though they, too, were in a dilemma, director AD Chaudhury was also aware that a closure could negatively hit people’s psychology. “I was in two minds but decided on the closure because we can’t take chances,” he said. Over 70,000 visitors had been to the museum since February 1, including 2,500-odd foreigners.Indian Museum that is 206 years old had shut for a month and a half in 2013 for renovation ahead of the bicentenary celebrations.Chaudhuri, who is also the director general of the National Council of Science Museums , issued shutdown notices for Science City and Birla Industrial & Technological Museum (BITM) as well.“In view of the evolving situation on spread of Covid-19 and following the advisory of the Union health ministry, Science City Kolkata will be closed to visitors from March 15, 2020 to March 31, 2020 or until further notice,” Science City director Subhabrata Chaudhuri said.

This has irked the residents and motorists.

Residents said that water wastage due to burst and leakages in pipelines has been rampant off late and it is noticed in various parts of the city. Thiruparankundram Main Road at Palanganatham, Ram Nagar in Bypass Road and Ponmeni, Theni Main Road at Kalavasal are few other places that have witnessed water wastage in recently. V Kalamegam, a social activist from Palanganatham, said that while there is a water problem in one part of the area, water is going waste in another part of the same area. Leakages, not only, result in water getting waste, but also reduces pressure in pipelines, resulting in poor supply of waste in tail end areas, he said.

While bigger bursts are attended immediately, smaller leakages are not fixed on time resulting in water getting waste for days. Immediate attention is required to address all sorts of water leakage problems, said M Muthulakshmi from K Pudur.

An official from the Madurai Corporation said that decade-old pipelines have to be blamed for these damages. The corporation has proposed plans to replace existing pipelines throughout the core city. A project has bene proposed at an estimated cost of Rs 77 crore to replace the pipeline in and around Meenakshi Amman temple, chosen for Area Based Development (ABD) under Smart City scheme. There is separate proposal to replace old pipeline in other part of the core city as well.

We have been rectifying water leakage problems at the earliest. We have sorted out leakage problems in Ram Nagar and work is underway to prevent leakage in East Veli Street, the official added.

PUNE: The Hadapsar police on Sunday arrested four young men on the charges of kidnapping, disrobing and attempting to murder a 15-year-old boy in the Gopalpatti area of Manjari, after a video clip of the incident went viral on the social media the night before.

The police are searching for two other accomplices involved in the crime.

Police said the teenager, who is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of the Sassoon General Hospital, had an argument with the suspects a few days ago and the latter decided to settle score with him. Medical authorities reported to the police the victim’s condition as in a state of unconsciousness. The boy is a school dropout belonging to a poor family, the police added.

The police identified the arrested suspects as Vinit Suryakant Biradar (19) of Phursungi, Shubham Rajabhau Jadhav (19) of Nigdi, Devidas Ghanashyam Pavhane (21) of Hadapsar and Bharat Vishal Rathod (21) of Manjari. All of them have previous record of body offences, the police said.

On Thursday night, the victim’s mother (age 49 years) had lodged a missing person’s complaint after her son, who had left home for watching a Shiv Jayanti procession in the evening, did not return. The police were searching for him when they came across the video clip and later traced the injured boy to the Sassoon hospital .

The video clip showed five to six men assaulting the boy with sharp weapons and leather belts, after disrobing him. The video clip helped the police establish the identity of the assailants.

Investigations revealed that on Thursday evening, the suspects found the boy moving around alone. They kidnapped and took him to an isolated spot at Gopalpatti on a motorcycle. The men then threatened and abused him and disrobed him, the police said. They assaulted him with their leather belts and a sharp weapon to the point where the boy fell unconscious.

The police said one of the suspects, while assaulting the boy, filmed the entire incident. The suspects then picked up the boy, abandoned him on the nearby railway tracks and also urinated on his face, the police said. They videographed the entire act, the police said, adding that some local residents found the boy motionless near the tracks and shifted him to the Sassoon hospital.

The police said the suspects had shared the video clips among themselves using a mobile phone-based internet messaging service. Some of them even sent these clips to their friends and others. Soon, the video clip went viral.

Senior inspector Ramesh Sathe of the Hadapsar police told TOI, “One of our policemen received the video clips on his cellphone. Within no time, he identified the suspects, as they have previous record of body offences registered with the police. We then showed the video clips to the boy’s mother, who identified her son.

PUNE: A well-known 25-year-old guitarist was killed after a PMPML bus driver knocked his motorcycle at Pashan on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass around 11.30pm on Friday night.

Mradul Tarun Singhal, a resident of Marunji near Hinjewadi, was driving his motorcycle towards Bavdhan when the accident occurred.

“Singhal was wearing a helmet,” assistant inspector Anand Pagare of the Hinjewadi police told TOI. The police have arrested the (PMPML) bus driver, Ulhas Sarphale (44), for negligent driving.

Pagare said Singhal and the PMPML bus were headed towards Chandni Chowk on Friday night. The bus was on its way Katraj while Singhal was headed towards Bavdhan.

The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus driver hit Singhal’s motorcycle while attempting to overtake him. “Singhal lost his balance, fell off the motorcycle and came under the front wheel of the bus. He died on spot,” Pagare said.

Vaibhav Bachale, Singhal’s friend and a drummer, said Singhal was practising for his performance, scheduled in the last week of March. “On Friday he had a practise session till 9pm with other musicians in the band. After it got over, Sighal decided to visit a friend of ours in Bavdhan,” Bachale said adding, “Singhal always used to wear safety gear while driving his motorcycle.”

Sarphale was produced in court on Saturday and released on bail, police said.

Sarphale has been charged under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Motor Vehicle Act.

Account of a fellow musician

“He had composed some new material on the day of his accident and was looking forward to release it. It's extremely shocking and heartbreaking the way he left us,” said Prateek Bhaduri, an eminent singer and songwriter.

“Mradul and I were in touch over social media for a few years till we finally jammed together at one of my events. Afterwards, we talked at length about the music scene and our love for the heavier genres of music and good songwriting,” said Bhaduri.

He added, “Mradul was an extremely humble, hardworking and talented. He was quite a riot on stage. Offstage, he was an easy going boy, soft-spoken and caring.”

Considering the novel coronavirus outbreak, the temple trustees claimed to be taking precautionary measures at the temple and during the shobha yatra to ensure safety of devotees.

The shobha yatra taken out by Ram Mandir in Ram Nagar has already been cancelled considering fears regarding the coronavirus outbreak.

On Saturday, district collector Ravindra Thakare, while citing state government’s directives discouraging large gatherings due to coronavirus outbreak, had made it clear that religious processions will not be allowed. Even commissioner of police Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay has said they will ensure that the government’s orders are followed.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had told TOI that no permission will be given to big events like the Ramnavami shobha yatra in which thousands of devotees take part.

The trustees of Poddareshwar Ram Mandir on Central Avenue held a meeting on Sunday evening and discussed preparations for the shobha yatra, including precautionary measures to be taken during the procession.

Punnet Poddar, a trustee of Poddareshwar Ram Mandir, tried to justify the temple’s decision to go ahead with the religious procession. He said sanitizers will be distributed among the devotees visiting the temple and also to people participating in the procession. “We will stock up enough sanitizers for the purpose,” he said.

In a bid to disinfect the temple premises, Poddar said that bleach will be added to the water in tanks of the air coolers. “We are not going to cancel the procession under any circumstances,” he said.

Ravi Waghmare, organizer of the shobha yatra at Ram Nagar, said, “We have mutually decided to call off our shobha yatra to ensure safety of devotees. We have also cancelled the mahaprasad that was scheduled on April 3.”

He said that adequate arrangements will be made and devotees will be asked to clean their hands with sanitizer before entering the temple on Ram Navami.

PUNE: Fifteen-year-old Santosh Adagale (name changed) refused to go to school despite his mother’s attempts to persuade him. He was drawn to his friends who were involved in thefts and robberies in Warje area.

Another teenager from Kasewadi saw his role model in a youngster from the slum pocket involved in robberies and body offences.

But the Pune police hope to see a turnaround. The two teens and 58 other boys will join a correction programme called ‘Roshni’ to dissuade minor boys from getting into criminal activities.

The officials of the Special Child Protection Unit under the Bharosa Cell have designed the Roshni programme with help from non-government organisations in the city.

“The programme was launched on February 20. So far, it has been started for boys and girls from the slum pockets of Lohiyanagar-Kasewadi and Warje,” inspector Shilpa Chavan of the unit said.

The police have enrolled 15 boys and girls from the Lohiyanagar–Kasewadi slum pocket while 12 teenagers have been enrolled from the Warje, Chavan added.

The Special Child Protection Unit in the last one year identified as many as 605 minor boys and girls in conflict with the law.

“Soon, the programmes will start at Janata Vasahat , Sahakarnagar, Hadapsar , Aundh, and other slum pockets of the city. As of now, we have decided to select 60 boys and girls for the programmes. The number will certainly go up,” she said.

Under the programme, the police and NGOs working for children approach the parents of the juveniles in conflict with law and urge them to send their children to the special course programme in the slum pocket.

A room is arranged where police and NGO officials conduct counselling sessions for the children, she said.“It is an attempt to dissuade children from getting involved in criminal activities and to pursue education,” she said.

The programme which conducts counselling sessions urges them to have an identity for themselves and not follow their role models, Chavan said.

Theatre workshops, de-addiction programmes, the importance of a proper diet, hygiene, meditation programme and programme based on motivational songs and drama are used to help them.

“We have also sought help from the local women who want to volunteer for the programme. They will help the police bring these kids for the counselling sessions and programmes,” a woman member of an NGO said.

In order to persuade the boys who drop out of school to go back, the police and NGO authorities have decided to include their school-going friends in the programme. After watching the progress of their pals, they will be motivated to resume their education once again. It will not only reduce criminal activities in the slum pocket but bring the kids back to a normal life,” Chavan said.

The project, estimated to cost over Rs 185 crore, will include the de-silting of the river, replacement of the old sewerage network system and connecting houses in the vicinity to the sewerage system.

This apart, RCC has also proposed that the Khareband nullah be connected to the north trunk main sewer line. Presently, water from the Shirvodem nullah is diverted to the 20 MLD STP at Shivodem, Navelim. The treated water is then released back into nullah on the downstream side.

RCC’s proposal includes the improvement and upgradation of the existing solid waste management facilities and erection of material recovery facilities/storage shed for non-biodegradable waste at Sonsoddo, Margao. It has also proposed that treated sewage from the STP at Colva be de-weeded, recycled and reused to maintain the e-flow.

This revised action plan will be submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for approval, as per the order of the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ).

A senior government officer said the installation of the sewerage network is being expedited through the Sewerage Infrastructure Development Corporation of Goa Limited (SIDCGL) and the institutional mechanism for solid-waste management is being strengthened through the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC).

“There is no industrial discharge into any of the polluted river stretches,” one senior government officer said. Earlier, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) had levied fines under the Polluter-Pay-Principle (PPP) to commercial establishments located along the banks of the Mandovi for discharging untreated sewage. Further, they had been given a time frame to make provisions for sewage treatment methodology.

The public works department had also disconnected water and electricity connections of residential units found to be discharging sewage into rivers. GWMC meanwhile has initiated a process to provide biotoilets.

The write-down of the AT-1 (quasi-equity) bonds will also impact high net worth individuals who, drawn by the higher rates, had bought these bonds. The reconstruction scheme was notified by the government last week to enable the distressed bank to exit a moratorium on withdrawals, imposed by the RBI on March 5 to protect depositors.In a letter to stock exchanges after the results on Saturday, Yes Bank said the lender is deemed to be “non-viable or approaching non-viability and accordingly the triggers for a write-down of certain Basel III AT-1 bonds have been triggered”. It added that in light of the provisions of the Basel III circular, AT-1 bonds worth Rs 3,000 crore issued on December 23, 2016, and another lot of Rs 5,415 crore issued on October 18, 2017 stand extinguished. In its results, the bank had said that Rs 8,695 crore of these bonds can be used to enhance the equity of the bank. It is not clear whether the difference of Rs 280 crore between the bonds issued and bonds written down has been converted to equity. Yes Bank did not respond to queries till the time of going to press.The bank said its common equity (tier-1) ratio fell to 0.6% after the quarterly loss. The losses were due to gross NPAs jumping to Rs 40,709 crore from Rs 5,158 crore in the previous year and Rs 17,134 crore in the preceding quarter. By making a Rs 22,328-crore provision for bad loans, the bank has managed to restrict the ratio of net non-performing assets to 5.97%, just below the 6% level which triggers prompt corrective action by the RBI.After considering a capital infusion of Rs 10,000 crore and write-down of Rs 8,415 crore of AT-1 bonds, the common equity (tier-1) ratio improved to 7.6%, which is just above the statutory requirement.Yes Bank faces a major challenge in convincing bulk depositors to retain their funds. The lender has seen a flight of Rs 72,000-crore deposits in less than six months and is meeting the mismatch through borrowings. There could also be legal challenges from shareholders holding more than 100 shares, who have been forced into a lock-in under the scheme.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74643882,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1783673,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-writes-down-rs-8415-crore-at-1-bonds/articleshow/74643881.cms

352,['16/03/2020'],"Pune: Let your hair down, even with a wig","Pretend tresses: Vrushali Maisekar displays some of the wigs

There’s hair transplantation for those who cannot embrace their baldness easily. But for those unwilling to undergo such surgeries, there’s always the wig. The hairpiece has brought solace to alopecia and chemotherapy patients alike and much cheer to the Kardashians and Lady Gagas donning them on those big nights out. In fact, celebrities are seen as having normalized the wearing of wigs in recent years.

The first known wigs were made of human hair in Egypt way back in 2700 BC, says skin-care specialist Vrushali Maisekar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, large full-bottomed expensive wigs signified the wealth of an individual. Hair was harvested from the heads of the rural working class.

Interestingly, the tonsure shops at the Tirupati temple are today the biggest suppliers of human hair world-wide. Maisekar says that while some Indian wig-makers buy the hair during the auctions at the temple, most of it is sent abroad for a chemical treatment mainly to remove the cuticles.

Maisekar gets readymade wigs of both human and synthetic hair from foreign countries. Her Indian-made wigs usually come out of factories in Kolkata, some places in the south of the country and Mumbai, she says. She sends the specifications required for her clients to these factories and gets her wigs prepared within 10 days.

Full wigs for women are usually made in Indian factories only and can cost up to Rs 25,000. Human hair wigs are pricier and last longer than the synthetic ones, but 18 months is usually the time by which one needs to buy a new wig, she says.

The wigs are made by sewing hair strands individually or in bunches into a lace base made of polyurethane and nylon. Highly advanced bases these days offer a natural-looking frontline and hairline, says Maisekar. Once she gets a wig from the factory, it requires a little styling and customization to suit the wearer.

Maisekar sells around 30 partial and full wigs each month with the start price being Rs 5,000. Around half her clients are chemotherapy patients.

Another wig seller, Namrata Pawar, has been in the trade for the past two years. Of the 15-odd wigs she sells each month, at least six are made locally by her workforce.

A full wig for women would use 5-10 lakh strands of hair which are at least 30 inches long, says Pawar. She buys hair of such length for around Rs 50,000 a kilo. The wigs made at her workshop get an application of shampoo, conditioner, gel and serum to give it a natural gloss. She advises her buyers to also wash, shampoo and condition their wigs two or three times a month. Among styles in wigs, the preference is for the Indian wavy look, not curls or straight hair, she says.

Most wigs lose their sheen and do not appear natural after two years, says Pawar. Chemotherapy patients need wigs for around that much time; their own natural hair starts growing again thereafter.

Maisekar says wigs today have shed the artificial look and feel of the past. The chemical treatment of hair in the factories is much advanced these days, she points out. Earlier, the entire base of the wig would be stuck to the head, which was rather uncomfortable for the wearer. Today, only an outer ring of the base is fixed to the head and the fitting is such that even an intense dust storm would not knock off the hairpiece, she says.

That’s literally keeping your hair on in all circumstances, like Angelina Jolie did even while wearing an array of wigs in the 2009 flick ‘Salt’.

PATNA: Yet another case of ‘ pakarua vivah ’ (forced marriage) came to light in Madhubani district on Saturday when the bridegroom’s father sought the SP’s intervention in rescuing his 19-year-old son Manish Kumar from the clutches of abductors.

Dinesh Mahto (40) of Kerba village under Saharghat police station submitted a petition to Madhubani SP Satya Prakash . Mahto alleged that Bhairavsthan police did not respond when he reported the incident on March 9, three days after his son informed him over phone that he had been abducted for marriage. “My repeated pleas to trace my son went on deaf ears. Then I decided to met the SP for justice,” the hapless father told reporters in Madhubani on Sunday.

According to the complaint, Manish was abducted when he had gone to meet his elder sister at Khaira village under Bhairavsthan police station in Madhubani district on March 4. He was forced to marry a 16-year-old girl, stated to be the daughter of Ganga Prasad Mahto , at gunpoint on March 6. “Manish later informed me that he had been confined in a room and was not being allowed to move out,” Mahto told the SP.

In the meantime, photographs of the ‘pakarua vivah’ went viral on social media. “I have provided the photographs of forced marriage of my son, who is an undergraduate student. The SP has assured me prompt action in the case. Since the groom is a minor, the marriage stands illegal and action should be taken against the girl’s parents under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006,” Mahto said.

In the complaint, Mahto has accused Ganga, his wife Rajo Devi and other family members, including Vinod Narayan Mahto , Kishore Mahto and Vinod Mahto of abducting his son for marriage and wrongful confinement. The police have neither been been able to trace Manish nor arrest the accused, Mahto alleged.

When contacted, Madhubani SP said, “I have already asked the SHO of the police station concerned to take appropriate action in the case as the groom is stated to be a minor. I have also asked the investigating officer to ascertain the age of the ‘couple’ before initiating any action.”

Bhairavsthan SHO Santosh Kumar Singh said initially the police got information that it was a case of love affair and not abduction, as claimed by the boy’s father. “Now we have come to know that the girl is a minor. Raids are on to trace the boy. Our priority is to recover him safely,” he said over phone.

The state has got the dubious distinction of lodging a record number of 4,488 cases of kidnapping for marriage in 2019. Majority of the cases were reported from Khagaria , Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Nawada, Nalanda, Samastipur and Darbhanga districts. Last year, a similar case was reported in Patna district.

357,['16/03/2020'],"Extreme weather events on the rise, Delhi identifies 6 vulnerable sectors","New Delhi: Extreme weather events seem to be increasing in the capital over the last couple of decades, both in terms of temperature and precipitation. This can severely impact public health, increase power consumption, deplete water resources and damage crops, states Delhi’s newly drafted State Action Plan on Climate Change .

To cope up better, not only will Delhi have to focus on vulnerable sectors, but also on improving the transport and the land-use, the action plan adds. Delhi government has identified six “vulnerable” sectors, including healthcare, power and energy, water resources, urban planning, transport and the agriculture and forest sector, to combat climate change.

“Extreme minimum and maximum temperature events appear to be increasing in Delhi. In December 2006, Delhi had the lowest temperature since 1935 (0.2°C). In June 2007, Delhi witnessed a maximum of 44.9°C. While these extreme temperatures cannot be directly linked to climate change, variability in weather patterns and possibility of exacerbation of extreme events due to climate change are major challenges,” stated the action plan.

It added that there had been several months when temperature and precipitation were greater than standard deviation from the mean. “The hottest summer was in 1944, the coldest winter in 1935 and the wettest monsoon in 1958. However, recent years have seen similar extremes in temperature in 1978, 1988 and 1996 and precipitation in 1994, 1995, and 2003,” it added.

The annual mean temperature is expected to rise between 2.5°C and 5 °C across the country under a range of scenarios, with warming more pronounced in the northern parts of India. There may be a general increase in the precipitation in the monsoon season, but an overall decrease in the number of rainy days and an increased intensity of rainfall are likely in future years.

Similarly, projections run by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) indicate temperature changes of about 3 – 5°C and increase of about 5-10% in summer monsoon rainfall for India. It is also estimated that the number of rainy days may decrease by 20 to 30%.

“Extremes in temperature and rainfall are also expected to increase in their frequency and intensity by the end of the year 2100,” said the plan.

Delhi’s SAPCC has been drafted on the lines of the national action plan on climate change. The government of India and National Green Tribunal had directed each state to prepare an action plan to combat the local impacts and devise mitigation strategies.

Referring to the primary exposure of people to diseases like dengue and malaria and an increased mortality rate due to high temperatures, the plan states there could be a strong decline in the number of water sources, agricultural lands and forest lands in Delhi.

“Delhiites are prone to heat stress-related disorders, such as heat strokes, eye diseases like cataract, dry eyes and respiratory disorders, and skin diseases. It is estimated that for every one degree rise in temperature above 29 °C, there will be a four percent increase in risk of mortality. In addition to heat stress, the changes in climate can also lead to an increased occurrence of vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria,” said the report, adding that increase in temperature will also push power demand greatly.

359,['16/03/2020'],"Stick to fresh deadline, get back Rs 7.74 crore: HC to NMC","NMC and MSEDCL have neglected the completion work despite the HC fixing a deadline

Nagpur: In a relief of sorts for the cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has assured the civic body that it would return the nine-year-old deposit of Rs5 crore as well as the accrued interest, Rs 2.74 crore, collectively Rs7.74 crore, subject to submission of a compliance report and a fresh deadline to complete the work of shifting electric poles and transformers from roads. The next hearing is slated for March 18.

Hearing suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) filed on the basis of a TOI report dated June 25, 2018, judges Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote in an order dated March 12 said, “We would request the NMC authorities to find ways and means to expeditiously complete the entire shifting work. The authorities of the corporation can meet, deliberate and come up with a reasonable time frame to complete the pending work. On an earlier occasion, the court had made an attempt to fix the deadline as January 31. That deadline is now a passe and the work is still going on. At this juncture, we would like to leave it to the good conscience of the authorities of NMC as well MSEDCL to complete this work, which is in public interest, as soon as possible. Accordingly, a time frame may also be placed before this court.”

Talking to TOI, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar said, “NMC and MSEDCL neglected the completion work despite the HC fixing the deadline.”

The judges also said, “Following the order passed by this court on March 6, the registry has placed on record an extract of the account in which the amount deposited in this court from time to time have been shown. Through details submitted by the Canara Bank, Rs5crore deposited as a principal sum has accrued Rs2.74 crore in interest as on March 7, making the total amount available in the account Rs7.74crore. This amount is to be remitted to the NMC, informed counsel Sudhir Puranik, for carrying out the work of shifting of electric poles for which it has also incurred the expenditure,” judges said.

The bench added, “However, before any order regarding disbursement of the amount is passed, it will be necessary for this court to verify the works actually done so far and the expenditure incurred for its completion. Therefore, we request the NMC to place on record the details of the work to be completed, name of the locality where the work has been done so far and the expenditure incurred and we would also request the NMC to place on record the detailed estimated cost of all the works which are required to be carried out in terms of various orders passed by this court,” judges said.

The NMC had widened 47 major roads under the Integrated Road Development Project (IRDP) project in 2001. The NMC was to first remove the electrical poles and transformers and then widen the roads. The roads were widened leaving the electric poles and transformers unmoved, causing accidents and congestion. Between 2014 and 2018, the NMC had removed electric poles and transformers from 28 roads and work on the remaining 19 roads were pending. After HC passed strictures, NMC started works on 19 roads and is yet to complete them.

THE LONG & SHORT OF IT

* NMC widened 47 major roads under the IRDP project in 2001 without removing electrical poles and transformers

* Electric poles and transformers on roads caused accidents and traffic congestion

* HC directed the NMC to remove them in 2011 and took a deposit of Rs5 crore from NMC and MSEDCL

* Between 2014 and 2018, electric poles and transformers were removed from 28 roads and works on the remaining 19 roads pending

* TOI highlighted NMC’s apathy on June 25, 2018 which was treated as suo motu PIL by HC

* NMC issued tenders for 19 roads but is yet to complete them

* NMC requested HC to return the Rs5 crore deposit

360,['16/03/2020'],41% drop in onion exports from Halcon this year,"Representative image

NASHIK: Onion exports from the inland container depot (ICD) of Halcon at Ozar has dropped by roughly 41% so far in the current financial year (2019-20) when compared to last year’s volume of trade.

Halcon is a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and Container Corporation of India (Concor). According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Exports Development Authority (APEDA), 61,593 tonne of onions , valued at worth Rs 113 crore, were exported from Halcon between April 1 and March 15 in 2019-20. This suggests a by 40.77% drop in exports since 2018-19 when 1.04 lakh tonne of onions, worth Rs 154 crore, were exported during the corresponding period.

The Union commerce ministry had imposed a ban on onion exports in September 2019 following a sharp rise in the average wholesale prices due to scarcity of the produce. This led to the overall drop in onion exports during the current fiscal, said the Halcon sources.

The Centre lifted the ban on onion exports with effect from March 15. However, only 15 days are now remaining for the current financial year to end. Monday (March 16) will be the first day of business since the withdrawal of the ban. Therefore, the average wholesale onion prices are expected to increase by Rs 200 per quintal when the Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market, reopens on Monday.

Apart from onions, fruits like grapes, pomegranates, mangoes and fresh vegetables are also exported to various countries from the ICD and air cargo complex of Halcon here.

Halcon has developed the ICD and air cargo complex to facilitate exports by sea and air. All the custom clearance facilities are carried out here and containers are directly exported via JNPT.

361,['16/03/2020'],NMC issues one-day ultimatum to scrap dealers in Nashik,"The civic body took major drives against encroachments in the scrap markets in the past two-three years follow... Read More

NASHIK: The civic body on Sunday issued a 24-hour ultimatum to all dealers in the scrap market based on the Ambad-Satpur link road for removing encroachments.

A public notice was issued in this regard on Sunday by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) that warned of a drive to demolish illegal structures and other encroachments in the scrap markets and confiscate the materials if the encroachments are not removed on their own.

The civic body took major drives against encroachments in the scrap markets in the past two-three years following directives from the Bombay high court. But few days after the drive encroachments resurfaced.

In January 2017, the civic administration had undertaken a major drive against encroachments by scrap dealers following directives from the high court and the drive continued for almost a week.

The materials seized by the civic body had to be lifted in as many as 169 trucks and tractors to the NMC’s Satpur Club House. A total of 450 police personnel and 350 NMC officials were part of the drive that included 14 cranes, 21 earthmovers, 42 dumpers and 32 truck/tractors.

The second drive was conducted in the same areas in the same year between October 12 and 14. Thereafter, NMC had also appointed a squad to keep an eye in these areas to ensure encroachments do not resurface, but it did not help.

“We had been planning to start a demolition drive against encroachments along the Ambad-Satpur link road for the past many months, but we did not receive police force,” an NMC official said.

“Last month, we wrote to the police last month requesting security to carry out the drive. We received a nod from the police administration for providing security from this week. Hence, we have given an ultimatum of 24 hours to the encroachers to remove the encroachment on their own. The demolition drive will begin soon,” he added.

362,['16/03/2020'],Chance to handle PM’s twitter a nod to my work: Kalpana,"Hyderabad: City-based architect and a volunteer with SAHE (Society for Advancement of Human Endeavour) Kalpana Ramesh , who was recently selected as the PM ’s ‘magnificent seven’ on Women’s Day, says she felt empowered and saw it as an acknowledgment of her work.

“I have been working on this mission to conserve water for the last eight years and to be selected to be a part of a small group of seven persons from across the country came as a huge surprise and honour. I also think that water conservation is something very close to the PM’s heart and my work in urban areas may have struck a chord,” she said.

The dependence of people on water tankers was something that worried her after she moved to Hyderabad from the US more than a decade ago. “I noticed that residents in my locality in Gachibowli were heavily dependent on tankers. I began harvesting rainwater and we began saving up on water and electricity bills. In 2016, despite four months of intense summer, we did not requisition a single tanker. ”

Kalpana has been harvesting rainwater at her home by installing rainwater harvesting pits that pass through a sump and through a bed of coal and sand for purification, which can be used for many purposes. “Rainwater does not have to be purified much. Thanks to Make in India initiatives, modular RWH pits are now manufactured in Delhi. Most of the water that we use, 20% is black water and the rest is grey water, which can be recycled,” she says.

The advantage is that this helps in prevention of sewage overflow and urban flooding, which damage the roads since the waste water discharge is minimal.

The ‘Save 10k Bores’ initiative that was spearheaded by her has also helped revive defunct borewells with the help of rainwater. By directing rainwater to a harvesting pit, several borewells have been revived through community initiatives.

Taken aback by the condition of the lakes in the city, the water warrior says that most of the lakes have turned into cesspools. “During the TedX Salon event, I saw Gandipet lake which was sufficient to meet the city’s water requirements. With the lake going dry during summer, we are moving from one water body to another to meet our needs. We cannot go on sucking out the resources,” she said.

She said a collective effort is the need of the hour by involving the people. “The RWH pits that are installed in the cities are just for namesake. Also, more STPs must be set up to recycle grey water,” she said.

Quoting Niti Aayog which said that by end of 2020, cities would run out of groundwater, she said her aim is to go block by block and reach out to as many people as possible to spread awareness on 3Rs (reuse, reduce and recycle) of water.

KOLKATA: Movement of people via all nine international land checkposts in West Bengal was restricted from March 15 midnight in the wake of the evolving situation concerning the spread of novel coronavirus in the country. The Union home ministry guidelines allowed entry of Indian citizens from Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and permitted exit of citizens of these three countries through the checkposts. Monitoring was also heightened at 78 inter-state checkpoints across West Bengal.“People from Nepal and Bhutan will be allowed to go to their respective countries only through Jaigaon and Panitanki checkposts,” said Srikumar Bandyopadhyay, inspector general of SSB (Siliguri frontier). “Movement will be restricted at all the land checkposts, except Gede,” said Vibhu Goyel, district magistrate of Nadia.Movement through the checkposts came down to a trickle on Sunday. The Petrapol border looked empty with trucks lined up away from the border checkposts. Shyamali Paribahan, which used to run at least six buses every day between Kolkata and Dhaka, has been operating just one bus between Kolkata and Petrapole for the past three days. “There were 30 passengers from Kolkata on Saturday. The number came down to 18 on Sunday,” said Pranab Ghosh, of Shyamali Paribahan.“March is a crucial month for India-Bangladesh trade, which has tanked following the emerging situation,” said Kartik Chakraborty, secretary of Customs Clearing Agents’ Association. There were nearly 1,000 people, mostly Bangladeshis, at the Gede checkpost, Nadia, on Sunday morning.A total of 78 checkposts were put up across Bengal to man inter-state movements. The highest number of checkpoints were allocated in districts like Purulia, Birbhum and Uttar Dinajpur. “We may increase number of checkposts depending on the traffic,” said Gyanwant Singh, ADG (law and order) West Bengal.At the medical camps, people were being screened into four grades — A, B, C and D — depending on their symptoms. Persons falling under grade A classification, with symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty in breathing and with history of travelling to any foreign country in past 14 days are being immediately shifted to hospitals.District Magistrate Rajarshi Mitra said, “We have set up a screening camp at Madhupur at Indo-Bangla border.”Vigil was also stepped up at the checkposts in north Bengal. “The vigil from both the central and state governments is praiseworthy.

The total NOx emissions due to light and heavy good carriers have fallen by 87-94% since 2015.EPCA says there has been a considerable drop in the total number of commercial vehicles entering Delhi through these 13 border points. Construction of eastern and western peripheral expressways and collection of Environment Compensation Charge have helped the city, it adds.The SC-appointed body said it compared data provided in 2015 and in 2019-2020 to determine the average number of light good carriers and heavy good carriers entering the national capital through the border points.“The results from the 13 points in the city are substantial and suggest that the efforts to mitigate pollution have been rewarded. Compared with 2015, there is a 95 percent reduction in the total particulate load from the trucks,” said the report.While the PM emissions from light good carriers and heavy good carriers in 2015 were 0.6 and 1.2 tonnes per day, respectively, this has now come down to just 0.03 and 0.06 tonnes per day – a reduction of 95 percent in both.The study revealed that NOx emissions from the light good carriers were down by 94 percent – from 3 tonnes per day to just 0.19 tonnes per day. For heavy good carriers, it went down by 87 percent – from 10 tonnes per day to 1.30 tonnes per day.Data from SDMC , SAFAR and a CPCB report were used to study the impact of RFID toll booths on the pollution in the national capital.The EPCA report stated the total average number of light good carriers was down from 12,985 vehicles per day in 2015 to 900 vehicles per day in December 2019. Similarly, the number of two-axle trucks came down from 4,058 vehicles per day in 2015 to 871 vehicles per day in December 2019.The Supreme Court-appointed EPCA in its report also urges the apex court to issue further directions to cover 10 more border points in Delhi through similar RFID toll booths. These include Noida Major, Loni Main, Dhansa border, Kundli-II, New Seelampur 1st, Bajghera, New Kondli, Chander Nagar, Jharoda and Pul Prahladpur.

371,['16/03/2020'],Infrared thermometer shortage plagues hosps,"Kolkata: Infrared thermometers, which have seen a sudden spurt in demand, ever since the Covid-19 outbreak are short in supply. Several private hospitals in Kolkata have been finding it difficult to procure them and are waiting for supplies to arrive from China.

Along with several other drugs that have been short in supply, following import restrictions from China, infra-red thermometers, too, have been scarce.

In its visitor protocol for hospitals, the Association of National Board Accredited Institutions have recommended use of infrared thermometers to check temperature. It has also recommended use of technology and instruments to reduce physical contact. While most hospitals have been following the protocol, some said they need more thermometers. “Thermometers are imported from China so there is an import issue there. Masks and hand sanitizers have also been impacted since most manufacturers/distributors have started exporting them due to greater demand abroad,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.

Another private hospital spokesperson said they it had placed an order for thermometers two weeks back but they are yet to get them.

372,['16/03/2020'],Nashik: Forum directs insurance firm to pay in full,"Representative image

NASHIK: The District Consumers Disputes Redressal Forum has ordered an insurance company to settle the claims of two consumers in full for unlawfully ‘forcing’ a one-time settlement (OTS) on them.

In its March 5 judgement in two separate complaints filed by Harsul traders, the forum headed by its president Milind Sonawane pointed out that the claim was forcibly settled in only half the amount, despite all the factors indicating that there was a complete loss as claimed by the complainants. Hence, the forum ordered the company to settle the claims in full along with a 10 percent interest on the balance amount from Feb 15, 2016, till date with an additional Rs 10,000 for mental harassment.

The consumers — Shaikh Atik Haji Abdul Samad and Shaikh Shehbad Jahi Abdul Samad — had insured their garment shops and goods with the New India Assurance Company in their shop for Rs 15 lakh each. On July 14, 2015, both the shops were totally damaged in the riots that broke out in the village. A survey of the damages was done after riots, in which the police estimated 100 percent loss, while the insurance company put up losses at around 45 percent only.

As part of the OTS, the insurance company offered Rs 6.67 lakh to Shaikh Atik and Rs 6.08 lakh to Shaikh Shehbad. Both the traders accepted the OTS and challenged the same in consumer forum on July 28, 2017.

FG Inamdar, the counsel, for the two traders, said, “The company has thrown to the wind the recommendations by the police, that there was a hundred percent loss of the clients. Instead, the surveyor surprisingly has cut down the losses to just 45 percent.”

The insurance firm counsel SC Abhyankar stated that the losses were exaggerated by the consumers. The income tax returns and other documents reveal that the losses were calculated by the company on a fair side without any injustice upon the consumers.

The forum, however, ruled the decision in the favour of consumers after checking the relevant documents and ordered the compensation to the insurance company.

373,['16/03/2020'],Board strives to retain green character of Deolali,"Representative image

The 150-year-old Cantonment Board, Deolali , has over 50,000 residents staying in the area. Making every effort to be a smart cantonment, the board has taken several steps to make it a happy abode for residents. TOI’s Pragya Jain spoke to Ajay Kumar , chief executive officer of the cantonment board about his plans for the welfare of residents.

How do you plan to upgrade infrastructure of the cantonment area?

We have repaired all our internal and main roads to facilitate better commute for the residents. They will be in better shape with some more funds. This should solve a long unresolved issue. Apart from schools and hospital, our library and gymnasium are also functioning well. Although our shopping complex plan has hit a roadblock, we are working towards reviving it.

The board has come up with its maiden Sewage Treatment Plant with over Rs 58 crores. Please share details of the project.

We have set up our state-of-the-art Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with the capacity of 11 MLD (million litres per day) which is currently operational. At present, we are driving out the residue into the downstream of Darna river , but we have big plans in the coming year to use the residual water.

The board had distributed two coloured dustbins to the residents last year. How is the response?

We have recently equipped the board with the solid waste management plant which is working effectively. We have started generating manure from 30 tonnes of waste per day. As far as the response from the residents is concerned, our 11 ghantagadis go from door to door in all the eight wards to collect dry and wet waste separately. We monitor the ghantagadis using GPS and ensure that they collect the garbage from every ward properly.

Monsoon is about to come in a few months. It creates havoc in the cantonment area every year. How is it preparedness for it this year?

We are cleaning the drains already. Now that the STP work is complete on both sides of the roads and the roads are also repaired, there should not be any issue during monsoon this year.

There is no entertainment hub in Deolali. Do you have any plans?

Ans: As the permitted FSI (floor space index) in this area is only 0.5, it hampers the infrastructural growth in many ways. But, we have plans to construct some recreational sports faciility for children in the jogging park area. There is some idle place around it where we can put up a bumper car sport and few others for children to play. The plan should materialise within six months. We also plan to keep the green character of Deolali intact and, for which, we plan to have more trees in the newly developed areas.

In a letter addressed by DPCC member secretary Arun Mishra, a copy of which is with TOI, the agencies have been asked to ensure that there are no instances of waste and garbage burning and full compliance of the approved fuel notification, especially in the 14 highly polluted areas of the city, is done.

The 14 highly polluted areas in Delhi include Okhla Phase II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar (including Mandoli), RK Puram, Jahangirpuri and Mayapuri.

The communique has been sent to the nodal officers, civic body deputy commissioners, Delhi Development Authority, New Delhi Municipal Council , the three municipal corporation, PWD, irrigation and flood control department, CPWD, DSIIDC, DMRC , Delhi Cantonment Board and National Highways Authority of India, among others.

“In case of non-compliance, action as per the provisions contained in Section 37 of the Air Act, 1981, shall be initiated against defaulters,” the letter stated.

Earlier in February, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had shared data on how air pollution at 13 major hotspots in the capital had come down “significantly” in 2019 as compared with the last year. Rai also released a five-point action plan to bring air pollution down by one-third over the next five years.

386,['16/03/2020'],"Once again, fire breaks out at Sonsoddo garbage dump in Goa","Five firefighters were engaged in dousing the fire that broke out in the sanitary landfill-end

MARGAO: A fire broke out at the garbage dump at Sonsoddo on Sunday evening causing anxiety among locals and triggering memories of the blaze that engulfed the area for nearly a week in May last year.

Firefighters were engaged in the firefighting exercise until Sunday night.

Nitin Raikar, deputy director of fire and emergency services, who was supervising the firefighting said that five tenders were used for the operations until 8pm.

“The fire has been brought under control. We have now requisitioned mud for dousing the flames,” Raikar said, adding that the cause of the fire that broke out in the sanitary landfill-end is yet to be ascertained.

Following last year’s week-long fire at Sonsoddo, a survey worker suffered burn injuries from electrocution in another fire incident on June 5.

The level staff held by him atop the baled stack of dry waste had accidentally touched the overhead 33KV high tension electric line thereby electrocuting him. The spark generated by the short circuit had triggered a raging fire as the large stack of dry waste piled up near the legacy dump went up in flames.

The visitors had come from different states and even from across the border.Once the people started vacating Darbar Sahib, the shops outside were also closed down. Hotel owners in the city meanwhile claimed that though coronavirus was declared an epidemic on Saturday (March 14), the tourism business has been suffering for almost 15 days now.The number of bookings, they alleged, had been shrinking day by day and events were being rapidlycancelled as people were avoiding coming for large gatherings.Hotelier SP Kochar, who is also the president of Doon Valley Hotels and Restaurants Association, told TOI, “The losses that we have incurred due to the coronavirus scare are beyond imagination. State government should ensure that people are taking all preventive measures but also ensure that a panic situation isn’t created.”He further said that the losses are such that business owners fear that they won’t have enough money for daily operational costs and even for paying monthly salaries to their employees. “Many families depend on the hospitality business in our state. We must get past this panic situation soon,” added Kochar. Amit Sharma, general manager of a city-based hotel, told TOI, “The scare is such that several private event bookings and government programmes have been cancelled. The last minute cancellations are denting our business. We just hope that the situation improves soon.”Besides prominent hotels, caterers are also bearing the brunt as several orders have been cancelled in the last one week. Suresh Gupta, a caterer, told TOI, “We had orders for events at prominent schools and private gatherings. Majority of them have been cancelled now due to the coronavirus epidemic.”Meanwhile, retail shopkeepers at Paltan Bazaar said they are keeping a watch on the situation.Pankaj Masson, president of Doon Valley Mahanagar Udyog Vyapar Mandal, told TOI, “We are ensuring cleanliness in the market area and shopkeepers and other staff members are wearing masks at all times in the wake of the coronavirus threat. We are trying to ensure that the threat of the disease doesn’t affect us adversely.”(With inputs from Shivani Azad)",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/traders-brace-for-losses-as-public-places-remain-shut-due-to-covid-19-scare/articleshow/74641876.cms

Police raided Suryakumar’s house and seized computers, scanners, printers and counterfeit currency notes amounting to Rs 2.64 lakh.

Preliminary inquiry revealed that Mohammed, who was earlier arrested for circulating counterfeit currency, had taught Suryakumar, who was facing huge losses in his business, how to make the fake notes. Mohammed asked him to make the notes and agreed to circulate them with Mahendran’s help.

Police had booked the trio under sections 489 (C) (possession of forged or counterfeit curreny notes or bank notes), 489 (D) (making or possessing instruments or materials for forging or counterfeiting currency notes or bank -notes) of the Indian Penal Code.

Listening to motivational songs, reading Gita’","The first Covid-19 patient from the city, who went through a traumatic experience after his name was made public, now wants to concentrate only on positive things. The IT company employee is trying to derive strength to defeat the virus. For those who may land in isolation, they should trust the doctors and follow instructions, he tells Chaitanya Deshpande over phone from the isolation ward at Mayo Hospital

It was a great tour indeed. During our stay in USA, we had been to Atlanta and Washington DC. All our meetings went well, and I returned to Nagpur via Doha with two of my colleagues. I was not feeling well for sure, but I never thought in my wildest dreams that it could have been infected with novel coronavirus.Assuming it to be a common cough and cold, I went to our family physician. After treating me for a couple of days, he advised me to get tested for novel coronavirus. It was for the first time in many years that when I visited a government hospital. I submitted my swab samples. On March 11, late in the evening, the authorities informed me that I was tested positive for Covid-19 and I must stay in the isolation ward of Mayo Hospital.We were completely scared and confused. But doctors here assured me that there was nothing to worry. I was suffering from fever, cough, cold, body ache and sore throat when I got admitted to this isolation ward. I must tell you, doctors here are very kind people. They know their job best. They are treating me with all compassion and care. My opinion about government hospitals was different, but the facilities at Mayo are very good.I started feeling well right after taking the first dose of medicines here. But the next day brought a major psychological trauma for me and my family. Health department officials had revealed all my details to a local newspaper. The paper went against the basic principles of medical privacy and humanity by printing all details. While I was down with fever and my family members were in another hospital getting themselves tested, we started receiving phone calls and enquiries from all over. My company colleagues also suffered a lot. Even today, I keep my cell phone off for most part of the day. Whenever I want to talk, I switch it on and make calls.Well, I don’t want to think about the negative things anymore. I want to concentrate only on positive things. Plenty of them happening for sure. I am feeling well now, taking good rest from the last five days, having good food and ample fluids — especially electoral solution. I was never fond of social media, so keeping myself away from these things. I go through newspapers but not in details. I know that my wife and one of my colleagues have also tested positive and kept in isolation. I am sure, all of us will come out of this soon.Yes, I am sure of it, because I believe in god. The only book I am regularly reading during this stay in isolation is Gita. It gives me strength to fight like a soldier against this enemy of life.Sometimes, I make it a point to listen to music and I prefer motivational songs. I can understand that many more people may test positive and land into isolation. For them, I will only say, keep patience and believe in God. Trust the doctors serving you and follow instructions.Who is bigger? Me or this virus? Of course, the spirit of life is going to win. I am going to win. Will see you soon.

390,['16/03/2020'],"No fancy proposals, Trichy corpn to go self-disciplined this FY","Trichy: The budget tabled by Trichy City Corporation after completing its silver jubilee has offered little for the residents to celebrate. Foreseeing a dip in revenue generation, which is unprecedented, the local body has avoided fancy proposals in the budget for 2020-21, and focused on completing the ongoing projects and proposals to improve basic amenities.

In the budget for 2019-20, the corporation’s projected revenue (excluding Smart City mission and AMRUT funds) was estimated at Rs 390.09 crore. But in 2020-21, the revenue generation was projected at Rs 380.13 crore. The Rs 10-crore fall was the first of its kind in the past decade. Corporation officials attributed the fall in revenue to the rollback of revision of property tax. But, experts said the lack of focus on collecting outstanding tax and failure to initiate fresh revenue generation proposals are the major causes.

If the Smart City mission and AMRUT project funds were included in calculating the revenue, the figure woukld have been much higher. But the officials acknowledged that the corporation’s coffer is not in a good shape. To curtail spending, the corporation has presented a simple budget for the financial year 2020-21 with only four new proposals using general funds in basic sectors such as solid waste management, education and greenery development.

""The ongoing and proposed projects will be completed. We will not try new projects by experimenting with taxpayers’ money. So no new fancy proposals. Successful projects implemented elsewhere will be emulated in the city,"" S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, Trichy City Corporation, told TOI.

Through Smart City fund, the corporation has proposed to improve basic amenities such as water supply and underground drainage (UGD). However, residents have to wait for a few more years to get good roads. While the projected revenue has declined, the corporation’s projected expenditure towards salary, pension, maintenance and repair work has increased.

""To augment revenue, the civic body should identify its properties and monetise them. Maintenance of public parks can be given to self-help group women after introducing an entry fee for visitors,"" H Ubaidullah, a resident of KK Nagar, said.

The residents have demanded the administrators to focus on improving revenue generation to utilise the resources for the city’s development and requirements.

She is in pain, but getting medical help in the Covid-19-hit country for non-Italians is almost impossible, she says.The woman from Bengaluru is among the 100-odd persons from India still stuck in Rome, even as 218 Indians were airlifted from Milan the other day. “I desperately want to be with my husband. I tried to take a ticket on Saturday but there weren’t any available. There was one flight on Sunday, but I couldn’t book as I wouldn’t have been able to make it to the airport on time from the place I am staying,” says Akshita, a robotics developer as she speaks over the phone.A Malappuram native who is also stuck in Italy, with whom TOI managed to talk to, says a medical team from India arrived the other day and that their swabs were taken on Saturday. “Embassy officials told us it would take a few days for them to get the results from India. We are stuck in a very dangerous environment without basic necessities, including medical care,” says Muhammed Safvan, who is pursuing MBM in Italy, adding that he has been going to airport every day for the past five days, hoping to reach home.“I took an Air India ticket on March 11, hoping that there wouldn’t be an issue with the Indian flight. But many who bought tickets of other private airlines, were allowed to go. We were barred from flying because we didn’t have a Covid-19 negative certificate. Getting such a certificate in Italy, where the disease is rampant, is impossible. We are now staying with a Malayali, who lives here. However, there are at least a dozen who haven’t left the airport in the past five days. I gave the samples for testing on Saturday, some say that it would take three to seven days for the results to come,” says Safvan.Meanwhile, Shyam Kurup, a volunteer based in Kochi who has been sending SOS messages on social media urging the Centre to bring the stranded Indians back, says those who booked Air India flights were the ones who got stuck because the general of civil aviation had issued a circular that they need to obtain certificates of having tested negative for Covid-19. Now, they don’t have money to buy another ticket.“Many private airlines were not insisting on such certificates. So, passengers who booked their tickets in those flights were able to leave Italy. But those who booked Air-India flight were stranded. Now, without a refund, they can’t book another flight,” Shyam says.Another NRI stuck in Rome, Diyana Kasturi from Indore, says on phone that she doesn’t understand why some people were evacuated without test results when they were asked to stay back till results arrive. “Why are we not told when results would come,” she asks furiously, adding that in Rome, they could be fined 280 euros if they venture out for food more than twice.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74645384,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-128665,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/many-still-stranded-in-italy-desperate-to-return-home/articleshow/74642760.cms
392,['16/03/2020'],Why 350 parks in Hubballi-Dharwad are little more than wastelands,"A garden in Dollars colony in Hubballi

Hubballi: Taking a cue from their Bengaluru counterpart, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation tried to rope in residents’ welfare organisations to maintain garden and parks. Then came a plan to use corporate social responsibility funds to develop them. As of now, of the 421 gardens and parks in the twin cities, 71 are maintained by HDMC while the remaining are yet to be developed.

Most parks in residential areas are little more than open ground overrun with weeds and shrubs. There is no fencing even to demarcate the park.

Former mayor Shivu Hiremath, who had floated a plan to develop gardens and parks with CSR funds, said: “I had a meeting with representatives of companies in this regard, but by the time it could materialise, my tenure ended. I don’t know what happened to that initiative after I left.”

“HDMC sets aside Rs 1 crore-Rs 1.5 crore in its budget every year but this meagre amount is not serving any purpose,” said Satish Merunde, a resident of Silver Park. “HDMC seems to have forgotten its basic duty, given the pathetic condition of the gardens. Our locality has just one park and it is not developed. For morning walks, we to Srinivas Nagar where the park has been developed,” said Srilekha Chouhan, a resident of Shimla Nagar.

HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said additional provisions have been made this time around to develop parks. “For maintenance of gardens by the Nere Hore Samiti, HDMC has chalked out guidelines and it has been sent for administrator approval,” Itnal said. “Twelve residents’ welfare associations are already maintaining gardens and we have received plenty of requests from other associations as well in this regard. The real problem is to develop the gardens. We have asked the horticulture department to develop and maintain some of the gardens. For CSR fund, we are preparing estimations,” he said.

This expert advice has spawned scores of online hand-washing tutorials set to the tune of Happy Birthday. However, one has to admit, singing it over and over can get a bit monotonous, no?And so, last week saw Twitter user @JenMonnier compile a list of songs with 20-second choruses to get your groove going while you soap up. With classics hits like Dolly Parton‘s Jolene and Beyonce’s Love On Top, the thread soon went viral, but the crowd wanted more.Enter, William Gibson – 17-year-old student – whose not-for-profit website Wash Your Lyrics, lets you pick a song, and generates a poster with the lyrics set to the 13-step hand-washing routine suggested by the NHS.The site generated 175,000 posters in the first three days of its launch on March 9, and has become the torch-bearer of an entirely new genre of music – ‘hand-washing anthems’.As per Gibson, Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen tops the list of hand-washing tunes so far. Stayin’ Alive, by The BeeGees – also a popular choice for administering CPR – is not far behind.Are you looking to spice up your hand-washing routine? Here are some of the classic bops that won’t fail you.Metal heads need to look no further than the Rage Against The Machine's very own recommendation - Killing In The Name Of. The band re-posted a hand-washing poster of their song, thanks to which you can wash your hands and head-bang at the same time.For punk rockers, there's All The Small Things - suggested by the band Blink-182 itself on social media. Classic rock fans can wash and jam to Queen and Eagles' tunes, besides the Rolling Stones' hit, (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.Miley Cyrus' got your back. The artiste tweeted a hand-washing poster for her song The Climb, urging followers to ""wash your damn hands"".According to @JenMonnier, Lizzo's Truth Hurts, Prince's Raspberry Beret, Britney Spears' Toxic and Beyonce's Love On Top can work quite well too.Mariah Carey, who cancelled her March concert in Honolulu over the outbreak, gave quite the handwashing performance on social media with her twin kids to the remix of her 1995 hit Fantasy featuring late Wu-Tang Clan member rapper, Ol’ Dirty Bastard.Iranian actor Danial Kheirkhah's elaborate and hilariously theatrical hand-washing routine, set to German classical music composer Johannes Brahms' Hungarian Dance No 1 combines hygiene with symphony.The Opera America has also offered more suggestions like, the choruses from Habanera (Carmen), Der Hölle Rache - Queen of the Night aria (The Magic Flute), Brindisi (La Traviata), Hallelujah Chorus (Handel's Messiah).“Badshah’s Yeh Ladki Pagal is an ideal song to listen to and croon while cleansing your hands because the hook of the song is quite catchy and you can groove to it while scrubbing your palms, and in between the fingers. You can, in fact, move your hips while singing it too!” suggests Sagar Shekhar, a guitarist and vocalist, from Mumbai.Nikita Kuwadekar, a jazz vocalist from Pune, adds, “Could any song be better than Jai Jai Shiv Shankar (from War) groove to while keeping coronavirus at bay?""""It’s ironic, but Zara Zara Touch Me Touch Me seems the perfect number to hand wash to. You can repeat the intro twice in 20 seconds, time taken to wash your hands. While you should technically be avoiding touching, kissing, and holding, during this time, but you can at least sing about it!"" quips Tina Toppo, vocalist, Pune.Punjabi-Thai singer Rimi Nique suggests, Naach Meri Jaan, ""because it's a sing-along. Oohhh oh ohhh naach meri jaan naach, wash your hands jaan, wash, sun. It's perfect for both dancing, and washing your hands.""Even ministers and health officials have jumped into the fray, and are offering song recommendations of their own. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock suggested Happy Birthday and God Save The Queen as the top hand-washing tracks, while the ex-minister of health in Ukraine, Ulyana Suprun, said that one could also sing the lesser known, but interesting- sounding number Putin – khuilo! (that translates to Putin is a d***head) in English.Vietnam's Ministry of Health's catchy PSA has also garnered appreciation worldwide. Featuring lyrics such as ""push back the virus corona, corona"" - it has been described as a ""genuine club banger"" by talk show host John Olivier. The nation's Tik Tok-ers have also choreographed a hand-washing dance routine to the number, that has since gone viral.The rock band, Foals, have released a new video for their number Wash Off, which features the protagonist doing just what the name suggests. With a timer at the bottom of the screen, the hands can be seen earnestly scrubbing to the tune.Rita Wilson - who is currently quarantined alongside husband actor Tom Hanks in Australia, after they were tested positive for the COVID-19 virus - took to social media to seek quarantine-friendly tunes.""Hi guys!I want to make a playlist for people self-quarantining.Something that might relate to isolation, perhaps? Can you send some song ideas that I can add? Also, what should we call it? Quarantine Choruses? This is what one does in quarantine. U think of stuff like this.(sic)"" she posted on Twitter.

Featuring songs like Toxic by Britney Spears, Jesus Take The Wheel by Carrie Underwood, Cough Syrup by Young and the Giant and SICKO MODE by Travis Scott, they have elicited both disgust and a few laughs among netizens.While a video of Gloria Gaynor washing and moving to her own hit (the very aptly named) I Will Survive had many cheering, others weren't so pleased with the fact that she left the tap running and water flowing while she soaped up.

Sources close to some such contestants said that they had kept money ready in a bid to woo voters, but now, with the postponement lasting at least six weeks, they are in a fix.

“It is difficult to keep liquid cash in our possession for such a long time. It is not safe for us as well. We will see what can be done,” said a candidate from the city who is contesting the polls.

A candidate from YSRC said that he had fixed his daughter’s marriage in March five months ago. Then, when the notification came out, he had had to postpone the ceremony. Now, he will have to rejig his plans again.

A TDP candidate fighting the GVMC elections said that they had already hired people to help in poll-related work like preparing food for cadre and making campaign arrangements and now those plans will also have to be rescheduled.

“For politicians like us, polls are like a big festival. My daughter has come from the US. Now she is in a dilemma about whether to stay for six weeks or go back,” said another contestant from TDP.

YSRC’s K Gopal Reddy, who is active in ward number 44, said that he had gone to court seeking GVMC elections in 2017. Now, just when the elections were supposed to happen, they got postponed again, said a bemused Reddy.

395,['16/03/2020'],"Narendra Modi to Saarc Countries: Time to collaborate, not grow apart","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a collaborative approach to dealing with Covid-19 in South Asia with shared data, expertise and a fund to which India will make an initial contribution of $10 million even as Pakistan sought to muddy waters by raising Kashmir at a conversation of Saarc leaders over video conferencing on Sunday.Chairing the unique video-conference of Saarc heads of government, Modi suggested a fund; rapid response teams of Indian doctors, specialists and testing gear for use by Saarc nations; online training for emergency response staff of participating nations; and video-conferences by doctors for distance diagnosis.Towards the end of the interaction, Pakistani PM Imran Khan ’s special assistant on health, representing Khan, made a reference to Kashmir. Responding to a prompt from the background, Mirza said, “It is a matter of concern that Covid-19 has been reported from Jammu & Kashmir and in view of health emergency, it is imperative that the lockdown in the territory must be lifted immediately.” Khan was the only head of government to be absent from the conference call.Government sources said they were not surprised at Pakistan’s determination to raise Kashmir on an occasion intended to deal with a health emergency. Modi, who was apparently not surprised at the reference, ignored the comment and summed the discussions stressing on offers on cooperation. Earlier, he had said that the shared challenge was an opportunity to collaborate, rather than grow apart.“Pakistan is trying to politicise a humanitarian initiative. It’s a pity they chose to be churlish on this occasion. From our point of view, we have the political will to see this through. We could have kept Pakistan out. We chose to bring them in,” an official source said.Sources said the government will continue to demonstrate the political will and ability to lead in the region. In fact, Australian PM Scott Morrison said in Canberra on Sunday that in his chat with Modi, the latter had proposed a similar video-conference by G20 leaders, and that Australia would support it. On Monday, the G7 leaders are expected to hold a similar exercise among themselves.In his opening remarks, Modi said, “South Asia is densely populated. As developing countries, all of us have significant challenges in terms of access to healthcare facilities. Our people-to-people ties are ancient and our societies are deeply inter-connected .Therefore, we must all prepare together, we must all act together and we must all succeed together.”The video conference showed in sharp relief the disconnect between most of the region’s countries and Pakistan. Except for Afghanistan, whose President Ashraf Ghani called for a different approach than closing borders, almost all other countries expressed willingness to work with India on this issue, including on post-epidemic economic revival measures. India has already sent a rapid response team to Maldives to deal with their Covid-19 challenge. The conversation also made it clear how exposed South Asian countries were to the three hubs of the Covid-19 outbreak — China, Iran and Italy.Ghani said Afghanistan’s greatest vulnerability was the open border with Iran which has been overwhelmed by the number of infections and deaths from coronavirus Ibrahim Solih of Maldives highlighted the peculiar problems his country has — while the islands are spread out enough to create the space needed for quarantines or isolation, medical treatment made it imperative to come to Male, which is bursting and with inadequate infrastructure. Gotabaya Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka was more concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on the region’s economy and asked for a ministerial-level group to assess and recommend ways forward. Lotay Tshering of Bhutan was equally concerned that the pandemic would affect smaller and vulnerable economies disproportionately. Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh offered to host a secretariat to monitor health emergencies now and in future. Modi agreed to arrange for a meeting of trade officials to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.This was the first time since 2014 that all the region’s leaders gathered together to find solutions to immediate problems. It also gave India an opportunity to bat on the front foot by taking a leadership role in the region. A senior government official said, “India also agreed to share the self-designed software of India’s health information platform for disease surveillance with all other countries, to help them track the spread of the disease. India has offered ICMR’s help to set up a research platform for sharing ideas for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for diseases.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74643896,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1353219,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/time-to-collaborate-not-grow-apart-pm-to-saarc/articleshow/74643886.cms

Many believe that rising temperatures would protect us from being infected. But that is not true. Many people are still down with cough and cold even after the summer has made its presence felt.”“In such a scenario, the risk of catching the virus is high. This is not just about elections. When there is such a health scare, people should not gather in large numbers. The risk of catching Covid-19 is high and old people as well as people with low immunity would be highly vulnerable,” the doctor added.However, state medical health authorities have exuded confidence. The said that they are confident about being able to deal with the disease.Dr S Tirupathi Rao, DMHO of Visakhapatnam said, “We are confident of being able to prevent spread. The government is taking pro-active measures such as screening travellers and spreading awareness. We are also informing people about advisories issued by the Union government.”Meanwhile, Dr Ambati Naga Radhakrishna, a member of the backward classes (BC) cell of YSRC said, “The risk of the virus spreading in India is far less than in colder countries. In southern India where conditions are hot and humid, it will be difficult for the virus to thrive.”",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74641878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-152426,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/doctors-heave-sigh-of-relief-as-elections-get-postponed/articleshow/74641879.cms

Vijayasai Reddy said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has approached the governor about the postponement. He added that the elections have been postponed at the behest of Chandrababu Naidu.

“The decision has come as a shock and as a reminder about the manner in which Chandrababu Naidu can make others playact on his behalf,” the YSRC’s Rajya Sabha MP said.

State minister for municipal administration and urban development Botcha Satyanarayana said, “The issue is with the sudden decision of the election commission. We clearly see Naidu’s had in this.”

Both Botcha and Vijayasai alleged that the decision was taken to prevent YSRC from getting a clean sweep in the elections.

Botcha further said that the TDP chief was an old hand at using undemocratic means and methods and was against the development of the state and the process of democratisation.

“The whole local body election exercise was taken up to ensure better governance for people and their empowerment,” the minister said.

Meanwhile, two people from TDP— Dr Zaheer Ahmed and Dr Bangarayya joined the YSRC. Dr Bangarayya had contested the state elections on a TDP ticket in 2019 from Payakaraopeta.

400,['16/03/2020'],"Now, political parties get time to rework their campaign strategy","Visakhapatnam: The postponement of elections to local bodies by at least six weeks owing to the outbreak of Covid-19 will give time to political parties to rework their plans. The local body polls were being conducted within a very short period of time and this delay might help the parties plan well.

While Visakhapatnam will elect a mayor after more than a decade, Vizianagaram will be electing its first mayor through these local polls. Consequently, with Visakhapatnam slated to become the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh and Vizianagaram electing its first mayor, the elections to local bodies will be a high-stakes affair, whenever they are held.

YSRC, through its addresses, has made it clear that the ruling party of the state is vying for a clean sweep in the municipal polls as well. YSRC had won all nine assembly seats and the sole Lok Sabha seat in the state and general elections in 2019.

“We are confident of repeating the 2019 feat. TDP can win less than 10% of local body seats, if at all,” said Botcha Satyanarayana, state minister of municipal administration and urban development. The minister added that the delay will give the party time to mollify rebels and get them back on board.

Meanwhile, the TDP leadership has alleged that the YSRC is exuding such confidence because of its rough tactics. “Their confidence probably comes from the undemocratic tactics they are using,” said Aditi Gajapathi Raju of TDP.

Raju said, “As far as the Vizianagaram municipal corporation elections are concerned, TDP is quite confident of putting up a good show. The cadre is disappointed that elections have been postponed but orders are being followed.”

The situation is similar in Visakhapatnam where both parties are treating it as a high stakes affair. YSRC has told its cadre to fight and win a majority and break the hold that the TDP MLAs have in the core city.

With 394 MPTC seats in Vizianagaram, the number of uncontested seats is over 12 per cent. TDP sources alleged that candidates who have won uncontested are associated with YSRC. YSRC however has refuted the allegations with Botcha Satyanarayana saying, “Why is only TDP making such allegations.” tnn

The 57 persons on the hoardings in Lucknow are yet to be declared guilty,” says a legal expert.“Also, unlike reports in a section media, the tribunal’s verdict can be challenged before the high court and the Supreme Court,” he adds.Taking a suo motu cognisance of recovery hoardings put up by the Lucknow administration on March 5, the high court on September 9 had ordered the state government to remove the hoardings and file a compliance report by March 16. The HC order were challenged by the Yogi government in the Supreme Court, which referred the issue to a larger bench.On Friday, the UP cabinet cleared a proposal to promulgate the ‘recovery ordinance’, citing a 2009 order of the Supreme Court to set up a tribunal or other competent authorities for the recovery of compensation in such cases.As per the rules of the ordinance released by the Yogi government on Sunday, the state government is empowered to set up one or more compensation claims tribunal to be chaired by a retired district judge and members from the executive, not less than the rank of additional commissioner. In case of more than one tribunal, the state government will have to declare the division of area for the tribunals. The claims commissioner can also engage surveyors and assesses to record the loss of the property.Under the new law, any private person /individual can also move a petition before the tribunal for claiming the compensation, provided the petitioner had not claimed it from the insurance company or any other such agency.Another provision of the ordinance mentions clearly that the claim petition has to be made before the tribunal within three months and the tribunal will pronounce the verdict within a reasonable time.No other civil court will hear such cases of recovery of the compensation and all such matters related to loss of property during agitation will be taken up by the claims tribunal only.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74643904,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2098319,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-govt-to-set-up-claims-tribunal-for-property-damage/articleshow/74643902.cms
405,['16/03/2020'],"Travel agents dupe nurse, others with visa promise","Ahmedabad: A 22-year-old woman from the Ramol area of city on Saturday filed a complaint of cheating against seven travel agents who had cheated her and six others of Rs 70.50 lakh with promise of sending them to Canada, either on work permit or students visa, via Bangkok in Thailand.

In her FIR with Ramol police, Bhumi Chaudhari, who has recently completed her nursing course from Gujarat Cancer Society (GCS) institute, states that she was trying to get a work permit visa of Canada and her uncle introduced her to a travel agent named Ashok Chavda.

When Chaudhari met Chavda on January 25 this year, he told her that she would have to first go to Bangkok on visa on arrival from where she would get a work permit visa for Canada. Chavda told her that she would have to pay Rs 17.50 lakh to get the work permit visa.

After this, Chaudhari along with six others were sent to Bangkok on January 28 where six travel agents received them at the airport and took them to a hotel. One of the travel agents identified as Kuldeep Bansal told Chaudhari and others that their visa process for Canada will be completed within 15 days.

Assured with the promise of travel agents, Chaudhari and others gave them around Rs 70.50 lakh till February 12. However, the travel agents did not provide them their visas nor their original passports. Chaudhari along with others obtained emergency passport and returned to India.

Later, they began seeking their money back from the travel agents but they went incommunicado after which she approached police and filed a complaint of cheating, breach of trust and criminal conspiracy against seven travel agents.

406,['16/03/2020'],Does anti-defection law need an overhaul?,"Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from Congress and joined BJP, the party of his grandmother and two aunts. Madhya Pradesh Congress satraps would have welcomed Jyotiraditya’s exit. But what is worrying them is the ‘tremors from the falling of a big tree’ — the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs.

A major concern for the Congress leadership is the looming danger of losing the reins of a big state, earned with a razor-thin majority after a hard fought election in December 2018. As the Karnataka experiment gets repeated in Madhya Pradesh, the worrying factor for democracy is that MLAs are happily courting disqualification or tendering resignations for a better deal in the new dispensation.

The Tenth Schedule, inserted in the Constitution in 1985 after bitter experiences of governments falling prey to defections of MLAs, is silent on this new resignation formula to destabilise governments.

The 1960s and 1970s political arena was marked by ‘Aya Rams and Gaya Rams’, the coinage credited to Haryana MLA Gaya Lal who changed his loyalty to parties thrice in a short span of time in 1967. Haryana had two other stalwarts in the defection game — Rao Birendra Singh and Bhajan Lal .

Bhajan Lal in 1980 had defected to Congress after Indira Gandhi returned to power post-Emergency. He along with his ministers and MLAs merged with Congress to remain chief minister. Probably that made Parliament in March 1985 to insert Tenth Schedule, which then had validated defection of one-third of MLAs of a party and merger of one party with another if two-thirds of MLAs of the merging party favoured it.

The Tenth Schedule gave the Speaker of Lok Sabha and assemblies unquestionable power in deciding petitions seeking disqualification of MLAs under the anti-defection law. This was challenged in the Supreme Court, which by a slender 3-2 majority in Kihoto Hollohan case [1992 Supp (2) SCC 651] ruled that Speakers, while deciding petitions under anti-defection law, exercised judicial powers akin to a tribunal and hence their decisions would be subject to scrutiny of HCs and the SC.

Since then, the SC has been called upon numerous times to decide the validity of Speakers’ decisions under the anti-defection law, which indicated rampancy of defection and Tenth Schedule’s limited deterrence effect.

Finding split and merger concessions in the Tenth Schedule getting exploited repeatedly, the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajapayee through Parliament effected the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003, which prohibited defections through split and merger. It also capped the number of ministers in a government as experience showed that the carrot of ministerial berths to engineer defections led to jumbo-sized council of ministers.

With the anti-defection law plugging exit routes for MLAs and given the mind-boggling cost of re-election, it was hoped that there would be political stability in governance after exploration of opportunities for post-poll alliances between parties.

But with the political manoeuvres of BJP, having been entrenched in federal governance, increasingly resembling the machinations of Congress in the last quarter of the 20th century, the anti-defection law appears to be in need of some urgent surgical treatment through constitutional amendment.

Penning the minority opinion in Kihoto Hollohan judgment, Justice J S Verma had noticed that under Articles 103 and 192, disqualification of MPs/MLAs was to be decided by the President/governor after consulting the Election Commission. Finding that Tenth Schedule vested disqualification powers with the Speaker, he had raised doubts about the impartiality of Speaker.

“Speaker being an authority within the House and his tenure being dependent on the will of the majority therein, likelihood of suspicion of bias could not be ruled out. The question as to disqualification of a member has adjudicatory disposition and, therefore, requires the decision to be rendered in consonance with the scheme for adjudication of disputes,” the minority opinion had said.

A similar view on erosion of traditional impartiality attached to Speaker was expressed by the SC through Justice N V Ramana in a recent judgment in the case relating to disqualification of Karnataka rebel MLAs.

The limitations of anti-defection law were evident from the fact that 17 MLAs, who resigned/were disqualified by the Speaker for anti-party activities, sought re-election and 11 of them got re-elected. Ten of them got ministerial berths in the B S Yediyurappa government that was formed after the H D Kumaraswamy government collapsed.

The SC in the Karnataka rebel MLAs case had said, “His (Speaker’s) political affiliations cannot come in the way of adjudication (of disqualification petitions)… There is a growing trend of Speakers acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral. Additionally, political parties are indulging in horse-trading and corrupt practices, due to which citizens are denied stable governments. In these circumstances, Parliament is required to reconsider strengthening certain aspects of the Tenth Schedule, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged.”

Probably, the solution lies in creating an independent authority to deal with disqualification of MPs and MLAs under the Tenth Schedule. Justice Verma in Hollohan judgment had said, “Tenure of the Speaker, who is the authority in the Tenth Schedule to decide this dispute, is dependent on the continuous support of the majority in the House and, therefore, he does not satisfy the requirement of such an independent adjudicatory authority; and his choice as the sole arbiter in the matter violates an essential attribute of the basic feature.” It is now for Parliament to decide.

Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi has decided to tackle the problem of a crippling shortage of masks for its staff by itself, thus freeing itself from the fluctuations of the market. KIMS has ordered a tailor to stitch 300 masks for the students pursuing their postgraduation at the hospital.KIMS superintendent Dr Arunkumar and resident medical officer Dr Siddeshwar Katkol confirmed to the media that they had placed an order for 300 cloth masks. However, members in the medical fraternity are not chuffed about the move. They are wondering if KIMS is faced with a dearth of funds, while also questioning the choice of cloth masks, which many said was not very effective in protecting those who donned it.Many doctors at KIMS pointed out that cloth masks were not in the least effective against the novel coronavirus. “We have been appealing to the hospital administration to provide us with N-95 masks to all the doctors, nurses and all staff at the hospital. But our demand has remained on the paper,” said a KIMS doctor.Another doctor said that the cloth masks could not be worn for more than four hours, since they grew wet, and grime accumulated very easily on them. “N-95 masks are effective to prevent contracting of infections when we are treating or consulting,” the doctor said.Many doctors, frustrated with waiting for KIMS to provide protective masks and wary of continuing to work without them for long, decided to spend money from their pockets to purchase the gear. They said that KIMS was providing each department with just 500ml of hand sanitiser, which was woefully inadequate, given the sheer number of patients that each received.A senior doctor expressed outrage with suggestions of those working at hospitals not needing masks. “We are working in conditions where risk is very high. One never knows when one will encounter a Covid-19 patient. From the security guard to doctors, all of us must wear masks for self-protection. We are all at risk,” he added.KIMS director Dr Ramalingappa Antartani, however, refuted charges of the hospital facing a shortage of N-95 masks. “We have 870 N-95 masks, 12,000 triple layer masks, 370 bottles of hand sanitisers.

Law minister P C Sharma said on Saturday evening that the Governor’s directive to the Speaker to hold a floor test on Monday is “only a message and not a direction”, indicating that the make-or-break division may not happen on the opening day of the budget session.The ‘cause list’ of the assembly, release around 9pm on Sunday, doesn’t mention floor test. It only mentions two programmes — Governor Lalji Tandon ’s address and motion of thanks.Floor test is not the only thing uncertain. There’s suspense over whether the 22 breakaway MLAs of Scindia faction, lodged in Bengaluru since March 9, will return before the expected floor test.While chief minister Kamal Nath reiterated that he is ready to face the floor test, Speaker Narayan Prasad Prajapati sparked speculation by saying he wouldn’t reply to “hypothetical questions on the floor test” and will take decision in the House.Congress ministers and even the Speaker have expressed concern over the coronavirus spread across the country. “From media reports, I came to know that the President of a country is also infected by coronavirus. In the present situation, everyone is worried, so am I,” said Prajapati.Asked if he would carry out the floor test in the House, as directed by the Governor, the Speaker said, “This will come tomorrow. I cannot answer hypothetical questions or be a part of any fluke. I had spoken about established procedures and have read out the power of a Speaker. The answer lies in it,” he said.Advocate general Shashank Shekhar attended a meeting with CM Nath, Digvijaya Singh and Congress leader and eminent lawyer Vivek Tankha at CM House on Sunday evening. Asked if it was mandatory for the speaker to hold the floor test on Monday, Shekhar told reporters: “It’s the exclusive domain of the speaker. What the governor has written to the speaker is between the two of them.”As of Sunday evening, the assembly strength is 222 — after six resignations and death of two MLAs — putting the majority mark at 112. If the 16 other resignations, in the wake of Scindia’s quitting Congress are accepted, Congress would be down to 92 members in the House, which would then have a strength of 206, putting the majority mark at 104.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mp-mlas-back-but-floor-test-uncertain/articleshow/74643910.cms

Coming out of the Raj Bhavan around 12.20 am, Nath told reporters that the governor had called him for a discussion.

""The governor told me that the proceedings of the state assembly should be carried out smoothly. So I told him that I will talk to the speaker in this regard on Monday morning,"" he said.

Asked if the floor test will be conducted on Monday as directed by the governor, the chief minister said the speaker will take a decision on this.

Nath said he has already communicated to the governor in writing that his government is ready for the floor test but the MLAs held ""captive"" should be released first.

After 22 Congress MLAs submitted their resignations last week, Tandon had on Saturday directed Nath to seek a trust vote just after his (governor's) address on the first day of the Budget session beginning Monday.

The Congress alleges that these 22 MLAs who submitted their resignations are being held ""captive"" by the BJP.

Madhya Pradesh assembly speaker N P Prajapati has accepted the resignations of six of these MLAs.

After visiting Noida as the CM, this is another jinx that he would break. He is the fourth CM from the saffron party to head politically most crucial states in the country.

Before Yogi, Kalyan Singh , Ram Prakash Gupta and Rajnath Singh of the BJP had served as UP chief ministers but none could complete three years. Before him, Kalyan Singh, in his second stint, had the longest tenure of a little over two years between 1997 and 1999.

Yogi’s completion of three years is seen by BJP leaders as a big accomplishment. “Yogi Adityanath is one such leaders who broke many jinx, including the one going to Noida. He is also one of the few CMs who toured almost all the states and took various public centric steps,” said UP BJP spokesperson, Rakesh Tripathi .

416,['16/03/2020'],Online test for govt jobs to come with anti-cheating tools,"NEW DELHI: Anti-cheating tools will be built into the proposed online common eligibility test (CET) for recruitment to central government jobs, with officials saying the exam algorithm will ensure both encryption and jumbling of questions to rule out copying by candidates.

Minister of state of personnel Jitendra Singh said the CET will be designed to “cheat the cheater”. “Candidates will realise that they will not gain anything by climbing up walls and windows,” he said in reference to a viral photograph from a school in Bihar which showed men scampering up the exam centre’s wall, standing on sun shades and passing answer chits from the windows to examinees inside.

Secretary (personnel) C Chandramouli added, “The online exam will offer full security against copying/cheating or leakage of question paper. The algorithm will ensure that each candidate gets a different question paper, with order of the questions jumbled. The paper itself will be encrypted at the central server.”

The CET is proposed to be conducted by the National Recruitment Agency (NRA), a universal body mooted for holding entry-level recruitment examination for Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ posts that are currently handled by different recruitment agencies such as Staff Selection Commission , Railway Recruitment Board and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection.

Singh said the common, online exam by a single recruitment agency — the scores for which will be valid for three years — will cut costs, inconvenience and time taken for recruitment process for non-gazetted jobs, both for the government recruiting agency as well as the candidates. “It is a socio-economic reform aimed at ensuring a level playing field by facilitating recruitment to government jobs irrespective of a candidate’s social status and availability of resources,” he said.

Chandramouli said with the launch of CET, possibly with the recruitment cycle of 2021, the recruitment time for government posts may be reduced to as little as three months from the 12-18 months taken at present.

Around 2.5 crore aspirants currently take separate, multiple examinations conducted by different recruiting agencies for selection to an average 1.25 lakh government jobs each year.

About 150 Trinamool workers, who had either left the party earlier and returned or had lately detached themselves from doing party work joined the meeting. Sources said the leaders urged the workers to start working together with renewed vigour for the coming KMC elections. TMC had trailed in the last Lok Sabha election from ward 73.

Trinamool plans to hold more such meetings and the target is to reach as many as 10 lakh people in Kolkata. Bakshi had earlier made no bones about the fact that TMC lost 18 Lok Sabha seats mainly because of “organisational shortcomings”.

In fact, sometimes we don't know who to admire more at a wedding, the bride or her mother. We came across one such mother-daughter duo who looked out of this world at the latter's wedding.We are talking about bride Neha Mehta and her mother Brinda Mehta, who looked so regal on Neha's wedding that we can't stop admiring the duo's beautiful pictures together.Neha Mehta stunned in a handloom chanderi silk lehenga for her wedding. The lehenga by Rimple and Harpreet is an ode to old vintage textiles, collectibles and curios and was handcrafted on a special leheriya Chanderi silk. The leheriya was derived from an old textile archived at the Jaipur Palace Museum, and the tie-dye effect called Panchranga (which was traditionally worn in Rajasthan during the spring Teej festival) was recreated by specialist dyers in Jaipur. The lehenga was adorned with a melange of motifs- delicate floral sprays found in Pichwai paintings, baroque chandeliers and fantastical birds of paradise; all rendered in fine zardozi using kasab, gotta and hand cut sequins. It was paired with an embroidered silk blouse and tulle dupattas in hues of burnished red and cinnamon.Her pretty mother, Brinda Mehta chose a pista hued tulle and silk sharara by the same designer duo for the wedding. The kurti featured a jaal of gokru gotta interspersed with kachi-patti floral buttis, layered with zardozi wrought delicate floral blossoms and peacock motifs derived from a Mughal Garden of Paradise miniature painting. The traditional Kachi Patti embroidery involves an almost origami-like technique of delicate hand folded gota petals combined with metal salma and tikkis meticulously sewn on the ground fabric. The embroidery was combined along with dabka, resham, textured metal sequins and semi-precious stones to render the intricately detailed motifs. The sharara and dupatta featured all over sucha gota textures forming chevrons and geometric patterns derived from sacred geometry.We can't get over the duo's pictures.

Actors Nikhil Siddhartha and Nithiin are both set to tie the knot on April 16 but the restrictions imposed by the Telangana government on Saturday have left the respective families very worried. As per CM KCR’s diktat, no fresh bookings of function halls will be allowed for weddings post March 31. And weddings that are slated to take place before March 31, have been advised to keep the guest count to under 200.The preventive measures have come as a dampener on wedding plans of many soon to wed couples but Nikhil Siddhartha, who is set to tie the knot with Dr Pallavi next month, says he’s determined to go ahead with the wedding as planned. “Nothing can stop me from getting married on April 16. Even if it means just the two of us getting married in a temple, we will do it. I don’t want to postpone my wedding,” shares the Karthikeya star, adding, “We have already booked the convention hall for the wedding well in advance and we’re not really sure what happens now. Hopefully, things will improve in the next week or so and we can get more clarity on the situation.”The actor though has decided to hold off on the invitations for now. “We were just about to start sending out the invites when the epidemic broke out. Given how the situation was unfolding globally, I told my parents that it’s better if we wait and watch. In hindsight, it proved to be the right decision. Obviously I want it to be a big, fat wedding but ultimately, public safety is of utmost importance and will be paramount to whatever decision we take,” he says, adding, “I have even cancelled my bachelor party and other pre-wedding functions scheduled this month as a safety measure.”The actor says that while the coronavirus scare has not hampered the wedding preparations, he admits that it’s playing on his and his family’s mind. “With the wedding just a month away, it’s not an ideal situation. There is a sense of nervousness. Pelli panulu (preparations) are still continuing and thankfully, most of theshopping has already been done. The only thing we need to decide is the guest list — whether it will be two people or two thousand, it will all depend on the government’s decision going forward. I’m hoping for the best,” he adds.Meanwhile Nithiin too is scheduled to get married to Shalini Kandukuri in a destination wedding in Dubai next month. However, the actor’s family members are now unsure if the wedding will take place as planned. When Hyderabad Times reached out to Nithiin’s father, Sudhakar Reddy a few days ago, he said, “While we had discussed the idea of shifting the venue, nothing has been finalised yet. We’re still discussing the options in front of us.” Unlike in Nikhil’s case, a destination wedding requires the guest list to be locked much in advance, so the postponement of Nithiin’s wedding would mean hundreds of guests would have to cancel their travel plans. Nithiin’s sister Nikitha says that they are yet to take a final call. “We haven’t yet decided whether to postpone the wedding date or shift the wedding venue. We will wait and watch how things unfold and take a decision soon,” Nikitha adds.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74638893,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-79591/74638893.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/coronascare-casts-a-cloud-over-summer-weddings-in-tollywood/articleshow/74638893.cms

The emerging consensus on the issue, however, gave indications that it will now most likely be deferred.TMC, in a statement on Sunday night, said: “We are all aware of the prevailing threat of Covid-19, which has also been declared a pandemic by WHO. The West Bengal government has issued advisories and implemented several measures with regard to precautions that citizens need to take to ensure their safety. In wake of such a crisis, we will appeal to SEC to defer the upcoming municipal/corporation elections . In fighting this pandemic political parties must stand shoulder to shoulder with people we represent.”“Elections will come and go. Politics must take a back seat when society is faced with such threat. Political parties must come together and join hands to ensure social well-being,” it added.The state BJP responded immediately. “We are not going to attend talks with any pre-set agenda or mindset. It is true there is a scare among people. Advisories are also being issued in public interest. Under such circumstances, the state government will have to take precautionary measures to ensure safety of the people. Election is not the main issue for us. We are concerned more about the safety of people,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said.Left legislative party leader Sujan Chakraborty also said people’s health and safety was all-important. “It is the responsibility of the state government to fix the date. We don’t know why the SEC has called us. But one thing is certain that life of people is more important than election and if there is a proposal (to defer it), we will not object,” Chakraborty said.Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury said, “There should not be any election in this situation. Life is more important than election.”Assembly opposition leader Abdul Mannan, however, said they would like to wait to hear out Trinamool and the state government before making any statement.A senior SEC official said: “Coronavirus is an important issue and this is definitely under the consideration of the commission. But two main stakeholders of an election are people and political parties. We need to see the proposal from different parties and only then we will decide.”Earlier, Nabanna had hinted the SEC for holding the polls for Kolkata Municipal Corporation before the Ramadan month, which starts from April 26, but now it can be held later due to the corona epidemic. Now, the poll dates might be pushed back and may be in end-May after the end of Ramadan.

KOLKATA: Kolkata stares at a loss of Rs 440 crore over the next month as the Covid-19 scare drives Bangladeshis away, leading to a slowdown in the hospitality and medical tourism sectors, and inducing a lull in shopping at central Kolkata markets, which depend heavily on patrons from the neighbouring country.As Bangladeshis rush to catch flights (most of which have been cancelled), buses and trains back home, room occupancy dropped at hotels across Sudder Street, Marquis Street and at guest houses near private hospitals along the EM Bypass, which saw a sharp dip in patient count.The number of shoppers at New Market and adjoining central Kolkata shopping complexes has also plunged to almost half in the course of the last one week.With the virus threat set to persist, the flight of Bangladeshi clients could continue to hurt the city’s revenues, fear stakeholders.While private hospitals stand to lose revenue of Rs 300 crore a month from Bangladeshi patients, most of whom seek outdoor consultation, central Kolkata’s shopping complexes are set to lose Rs 120 crore. Bangladeshi buyers account for a turnover of Rs 4 crore per day at these markets, including New Market. The loss of revenue for hotels across Marquis Street and Sudder Street — the haunt of foreign backpackers and also medical tourists, mostly Bangladeshis — could add up to Rs 15 crore a month, according to stakeholders. Guest houses that host Bangladeshi patients and other business activities that are going to be affected could add up to another Rs 5 crore, said sources.AMRI Hospitals has seen a 50% drop in Bangladeshi patient count across outpatient departments (OPDs) at its three units at Mukundapur, Dhakuria and Salt Lake since the last week. The hospital usually gets around 1,200 Bangladeshi patients a month. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), there has been a 30% drop since Saturday. The hospital receives around 5,000 patients from Bangladesh a month.At Peerless Hospital, the Bangladeshi patient count has dropped to around 40 from the usual figure of around 100 daily. Around 15% of its total patients are from the neighbouring country.Narayana Superspecialty Hospital in Howrah has also witnessed a 30% dip in Bangladeshi patients. “Bangladeshi patients constitute more than 15% of our total patient count. More than 200 Bangladeshi patients visit our OPD each day. Things could get worse over the next few days,” said R Venkatesh, RTIICS zonal director.Hotels across Marquis Street and Sudder Street wore a deserted look on Sunday. Nearly 90% of their occupants — Bangladeshis visiting Kolkata for tourism and treatment — have left, leaving them staring at a huge loss. Room occupancy across more than 40 hotels in the area has dropped to less than 10%. Hotel Oriental on Marquis Street, for instance, hosts around 70 Bangladeshi visitors on any given day. On Sunday, the figure was just 10. “Around 95% of our guests are from Bangladesh, so we are staring at a shutdown. Our daily revenue has dropped from Rs 60,000 to just Rs 5,000,” manager Gurmit Singh told TOI.Other hotels are also feeling the pinch. Hotel Samrat on Sudder Street has just 16 guests in its 37 rooms. Till last week, it used to host 90 Bangladeshi guests each day. At Hotel DK International, there were just two guests — both Bangladeshis — occupying just two rooms, on Sunday. The other 38 rooms at the hotel were vacant. “This is an unprecedented situation. We have never experienced such a sharp drop in occupancy. If this persists for a few days more, which now seems inevitable, we will have to shut down. Things have never been worse,” said Prem Ghosh of Hotel Samrat.Once its last two Bangladeshi guests leave on Monday, Hotel Astoria on Sudder Street will be left with a single visitor. “Ninety per cent of our guests are Bangladeshis. The nCoV outbreak has reduced our daily revenue to just Rs 4,000 from Rs 25,000,” said a manager.New Market and its adjoining shopping complexes, too, have been hit hard by the flight of Bangladeshi patrons. Around 40% of the 50,000 daily visitors at these markets are from Bangladesh. While they have a collective daily turnover of Rs 7.5 crore, Bangladeshis comprise 55% of the buyers, and contribute around Rs 4 crore to the daily total turnover.“Since 2002, when the digging up of Lindsay Street for the underground Parkomat led to transitional customers deserting the market due to lack of space to park cars, it has been customers from Bangladesh who have sustained the market,” said Ashok Gupta, president of SS Hogg Market Traders’ Association. “On any given day, 40% of customers are Bangladeshis. The ratio doubles ahead of Eid. They contribute to more than 55% of the turnover, of not just New Market, but other markets in the vicinity. Since Thursday, footfall has declined drastically and so has business. We are starting at a very bleak period for the heritage market that is already in distress.”With Bangladeshi patients exiting private hospitals, small hotels and guest houses around them, too, are deserted. Several guest houses near the Tata Medical Centre in New Town were left without occupants on Sunday. “All my four Bangladeshi guests left on Saturday,” said Samaresh Mandal, a guest house owner at New Town’s DB Block. Occupancy has dropped by 80% at Jayanti Guest House opposite RTIICS. “We depend on Bangladeshi patients, who have traditionally formed the bulk of our guests. Occupancy had been steadily dropping over the last seven days, and now we are left with a couple who will leave by Monday,” said an employee.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74644355,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-698551,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/corona-fears-set-to-give-city-a-440cr-volt-biz-jolt/articleshow/74643660.cms

FacebookTwitterPintrest

Iconic songs like Hamari atariya and Mohe panghat pe, nandlal chhed gayo re are synonymous with Madhuri Dixit and Madhubala, respectively. While Rekha Bhardwaj sang the former for the film Dedh Ishqiya, Lata Mangeshkar lent her voice to the latter in the film Mughal-e-Azam. But little do people know that both these songs were originally sung by the tawaifs (courtesans). While Hamri atariya pe aao was crooned by Begum Akhtar; the original version — Mohe panghat pe nandlal gher liyo re — was recorded in 1930, as a thumri by Indubala.It’s facts like these about the tawaifs, that Kathak exponent Manjari Chaturvedi hopes to bring to the fore through her theatrical dance performance, Begums and Baijis of Bollywood . Touring the country, she is telling the stories of female artistes and their unrecognised contributions to Bollywood. Pune recently witnessed this theatrical performance at a city amphitheatre. An extension of her previous theatrical performance, The Courtesan Project, Begums and Baijis of Bollywood has narrations by Ekant Kaul and Burhan Qureshi alongside Manjari’s Kathak performances. “Not many people know that before independence, Jaddanbai, mother of actress Nargis, ran her own production house. In pre-independence time, there was a film actress Kajjanbai, whose face was used in a talcum powder advertisement in England. We don’t know about her, nor do we celebrate her,” she says.Manjari, who stumbled upon the stories of several such women in Hindi cinema during her research, decided to turn them into a theatrical performance. “If I give a lecture, nobody will be interested in listening. But we need to know about these people, the courtesans. There are some very iconic songs from Bollywood like Hamari atariya, mohe panghat pe, Aaj jaane ki zid na karo, among others, that everybody loves. But no one knows that these were the songs of the tawaifs. We have taken their music and their dances without acknowledging them,” says Manjari, who took her performance to Mumbai, Delhi and Lucknow, before coming to Pune. “I want Bollywood tounderstand that if you are inspired by a tawaif’s song, please give credit. Why do we shy away from doing this? These women are not even alive to ask for a copyright, but the least we can do is acknowledge them,” she says.Talking about the response to her previous project, The Courtesan Project, Manjari says, “Over the past year, I have seen two changes — the tawaifs are now in fashion and people have realised that need to refer to poetry and history to describe a tawaif, and not refer to Bollywood. I’m glad to see these changes as people are now delving into history and seeing what these women really were, rather than what were portrayed on screen.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74598201,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-392297/74598201.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/an-ode-to-the-tawaifs-of-bollywood/articleshow/74597968.cms

MUMBAI: A 23-year-old engineer was arrested on Saturday for cheating a businesswoman of Rs 4 lakh after she placed an online order for 1.6 lakh face masks.

Coronavirus outbreak live updates

adala Truck Terminal police charged Abrar Mustag Bodle with cheating, forging and breach of trust. The complainant, Wadala resident Namrata Monacha, runs an export company. She told the police she had received bulk orders for face masks from Oman and France.

She came across an online ad for Bhakti Enterprises in Bhubaneswar, and contacted its proprietor, Bodle. She asked for pictures of the mask, and the company's GST number and ISO certification. She finalised a deal for 1.6 lakh masks at Rs 14.4 lakh, and paid Rs 4 lakh as advance.

Monacha's accountant checked the GST number and ISO certificate, and found it to be fake. Monacha also found that the company address Bodle had given her was bogus. She then approached the police.

424,['16/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Mumbai: Home quarantine for over 700 proves easier said than done,"MUMBAI: The 14-day home quarantine has finally ended for the Mumbaikars who had travelled abroad with the Andheri couple, the first from the city to test positive for the novel coronavirus. Their group which returned from a Dubai tour on March 1 make up the biggest cluster of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra.The home quarantine imposed on the non-infected members of the Dubai group has been a mixed experience. At least one senior citizen couple from Vile Parle admitted they had breached the rules to step out for shopping. It turns out the BMC's health department phoned them each day to track their health but did not monitor their actual quarantine. The husband, a retired customs officer, said, ""There is just the two of us at home. Who would run errands? Moreover, don't I know my responsibilities? BMC did not post anyone at our door. They would have to hire staff and pay wages to do so. Is that easily done?"" He and his wife finally tested negative.With over 700 Mumbaikars now confined to their homes, the success of the arrangement is vital to the fight against the virus's spread. However, those quarantined speak of lack of support, harassment by neighbours, and the haphazardness of the process, while authorities say the BMC does not have the resources to ensure hundreds of citizens can be supported through the process. For citizens, problems range from everyday concerns like supply of household provisions to battling ostracism, to tackling fake news and being summoned for tests during the confinement. For the authorities, challenges vary from logistics of enforcement to tackling breach of protocol by quarantined individuals, some of whom invite relatives over out of boredom. The situation is not very different from even the advanced countries, as documented by the medical journal Lancet which recently did a study on quarantining and its impact. At Bangur Nagar, Goregaon, where Archana Bhargav (name changed) and her mother, Purnima, were asked to stay put at home for a fortnight from March 1 onwards, the fortnight-long process has left more questions unanswered than resolved. Archana casts doubt on the very purpose of quarantining them since they were forced to step out of their home within days. ""We were called for testing to Kasturba Hospital on March 10. And it turned out we were never ill,"" she said. BMC does provide ambulances to ferry people for Covid-19 tests at Kasturba, but services are patchy.Quarantined families say BMC also exposed them to infection during the overnight testing procedure in Kasturba Hospital. ""Seven of us were put in the same room, of whom two turned out to be infected with the virus. Was that a wise thing to do? Why didn't they isolate us there?"" one asked. ""A key to halting the virus's progression lies with people's cooperation in strictly staying home when advised to do so,"" BMC's Dr Daksha Shah told journalists on Sunday. ""The idea of home quarantining is to limit one's interaction with the rest of the community,"" Dr Shah said. So far, 270 Mumbaikars have completed the 14-day isolation period. ""In this situation, neighbour and friends must step in and help people who are under quarantine,"" she said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74644034,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/coronavirus-in-mumbai-home-quarantine-for-over-700-proves-easier-said-than-done/articleshow/74644020.cms
425,['16/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Rajasthan: Rajasthan turns into ‘learning ground’ as 7 Covid-19 patients declared ‘cured’,"JAIPUR/AGRA: In a heartening piece of news that could lift the coronavirus gloom, seven Covid-19 patients — an Italian couple and a Dubai-returned person in Rajasthan and four members of an Agra shoe exporter’s family admitted in a Delhi hospital — were on Sunday declared “cured” and either discharged or shifted out of intensive care.Doctors at Jaipur’s SMS Hospital said the 69-year-old Italian man who was the first to test positive for Covid-19 in Rajasthan was free of the virus, but would need further treatment for an underlying lung condition. His wife, who was the first to recover, has been shifted to RUHS College of Medical Sciences for observation in keeping with the recommended protocol.The third patient, an 85-year-old man who returned from Dubai on February 28, also remains under observation after testing negative in post-treatment investigations, the hospital said.In Agra, four out of six members of a shoe exporter’s family were relieved to be back home after 13 days of treatment for Covid-19 infection at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital. Two members of the family, which had returned from a vacation in Italy in late February, are still in hospital.Barring the shoe exporter and his son, everyone was discharged on Saturday.The shoe exporter’s younger brother, who is among those back home, told TOI after reaching Agra that spending 13 days in total isolation was the most difficult part of the recovery process.All four “cured” members of the family have been advised to “avoid social gatherings for a few days and maintain a high level of sanitation and hygiene”.For Rajasthan, the Covid-19 treatment protocol followed at SMS Hospital has not only brought success but also grabbed the attention of the medical fraternity elsewhere. Additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh said doctors and health officials battling the Covid-19 outbreak in several states and countries, including the US, had called to enquire about the combination of drugs that had worked for the hospital so far.Since there was no clear treatment protocol for Covid-19 before the first case was reported in the state on March 3, a team of doctors led by principal and controller Sudhir Bhandari and internal medicine specialist Prakash Keswani had gone into a huddle that evening and decided that a combination of malaria, HIV and swine flu drugs would work best.Principal Bhandari said the line of treatment wasn’t an experiment, as many might have suspected. “We sought permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research in New Delhi, which gave its nod to our suggested combination of drugs.”The hospital also took the patients’ consent before administering those medicines.The fourth Covid-19 patient at SMS Hospital is a 24-year-old man who tested positive for the virus on Saturday.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74644023,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1540879,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajasthan-turns-into-learning-ground-as-7-covid-19-patients-declared-cured/articleshow/74644017.cms

None of the security personnel or those around him were seen wearing protective gears.Emotional plea changed Yediyurappa’s mindThe CM arrived at the wedding venue around 11.15am and blessed the couple before heading to the dining area.On Friday, the CM announced a lockdown in Karnataka to check the spread of Covid-19 and said, “As a precautionary measure, we are closing down places where mass gatherings happen for the next one week.” He had placed restrictions on weddings, parties and sporting tournaments, forcing many to defer or cancel planned events.Sources in the CMO said Yediyurappa had cancelled his plan to attend the Belagavi wedding, but changed his mind after Kavatgimath made an “emotional plea that it’s a matter of prestige for him and his family to have the CM at the ceremony”.A source said, “Kavatgimath is BJP’s chief whip in the legislative council.

It seems that the SEC is working at the behest of others and is reading out the script prepared by others,"" Jagan said.The SEC later in the evening issued a statement clarifying that it had acted against certain government functionaries ""as per the dictum of Supreme Court"". ""All the safeguards available to a judge of high court are applicable to the state election commissioner. To attribute motives for the acts of a constitutional functionary are highly regretted and will only weaken the institution,"" the SEC statement said.Jagan alleged that “ever since YSRCP won several seats unanimously, TDP along with its friendly media has been conspiring to stall polls to save its face and also to deprive the state of central funds worth ₹Rs 5,000 crore, which we have to forfeit if polls are not held before March 31”. He said for the 9,600 posts, 50,000 nominations were filed and 2,000 YSRCP candidates were unanimously elected for MPTCs.Jagan alleged that former CM N Chandrababu Naidu had conspired to postpone the polls as TDP was staring at defeat. “We have complained to the governor and will also explore other options as we were elected with a majority of 151 seats in the 175 member house. But if elections are postponed and officials are being transferred, what should the elected representatives do,” he asked.Jagan said as far as coronavirus was concerned, in AP of the 70 samples taken, only one case was tested positive and the state has taken effective steps.Earlier, state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar clarified that the election process was postponed, but not cancelled. “Unanimous nominations will stand good and the candidates will be declared as elected.

The 2019 floods that hit 22 districts of Karnataka caused a damage of Rs 34,000 crore. With the Centre releasing only Rs 1,870 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and Rs 300 crore from SDRF, the funds were insufficient.The 15th Finance Commission recommended an SDRF of Rs 1,054 crore for Karnataka for 2020-21, of which the Centre’s share is Rs 791 crore.With norms suggesting only 80 per cent can be utilised for handling natural calamities (20 per cent as mitigation fund), the state may spend up to Rs 640 crore on operations to contain Covid-19, including setting up quarantine camps and special treatment for patients. This may impact ongoing rehabilitation works for last year’s floods victims.According to Veeresh Sobaradmath, president, Raitha Sena, only 30 per cent of 1.25 lakh households have got financial assistance for house repairs and a proposal to shift 100 villages is on paper.The executive committee on natural disaster management will meet on Monday. “While adequate funds are available for both flood relief and Covid-19, we’ll approach the Centre for more funds if needed,” said chief secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar.However, questions are being raised on why National Health Mission funds are not utilised to fight the pandemic.

BENGALURU: A software engineer was allegedly abducted in a minibus for more than three and a half hours and made to withdraw Rs 4,400 from an ATM. The miscreants also stole his cellphone before he managed to give them the slip in south Bengaluru on Friday night. The two abductors have been arrested.

Satish N, 37, a resident of Banashankari II Stage and employee of Dell International Services, Whitefield, usually parks his scooter near Devegowda Petrol Bunk, from where he boards an office cab to go to work.

On Friday too, he did the same. After returning from work, Satish met his friend Mahesh near the petrol bunk at 9pm. The duo left for a friend's place near Katriguppe for dinner. Around 12.20am, they returned and found Satish's scooter key missing. The duo began walking towards Katriguppe signal to reach Devegowda Petrol Bunk when a minibus stopped and its driver offered them a lift. The duo boarded the vehicle. When the truck reached the petrol bunk, Mahesh alighted and walked towards an ATM to withdraw money while Satish remained in the bus and was chatting with the driver and another person in the vehicle.

However, the bus began m oving and the duo threatened to kill Satish at knifepoint. They drove towards Sarakki signal and later towards Talaghattapura on Kanakapura Main Road. They took him to two ATM kiosks to withdraw money from his account, but both didn't have cash. The irked abductors began talking about killing Satish.

When Satish pleaded for his life saying he has a child, the accused took him to an ATM kiosk in Khodays Factory and got him to withdraw Rs 4,400. They also sent an SMS to his wife, asking her for money.

After about three and a half hours, the minibus reached Devegowda Petrol Bunk and stopped for a while. The accused were discussing where to abandon Satish when he managed to escape from the vehicle. Realising Satish had fled, the abductors sped away.

Though the accused claimed he was abducted and assaulted, police registered a case under IPC section 394 (voluntarily hurting while committing robbery). Based on the vehicle's registration number, police arrested Deepak, 25, a murder accused, and Prashanth, 29.

472,['16/03/2020'],Reporting of crime a must in new anti-trafficking bill,"NEW DELHI: The revised anti-trafficking bill sets out steep penalties and proposes “mandatory reporting” of trafficking crimes which makes being a bystander an offence if a person has knowledge of a misdemeanour but withholds it from the authorities.

The bill targets organised trafficking syndicates targeting minors girls and boys and the new draft, drawn up after consultations within the women and child development ministry, will now be sent for consideration of a group of ministers chaired by home minister Amit Shah .

The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018, was passed by Lok Sabha in 2018 amid a heated debate but it never made it to Rajya Sabha and lapsed when the Modi government’s first term ended in 2019.

In the new bill, a national database on trafficking offences and victims is also proposed. According to sources, it is also proposed to specify that if a public servant and those working in child care institutions and rehabilitation homes are found to be involved in crimes, they will face prosecution for “aggravated crimes”. The blatant abuse of authority in the Muzaffarpur shelter case is an obvious example.

The “aggravated offences” category introduced in the 2018 bill lists a series of offences and the jail terms and fines for the same and inclusion of public servants under this category will be a significant step in increasing deterrence.

There is an emphasis in including possible sources of abuse like forced labour and employment agencies involved in exploitation of migrants, offences involving children (gender neutral) and those with disabilities in the “aggravated offences” category. The government is also exploring steep penalties in the range of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 25 lakh on traffickers, particularly those involved in running organised syndicates targeting minors.

The GoM headed by Shah recently considered proposed amendments to the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. Other members on the GoM include foreign minister S Jaishankar , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , WCD minister Smriti Irani and social justice minister Thaawarchand Gehlot.

There is a strong view in government that the crackdown on trafficking needs to punish not just the kingpin but the entire chain of intermediaries by way of penalties and seizures of not just property but even vehicles used for trafficking purposes.

The WCD ministry also proposes to recommend complete immunity to victims so that they are able to come forward without fear to report their trafficker and not feel concerned about being accused of being at odds with the law as unwitting accomplices. The section on protection to witnesses, victims and complainants also proposes to extend the provision to specified family members of the victim, sources said.

The ministry considered National Crime Records Bureau data for 2019 which showed that one of every two people trafficked is a minor.

Also, the ministry's analysis of NCRB data in terms of trafficking of minors drew their attention to the fact that among those trafficked, there were more male children than girls. According to sources, this has brought focus on the need to crack down on organised trafficking syndicates and the need for a national database on such offences.

It is also proposed to change the title of the draft Bill from “Trafficking of Persons” to “Trafficking in Persons.” This is significant as it meshes with the international definition of human trafficking as elaborated by the United Nation Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner.

The draft Bill also reinforces the role of the national and state level an Anti Human Trafficking Agency in stepping up investigation. It is also felt that effective district level anti-human trafficking units are critical to strengthening the investigation framework. The government also sees the role of the National Anti Trafficking Relief and Rehabilitation Committee as an important component of the proposed legislation.

473,['16/03/2020'],"Shops sell masks at 8 times the price, finds EB during raids","Kolkata: From selling duplicate paper masks for Rs 80, which is eight-times more than its original price, to illegal Chinese-made masks, an Enforcement Branch (EB) raid in central and north Kolkata revealed that these medical stores are carrying out illegal pricing.

A shopkeeper in College Street was found selling a duplicate paper mask as N95 at Rs 80. When an EB official asked him to show purchase documents of the manufacturer, he simply denied any evidence by saying that he didn’t receive any receipt or written document. “There are two types of masks that are being sold, one is supposed to sell at Rs 5 while the other one costs Rs 15. Instead, some medical shops are selling these masks for Rs 80 to Rs 150,” a senior official said.

In the EB raids, a reputed Amherst Street medical shop was found selling illegal China-made masks at Rs 40 without any documents. When EB officials threatened to slap penal charges against them, they accepted their wrongdoing and destroyed all the 15 masks in front of the EB officials.

Jadab Paul (57), a resident of Shyambazar, asked around in more than 12 medical shops in College Street but could not find even one N95 mask. Nimai Nag, an advocate, claimed he had to buy a sanitizer at Rs 200, while it is available in the market at Rs 45.

Aditi Choudhury, a bank official, who had come from Agarpara to Shyambazar just to buy a sanitnizer and a mask, said: “ It is extremely unethical that all the medical shops selling the products at an extremely high price.”

The Bengal government has put mask and hand sanitizers under Essential Commodities Act up to June 30 after complaints that N95 masks and hand sanitizers are unavailable or being sold at high prices.

“If anyone is found to be an offender under the Essential Commodities Act, that person can be punished with imprisonment of up to seven years or fine or both,” said an Enforcement Branch official.

474,['16/03/2020'],Govt to review policy on building near monuments,"NEW DELHI: The culture ministry has said it will revisit the policy which regulates construction around centrally-protected monuments and classify them based on their historical significance.

At present, the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, imposes a ban on construction of any kind within a 100 metre periphery of centrally-protected monuments and allows only certain types of regulated construction within the 100-200 metre perimeter.

While conservationists may disagree, many in the government believe the existing provisions come in the way of significant development work around these areas. With this in mind, the government had moved an amendment to the law in 2018 through which it sought to remove these restrictions.

A parliamentary standing committee, which examined the bill and submitted its report in February 2019, advocated the need for a law that balanced preservation of monuments of historical significance and development of infrastructure around them, keeping in mind the needs of tourists as well as those who live around them.

Minister of state for tourism and culture Prahlad Singh Patel said his ministry has directed the relevant authorities to produce a roadmap for the reclassification. “If a mazaar or a samadhi is there and there is limitation that for 300 metres nothing can be built, why should it be so ... we are preparing the amendments.” Patel said.

Revisiting the legislation, the ministry has clarified, will not impact a monument like the Taj Mahal, for which the construction restrictions extend to a 500 metre periphery.

The same exception, however, will not be applicable to all burial grounds or samadhi, a decision that is in line with the standing committee’s view that a blanket ban on construction around archaeological monuments acts as an impediment to infrastructure projects, especially in cases where the construction is not likely to impact the monument. A comprehensive reclassification will also allow the government to repopulate its list of centrally protected monuments to include some important sites currently being maintained by state governments.

On Saturday, the state requisitioned CNCI for quarantining the in-bound travellers with symptoms of fever and cough.According to health department, in bound passengers from the foreign countries have been categorised into three categories — first category suspects are those with fever and other symptoms. They will be quarantined. Second category of passengers are the ones, who are above 60 years of age with a history of hyper tension, diabetics. They will be in isolation ward under close observation. Third are with no symptoms or co-morbidity, who will be advised 14-day home isolation.Initially, a new building of Barasat State General Hospital was earmarked for quarantining. But in case of an outbreak, when number of suspects may grow exponentially, the 28 bed arrangements at Barasat may be highly inadequate. Moreover, many norms laid down by Central Health ministry directive may not be complied with at the Barasat facility.This is why CNCI and NBCC Square are chosen for quarantining process, said a health department source.On Sunday, basic facilities for suspects and basic amenities for their relatives were put in place at CNCI on a war footing. Similar exercise will be taken up at NBCC Square as well, said state Health department officials.According to National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC), NBCC square was built keeping in mind the requirement of state and central PSU.Apart from the airport, the state health department is putting up health screening facility at 78 entry points at inter-state and international borders.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74648586,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-likely-to-requisition-52-flats-plans-500-more-quarantine-beds/articleshow/74643404.cms

The expenditure of Rs 2,038 crore, includes revenue expenditure of Rs 1,256 crore and capital expenditure of Rs 782 crore. The revenue generation has been estimated at Rs 4,459 crore, that include the revenue and capital income.According to the civic agency officials, the expenditure for the next fiscal year has been estimated two times more than the expenditure of the current fiscal year (2019-20) that was nearly Rs 850 crore (see box).Initially, the proposed revenue generation for 2019-20 was estimated at Rs 2,605 crore, however the generation came to be Rs 417 crore for the same financial year. These projections for the 2020-21 fiscal were tabled in a meeting chaired by the mayor with the councillors on Saturday.However, councillors claimed that that these projections are inflated. “The estimates say that MCG will earn Rs 1,100 crore from house tax. I said in the meeting that the house tax collection from 2008 to 2016 was Rs 800 crore, so how can one year’s collection be projected at Rs 1,100 crore? They have shown inflated collections. This will gradually enhance the deficit,” said R S Rathee, councillor of ward 34.Raising another concern, Rathee said that the MCG had the surplus budget of Rs 325 crore for the 2019-20 fiscal year. “The collection (revenue) was Rs 417 crore and the expenditure was Rs 850 crore. The deficit was Rs 432 crore. I saw the entire budget but could not find how they covered this deficit. It is either they have used the fixed deposit (FD) of the civic body or have taken loan against the FD,” added Rathee.Under the revenue expenditure head, the establishment expenses, which include salaries and wages of employees, is also proposed to increase from Rs 137.07 crore to Rs 201.78 crore.

Responding to a prompt from the background, Mirza said, “It is a matter of concern that #COVID19 has been reported from J&K and in view of health emergency, it is imperative that the lockdown in the territory must be lifted immediately.” Khan was the only head of government to be absent from the conference call.Government sources said they were not surprised Pakistan’s determination to raise Kashmir on an occasion intended to deal with a health emergency. PM Modi, who was apparently not surprised at the reference, ignored the comment and summed the discussions stressing on offers on cooperation.“Pakistan is trying to politicise a humanitarian initiative. Its a pity they chose to be churlish on this occasion. From our point of view, we have the political will to see this through. We could have kept Pakistan out. We chose to bring them in,” said official sources.Indian sources said the government will continue to demonstrate the political will and ability to lead in the region. In fact, Australian PM Scott Morrison said in Canberra on Sunday that in his chat with Modi, the PM had proposed a similar video-conference by G20 leaders, and that Australia would support it.The video conference showed in sharp relief the disconnect between most of the region’s countries and Pakistan.

480,['16/03/2020'],"Recover dues first, say MCG councillors","GURUGRAM: As MCG is reeling under financial crisis due to non-recovery of funds, the councillors have demanded reviewing of methods of revenue collection and generation. Ahead of MCG budget 2020-21, the councillors gave suggestions on transfer of tax collected, collection from purchasable floor area ratio (FAR) and levying charges for usage of water, to help financial stability of the corporation .

The corporation has over Rs 600 crore pending with departments, which include DHBVN, HSVP and HSIIDC. The councillors suggested that every tax collected through stamp duty, electricity duty, and transfer and extension fee should be properly recorded, checked, followed up and collected in a time-bound manner so that the expenditure can be met for city’s development.

Councillor Kuldeep Yadav said the issue of recovery of funds should be addressed on priority basis. “The corporation has repeatedly requested these departments to transfer the pending dues to MCG account but it is still awaited,” he said.

On the lines of licenced colonies, where developers charge water charges from residents and a share goes to HSVP, the councillors suggested that MCG can also develop a scheme whereby flat rate charges can be levied on the residents. “Builders are pocketing this amount as of now, running into crores. Not only revenue of more than Rs 100 crore can easily be generated in this manner but also wastage of water can be prevented,” said RS Rathee, councillor of ward 34.

Another major concern, pointed out by Rathee, is poor collection against purchasable FAR, where the corporation needs to work. Yadav raised the issue of advertising policy and said, “Presently there is no proper policy for advertisements in societies and builders areas, whereas private developers are making crores from it. Even a policy of 50% sharing from these areas can be implemented by which huge amounts of revenue can be generated”.

The residents said as the society has been developed as an affordable site, the builder is legally not entitled to charge maintenance fee for the next five years. They have written to the chief minister and the department of town and country planning demanding immediate intervention.

Residents said the builder is deducting maintenance fee from the pre-paid electricity account without their knowledge. “It is to our surprise that the maintenance officer started deducting money without a prior notice from the pre-paid meter. We have written to the builder and asked for a clarification. Even after 10 days, we are still awaiting a reply. Maintenance charges are being deducted daily from the electricity meter. I have never received any receipts of the money the builder is charging us,” said Dheerendra Pratap Singh, a resident.

Residents also said they are being charged Rs 7.10 per unit for the electricity.

“We are being asked to pay high electricity charges which is technically wrong as per affordable housing society norms,” Singh added.

Another resident, SS Rohila, said, “There is no transparency related to maintenance charges that the builder is forcing us to pay. The society is an affordable property and we are not supposed to pay anything for the next five years as per the norms. The builder has failed to maintain the society properly as we are suffering from defunct lift every now and then.” added Rohilla.

Meanwhile, a representative from the builder’s side pointed out that they are working to solve all inconveniences faced by the residents. “The maintenance charges are very nominal and there are no such rules that the residents will not pay for the maintenance for five years. We have invited them to talk about their issues and we are open to reduce the charges as well. The residents are supposed to pay salaries of the maintenance staff. The builder is responsible for upgrading the electricity and DG sets while residents should pay for cleaning and horticultural work,” the spokesperson said.

485,['16/03/2020'],"Strength tested, Hero Honda Chowk flyover may open this month","The agency will submit the strength test report to NHAI this week

GURUGRAM: The strength-testing of the Hero Honda Chowk flyover, that was recommended by NHAI’s special committee, was completed by the officials of a private lab on Saturday, who will now compile the report and submit it to the special committee within a week. If all goes well, the flyover will open by March 31.

According to NHAI officials, once the committee gives a go ahead, the traffic movement, closed for over months now, on the Jaipur-Delhi side of the carriageway will be resumed.

Strength-testing of the entire flyover was mandated by a three-member committee of NHAI, that was set up to investigate the structural damage of the flyover.

While the exercise was supposed to be concluded within 10-14 days, it took a month for the agency, hired for the purpose, to conclude the scanning that started on February 14. “We have been on the job with a sense of urgency. There were delays due to construction ban, weather and a few unexpected circumstances in crash barrier casting. But, we had completed our work in February itself. We had hoped that strength-testing would go on simultaneously and would not take more than 7-10 days. But they took over three days to complete just 2 spans (pillars) and the entire flyover has 14 pillars,” said an official of Valecha Engineering Ltd. On February 13, the NHAI and contractor claimed that due to the unexpected delays in casting crash barriers, they hoped to open the flyover by mid-March.

The 1.4-km long flyover constructed at the cost of Rs 197 crore had developed a gaping hole in May las year. In August, a three-member technical committee of NHAI released an interim report suggesting that a 15-m long and 16-m wide portion around the damaged hole will be reinforced with steel and concrete.

In October, Jaipur-Delhi side of the stretch was closed and it was claimed that within 45 days the work will be completed. The work couldn’t start as NGT banned construction. The work resumed mid-December and January 31 was the new deadline. It was later pushed to February 15 and then to mid-March.

Their group which returned from a tour of Dubai on March 1 make up the biggest cluster of Covid-19 positive cases in Maharashtra The home quarantine imposed on the non-infected members of the Dubai group has been a mixed experience. At least one senior citizen couple from Vile Parle admitted they had breached the rules to step out for shopping. It turns out the BMC’s health department phoned them each day to track their health but did not monitor their actual quarantine. The husband, a retired customs officer, said, “Of course, we went out to buy things. There is just the two of us at home. Who would run errands? Moreover, don’t I know my responsibilities? BMC did not post anyone at our door. They would have to hire staff and pay wages to do so. Is that easily done?” He and his wife have finally tested negative.With over 700 Mumbaikars now confined to their homes as a preventive step against the spread of Covid-19, the success of the arrangement is vital to the fight against the spread of the virus. However, those who were quarantined speak of lack of support, harassment by neighbours, and the haphazardness of the process, while authorities say the BMC simply does not have the resources to ensure effective quarantining of citizens.For citizens, problems range from everyday concerns like supply of household provisions to battling ostracism, to tackling fake news and being summoned for tests during the confinement. For the authorities, challenges vary from logistics of enforcement to tackling breach of protocol by quarantined individuals, some of whom invite relatives over out of boredom. The situation is not very different from even the advanced countries, as documented by the medical journal Lancet which recently did a study on quarantining and its impact.At Bangur Nagar , Goregaon, where a woman, Archana Bhargav (name changed) and her mother, Purnima, were asked to stay put at home for a fortnight from March 1onwards, the fortnight-long process has left more questions unanswered than resolved. Archana casts doubt on the very purpose of quarantining them since they were forced to step out of their home within days.Quarantined families say BMC also exposed them to infection during the overnight testing procedure in Kasturba Hospital. Fake news on social media was among the nuisances that the Goregaon family faced, which led to them becoming targets of suspicion within their housing society’s WhatsApp group.Some quarantined families said more than the fear of the disease and boredom, it was the harassment of having their addresses and phone numbers put out in the public domain by the BMC that caused hardship. “I have received at least 500 phone calls from random people asking how to identify symptoms of the coronavirus, how to prevent it and how to combat the disease.

GURUGRAM: In an attempt to give a much-needed push to installation of high-security registration plates ( HSRP ) in vehicles plying in the city, traffic police will soon launch a drive to challan defaulters.

Officers have been advised to not only challan the drivers, but also guide them on how to get the high-security numberplates and the repercussions of not doing at the earliest. While first-time offenders would be fined Rs 500, repeat defaulters will have to cough up Rs 1,000 each time they are found flouting the norms.

Police said over 2,000 such defaulters have already been fined in the past two months. Last year, nearly 16,000 were penalised for not installing HSRPs. The move aims to curb increasing instances of crime and road accidents. HSRPs will not only help the vehicle owners to ensure security of their vehicles, but also help police in investigating vehicle thefts and accidents.

“We keep challaning such vehicles on a regular basis. In the coming days, we’ll be intensifying the drive to make people understand that they can’t ply on roads if they don’t have HSRPs without being penalised,” DCP (traffic) Chander Mohan said.

“There has to be some deterrence, as people will switch to HSRPs only then. Commercial vehicles are relatively easier to tap as they keep coming to RTA offices for permits. Covering personal vehicles is a little challenging,” additional deputy commissioner and RTA secretary Prashant Panwar said.

Pictures from the wedding of MLC Mahantesh Kavatgimath ’s daughter show Yediyurappa relishing the wedding feast in a dining area teeming with people. State home minister Basavaraj Bommai , Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje , and MLCs N Ravi Kumar and Lahor Singh Sisoriya were among the other high-profile guests at the reception hosted by their BJP colleague.

Sources said the CM flew from Bengaluru to Belagavi, which is 510km from the state capital, and reached the venue around 11.15am. He blessed the newlyweds before walking towards the dining area. None of the security personnel or others around him were wearing masks.

A source in the CMO said Yediyurappa had cancelled his visit to the wedding, but changed his mind after Kavatgimath “made an emotional plea” that it was “a matter of prestige” for him and his family. “Kavatgimath is BJP’s chief whip in the legislative council. The CM’s absence would not have gone down well with local supporters.”

The accused had to pay the landlord rent of Rs14,000. The police later identified the accused — Manjit Singh (35), a factory worker of New Janta Nagar — though his handwriting. Shimlapuri police have registered a case against him under Section 384 (punishment for extortion) of the IPC on the complaint of the landlord, Sarabpreet Singh, an insurance agent from New Janta Nagar.

Sarabpreet said Manjit was living with his family in another house of his for the past two years. The rent of that house was pending for the past few months, which came to around Rs14,000. Manjit had once given his landlord a cheque of Rs14,000, but asked him not to deposit it in the bank, as his wife was pregnant and he needed the money. Later on, he took back the cheque after assuring Sarabpreet he would pay the amount soon.

The landlord added that on March 7, Manjit came to his house and handed him a yellow envelope, saying it was kept at his house entrance. After giving him the letter, Manjit left. In the letter, an unidentified person demanded Rs50,000 from him if he wanted the safety of his children. Sarabpreet immediately informed the police about it.

Investigating officer from Shimlapuri police station, ASI Gurpreet Singh, said the police identified Manjit from his handwriting in the letter. Meanwhile, Manjit fled the place, leaving his wife behind. The ASI added that Manjit and his wife were supposed to vacate the house by March 31, but before that, he had to clear the dues. Therefore, he thought of extorting the money from the landlord himself. Sarabpreet has two daughters, aged 3 and 5, but Manjit did not attempt to kidnap them.

498,['16/03/2020'],Use tyre mulch to save environment,"Mulch is actually a layer of material applied to soil surface. Reasons for applying mulch are saving of soil moisture, keeping root system cool in extreme summer and warm in cold winters, stopping erosion and retaining organic humus in the soil, reducing weed growth, and enhancing the visual appeal of the area. The process is commonly used both in commercial crop production and in gardening, and when applied correctly, it can dramatically improve soil productivity.

Now, since mulching is not very common in our city parks, there is an urgent requirement to introduce this practice because of its soil conservation, moisture saving, and aesthetic value. For agriculture, horticulture, olericulture, and floriculture production, we have seen the use of organic and inorganic materials for mulching. A time has come to think of some more novel and environmentally sustainable material to be used for mulching. In fact, from my own experience, I can say that the used tyre pieces can be excellent mulch material.

Let’s understand what actually is a tyre mulch. A tyre mulch is made of used tyres crushed mechanically into very small 2 to 3-inch pieces, and spray/dip painted in different colours, as per design and aesthetic requirements. Now, why tyre mulch should be used in municipal controlled areas, and not wood mulch as used in western countries. The basic reason being, as our forest cover is dwindling very fast, we are not in a position to resort to making wood mulch by chipping forest wood, using mechanical wood chippers. Therefore, lack of wood as a resource, and in view of other reasons given in this column, tyre mulch will be a much better idea for our environment.

The foremost reason why tyre mulch should be the preferred material for mulching is that it would not be carried away from road medians and flower beds by poor people to be used as a fuel, the way they would have carried wood mulch away as fuel. Also, used tyres can be donated by common people, as they just get Rs50 or 100 per tyre. Besides, the tyre mulch can be dip-painted in bright enamel colours to provide a colourful look to roadsides, Leisure Valley, and park flower beds. Just imagine — white, red, blue, green, and orange as ground cover. Rubber mulch has a long life, and being dense, it is unlikely to be blown away by strong winds. Tyre mulch colours can be changed every three to four years, and they would always look as if newly laid. When applied as a base for non-flowering plants, the tyre mulch will add colour to the base as a contrast.

There are several other advantages of tyre rubber mulch that are directly beneficial to the environment. It suppresses growth of weeds, and reduces the manual maintenance of ‘difficult to maintain’ road medians, roadsides, and public park flower beds. It also reduces soil erosion by high velocity winds, as well as vehicle sidewash when moving near road medians having plants, besides dust pollution on the roads by providing excellent ground coverage to topsoils of roadside plantation and parks during the dry summer season. It keeps roots warm in winter and cool in summers for healthy growth of plants and trees. It also reduces irrigation requirement by saving water evaporation and keeping moisture in the soil for plants during lean periods. It also keeps soils healthy by sheltering and providing cover for soil-friendly micro-organisms like earthworms.

Besides these advantages, it will also save the environment from the present use of used tyres, which are used to extract furnace oil for the most polluting industry, that is pyrolosis oil industry.

So, by resorting to tyre rubber mulch, we can contribute to sustainable development by saving trees, having better plants, better soil health, conserving water, and above all, adding colour to the otherwise weed-invested road medians and ill-maintained flower beds.
