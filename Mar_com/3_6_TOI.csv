1,['6/03/2020'],"Women have always been told they can’t play heavy instruments, says musician Biggi Vinkeloe","While the world gears up to celebrate International Women’s Day, 63-year-old Sweden-based saxophone player Biggi Vinkeloe reveals that throughout her career, she has faced discrimination on the basis of her gender and age. Ahead of her performance in Bengaluru, along with Bengaluru-based band MoonArra, Biggi shares her thoughts on the challenges she faces.“When I started out as a musician, there were very few women and fewer women saxophone players. Piano, violin, harp or even the cello usually found more female takers. Brass or wind instruments like the saxophone were touted as ‘too difficult for women’. I also began with the flute and eventually moved onto the saxophone. I have mostly worked with men and would often be the only woman performing at events,” says Biggi. Today, however, Biggi feels things have changed for the better. “It’s a misconception when people say women cannot play the saxophone. What you need is good technique. You need to focus on your breathing and how you play. But for the longest time, women were told they cannot handle a saxophone.”Biggi, who began playing when she was in her early 20s, says that she was discriminated by many known musicians for being a woman. “There was this incident with a keyboardist, who asked for a saxophone player and was surprised to see me. But after I finished playing, they (organisers) came up to me and said, ‘I didn’t know you could play so well’. There are so many incidents that I can share. If I would perform in a group and if someone would make a mistake, everyone would look at me, thinking that I made the mistake,” says Biggi, adding that such incidents, only made her perform better. She says that she also faced discrimination because of her age. “Some people think I am too old to be on stage. I feel this happens in Europe, in the US and in India a lot. I collaborate with musicians of all ages and without problems — in fact, I enjoy playing with younger musicians,” says Biggi.The musician, who will be performing with Bengaluru-based band MoonArra, says that she enjoys performing with artists from different genres. “I enjoy playing with artists who play different genres. Our performance in Bengaluru, today, will be very different and audiences will be in for a surprise,” Biggi sums up.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74492040,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-243372/74492040.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/english/music/women-have-always-been-told-they-cant-play-heavy-instruments-says-musician-biggi-vinkeloe/articleshow/74492040.cms

6,['6/03/2020'],"Shankar Nag and I won awards for our films, but didn’t get the rewards we desired: Anant Nag","Acting, writing, film production and even politics, Anant Nag ’s professional journey has been as diverse as it can be. The recently-concluded Bengaluru International Film Festival hosted a retrospective of his films that culminated in a rather interesting session with the thespian , which was attended by cinema aficionados, fans and other curious minds. He spoke candidly on various things that included his brief political stint that he rarely talks about. As he walked down memory lane, the actor shared memories of his brother, the late Shankar Nag , his own life experiences and anecdotes from his journey so far. Excerpts:I grew up in a matha, where I learnt bhajans, sacred texts and tried my hand at playing a number of musical instruments. My father was very keen that I learn the verses of the Bhagavad Gita, and I began my lessons under him from the age of six. Now when I look back, I feel that all those lessons helped me in my acting career. I was doing very well in my studies as well, and someone suggested my father to send me Bombay for better academic opportunities. From studying in a Kannada-medium school, I was now sitting in a convent school, where the medium of instruction was English. But unfortunately, I ended up not clearing my Class 10 exam. It was too embarrassing for me and I lost interest in studies. Later, after I finally cleared the 10th board exam, I took up arts and ended up in a class that mostly comprised girls. Tired of getting bullied by them, I requested the college authorities for a shift to the science stream. I had even requested my father to call me back home.The 1962 and 1965 wars had made me very patriotic and I wanted to join the armed forces to serve the nation. But the Air Force rejected me because of my weak left eye and the Army declared me underweight. And I was once again clueless in life. I didn’t know in which direction my life was heading. It was at this time that a break in theatre came about and the seeds of acting were sown in my mind. I started my career with Konkani plays, followed by Kannada dramas and then did theatre in Hindi and Marathi. In a span of around five years, I enacted about 50 characters on stage. And that’s where I found my comfort zone. Theatre also paved my way for movies and I landed my first film, Sankalpa. This was followed by films with Shyam Benegal , who was introduced to me by Satyadev Dubey I had trained in comedy from my theatre days. My comic scenes began in films like Bayalu Daari. I had even done a full-fledged comedy movie like Dhairya Lakshmi in my initial days itself. And the love for comedy continued in films like Narada Vijaya. Earlier, cinema had a separate track for comedians. I am fortunate that my writers and directors gave me a chance to break that pattern after seeing my potential.I was deeply affected by the wars that India fought. I used to be politically active in my younger days, but later got busy with acting. Around two decades later, I campaigned for Janata Party. I did not do this in anticipation for a seat. But got nominated as an MLC in the artiste category. It was then that I wanted to become an MLA. Later, when I saw the political debates and doings, I realised that it was easier to essay the role of a politician in films than become one in real life. I figured that this wasn’t my calling. If I belonged anywhere, it was in front of the camera. I wasn’t just disillusioned, I even failed to make an impact as I wasn’t allowed to work.I entered theatre at the age of 17-18. Now, I am 71. I find it easier to work in cinema now. I have adapted myself to this medium better. Theatre is physically tiring. Even when Girish (Karnad) had approached me for a play, I’d told him the same. I think I’m past theatre now.On the sets of Shyam’s (Benegal) films, politics was a prime topic of discussion. He had come to Bengaluru, when I decided to join politics. “You’ve become a minister. You’ve entered politics,” he had told me. And I responded to it saying that I learnt politics on his film sets.There are films like Ankur, Nishant, Manthan, Bara, Accident and Avasthe that revolved around politics. Somehow though, the audience for such movies is still less. Lately, Kavaludaari spoke about the Emergency and politics. There might be 6.5 crore Kannadigas, but the cinema-going population in that is just a fraction. On the contrary, mostly all of the 12-crore Telugu population watch films. Kannadigas, I feel, are more fond of reading, as we have a bigger demand for literature here.My brother Shankar Nag wanted to go abroad. So, I had advised him to study well, achieve something here and then travel to a different country on scholarship. He even got the opportunity to act in a Girish Karnad film. But he was more interested in directing a film thanacting. I’ve produced and directed many plays, but when Shankar decided to direct films, I thought to myself that there shouldn’t be any competition at home (laughs). Together, we have produced films like Minchina Ota and Accident. We won many awards for our films, but we didn’t receive the rewards that we desired.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74494000,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1154163/74494000.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/shankar-nag-and-i-won-awards-for-our-films-but-didnt-get-the-rewards-we-desired-anant-nag/articleshow/74494000.cms

Tell us about your favourite India things...

It is amazing to come back to India. I love the country, as it has the best food ever and the nicest hospitality. I especially go around trying to find the best Chicken Tikka Masala . It is usually my goal when I am here. I really take food seriously.

What about the Indian audience makes you keep coming back here?

The Indian audience is very open-minded. They have known psy trance for so many years, especially because of the Goa scene. They know what’s happening. The audience here is one of the smartest in the world. They appreciate this kind of music, which has so many layers into it.

Your track Becoming Insane is still one of the most requested tracks, even after more than a decade of its release. Did you guys ever expect it to become such a hit?

When we went into the studio, we never ever imagined the success that it would achieve. Every track we do, we think it will do well. But, sadly, not everything does, as it is hard to tell what goes into the success of the song. For Becoming Insane, we had a lot of fun doing the song.

Who do you listen to for inspiration?

For inspiration, we listen to many cutting edge new artistes . These do not have to be from any specific genre itself. Though, most of them are related to electronic.

Any collaborations with Indian artistes that we can look forward to?

I would love to hear and promote new artistes in psy trance. In fact, this was what led me to open an agency that manages new talent in the genre. I am currently looking to help people in this genre and would love to collaborate with any new artiste in the genre. I do not get to listen to much Indian music, except during the taxi rides in India or at the gigs here. But, I’d love to listen to more.

You’re always travelling on tight schedules. Do you ever feel that you could stay on a day or two longer to just to explore a place?

It is nice that we get to travel. But I always wait to get back home. We have families and I have four kids. So, my kids and my wife need my time. We always try to finish the show and then get back quickly. For us, family comes first. Amit, though, lived in India for extended periods and has travelled and checked out this beautiful nation.

What’s next from your side?

We are looking forward to the release of our new album, which should be out in the next month or two. We have a lot of new collaborations and surprises this time. These collaborators have made the album extra special. Each one is different and gives our fans something new to experience. I am eager to see the reaction to the entire album.

10,['6/03/2020'],‘I got nervous about Vivekh sir riding pillion with me’,"Before debuting with Chellamae, I did Jadikketha Moodi (produced by his father, GK Reddy, and directed by Umesh Prabakar) as a child artiste. My brother and I were in Class 7 then and we were just whisked away from school one day to shoot a song for the film. Pandiarajan sir was the hero and for that particular shot, he had to lift both of us and dance. It was a very small sequence, and I had a lot of fun on the set. So, that was my first tryst with the camera. When Chellamae happened years later, I fairly knew what all went into getting a shot right. But despite all that, I was super nervous to shoot for my first scene.It was a sequence in which Vivekh sir and I were heading to the bank and he had to ride pillion with me on the bike. I was scared to shoot with a senior actor like him and he was also scared to sit behind me. To top it all, I had to ride the bike on GN Chetty Road, in heavy traffic. Of course, I’ve ridden bikes when I was in college. But what made me nervous on that day was the fact that my first shot for my first film was with an actor of Vivekh sir’s calibre and I had to perform in front of top technicians.

11,['6/03/2020'],How India's ballet boys are dancing their way to their dreams,"Dipesh Verma first discovered ballet at 13 while browsing through YouTube on a mobile phone borrowed from his sister. The graceful movements immediately hooked Verma, a freestyle street dancer in Siliguri, and he began following a few dancers and imitating their moves. “It was a small town and ballet seemed so far away,” says Verma, 19. “But slowly, I found more love for ballet and started researching about ballet companies and how I could formally learn it in India.”It was only when he saw a YouTube video of veteran Israeli-American ballet teacher Yehuda Ma'or teaching two young men Manish Chauhan and Amiruddin Shah at dancer-choreographer Ashley Lobo ’s Danceworx academy in Mumbai in 2017 that he realised that there was a way to realise his dream. “They were the first boys I saw training in ballet in India. I was happy that there was a way to get out.”In 2017, Chauhan and Shah, the son of a taxi driver and welder respectively, made headlines for dancing their way to international ballet fame by securing an admission at Oregon Ballet Theatre in the US. Their journey inspired Verma and fellow student Bobby Roy to enroll at Dancework in 2018 and apply for 'Going Home' project, a programme that offers free ballet lessons to talented youth without the financial means to pursue a career in dance and had helped Chauhan and Shah as well. After a year-and-a-half of rigorous training, they both got admission at Paris Marais Dance School with full scholarships last November.Lobo recalls the duo's “natural talent and drive”. “When I met them and they wrote to me for the scholarship they could not speak English. I told them I needed to see that they could find a way to convince me,"" he says. ""They figured out how to write letters in English as well as expressed their desire clearly. That attitude combined with their natural talent told me they were very ready for the journey.”It wasn’t easy for Verma to convince his family to let him move to Mumbai to learn ballet in the first place. “My parents never liked me dancing. They were forcing me to study medicine but I felt if I did it I wouldn’t be happy my whole life,” he recalls. “Since childhood, I’d hide from my father, a grocer, and dance. If he knew I’d gone to my friend's place to dance, he would scream like crazy.” Nevertheless, after finishing his high school, Verma came to Mumbai at the age of 16. The early months were a struggle -- he had just Rs 6000 and no permanent residence, staying in a chawl, with friends and even sleeping on railways platforms.Around the same time in Delhi, Bobby Roy, a Bollywood dancer also decided to come to Mumbai to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional dancer after finishing class 10. Roy, whose father hawks clothes, had been earning some money through performances but was keen to make it big. “My family is not financially strong and at first, my father was upset because I am the oldest so he wanted me to become an engineer,” Roy, 19, says. “One day I told him I'll start studying to become an engineer but I won't get the happiness I do from dance. After that he said, do whatever you want.” After struggling to find a foothold in Mumbai for a few months, Roy finally joined ballet classes at Danceworx.“I didn’t like ballet at all at first. I didn’t understand it,” he says. But this changed when one day when he saw Shah performing Don Quixote in class and was spellbound. Even then, the transition was far from smooth. “Ballet dancers need flexibility, technique, and talent and I had none of these,” he says. “My body wasn't meant for ballet. So I began working ten times as hard -- I would memorise steps and stretch in the studio during lunch.” When Roy went home, people would confuse ballet for belly dancing and ask him why he was dancing like a girl. But the hard work paid off. “One-and-a-half years ago, I would struggle even to do a little jump in the air and split. I still can't believe I am here.”Life has come full circle for Verma as well. “In the beginning, my parents were so unhappy and tried to stop me from going to Mumbai saying I wouldn't survive and would come back in a week or that there was no money in dancing,” he recalls. “But after two years, they saw I was getting opportunities and scholarships in the US. Now they’re happy.”“I feel very honoured to do ballet. It is not just dancing -- the music, the orchestra, the theatre, the story and the way it all comes together is such a dream,” Verma says. “Even now, when I enter a theatre, I start crying.”For now, both Roy and Verma are keen to perform around the world after they graduate next year but they also want to come back and guide others like them. “Till my body has strength, I want to perform around the world but It is my dream to come back to India and open a ballet school,” says Roy. “Just as I got a chance, I want to provide a chance to people who have talent but face financial difficulties.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74501133,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1010556,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-indias-ballet-boys-are-dancing-their-way-to-their-dreams/articleshow/74501132.cms

NEW DELHI: The desi “Air Force One”, equipped with advanced missile defence measures, will finally be ready to fly the President or Prime Minister by the middle of next year. India has now inked the around $190 million (Rs 1,300 crore) deal with the US for two self-protection suites (SPS), which will be retrofitted on the two custom-built Boeing-777 aircraft earlier acquired for long-haul VVIP travel.

The two wide-bodied B-777s, with their fully-integrated advanced missile approach warning sensors, defensive electronic warfare systems, infra-red counter-measures, digital radio frequency jammersand other such contraptions under the overall SPS, will be akin to the US President’s iconic Air Force One or the “flying Oval office”.

Though the US President’s aircraft is much more advanced, and can even serve as an airborne command centre to direct military operations during NBC (nuclear, chemical, biological) attacks, the Indian PM will be able to fly in a much more secure, and plush, manner with the new planes.

The two extended-range B-777s, which will also have encrypted satellite communication facilities, will replace the almost three-decade old 747-400 jumbo jets being currently used for VVIP flights. The SPS will ensure a robust capability for automated detection and jamming of different kinds of missiles. The counter-measures dispenser systems, in turn, will swing into action by shooting flares and chaff to “misguide or divert” incoming radar-guided or heat-seeking missiles.

Sources on Thursday said the government-to-government deal for the two SPS was signed at the time President Donald Trump with his Air Force One was in India on February 24-25. It was in February 2019 that the US state department had notified the proposed “foreign military sale” of the SPS “to protect two Boeing-777 head-of-state aircraft” but negotiations delayed the inking of the contract till now.

“The two aircraft were slated for delivery in June 2020 after customisation at the Boeing facility in Dallas. But the SPS retrofitting in them will obviously take much more time,” said a source.

Moreover, the B-777s are set to be placed under the IAF’s control now, though the original plan was that Air India would own and operate them. A few IAF pilots have already being trained to fly the VVIP aircraft, and will take over operations from Air India pilots in the long run. With the SPS and other sophisticated systems, the aircraft will also have a military classification. “The call-sign is likely to be Indian Air Force One, not Air India One,” said the source.

13,['6/03/2020'],Focus more on investigating the reason of fatal road than who caused it: Experts to police,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Police shouldn’t focus on investigating who caused a road crash, rather it must find out what caused the crash, a top collision investigation and road traffic enforcement specialist said who has worked long for the police in United Kingdom . Even legal experts said how police should investigate every fatal road crash as they probe a murder case.

While addressing policy makers and Indian police officers at a workshop on ‘Dangers in Road Usage’, Mike Fell from UK said the change in this approach by investigators will help find out who had bigger role in any road crash. Several global safety experts are attending the workshop organised by the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) to discuss all aspects of dangerous driving at a time when amended Motor Vehicle Act has brought more traffic offences in this category.

""In most fatal accidents the focus of investigation should be what caused the accident not who caused it to reduce road accident deaths. United Kingdom has been able to reduce accidents by 30% in last one decade despite 400% increase in number of vehicles. Both enforcement and improving road engineering worked"", said Fell said. He added traffic safety and enforcement don’t get priority in India, which is the main reason why world’s largest accidents are taking place here.

Chief state attorney of Miami Florida, Stephen K Talpins traffic crashes are an intentional act and should be treated as murder. ""Changing driving behaviour and better enforcement can bring the change,"" he added.

Speaking at the workshop, Jeffery Micheal , former associate highway transport safety administration in the US, also said all road crashes should be investigated on scientific parameters instead of making driver responsible for each crash.

""There is a need to clearly identifying ‘dangerous factors’ and defining them in relation to drivers, other road users, vehicles, road infrastructure and the existing legislation and codes of practice. Such clear explanations would help law enforcement agencies as well as the judiciary towards catalyzing the process of improving road safety in the country,"" said Rohit Baluja, president of IRTE.

14,['6/03/2020'],Japan issues demarche to India for visa restrictions,"NEW DELHI: Japan has issued a demarche to India asking it to review its decision to cancel all e-visas to Japanese nationals. Apparently upset that it has been clubbed with countries like Iran, Italy and South Korea, Japan has conveyed to India that a blanket ban on visas is going to hurt economic engagement with India including work on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train which has a 2023 deadline.Japan, in fact, has also asked India to at least not block visas for Japanese engineers and other workers directly involved in bullet train work. ToI has learnt that Japanese authorities are trying to approach both health minister Harsh Vardhan and foreign minister S Jaishankar to emphasise before them the need to take an ""objective"" view of the situation.India has cancelled all e-visas for nationals of Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran as it works to prevent the spread of coronavirus Japan though has told Indian authorities that while South Korea had 5328 cases of infection, Italy 2502 and Iran 2336, Japan only was dealing with 284 such cases as of March 4, 2020, as per WHO. Japan also last week helped India evacuate 119 Indian nationals who were on board the Covid-19 infected Diamond Princess cruise ship.Indian government sources said they were working to address concerns raised by Japan. ""Their people are worried that if they step out of the country, they won't be allowed to return. But as we have said, they can still apply for visas with the Indian mission,"" said a source.There are more than 1400 Japanese companies active in India. Japan also wants India to consider the cases involving family members of Japanese workers as they are are unable to visit Japan for the fear of not being able to return to India.While India has said that Japanese nationals can still seek visa from the embassy in Tokyo, it seems easier said than done. ""There's effectively a ban on all visas as the visa officials are reluctant to issue any visa keeping in mind the coronavirus scare,"" said a source who didn't want to be quoted.The visas ban has come as a surprise to Japanese authorities as India otherwise looks at Japan as perhaps the most important partner for its economic transformation. As the MEA says, Japanese ODA supports India’s efforts for accelerated economic development particularly in priority areas like power, transportation, environmental projects and projects related to basic human needs.Apart from the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail , Japan is also helping India build the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor with twelve industrial townships and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC). They are all seen by the Indian government as landmark projects which can transform India in the next 10 years.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74501727,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-345086,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/visa-ban-could-hurt-economic-ties-japan-warns-india/articleshow/74501709.cms
15,['6/03/2020'],"Staring at uncertain future, Mandar gears up for 100th appearance with FC Goa","PANAJI: To get a measure of just how long Mandar Rao Dessai has stayed with FC Goa , have a look at the coaching staff.

In 2014 when FC Goa took shape and the Indian Super League (ISL) kicked off, Mandar was fighting his way into the playing eleven. It wasn’t easy. He had to displace Clifford Miranda for that left-wing position. It took a while, and it was not until coach Zico saw him and Romeo Fernandes wreak havoc during a friendly against Dempo SC, that he got his chance.

That seems like really long ago. Romeo is nowhere to be seen and Clifford is now the interim coach at FC Goa! While so much has changed at the club – including coaches, owners and players – Mandar has been the only constant. It’s no surprise then that the winger, forced to play as left-back for two seasons now, is approaching a record century of matches for FC Goa in the ISL and Super Cup.

“We speak about this. Once upon a time, I tell Clifford, ‘I was your teammate, and now you are the coach and I have to respect you more’,” said Mandar.

The former Dempo winger is the only player to remain with the club since inception. When he leads FC Goa against Chennaiyin FC in the decisive second leg semifinal at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday, it will be his 100th appearance for the club.

It’s a record that will remain his for some time. Sandesh Jhingan ( Kerala Blasters), Jeje Lalpekhlua (Chennaiyin FC) and Reagan Singh (NorthEast United) have all been with their clubs since ISL’s inception, but nobody has played as many games as the winger turned left-back. Jhingan, with 78 games in ISL and Super Cup, is second by quite some distance.

Mandar’s three-year contract which he signed in 2017 will expire in the summer and he is yet to sign an extension. There is desire from both sides to continue the partnership, but without putting pen to paper, there is also increasing danger that the club mascot could look elsewhere.

“Right now, the focus is just on the semifinal, a crucial game for us. I am definitely not thinking about the future. I don’t know whether I will be here or at some other club. All that I am thinking right now is the ISL trophy,” said Mandar.

The international defender has lost two finals with FC Goa. While he played from start to finish in the 2-3 loss against Chennaiyin at home in 2015, he had to pull out early after injuring himself in last season’s final clash against Bengaluru FC . Goa lost both finals but haven’t given up hopes that they can break their duck as the final returns to Goa for the second time.

“We have the away goal. It gives us something to fight at home. The first half was fine, we tried to keep the ball. It’s true that we missed some of our players who were always starting, but we conceded too many goals too soon in the second session,” said Mandar.

Just like everyone else, Mandar believes Goa can turn this around. With Hugo Boumous , Edu Bedia and Brandon Fernandes all returning for the second leg battle, who knows, Mandar’s century could be one to remember. Nothing better than doing this in front of adoring fans.

A lot of wrong information is spreading on social media, like having garlic and hot water, which is deplorable. Don’t spread misinformation. For critical patients supportive treatment is necessary, like keeping a patient hydrated, treating a secondary infection or to give medicine in case pressure falls etc. For normal fit adults, avoid shaking hands, request those coughing to wear a mask. Stay at least three-feet away from anyone infected. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.

22,['6/03/2020'],Are you obsessing about your food intake? You could be suffering from an eating disorder,"What is your relationship with food? Does its sight and smell excite you, or does it make you feel guilty and self-conscious? Food habits are linked to our state of mind, and when one fails to maintain a healthy balance between the two, it can lead to an eating disorder. This mental health condition is associated with a fixation with food or body shape, which disrupts your everyday life. It can be classified into common eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (caused by an intense fear of gaining weight), binge eating disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, which is most prevalent among children. Several factors, including the way a person’s brain is wired, genetics, personality traits and cultural influences are also at play here.Nia Sharma recently spoke to us about her battle with an eating disorder. “For the past few years, I’ve suffered from the fear of getting out of shape. I was obsessed with my weight and if I put on even one kilo, I’d start fretting over it. Even my conversations with my friends were all about my weight worries. And in order to look a particular way, I ended up starving myself. If I ever ate a lot, I would feel extremely guilty. So, I would try to throw up what I ate. This was a practice for many years, but I realise that it is one of the worst things I did to myself. My friends helped me realise it was a problem. Thankfully, I am now over it.”Social media is inundated with images and posts of healthy eating, workouts and people flaunting their fab bodies. This tends to put undue pressure on many. While trying to get that ‘perfect’ bod, some go to extreme lengths and end up suffering from eating disorders. Cyber-bullying can worsen the situation for them when their posts receive negative feedback. Dr Mundra says, “We sometimes do not realise that the constant posts and pages we follow also influence our choices, and can be detrimental to our health if we are not careful. Many people start with wanting to eat healthy, but gradually start obsessing about it. Slowly, that obsession takes over and they start avoiding food altogether as they are petrified about putting on an extra inch. As a result, some of them become painfully skinny and need help.”While some tend to overeat when they are going through an emotional crisis, others lose appetite at such times. Dr Vasant Mundra, a psychiatrist, explains, “Food is not only a basic need, but it also affects our physical, emotional and mental well-being. Loss of appetite and sleep are signs that an individual is battling depression.” He also explains that the condition affects one in five men and one in four women at some point in time, and is a common form of mental illness. Manish Roy (34), an IT professional, narrates his struggle with food. He says, “I was unhappy with the way my career was going, and that had a direct impact on my health. I drastically lost weight as I wasn’t eating well, and consequently, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression.”It isn’t uncommon to turn to food when you are depressed, anxious or stressed, even if it is for temporary relief. Homemaker Shreyansi Gupta shares, “My husband and I were going through serious problems in our marriage at one point. That affected me emotionally and in a strange self-punitive way, I started reaching for junk food to comfort myself. It was only when I gained more than 15kg in less than three months that I realised I needed help, perhaps not just with my diet but also my state of mind.” Some of us will devour a cupcake when stressed, while others reach out for a bar of chocolate, a bag of chips or cookies. And there is a reason for this. It’s a coping mechanism for stress, explains Dr Kersi Chavda, a psychiatrist. He says, “Excessive carbohydrates seem to increase neurotransmitter concentrations. This amongst other factors affects our mood. As sugar and carbohydrate-rich food make you feel happier temporarily, your brain craves this happy chemical again and again.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74493485,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-206555/74493485.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/are-you-obsessing-about-your-food-intake-you-could-be-suffering-from-an-eating-disorder/articleshow/74493437.cms

26,['6/03/2020'],"Yes Bank News: RBI supersedes Yes Bank board, caps withdrawals at Rs 50,000","RBI wanted to avoid 'systemic issues'

MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday evening superseded the board of directors of Rana Kapoor-promoted Yes Bank and limited cash withdrawal to Rs 50,000. However, depositors can withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh for medical treatment, higher education fees, expenses on marriage and other ceremonies, and “unavoidable emergencies”. The cap applies across even multiple accounts of the same depositor.RBI has appointed deputy managing director and chief finance officer of State Bank of India, Prashant Kumar, as an administrator of the bank. Although the central bank has said that the moratorium will last for 30 days, sources said that a plan involving SBI is in the works. This includes the possibility of a revival by an SBI-led consortium of new owners including Life Insurance Corporation.In a statement, RBI said it had given the bank’s management enough time to try and raise capital and find a ‘market-led solution’ to its problems. However, the bank failed to find investors who would support a revival package.“In the absence of a credible revival plan, and in public interest and the interest of the bank’s depositors, it had no alternative but to apply to the central government for imposing a moratorium… effective from today,” the RBI said.According to government sources, the management led by Ravneet Gill kept pushing the deadline for raising capital, prompting RBI to finally act. “RBI had to step in because it did not want to create systemic issues,” said a senior official.While depositors will be protected up to Rs 5 lakh, thanks to deposit insurance cover and the proposed reconstruction/amalgamation that RBI is working on, shareholders are likely to lose out. They include LIC, which holds an 8% stake, and mutual funds such as Nippon Life, Franklin Templeton and UTI Asset Management.JP Morgan said in a report, “We believe forced bailout investors will likely want the bank to be acquired at near-zero value to account for risks associated with the stress book and likely loss of deposits.”Yes Bank’s troubles first came to light in 2017 when RBI said that its bad loans were more than the bank had divulged. Following an inspection of the bank, RBI denied an extension to its founder and chief executive Kapoor.In subsequent years new defaults came to light. Some of the big defaulters to whom the bank had advanced funds included IL&FS, Anil Ambani group, CG Power, Cox & Kings, Café Coffee Day, Essel group , Essar Power, Vardaraj Cement, Radius Developers, and Mantri Group.Kapoor, an industry veteran, had floated Yes in 2003 and soon scaled it up. Banking sources said that the bank engaged in high-risk lending, providing advances to those who could not raise funds elsewhere.RBI began working on a moratorium a few days ago after it became clear that Yes Bank was unable to put in place a “credible proposal” for capital infusion.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74504632,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-176009,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-supersedes-yes-bank-board-caps-withdrawals-at-rs-50000/articleshow/74502162.cms

NEW DELHI: The toll in the north-east Delhi riots rose to 53 on Thursday as more victims died of their injuries in hospital. According to officials, so far 44 deaths have been reported from GTB Hospital and five from Ram Manohar Lohia . Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital has reported three deaths and Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital one.“Around 298 patients have been treated so far at GTB and around 100 have gunshot injuries,” said an official.Meanwhile, two new mobile videos have emerged showing the mayhem in the Chand Bagh area during riots on February 24. The videos show a mob of over 2,000 anti-CAA protesters attacking badly outnumbered policemen, throwing stones at them and even firing, as they are huddled over the divider, trying to escape the fury of the mob.This is the incident in which head constable Ratan Lal was shot dead while DCP Amit Sharma was critically injured, along with ACP Anuj Kumar and a dozen other cops . These clips show several women to be part of the mob.These will help cops in identifying the rioters. The cyber cell will use special software to enhance quality of the images and get them verified by a forensic lab.One of the two videos is shot from the terrace of a gym in Yamuna Vihar while the second has been shot from the Chand Bagh side. The police are also trying to reach the people who recorded the video.In the videos, the mob is first seen running away from the police with the women protesters behind the cops. But, suddenly, it turns back and comes charging at them, throwing stones and bricks, even as the women too join in the stone-pelting. The cops try to jump over the divider to cross the road and take refuge in the bushes even as they are being pelted with stones and also physically assaulted.They try to rescue their injured senior colleagues, braving a volley of stones. “Blood was oozing from the mouth of DCP (Shahdara), Amit Sharma, and he was not responding. Police were outnumbered by the mob 1:50 and the divider behind us acted as a wall. With the help of two others, we picked up Sharma and crossed three railings to take him to the hospital,” said a senior cop who was injured in the incident. The cop said that the stone-pelting was so intense and unrelenting that his helmet broke and he suffered an injury on the back of his head.Ratan Lal, who was already injured, was taken to the hospital from the other side of the road which goes towards Yamuna Vihar. He was rushed to the hospital in a private car that was flagged down but he died on the way.A third video has also emerged showing a rioter opening fire. Cops said he has been identified and raids are on to arrest him.Pooja Sharma, wife of DCP (Shahdara) Amit Sharma, told reporters that their family was extremely pained by the visuals. “My husband had gone to have a dialogue with the protesters. It was a group of only women. They took off his helmet and then the mob attacked him,” claimed Sharma. “I appeal to the government to take strict action against the rioters.

DARJEELING/KOLKATA: Sikkim has decided to ban entry of foreigners to insulate itself from the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), leading to wide-spread fears among travel and tour operators and hoteliers in Darjeeling that bookings would be cancelled.A blanket ban has been issued for permits to visit Nathu La that borders China.“Darjeeling and Sikkim are inter-linked tourist destinations. Overseas tourists usually spend four-and-a-half days in Sikkim and two-and-a-half days in Darjeeling. Now that they will not be able to travel to Sikkim, they are most likely to cancel the Darjeeling leg of their visits and go elsewhere for week-long holidays,” said Amit Periwal , the proprietor of Clubside Tours & Travel, who spent most of Thursday, informing his clients in the US and Europe about the development.The tourist season in the Hills gets underway in April.The Sikkim home department on Thursday issued a notification placing curbs on the issue of inner-line permit, a travel document that foreigners require to have in addition to the Indian visa to visit the Himalayan state. The restriction also applies to nationals from Bhutan. Within hours of the notification, an Australian group that was due to travel to the belt from March 28 sent a cancellation request to Pradeep Lama, proprietor of Blue Line Tours & Travel. “I fear there will be more such cancellations,” Lama said.Around 8% visitors to Darjeeling are foreigners. Americans and Europeans in addition to Japanese and Chinese make up a bulk of travellers to Sikkim and north Bengal. While restrictions have been placed on entry of Chinese and Japanese travellers into India following the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Sikkim government’s decision will now impact not only hotels in Darjeeling, but also the travel industry in Kolkata and the rest of India.“With outbound travel business gone, we were trying to woo foreigners to India that had been relatively free of nCoV. But with cases in Kerala and then Delhi and Agra, some of the big tourist draws are gone. Now with Sikkim’s no-entry to foreigners, the recovery efforts by selling India is as good as over,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi .

NEW DELHI: Holi goods traders sitting idle just five days before the festival would be an unimaginable sight under normal circumstances. But this year, the festival of colours could prove to be a damp squib for shopkeepers and wholesalers.Large scale importers are set to be hit particularly hard as consumers and traders are shying away from made-in-China Holi products such as balloons, toys and colours due to the coronavirus scare. Holi-related Chinese goods worth about Rs 500 crore are lying with importers across Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, according to an estimate by trader bodies.When asked what they intend to do with the unsold inventory, importers said they would have to bear the brunt of the losses. “This was unforeseen,” said Ashish Grover, a New Delhi-based importer of Holi products. “Holi is one of the biggest festivals. The losses this year will have a long-term impact on my business,” he added.Much hype has been created in the country on novel coronavirus, which has badly impacted the domestic market,” said B C Bhartia, national president of Confederation of All India Traders. “Even retail traders are least interested in procuring Chinese goods,” he said.Sanjeev Jain, a trader who deals in Holi equipment, said he had been sitting idle all day. “The shop is empty. While we all had bought goods from China before December, it seems it will be difficult to clear them,” Jain said. The biggest hub for trade of Holi goods in Sadar Bazar is reporting a severe decline in sale of Holi essentials. The recent riots in northeast Delhi have also kept people from nearby towns away.Kale Ram (58), a sales representative, said he has been selling colours and pichkaris for the past 30 years but has never witnessed such a drop in sales. “Small shopkeepers from all over north India come here to purchase in bulk. This year, sales are very slow as outsiders have this image that the entire Delhi was affected by riots,” Ram said.While traders had imported multiple niche items like ‘police cannon’, ‘rocket launcher’ and ‘Holi crackers’, the clientele has simply refused to show up. “Last year, some of these popular products had gone out of stock several days before Holi but now traders are even thinking of reducing the prices to clear the stocks. We may be staring at massive losses,” Rahul Sharma , a trader, said.Traders say it takes around 30 days to import goods from China and orders are made almost one month before so that they can be sent to other states. It is estimated that goods worth Rs 90-100 crore are currently stuck in the market.Chokhelal Patwa, another wholesale dealer, said that in a normal year he would not even have time to breathe during the Holi season but this year is different. “Even people who are coming to buy are not purchasing in bulk as they are apprehensive that people might not turn up to celebrate in the same fervour due to the virus scare.” Nikki Kumari, a salesgirl in the shop, said she was finding it extremely difficult to make sales pitches.Sadar Bazar’s cental road is usually lined with roadside vendors who buy cheap goods from wholesale dealers and sell it at a profit. A seasonal trade for many who are low-wage labourers may prove disastrous this year. Nisha Rani, a vendor, said the crowd present in the market was mostly passing traffic. “What will we do of all these colours and balloons? People are simply not coming,” she said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74502292,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1112345,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-riots-threaten-to-make-it-a-colourless-holi-for-shopkeepers/articleshow/74502291.cms

concerns, but discussing them with India’

NEW DELHI: Ignoring the Centre’s strong protest against Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif’s comments on the Delhi riots, Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei on Thursday slammed India on the violence.Using the hashtag #IndianMuslimsInDanger, the Ayatollah tweeted, “The hearts of Muslims all over the world are grieving over the massacre of Muslims in India. The government of India should confront extremist Hindus and their parties and stop the massacre of Muslims in order to prevent India’s isolation from the world of Islam.”This comes even as the Centre urged the international community to refrain from “irresponsible comments” and “not be influenced by unsubstantiated narrative” on last week’s violence. On Tuesday, the MEA issued a demarche to the Turkish ambassador to protest against comments by Turkish President Recep Erdogan. “They are factually inaccurate and driven by political agenda. We don’t expect such irresponsible statements,” the MEA said.In a speech in Ankara, Erdogan had said, “India right now has become a country where massacres are widespread. What massacres? Massacres of Muslims. By who? Hindus. How will these people make global peace possible? It is impossible. When making speeches — since they have a large population — they say, ‘we are strong’ but that is not strength.”Freedom House, a US think tank, also flagged concerns about India. “The Indian government has taken its Hindu nationalist agenda to a new level with a succession of policies... threatening the democratic future of a country long seen as a potential bulwark of freedom in Asia and the world,” it said.Nigel Adams, junior foreign minister of UK, told the House of Commons, “The UK government has concerns about the potential impact of the legislation (CAA). It is because of our close ties with India that we are able to discuss difficult issues with them and make clear our concerns where we have them, including on the rights of minorities. We will continue to follow events and to raise our concerns when we have with them,” the minister said. The MEA has not reacted to this remark yet.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74502306,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1153548,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/irans-ayatollah-khamenei-slams-india-for-delhi-riots/articleshow/74502299.cms
35,['6/03/2020'],Nirbhaya convicts set to hang on March 20,"A Delhi court set March 20 as the date for executing the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya case

NEW DELHI: A city court on Thursday set March 20 as the date for executing the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case. The court noted there was no legal bar, but rather an obligation to set the date.

The latest ruling follows three postponements of the hanging in six weeks and adds a sense of finality in a sensational case in which the four had received the death sentence way back in 2013.

“Death warrants issued by this court with respect to condemned convicts Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay and Vinay shall now be carried into effect by hanging the convicts by the neck until they are dead on March 20 at 5.30 am,” said additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana.

Special prosecutor Irfan Ahmed , who on Wednesday moved a plea seeking setting the date of hanging, informed the court the convicts had exhausted all their legal remedies . Convict Pawan Gupta was the last convict in the case to exhaust the legal remedy of the President’s mercy .

‘No legal hurdles left in setting execution date in Nirbhaya case’

Rejection of his mercy plea brought an end to all judicial, Constitutional and administrative remedies to which a prisoner is entitled as a right before execution of death sentence.

Appearing for Pawan, Vinay and Akshay, advocate A P Singh said he would be meeting Pawan and then challenge the rejection of mercy plea. While he also wanted to meet Akshay to “discuss with him the future course of action”, he conceded that there was no legal obstacle before judge Rana to set the date of hanging. He also prayed that the jail authorities be directed to permit the convicts to meet their counsels.

When it was urged that Akshay be informed about the status of his second mercy petition, the court stated that the jail superintendent was duty-bound to do it. Judge Rana was of the view that the lawyers were at liberty to meet their clients as per the standard procedure of jail after complying with the formalities.

The state government had on Wednesday said that all legal remedies of the convicts have been exhausted and nothing survived now. And no notice was required to be issued, the prosecutor said.

The court, however, stated that principles of natural justice are part of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and the sacrosanct principle of “audi alteram partem” (listen to the other side) couldn’t be ignored.

A day before the last scheduled day of hanging, the court had observed that the condemned convict shouldn't meet his creator with a grievance in his bosom that the courts if this country have not acted fairly in granting him an opportunity to exhaust all his legal remedies. It had deferred till further orders the hanging of convicts after it was informed that one of the convicts had moved a mercy plea with the President.

36,['6/03/2020'],EPF Interest Rate: EPFO snips interest rate by 0.15% to 7-year low of 8.5%,"NEW DELHI: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) on Thursday recommended a minor reduction in interest rate for its six crore subscribers to 8.5% for the current financial year, the lowest in seven years, compared with 8.65% last year.The lower rates came amid falling interest rates in the economy, which has prompted the RBI to lower policy rates by 135 basis points over the last few months. Labour & employment minister Santosh Gangwar told reporters that at 8.5%, the social security agency for organised sector workers will be left with a surplus of Rs 700 crore. Paying higher than what was decided by the central board of trustees would have left a hole in the EPFO’s books.Even at the current rate, EPF remains more attractive than other instruments, especially because it remains tax-free at every stage. While investment up to Rs 1.5 lakh fetches a tax break, there is no levy on the interest earned and even the withdrawal amount is tax-free. Including the tax benefits, the returns will add up to around 11% for someone in the 30% tax bracket.Currently, comparable products such as public provident fund offer 7.9% a year, while a 5-10 year fixed deposit with SBI will earn 6.6%. In fact, bankers complain that higher returns offered by EPFO and on small savings schemes are holding up a reduction in lending rates, making home and auto loans expensive. The recommendations of the EPFO’s central board of trustees rate will now have to be ratified by the finance ministry.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74502383,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-591624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/epfo-snips-interest-rate-by-0-15-to-7-year-low-of-8-5/articleshow/74502382.cms

38,['6/03/2020'],"Yes Bank News: Rana Kapoor, a veteran banker who never said no to risky loans","MUMBAI: The word about Yes Bank in finance circles was that it was a lender which never said no to risky borrowers who had built a highly leveraged position. Veteran banker Rana Kapoor used his networking ability to lend and recover loans, distinguishing the bank from others which depended more on process rather than relationships.When the business cycle turned and the central bank became tough on bad loans, Yes Bank ended up with a disproportionately high level of non-performing assets (NPAs) with a presence in almost every stressed account — whether it was DHFL , IL&FS, the Anil Ambani Group , Essel Group and many other troubled borrowers.Kapoor was ousted by the RBI last year and his shares in the bank, which he once described as never-to-be-sold “diamonds”, were offloaded by lenders who had them under pledge. His successor Ravneet Gill has been struggling for a year to keep afloat the bank that Kapoor built, but ran out of time with the RBI pulling the plug on Thursday.Kapoor, who started his career as an intern with Citibank New York, joined Bank of America in 1980 and led its wholesale banking business in Asia. He headed ANZ Grindlays’s investment bank, then the largest in India, up to its acquisition by StanChart in 1998.It was at this point that Kapoor began the pursuit of his dream to set up his own financial institution by floating Rabo India Finance with brother-in-law Ashok Kapur and another banker Harkirat Singh.In 2003, Kapoor and Kapur floated Yes Bank — the second time that the RBI was experimenting with granting a banking licence to professionals. The time was fortunate, as a year later another professional-promoted institution — Ramesh Gelli’s Global Trust Bank — folded up.Rising profits boosted the share price with Kapoor’s holding turning him into a billionaire. A large part of the bank’s profits came from the upfront fees that it earned on risky term loans.Many bankers feel that Kapoor would have been better off had he agreed to sell his stake to new promoters and exited from Yes Bank in 2017. However, despite being ousted by the RBI, Kapoor fought back and swore never to sell his shares.As luck would have it, Yes Bank’s woes worsened with a series of unexpected defaults hitting it in quick succession, beginning with IL&FS and DHFL. While his successor Gill tried his best to bring in new investors, the spate of defaults and their slow resolution in the bankruptcy courts turned investors sceptical. Ultimately, the RBI had no choice but to use its ultimate weapon of placing the bank under moratorium.Even after launching the bank, Kapoor had three major setbacks. First, his brother-in-law and co-promoter Kapur was killed at the Taj hotel in Mumbai during the 26/11 terror attacks.Soon thereafter, the global financial crisis broke out and there was a credit squeeze, with Yes Bank being badly hit because of its dependency on wholesale loans. However, the subsequent easing by the central bank and government support helped the bank get back on its feet almost immediately. The third was a boardroom battle with Madhu Kapur , his sister-in-law. While this ended in a truce, Kapoor did not have the satisfaction of having his own people on the board.When the going was good, Kapoor used his stake to raise around Rs 630 crore by pledging his shareholding in the bank through two promoter entities — Morgan Credit and Yes Capital . However, as the share price of his bank collapsed, lenders began selling all his holding, pushing down the share price even further, and thereby hurting the revival plans of the bank as well.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74505696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-212669,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kapoor-a-veteran-banker-who-never-said-no-to-risky-loans/articleshow/74502001.cms

SURAT: The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has unearthed Rs 10 crore tax evasion by Vapi-based distributor and manufacturer of branded gutkha brand from Gwalior , on Thursday.

Sources said that the DGGI’s Surat unit had received intelligence report against the Sama Sales, engaged in the distribution of Karamchand brand of paan masala. It was found that its customers in south Gujarat were receiving the goods without payment of GST from the clearing and forwarding (C&F) agent of the company in the state.

The Karamchand paan masala is manufactured in Gwalior and it is supplied to the C&F agent in Gujarat for the forward sale to the distributors. However, searches were conducted at the C&F agent, transporters and the manufacturers in Gwalior for the evasion of the tax.

Officials said that scrutiny of the documents seized during the search operation revealed amount of tax evasion at Rs 10 crore. However, the distributor, C&F agent and the company accepted the evasion and paid Rs 4.5 crore to the officials with the promise to deposit remaining amount with the department soon.

Earlier, the only tourist police station of the state existed in Agra.

SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary also announced the appointment of Dhananjay Kumar Pandey as the first SO of newly created Lalpur-Pandeypur police station on the occasion. Both these police stations were sanctioned by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in November and December 2019. Construction of the buildings of these two police stations will be started soon.

The SSP said that the newly appointed SOs will monitor construction of the proposed buildings of their police stations. A budget of Rs seven crore has been sanctioned for the construction of TPS building whiuch will come up on the campus of tourism department in Sarnath, he said. The building of Lalpur-Pandeypur police station will be constructed on the land of Pahadia police outpost, said the officials adding that the budget of the building will become clear after the agency concerned submits an estimate.

On November 29, 2019, Yogi government had sanctioned two tourist police stations each in Gorakhpur and Varanasi, for extending better facilities to national and international tourists and pilgrims apart from ensuring their safety.

Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi, who disclosed the CM’s decision in November, had visited Varanasi on December 21, 2019 and announced the sanctioning of Lalpur-Pandeypur police station by dividing the area of jurisdiction of Cantonment police station. He also directed the officials concerned to act promptly for setting up the new police stations in accordance with the prescribed norms.

A staff of 70 constables and seven inspectors and sub-inspectors has been sanctioned for the TPS, which will be arranged soon, said the SSP adding that similar, provision will be followed for the Lalpur-Pandeypur police station.

42,['6/03/2020'],‘Indian astronauts can fight space blues with yoga’,"Chennai: Yoga could be an integral part of the daily routine of the Indian astronaut who is sent into the space in the next two or three years, Indian Space Research Organization former chairman K Kasturirangan has said.

With India’s plans for human space mission — Gaganyaan — a new dimension needs to be created with respect to medical education that involves understanding and dealing with physiological and psychological effects on human beings in space and to adopt the necessary counter measure, he said to young doctors, nurses and paramedics at the 32nd annual convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University here. The convocation was declared open by the chancellor and TN governor Banwarilal Purohit.

The convocation was held on the university campus for the first time. Students, graduates, doctors, paramedics and professors attended the event.

Kasturirangan said in space human beings face micro-gravity conditions that affect flow of body fluids and body mass. Although the cardiovascular system adapts to the new environment, an astronaut in space experiences 3.2% of average bone loss after nearly 10 days of weightlessness, primarily through the excessive secretion of calcium and phosphorus in urine. The loss of calcium in urine may produce stones in the bladder which may cause severe pain. Counter measures include on-board exercise with treadmill and ergometer, he said. India’s spaceman Rakesh Sharma, he said, found benefits in yoga to beat the blues in space. “We need to create specialized courses as well as institutions to impart education with necessary simulation and training infrastructure for our future astronauts,” he said.

Kasturirangan gave away the degrees and awards to 724 students, including 328 medical, 84 dental, 58 AYUSH and 254 in allied health services. In addition 16,866 were given the degrees in absentia. The university will give away 130 endowment medals and cash awards to students. There are 62 endowment gold medals, 8 endowment silver medals and 60 university medals.

He urged young graduates to combine ancient Indian wisdom with modern science.

Earlier, BARC former chairman R Chidambaram spoke about artificial intelliegence in medicine. A match between debating campion Harish Natrajan and a female voice AI system nicknamed Ms Debater proved how the machine can never win against human without emotional intelligence.

“We have robotic surgery in India, but I don’t expect to see an independent doctor robot to emerge in the foreseeable future,” he said. He, however, said machines had a large role to play in the medical field.

43,['6/03/2020'],HC functioning at 50% strength with only 25 judges,"PATNA: The Patna High Court is functioning with less than 50% of its full strength of 53 judges for the past several years. The current strength of 25 judges will get further depleted when Justice Vinod Kumar Sinha retires next month.

In fact, this year will see two more judges retire after Justice Sinha’s superannuation on April 22. Justice Aditya Kumar Trivedi is scheduled to superannuate on August 10 followed by Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh on October 2. The most recent judge to retire was Justice Anjana Mishra, who superannuated in February end.

Last year, the high court recommended 15 names to the Supreme Court collegium for elevated to higher judiciary in Patna. However, no information has surfaced in the public domain so far over the recommended names.

The HC has more than 1.76 lakh cases pending for hearing before it. Out of them, 96,278 are civil cases while 80,204 are criminal cases, as per figures available on the National Judicial Data Grid updated till March 5.

The last time the Patna High Court’s strength was increased was way back in 2003 when the older sanctioned strength of 43 judges was increased to 53, which stands to this day.

Senior advocate Yogesh Chandra Verma expressed concern over the majority post of judges lying vacant. “Since more than a year, these posts are lying vacant. Looking at Bihar’s population, there should be at least 70 working judges, but even the sanctioned positions are not getting filled. More than six months has passed that 15 names were recommended for elevation at Patna High Court but nothing has happened yet,” Verma said.

Verma, who is the chairman of the coordinating committee of all three associations of HC lawyers as well as president of the Advocates’ Association, remarked that speedy disposal is a fundamental right of a litigant.

“The bar doesn’t relish this situation. In the absence of adequate number of judges, Patna High Court is perhaps passing through its worst phase. Our request to the Supreme Court collegium and the central government would be to act quickly on the issue,” Verma said.

Another advocate Dinu Kumar said litigants are suffering due to depleted strength of judges and added that the apex court and the Centre is well aware of the abnormal rise of litigations due to the Excise Act in Bihar. “It is taking almost six months to get a bail in other matters. In such a scenario, Supreme court and the central government must take steps to recruit judges here fast,” Kumar said.

Representatives of different teachers’ associations said they would continue the agitation till the government agrees to their demands.

Describing the act of the teachers to abstain from evaluation work as a “punishable crime”, Nalanda district education officer (DEO) Manoj Kumar said so far 155 teachers were suspended and FIRs lodged against 215 for either not joining the evaluation work or preventing others from doing so.

He said 570 teachers, including guest teachers, had evaluated 1,59,554 answer sheets till Wednesday and only 1,31,042 answer sheets were left to be evaluated in the district. “Altogether 794 teachers were commissioned to evaluate 2,90,596 answer sheets at five centres in the district – National High School, Aadarsh High School, Nalanda College, Kisan College and Soghra College,” the DEO added.

The striking teachers, who burned effigies of CM Nitish Kumar, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and education minister recently, also went begging on streets, tonsured their heads and organized hawans as part of their protest.

Teachers in Sheikhpura also held a protest march on Wednesday while Kasar block education officer Manju Kumari on Thursday lodged FIRs against four teachers who refused to join evaluation work.

45,['6/03/2020'],States told to check drug availability,"Rupali Mukherjee | TNNMumbai: Drug pricing regulator NPPA on Thursday asked states and UTs to monitor the production and availability of key APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients or raw materials) in which there is dependance on China and their finished drug formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding, and ensure price compliance.The APIs are used in drugs like paracetamol, aspirin, azithromycin and amoxicillin, ofloxacin, metronidazole, vitamins such as B12, B1, B6, and E, female hormone progesterone and HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. Pharma companies say certain API firms have increased prices of key ingredients as high as 80%, which are due to “speculative buying, and not justified”.With the number of coronavirus cases rising in India, there is fear of panic buying, with people trying to hoard certain essential medicines, including antibiotics. A similar situation is being witnessed in surgical masks and hand sanitisers, with them flying off retail shelves, with reports of marked up prices.Due to the coronavirus outbreak in China and the resulting lockdown, imports of key APIs have been impacted, resulting in disruption in the supply chain of domestic units. Of the total imports of APIs, China accounts for around 65-70%, while in specific ingredients like cephalosporins, azithromycin and penicillin, the dependence is as high as 80 to 90%. Earlier this week the government also imposed restrictions on exports of 26-odd APIs and finished formulations of key antibiotics, vitamins, and paracetamol. While last month, the regulator had asked the industry to submit price movement, production details and inventory of crucial APIs, imported from China.In a related development, Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, V Sadananda Gowda on Thursday said there is no shortage of medicines in the country. Speaking at India Pharma & Medical Device 2020, he stressed the need to reduce dependence on imports of APIs, urging companies to increase their capacity in API manufacturing.The industry has also been involved with Indian Council of Medical Research to identify alternatives to molecules, on which there is dependence on China.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/states-told-to-check-drug-availability/articleshow/74502087.cms
46,['6/03/2020'],49% startups hired fewer or no women in last 12 months,"Chennai: A six month mandatory maternity leave policy in the country is impacting women being hired by startups, a survey has revealed. A survey by consumer forum Local Circles has shown that 49% of the startups and SMES have hired fewer or no women in the last 12 months.

The platform conducted a survey to assess the impact of this amendment in the last 12 months from over 8,500 startups, SMEs and entrepreneurs. A third or 33% said they did not hire women at all while 16% said they had hired fewer women than in the previous year.

LocalCircles will be making a submission of this report to the Ministry of Labour & Employment and asking them to take swift action on it. Startups cite reasons of limited funds to accommodate paid maternity leave for 6 months and have refrained from hiring women in that age group if they are married. “Unfortunately, this is biased against women, but the resources need to be exceptional for us to bear the cost of a candidate who is not working for 6 months. We want the duration to be reduced for startups that are registered with the DPIIT,” said Nikunj Bubna, founder, The WowBox. The company has not hired any women in the last 12 months and has only 15% women in its total workforce. It is exploring hiring women as consultants so that they hire qualified candidates but also save costs. The young firms are keeping away from newly married women or those who have been wedded for 3-4 years and this is keeping the gender ratio skewed towards men. For this, startups recommend a 3 month paid leave system for them.

In the survey, 37% opted for 3 months paid leave.

“We work at hand to mouth in terms of resources. As such what is happening is startups think twice before hiring a person who could probably go on a maternity leave in near future. Thus, slowly, startups are becoming man bastions despite no mistake on the part of the women. To solve the problem either maternity benefit should be for 3 months for startups or the government must bear the cost for 3 months,” said Sreejith Moolayil, co-founder, True Elements.

The regulator has also asked insurance companies to ensure they do not reject claims by those infected by coronavirus, including treatment during quarantine period under existing mediclaim policies.The directive comes even as health authorities are yet to come out with a standard treatment. The regulator has said that where hospitalisations are covered, insured shall ensure patients affected by coronavirus are handled expeditiously.According to Oriental Insurance chairman Girija Kumar, the current mediclaim policies are enough to cover treatment for coronavirus.“The directions from the regulator are to pay due diligence to claims,” he said. Kumar, who is chairman of the General Insurance Council, was in the city, with other non-life CEOs, to launch the industry’s awareness campaign — Faayde Ki Baat. The CEOs said the current mediclaim policies do not exempt coronavirus hospitlalisation.At present, those infected are admitted to government-designated hospitals, while suspected patients too are not admitted to regular hospitals. “Patients may have to be admitted to regular hospitals if other organs are affected. There might also be cases where detection happens later,” said Future Generali COO Shreeraj Deshpande According to Deshpande, the specialised cover for coronavirus could be in the nature of a benefit cover where the insured gets a fixed amount if infected. “It is the variant of flu virus and in all likelihood the treatment will be administering a cocktail of antibiotics. For majority of people who are kept under isolation, there would be loss of salary that can be covered under the policy,” he said.According to Aditya Birla Health Insurance CEO Mayank Bathwal, the focus of authorities at present is on isolating those infected by the virus. “A health insurance policy covers all infections, and coronavirus is one such. Coverage will be available in all our products that offer hospitalisation covers. Hence, all covers such as in-patient treatment, pre- and post-hospitalisation, OPD and ambulance cover, that your health policy offers will be available to you,” he said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/create-new-cover-for-covid-19-says-irdai/articleshow/74502078.cms
49,['6/03/2020'],"Has Nitish’s stand on NPR, NRC dented Gaya anti-CAA protest?","GAYA: The crowd at the anti-CAA protest at Shantibagh, which began on December 29, appears to have thinned following CM Nitish Kumar’s stand on NPR-NRC and the subsequent resolution passed by the Bihar assembly.

Conceding that the footfall at the 24x7 dharna site has registered a decline, Satish Kumar, joint convener of the Samvidhan Bachao Morcha, attributed it to “some confusion” caused by the CM’s announcement. According to Kumar, a section of the people aggrieved by the CAA-NPR-CAA fall out has been “temporarily taken for a ride” by the CM.

However, the protest organisers continue to hold their ground. “Along with convener Umair Khan, we are trying to create awareness about the shallow nature of the announcement and the CM’s track record of going back on his promises,” Satish said.

He added, “The initial confusion has been removed to a great extent and the dharna is gradually regaining its momentum.”

The organisers claimed that the agitation will continue till a “satisfactory resolution” either through a judicial verdict or the government stepping back. “After taking a hard stand, the government is unlikely to back off, but our faith in the judicial system continues to be strong and the supremacy of the basic principles of Constitution will be redeemed,” said the joint convener.

But there are differing voices within the Muslim community in Gaya. According to activist Abdul Moqsit Karimi @Motibhai, the protestors have no reason to disbelieve CM Nitish Kumar. “Notwithstanding Nitish Kumar’s alliance with BJP, the CM has always been very sensitive to the genuine concerns of Muslims and his track record has been free from any anti minority bias. The socialist in the CM was very much alive and thriving,” Karimi, who is also the general secretary of the district Olympic association, said.

Welcoming the CM’s stand on NPR-NRC, orthopaedic surgeon Dr Farasat Hussain has little reason to disbelieve the CM. “But the legal implications of the CM’s announcement as well as the Bihar assembly resolution remain questionable. Moreover, the BJP leadership has not yet officially reacted to the CM’s stand,” Hussain said.

“The track record of BJP inspires little confidence and they have yet to send signals that are in sync with the ‘sabka Vishwas’ slogan. So there is no harm in continuing with the peaceful protests till an SC order comes,” Hussain remarked, adding, he hoped for early justice as delayed justice amounted to injustice.

Retired IPS Masoom Aziz Kazmi is of the opinion that if the protesters suspend the agitation for sometime it would not mean surrender. “No agitation has got a uniform trajectory and Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest ever practitioner of peaceful protests, too, periodically reviewed his strategy. Let us take Nitish at his face value,” said Kazmi.

Police said around 10 activists, a few of them having criminal background and charged with spreading hatred in the society earlier, reached the Power House Chowk at Maripur around 11.30pm and threatened those sitting on dharna to vacate the place by Thursday morning.

The four arrested people – Vaibhav Mishra, Vikas Goswami, Rishikesh Shahi and Gautam Kumar – are residents of Muzaffarpur. They were caught by those sitting on dharna and subsequently handed over to the police. The breathalyzer test confirmed that the four had consumed liquor.

Muzaffarpur City SP Niraj Kumar Singh said Vaibhav had criminal antecedents. “He was earlier booked for spreading hatred and inciting communal flare up through social media. Mishra has also been accused of threatening former SSP Manoj Kumar over phone,” Singh added.

He, however, said the four arrested persons created nuisance outside the dharna site in inebriated condition. A bottle of liquor was also seized from their possession. On Thursday, all the four accused were produced in a local court, which remanded them in judicial custody.

“Raids are on to nab other accomplices of the four, who managed to give a slip to the police,” the SP added.

52,['6/03/2020'],"Teachers’ strike hits exams, evaluation &amp; mid-day meals","PATNA: The indefinite strike of 4 lakh contractual and regular teachers of government-run schools has adversely affected 71,000 primary schools and 6,000 secondary and higher secondary schools across the state with mid-day meals discontinued in about 81% primary schools.

The primary teachers went on strike from February 17 over their 8-point demand charter, including equal pay for equal work, while secondary and higher secondary schoolteachers have been on strike since February 25.

The annual examination for Class IX, which was scheduled to begin from March 4, has been suspended due to the strike. The examination was supposed to be conducted by the Bihar State Secondary Teachers’ Association (BSSTA).

BSSTA spokesperson Abhishek Kumar said the examination was suspended because only 5% teachers are on duty, out of 50,000 teachers in secondary and higher secondary government schools. “The non-protesting teachers are doing the evaluation of answer copies of intermediate, the examination of which was conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board,” he said.

He added: “The examination will be conducted only after the strike is called off. We will call off our strike when the state government would fulfil our demands.”

The annual examination of classes I to VIII, which would begin from March 16 would also be affected as primary teachers are also not ready to call off their strike until the state government accepts their demands.

Sanjay Kumar Singh, state project director of Bihar Education Project Council, a wing of education department told this newspaper that the department has no accurate data on the absentee teachers in primary schools. “The block education officers have been asked to send the list of absentee teachers to stop the salary of teachers who are boycotting their duty,” he said.

Education officials, however, claimed that the attendance in most of the government schools was poor.

According to the director of the mid-day meal scheme, Kumar Ramanuj, mid-day meals have been discontinued as 81% primary schools are closed due to the ongoing strike.

Ramanuj on Wednesday issued a letter to district programme officers asking them to send a daily report on mid-day meals to the district offices. “The online reporting system shows that only 19% primary schools are serving mid-day meal to kids till February 27. Additional chief secretary of education department is reviewing the mid-day meal scheme affected due to the strike,” Ramanuj said in the letter.

The teachers’ strike may also impact the evaluation of answer copies of Class XII exam. Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma told this newspaper that the results of intermediate and matriculation may get delayed due to the strike. “We can’t fulfil all the demands of teachers. The department is looking for the long-term solution to sort out the problem,” he said.

Officials at the Board, however, claimed that the evaluation process has been going smoothly as regular, government-aided, inter-college and college teachers have been evaluating the copies.

Meanwhile, college administrations have complained that academic activities in their colleges were affected as teachers have been deputed for evaluation duty. Principal of AN College, SP Shahi said 50% teachers are on evaluation duty, which is hampering the academic activities for last few days.

Sanjay had earlier written to the Union ministry of health and family welfare about long porous border which Bihar shares with Nepal.Through the letter, Sanjay had requested the Union health ministry to take up the issue with the external affairs ministry which could intervene and coordinate with Nepal government for establishing a mechanism of coordination between health officials of Bihar and Nepal for better screening.Seven districts of Bihar with 6,364 villages share border with Nepal. There are 49 transit points at these borders and 1,11,984 people have so far been screened there.The health department has also urged the state government to set up a coordination committee, involving officials of various departments, under the supervision of chief secretary to combat coronavirus threat.Sanjay said the state has got 5,000 N95 masks from the Centre and placed an order for 31,000 more such masks. “The department has also got 32,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits to be used by medical service providers,” he added.Meanwhile, state health minister Mangal Pandey has asked people not to get panicked and purchase masks only if required. “Everyone should not be worried about the mask.

Pending confirmation of 14 teachers in the job was one of the major issues on which members of South Gujarat University Teachers' Association (SOGUTA) made a first of its kind representation to the VC in the last one decade. The representation follows protest by a student group and members of the syndicate against the VC. Gupta and his supporters were recently cornered over signing of an MoU with a private institute to allow it to offer event and sports management courses from university premises.

SOGUTA also demanded promotions to eligible teachers under career advancement scheme (CAS) and permanent appointment of those employed in self-financed courses.

""We have been writing letters to university registrar since last many months, but the vice-chancellor claims he is not aware about them. Majority of our demands except confirmation of appointment of 14 teachers are a routine affair that the university should have done without any need of us to remind it,"" SOGUTA president Rakesh Desai said.

The probation of the 14 teachers was to end in 2019, but has been extended by university authorities for some or the other reasons. Some of these teachers have also approached different courts with the prayer that their appointment be made regular. These teachers were appointed during the term of previous vice-chancellor and hence being victimized, university sources said.

It is a large unmet medical need as there is currently no approved drug for NASH globally, a disease that is highly prevalent with 10-30% of the global population being affected, a company statement said.

Saroglitazar was launched in India in September 2013, for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with type-2 diabetes not controlled by statins alone. NASH is a progressive disease of the liver, which starts with fat accumulation in the liver known as Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This condition could progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.

The prevalence of NASH in India is estimated to be nearly 25% of the population. NASH ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only option for managing advanced cirrhosis with liver failure. TNN

56,['6/03/2020'],A long road ahead for bitcoin exchanges,"Rachel Chitra | TNN

Bengaluru: After the Supreme Court’s landmark verdict lifting the ban on cryptocurrencies in India, interest has spiked overnight, according to exchanges. Players like Zebpay, Unocoin , Wazirx and CoinDCX went live on Thursday, a day after the SC verdict. While some banks like Karnataka Bank, IDBI and Karur Vysya Bank have started supporting their payments, others are waiting for an official circular from the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to go ahead.

However, reviving a legitimate cryptocurrency market in India could take time and effort, say the founders, as there are both regulatory challenges and the global bitcoin slump to deal with.

Payment gateways

The first practical problem for crypto exchanges in India is the payment networks. In April 2018, the RBI banned banks from supporting payments to cryptocurrencies. To survive, exchanges then had to come with alternate methods like peer-to-peer payments, which were risky. With no RBI circular issued, it is not possible for the crypto exchanges to set up an online payment facility on their websites. For online payments via NEFT, RTGS or UPI, the exchanges would need the help of both banks and payment facilitators like PayU , BillDesk , Instamojo and Razorpay. “We will have to work out systems as the interest is huge. We are seeing thousands of users crowding our platform,” said Sathvik Viswanath , founder of Unocoin, which has an active trading base of 3 lakh customers and claims to have a total customer base of 1.3 million.

Another issue would be, even if the RBI gives an approval, investors and major banks like State Bank of India could stay away if the government and finance ministry remain sceptical.

Different cryptos a challenge for regulator

There are 1,658 cryptocurrencies in the world, of which Indian exchanges offer 70-80. But they vary in nature as some are currencies, some assets, some securities, some commodity derivatives and some are tokens used in a closed-loop system. Given that the nature of each cryptocurrency is different, regulation could be a nightmare, said RBI officials. “Does it come under the RBI? Under Sebi? There are even telecom companies globally using token cryptos for closed-loop payments. Does it then come under Trai when it’s a token and not a currency? So, given the chameleon nature of cryptos, it’s a regulatory nightmare,” said an RBI official.

Self-governance way forward

The microfinance industry in 2000s grew by leaps and bounds with little regulatory check, till the massive Andhra 2009 crisis put it on the path of self-regulation with the formation of the MicroFinance Institutions Network (MFIN).

Likewise, crypto exchanges in the country and the Internet and Mobile Association of India ( IAMAI ) — which was the petitioner in the SC — are seriously considering self-governance. “We realise that one bad actor can really spoil things for all of us. It would take just one wrong move, one scam for the government to clamp down really hard on us,” says Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, which has 2.5 lakh customers.

Take the Amit Bhardwaj bitcoin scam in 2018 — thousands of Indians lost close to Rs 2,000 crore. Or, the Rs 485-crore bitcoin scam where kingpin Abdul Shakoor was murdered in Dehradun. Even in a country like Japan, where cryptocurrencies have been legalised and encouraged by the government, there are scams like BITPoint, where customers lost $28 million in July 2019.

There is another huge problem of terrorism and possible misuse by fraudsters and con artists. As a result, to prevent illegal activities and possible use for terrorism, exchanges intend to do rigorous KYC checks.

What about customer grievance redressal?

If customers lose money in an ATM or in an online scam, there is the bank, banking ombudsman, the RBI, and the consumer courts to appeal to. The nascent cryptocurrency space also needs a proper grievance redressal mechanism to gain customer trust.

“It’s about technology robustness and investor awareness. Today, there is no Indian company offering e-wallet storage solutions for your cryptocurrency. So, you have to buy hardware wallets from cryptos from foreign players. What happens if you lose your cryptos because someone mined them? Who do you sue? Or, say, one loses cryptos because of weak technology on the exchange. It would be a nightmare for others,” says Shetty.

57,['6/03/2020'],HC dismisses Kochhar’s plea against termination,"Swati Deshpande | TNN

Mumbai: In a setback to ICICI Bank’s former CEO and managing director, Chanda Kochhar , the Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed as “not maintainable” her petition challenging the validity of her January 2019 termination for cause.

A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Makarand Karnik heard the matter and swiftly decided the issue. In the judgment pronounced on Thursday, it said, “The termination of the petitioner (Kochhar) is in the realm of contractual relationship.” The high court added that merely questioning a nod from the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) doesn’t infuse a public law element — essential for the HC to hear a writ petition concerning violation of fundamental rights — into the dispute.

Kochhar had last November approached the HC for a declaration that her resignation accepted by the bank before it terminated her service be held as valid. Her case, as enunciated by her counsel Vikram Nankani, was that her fundamental rights were infringed upon since the termination under the banking regulation law required a prior nod from the RBI and not a post-facto approval as was given in February 2019.

But the HC found merit in the arguments of ICICI Bank, whose counsel Darius Khambata raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of her challenge as a writ petition before the HC since it is a private bank with “no public law element in its functioning”. The RBI, through its counsel Venkatesh Dhond, also joined ICICI in raising a preliminary objection to her plea and further said that its approval was valid under the law.

In February last year, the bank also revoked her retirement benefits. And her removal meant forfeiture of substantial stock options, existing and future entitlements, including unpaid amounts and medical benefits. She sought their restoration, but ICICI refused the request and said her petition now was a “concerted strategy… to avoid making any payments to it under clawback provisions”.

It said, “ICICI Bank is a private body. It is not an instrumentality of the state. It receives no public funding. Service conditions of the petitioner (Kochhar) are not governed by any statute. The dispute raised in this petition arises from a contract of personal service.” Significantly, the HC said, “Section 35B(1)(b) of Banking Regulation Act does not regulate service conditions between an employer and employee.” It said “approval for termination under it does not adjudicate the rights of the petitioner as an employee”.

The HC said, “Though the section postulates that the termination would not come into effect if there is no prior approval of the RBI…legal implications of the approval …would be grounds and arguments in the contractual dispute.” The HC thus upheld the “preliminary objection raised” by ICICI Bank and the RBI.

The HC emphasised that “when employment in a private entity is regulated by contracts, the courts do not exercise the writ jurisdiction”. “Courts exercise writ jurisdiction when a public law element is involved, if the services are governed by a statute.”

For that purpose, the nature of the concerned enactment and its purpose and scope has to be ascertained. “The grant of approval by the RBI does not mean that the action of termination is valid in terms of the service dispute,” said the HC. Elaborating on the scope of section 35B(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, it said that this “is enacted to examine the situation post termination, that is, its impact on the larger banking interest”.

“The predominant object of conferment of power on the RBI is the interest of banking policy. Banking companies such as ICICI have the freedom to conduct their affairs. However, the RBI ensures that their activities will not affect the economy in general. The supervision by the RBI is in the realm of larger policy,” said the HC.

Kochhar, who joined the bank in April 1984 as a management trainee, was a managing director with the ICICI Bank when removed. The bank said that on complaints received against her, it had in May 2018 constituted an enquiry by retired SC Judge B N Srikrishna. In June 2018, she took leave pending enquiry and, by a letter on October 3, she sought early retirement, which the bank accepted on October 4, 2018.

The next year on January 27, the enquiry report was submitted, “adverse to her”. The bank then in a January 30, 2019 meeting decided her services would be terminated for cause. In that meeting, the ICICI Bank board treated the separation of the petitioner’s service as a termination for cause.

YAVATMAL: The Ghatanji police on Wednesday evening booked official of a private bank who allegedly tried to molest a tribal woman of Mowada village.

According to sources, Ghatanji police initially ignored the complaint of the victim. The woman then approached SP M Rajkumar and lodged a complaint.

On directions of the SP, PSO of Ghatanji Dinesh Shukla filed an FIR and booked the bank official under sections 354, 354 (A), 504 and 506 of IPC late in the evening.

In the complaint, the woman stated that her husband being mentally unstable, she has taken up farming in her village. She bought a tractor after securing a loan from the private bank in Yavatmal.

After the woman defaulted on two instalments, the bank on Monday deputed its representative Suraj Gajbhiye, a resident of Yavatmal, along with three other employees to recover dues. When they met her at the farm, she sought some more time to make the payment, the complainant said.

Three of the employees left Suraj behind at the farm and towed away the tractor parked in front of the woman’s house. Later Suraj accompanied the woman to her house and allegedly sought entry under the pretext of having water. When the woman offered him water, he allegedly caught her hand and tried to molest her.

62,['6/03/2020'],"Eight thefts, one kidnapping, one house break-in reported daily in Surat","Representative image

SURAT: The latest crime figures recently presented in the house of the state assembly by the government can leave citizens of the Diamond City worried. A total of 3,223 thefts were reported in the city in 2019, which is the highest number in the state among all the cities.

In 2018, the number of thefts were 2,086 much lesser than its following year, and police suspect that due to the rise in snatching crimes, the numbers have gone high.

Going by the figures, the city witnessed over eight thefts per day, while one kidnapping and one house break-ins were also reported in the city on daily basis. Despite being the commercial hub, the city witnessed two suicides daily in 2019. However, there is a drop in the number of suicides compared to previous year which was 816.

The police claim that though the number of crimes are high there is a considerable drop compared to the last year. City police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt told TOI: “Police’s priority is to detect the cases. We can judge police’s performance from the number of cases solved. We have detected a majority of the serious crimes and arrested the involved accused.”

“The rise and drop in the crime may not be too much compared to the past year and it is routine. But police's focus is on solving the crime,” Brahmbhatt added.

The police detected 198 rapes out of 199 cases reported, while 91 murder cases have been solved of the total 97 registered. Apart from serious crime cases, the detection of theft and house break-in remain challenging area for the city police. A large number of theft and house break-in cases remained undetected in 2019.

Out of the reported thefts, a total of 2,054 thefts have not been detected. Similarly, out of 406 house break-ins, 252 are yet to get detected.

“Though employed, poor living conditions and financial crisis drive many individuals into criminal world. They are not part of organized gang but they develop habit of committing crime out of need in most cases,” said Kiran Desai, a social scientist at Centre for Social Studies (CSS).

“Apart from locally available workforce a large number of migrants come regularly to the city in search of livelihood, and we need to think over economic distress among them. Better working and living conditions need to be provided to all class of workers,” Desai added.

63,['6/03/2020'],DGTR imposes anti-dumping duty on imported nylon filament yarn,"SURAT: To the disappointment of powerloom weavers , Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has recommended anti-dumping duty on import of nylon filament yarn from China, Taiwan , South Korea and Thailand.

In a notification issued on Wednesday, DGTR stated that the purpose of anti-dumping duty is to eliminate injury caused to domestic industry by unfair trade practices of dumping by exporting countries. Accordingly, definitive anti-dumping duty in the range of Rs30 to Rs70 per kilogram on nylon filament yarn has been imposed.

Industry sources said nylon yarn spinning industry was running on less than 70% capacity due to dumping of low-grade nylon yarn from China, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. Against installed capacity of 1.60 lakh metric tonnes per annum, the industry was manufacturing about 1.10 lakh metric tonnes of yarn per annum.

Narayan Agarwal, president of Nylon Spinners’ Association, said, “Surat is hub of nylon filament yarn manufacturing where about 70% of yarn is manufactured. On an average about 1,300 metric tonnes of nylon yarn per month was being imported from China and other countries, resulting in huge loss to the industry.”

Agarwal added, “The industry has welcomed the decision of DGTR to impose definitive anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn imported from China and other countries. This will allow us to increase the capacity and make fresh investments in the spinning sector.”

Vinay Agarwal, secretary of Nylon Spinners’ Association, said, “Powerloom weavers made wrong allegations against yarn spinners regarding price hike, closure of units and job losses. DGTR findings are based on detailed investigation. The industry is not going to increase yarn prices as they are directly linked with prices of raw material in international market.”

Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry chairman Bharat Gandhi said, “DGTR decision is disappointing for nylon weavers in the industry. We have convened a stakeholders meeting to decide on future course of action including challenging the decision in high court.”

PATNA: Sushil Kumar Singh has been nominated as state president of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), replacing Shatrughan Sahu. Singh’s name for the post was cleared by the AAP’s central committee on political affairs comprising president of the party and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal , deputy CM Manish Sisodia and MP-cum-Bihar incharge Sanjay Singh among others at its meeting held in New Delhi on Wednesday.

Singh’s elevation to the post assumed significance in view of the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar. Singh, who hails from an upper caste family of Khajuri village in Saran district, had played an important role in the recently included Delhi assembly election in which the party bagged 62 out of 70 seats.

Talking to TOI over phone on Thursday, 38-year-old Singh said he was earlier appointed observer of the party in the assembly elections in Punjab and Haryana. “I have served the party in different capacities, such as national spokesperson, observer and organizing secretary since its inception in 2012. Strengthening the party’s base in Bohar will be my top priority,” he said.

The AAP has already launched a mass contact programme in the state in a bid to reach every nook and corner of the state with the agenda of development. “When Gujarat model of development can be part of election campaign for a particular party, why not Delhi model of development?” Singh said, adding that the party would try to win the confidence of the electorate on the issue of development.

He said the party would organize ‘jan samvad’ of party president and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal either in the last week of April or first week of May so that the workers of the party could interact with him. “Around 10,000 workers of the party, mostly belonging to remote panchayat, will attend the function. Functionaries at panchayat level will be appointed to strengthen the base of the organization in the state,” he added.

“Our main motto is to reach 45,160 villages across the state in next two-three months,” he said, adding the AAP would provide a dependable alternative to the electorate in the coming assembly polls.

“We will not field any candidate having criminal background in Bihar also. This is our party’s firm decision,” he added. Asked about the number of assembly seats the AAP would contest in Bihar, Singh said it would depend on the people’s response to the party in the days to come.”

66,['6/03/2020'],Maoists had planned to blow up 5 railway stations: Police,"PATNA: Police investigations have revealed that the CPI (Maoist), a banned outfit, had planned to blow up five railway stations on Jamalpur-Kiul-Bhagalpur section of the Eastern Railway to boost the morale of its cadres.

The startling revelation was made during interrogation by Jai Paswan, a hardcore Maoist, who was arrested from Maheshpur village in Lakhisarai district on Monday.

Deputy inspector general (DIG), Munger range, Manu Maharaaj said on Thursday that Jai corroborated the evidences collected during recent police operations in Jamui, Munger and Lakhisarai districts that the Maoists were planning to target the railway property in the region.

“The police had seized some mobile chips, videos and letters, which indicated the Maoists’ plan to attack five railway stations, including Piri Bazar and Abhaypur,” the DIG said, adding the Maoists’ operation was being monitored by Parvez alias Anuj, a central committee member of the outfit.

Police said Parwez, stated to be chief of the East Bihar-North Jharkhand region, was evading arrest for long. At least four cases related to Maoist incidents were pending against Jai, who was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days after interrogation at an undisclosed location.

Forty-eight-year-old Jai, a former self-proclaimed area commander, also revealed to the police that the recce of the railway stations was done and videos were made. “The operation was being given final touches when the police intercepted and arrested another Maoist, Siddhu Koda, who later died in police custody,” an investigating officer said.

The police officer, who didn’t wish to be named, said a meeting of top Maoist leaders and activists from Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand was held near Kalmegh village on the borders of Maoist-hit Jamui and Munger districts recently to finalize the attack on railway stations. “The arrest of Siddhu Koda and later Jai, however, poured cold water on the Maoists’ plan,” he added.

Meanwhile, the police have launched operation in the Munger region to arrest Parwez and his associate Baleshwar Koda. “The police will heave a sigh of relief after the arrest of the two influential leaders of the banned organization,” the police officer said.

69,['6/03/2020'],Migratory birds float on a raft of hope at Sukhna,"Chandigarh: Deep waters of 8-9 feet have robbed migratory birds of silted isles and extended mudflats to bask, rest and sleep during their winter sojourn at Sukhna Lake. But a brace of floats devised of bamboo, grasses and soil, and anchored by heavy stones has provided a ‘raft of hope’ to the birds who not only perch comfortably but afford excellent views for daily visitors and photographers.

Two floats of dimension, 10x12 feet and 12x14 feet, have been anchored 50 yards away from the Bird Walk at Sukhna’s regulator-end. Buoyed by the success of the two floats, the field staff of the forest and wildlife department’s lake block are putting together a third and bigger float of dimension, 14 x 16 feet. The species that most often use the floats are migratory Ruddy shelducks and Great cormorants while Common pochards, Bar-headed geese and Gulls also avail of the float less frequently. Resident species like the Red-wattled lapwing and egrets while regional/transcontinent migratory species such as the Grey heron also perch on the floats. The floats have been anchored because gusting winds would throw the float onto the banks of the rowing canal and lead to entanglement in the tall, entrenched water reeds.

“We came up with this idea of anchored floats due to deep water depriving birds of places of rest. Visitors and bird-watchers have provided us a positive feedback on the birds taking to the floats and feeling comfortable. I have informed the UT administrator, V P Singh Badnore, about the success of this pilot project as he takes a keen interest and is a patron of wildlife conservation. We have also facilitated bird-watching hides at shallow water bodies in the forests lying to the north of the rowing canal. Another set of shallow water bodies were set up at the Nagar Van and they have also attracted some migratory and resident birds,” chief wildlife warden Debendra Dalai told TOI.

However, the main attraction of bird viewing for people at large is at the rowing canal as access to water bodies in the forest area is restricted due to an apprehension of hordes of people disturbing birds and other wild species. “We plan to build islands of silt in the rowing canal and grow native species of flora on them to attract migratory and other birds. However, for that, the water levels have to reduce before we can undertake the exercise. The other feasible option is to maintain two levels of water for Sukhna: a low level at the regulator-end area where migratory birds are concentrated and a higher level for the main body of the lake to facilitate other activities such as tourism, boating and rowing,” Dalai added.

The avian numbers and species diversity at Sukhna has dwindled ever since the wetland was de-silted. While migratory birds have been hit the hardest, even resident birds such as the rare and vulnerable species, the Bristled grassbird, has disappeared from the regulator-end.

70,['6/03/2020'],Demand for used luxury cars up as buyers look for good deals,"Chennai: Motown’s luxury vehicle component is higher in used cars has risen to 5% -7% of the total from the 2%-3% earlier, as more used cars come up for sales than before.

And despite the auto slowdown, used car retailers including OLX, Mahindra First Choice Wheels or Cars24 say affordable used luxe cars in the price band of Rs 12-Rs 15 lakh are drawing customers from both metros and non-metros.

“A pre-owned luxury car could be priced 30%-40% lower than the new model since they depreciate fast. These cars have been barely driven and in 2018 & 2019 this segment on OLX grew by 18% whereas buyer enquiries for such cars grew by 50%,” said Sunny Kataria, VP-auto, OLX India, which sees a 21,000 luxury cars available for sale every day.

Typically, organised retailers say used luxury car sales are 3%-5% of their total transactions. In contrast, luxe marques are just about 1% of the new car and SUV sales and the slice has contracted between 2018 to 2019 when new luxe car sales went down from around 41,000 units to 34,500 units.

Used car marketers say this is because used luxury vehicles offer better value for money roping in more aspirational customers from metro and tier-2 cities. Overall though, more than 50% of used car buyers actually come from tier-2, tier-3 and tier-4 cities.

“Premium used vehicles (priced more than Rs 20 lakh) account for 5%-7% of the overall listings. The customer profile of a used premiumand new premium vehicle customer is largely similar – both are generally between 35-50 years, have been using a lower segment vehicle earlier, 70% male and 70% are from top 10 cities,” said Ashutosh Pandey, chief execuitve officer (CEO, Mahindra First Choice Wheels.

The NCLT has also ordered the ministry to initiate action against company executives, past and present, if found guilty after the probe.It added that the ministry and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) shouldn’t rely solely on the Vaish report commissioned by CG Power to conclude that a fraud has been committed. Instead, they should conduct their own investigations.The NCLT further said that there is an internal fight between ousted CG Power chairman Gautam Thapar and the current management and it is in this context Thapar was removed from the chairman’s position. The reason for the internal fight, NCLT said, is yet to be established. But it added that the complainant in the whole episode is none other than the current management.“When there are serious differences existing between two parties, there are provisions in the Companies Act to seek a proper remedy. But in a strange manner, the present management of CG Power had gone to the stock exchanges and declared about the so called irregularities purported to have taken place in the company. While this being the position, government machinery cannot be used by either of the conflicting parties to settle their scores, and instead a fair and impartial inquiry be allowed to be conducted by the government agencies to know the real facts,” it said.The NCLT has given the ministry permission to review CG Power’s accounts from fiscals 2015 to 2019.Amit Agrawal of RegStreet Law Advisors said, “The NCLT, on one hand, has observed that independent investigation alone can bring out the truth, and that the Vaish report cannot be relied upon as such. And on the other, it has held that accounts of the company are doubtful. Accounts cannot be allowed to be reopened on mere suspicion without there being a prima facie view of their incorrectness. Unverified doubt cannot be justified to reopen accounts.”The NCLT, however, was unimpressed by the submissions made by the past and present management of CG Power.

74,['6/03/2020'],"Bihar assembly passes Bill to help government borrow Rs 5,688 crore from market","Bihar Assembly

PATNA: The state assembly on Thursday passed the Bihar Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (Amendment) Bill, 2020, by voice vote, increasing the cap on the limit regarding government’s market borrowings from 3% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) to 3.5%.

It was done 12 years after the FRBM was first passed by the House in 2007 in line with the recommendation of the Finance Commission. The Finance Commission had asked the state governments to fix the cap regarding market borrowings to 3% of the GSDP in order to contain deficit financing in their annual budgets. The Bihar government, like other state governments, had witnessed deficit financing and heavy market borrowings in the past.

Deputy CM-cum-finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who moved the FRBM (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in the House, said the state government would raise Rs 5,688 crore through market borrowings, as facilitated by the revised cap. “The money so raised will be utilized on scheme (plan) expenditure, and in no case to pay the salary of its employees or pensions,” Modi said.

He said the main sources of the government’s income are four fold – state’s share in the central pool of taxes, grants that the state government gets from the Centre, its own tax revenue and market borrowings. However, observers said the need to increase the cap to 3.5% of the GSDP was felt because there was a shortfall in the Centre’s pool of taxes, which forced the state government to raise money through market borrowing.

Modi said the FRBM (Amendment) Bill was not moved in the House earlier, as the Centre gave its consent to revising the cap from the existing 3% of the GSDP to 3.5% only six days ago.

“Further, the state would get the first instalment of Rs 5,688 crore on March 9 and remaining instalments before March 31. The entire sum of money has to be allotted for expenditure on development activities before the end of the 2019-20 fiscal on March 31,” Modi said.

76,['6/03/2020'],Government plans to amend APMC Act to woo farmers,"Picture used for representational purpose only

GANDHINAGAR: In a year when taluka and district panchayat polls are scheduled, the BJP government has planned to revamp the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets (Amendment) Act. A bill for amendment of the act will be tabled in the ongoing state assembly session and is seen as a move to woo farmers.

A key government official said that the most important amendment that is proposed will be lifting of restrictions on farmers to sell their produce in a particular Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) only.

“They will be allowed to sell their produce anywhere in the state. Moreover, the government has decided to facilitate competition in functioning of APMCs by allowing private players with good warehousing facilities to act as APMC markets.” The official added that farmers can sell their produce at any place where they get best prices.

“This will drastically improve the condition of the farmers as they will have multiple options to sell their produce,” the official said.

Another amendment being proposed is lifting of the restriction of registration of traders at one APMC only. Traders will now be able to register themselves at multiple APMCs, increasing the options of farmers for selling their yield.

Sources in the government said the move to allow private entities to operate as APMC is expected to have a backlash from vested interest groups. Sources said, this could have political repercussions as well.

78,['6/03/2020'],Kerala waste management authority set to get rolling,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The department of environment has initiated preliminary steps towards the constitution of Kerala Waste Management Authority (KWMA) — a specialist agency meant to execute large-scale waste management and waterbody pollution abatement projects in state. Steps are underway to register the authority under Companies Act even as a cabinet decision on the same is expected.

Chief secretary Tom Jose had proposed the formation of waste management authority in the status report for compliance by the state on the directive of NGT submitted in April 2019. It said that the government had amended the Panchayat Raj Act to take over the powers of local bodies in waste disposal and is working on the proposal to set up Kerala Waste Management Authority in state. It is especially being set up to build and monitor modern solid waste treatment plants, rendering plants, slaughterhouses, sanitary landfills, and common biomedical waste treatment facilities.

This authority will take care of wastes not presently handled by local bodies and Kerala Water Authority (KWA). Real-time monitoring of water quality of waterbodies shall be made available to the authority, the report said. It is learnt that the chief secretary is slated to appear before NGT on March 20 and the environment department is trying to get through the hurdles to launch KWMA by then.

The state policy on waste management released in 2018 says that whenever an urban local body fails in fulfilling its mandatory function of solid waste management, the government will take over the function and establish appropriate modern solid waste-management plants.

Officials associated with formation of KWMA said that of late NGT came down heavily on the state government for lapses in waste management and conservation of waterbodies, mainly due to failure of local bodies. The state-level monitoring committee has been tasked with developing model local bodies across the state to showcase exemplary works in waste management. Lack of political consensus and delay from administrative councils of local bodies for timely implementation of projects have necessitated the need for establishing an authority comprising experts to handle such projects.

The move is widely perceived as an attempt to weaken powers of local bodies, although officials said that modalities of association with local bodies are still in the works. Presently, KSIDC acts as nodal agency for waste-to-energy projects, and Suchitwa Mission is more of a technical advisory body with no powers for execution and enforcement, officials pointed out. It is learnt that finance department is not too enthused about KWMA.

80,['6/03/2020'],Fighting fit: Most get into exercise regime in 40s,"Chennai: Are people more proactive about fitness in their 40s than in 20s? The insights into ‘physical activity levels of Indians’ survey released on Thursday seems to suggest just that. According to the survey, conducted by fitness app Healthifyme, less than 60% of people in their 20s remain active while around 65% in their 40s are active. After the 40s though there is another dip. Nearly half the people in their 50s remained inactive.

Dr Kannan Pugazhendi says at his clinic, more than 80% of his clients are in their 40s. This is the decade, says the sports doctor, that the effects of stress begin to show and the ‘logists’ enter lives. “Diabetologists, cardiologists… so people are forced to look at their physical and mental life differently. For women, this is also the time that perimenopause symptoms begin and so they notice changes to their body,” says Dr Pugazhendi. “But what people need to understand is that if you can develop a passion for fitness in your 20s it becomes a habit in your 40s.”

Among the 12 million users of the app, it was found that Bengaluru has taken the pole position as the fittest city with users having burned upwards of 310 calories a day. Ghaziabad, Pune, Mumbai, and Dehradun burned 302 calories per day on an average. Kolkata, on the other hand is at the bottom of the list, having burned just 267 calories a day. Chennai placed 13th at a little less than 277.

The survey also finds that 45% of Indian women and 37% of Indian men were ‘inactive’ in 2019, burning less than 50% of their calorie burn budget in a day. Calorie budget is the number of calories that a person should burn through daily physical activity. The average calorie burn budget of Indian men is 476 calories a day versus women’s 374. While paranthas, suji rusk, boondi raita, and samosas were among the top unhealthiest snacks in the capital, in Chennai it was samosa, vada, biscuit, and puri that topped the munch list. In Kolkata it was white bread, plain and simple.

“Walking and running continue to be the most popular workouts while towel push-ups, canoeing, rowing, sculling, windsurfing and standing torso twists were some of the workouts that became more popular in 2019,” says Roshini Gilbert, vice president, Fitness and Services.

Whatever the workout, says Dr Pugazhendi, when one is in the 40s, weight and strength training needs to become part of one’s fitness regime. “Not so much to bulk up, but more to combat work day stress or climb a flight of stairs without discomfort. Or as most of my clients tell me, to just enable them to dance at a party all night and not feel like a dead man walking the next day.”

The survey also found that Sunday the “fattiest day” for most Indians with highest fat consumption taking place over the weekend. Friday on the other hand was the most active day with an average calorie burn of 335 a day.

Personal trainers say Mondays and Fridays are the days they see most footfalls at the gym.

“Fridays because to pre-empt the guilt of a weekend of partying or binge eating. And Mondays because they want to work off the guilt,” says personal trainer T Mathiazhagan of Decafit. “But one needs to work out at least four to five times a week.”

82,['6/03/2020'],Over 200 families affected as effluents pollute canal,"Alappuzha: Untreated effluent from fish processing companies and other private firms of Aroor-Chandiroor area is polluting Puthenthodu (canal) and making life miserable for the over 200 families in Chandiroor village. Puthenthodu is a two-km long canal in Aroor grama panchayat and connects Veluthulli Lake and Vembanad Lake .

“Relatives are not coming to our home. If anybody comes, they leave immediately covering their nose even without drinking a glass of water. Our villagers, especially children, are suffering from various health issues including skin problems. It is due to the pollution of Puthenthodu,” said Sheeja Suresh, a home maker in Chandiroor village.

Chandiroor Punnathara Road Residents Association convener Ubaid M E said that the canal began to turn highly polluted around 20 years ago. “At least 4 lakh litre of untreated waste water from nine major fish processing companies and 20 minor fish processing companies are daily discharged into this canal. Our villagers have not been using or depending on this canal since then,” he said.

“Though we conducted many agitations, authorities and governments failed to find a solution to this grave issue. They tried to set up a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) spending around Rs 12 crore in our residential area for treating the efluent water. We are not against the plant but it should be away from the residential area,” Ubaid added.

Aroor grama panchayat president B Rethnamma said that they gave licenses to the fish processing companies after ensuring that they have proper treatment plants. “But villagers are complaining that the companies are discharging waste water into the canal. The villagers are against a CETP. So the panchayat is planning to clean the canal,” she said.

Chamber of Kerala Seafood Industry president J R Ajith said that fish processing companies don’t have any role in the pollution of this canal. “Waste from chicken shops and abattoirs are the reasons for the pollution of this canal,” he said.

District collector M Anjana said that the villagers are not aware of the importance of the plant. “We are trying to convince the people how the plant will give a facelift to the canal,” she said.

Pollution Control Board Alappuzha district environmental engineer Biju R said, “The state government acquired 73 cents near this canal in 2003 for a CETP and at that time, there were no houses near the site. But, now houses have come up and they are opposing the plant.”

83,['6/03/2020'],Self-defence lessons taught by cops at school helped girl fight off armed stalker,"Chennai: Self-defence techniques taught at a government school in Shenoy Nagar saved the life of the 13-year-old girl who was attacked with a knife on Wednesday by her stalker .

The girl told TOI that she had “nothing in her mind but to escape from the clutches of the stalker”. The girl bit the man and freed herself but not before he slit her throat.

The girl said Nithyananthan, 27, had been stalking her since February last year. He had attempted to commit suicide in front of her and had threatened to kill her parents. Every day, she would walk to her school, which was a kilometre away, only to be followed by Nithyananthan. Though four of her friends and her sister accompanied her to school, the man would ask her to accept his proposal. Nithyananthan would prostrate at her feet, once he dropped a phone in her bag and also attacked boys who spoke to her.

Around 12.30pm on Wednesday, the girl was walking up a staircase to reach her second floor home when Nithyananthan, who was hiding in a bathroom, pounced on her. He lifted her on his shoulder and wanted to take her to his house. “I never thought he had the guts to do this. I never imagined that he would harm me,” said the girl whose wound was sutured at the Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.

“But I gathered all my strength to fight back. I recalled the self-defence techniques taught by the police at school. I shouted loudly to attract the attention of the neighbours, hit him hard and bit him,” she said. Hearing her cries, neighbours rushed to her rescue.

Nithyananthan, who was absconding, was arrested on Thursday morning from Aminjikarai. “We follow our child to ensure she is safe. Whenever we were around, the man was cautious,” said her mother. “It was her boldness that saved her. Police should ensure that the stalker doesn’t get bail easily.

84,['6/03/2020'],Zalke throws a challenge to Mundhe: Probe if there are irregularities,"Mayor Sandip greets new standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke after assuming charge. Outgoing chairman Pradi... Read More

Nagpur: Immediately after assuming charge as standing committee chairman, Vijay Zalke said municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe should conduct an inquiry if he feels there are irregularities in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). His statement follows mayor Sandip Joshi’s allegation a day earlier that Mundhe had conspired with four Shiv Sena MLAs of Mumbai in submitting a calling attention motion seeking the dissolution of NMC.

A first-time corporator of BJP from ward no. 28 in South Nagpur, Zalke got elected as chairman of NMC standing committee unanimously in the election held on Friday. Zalke replaced Pradip Pohane and will present NMC’s budget for 2020-21.

With BJP enjoying a clear majority of 12 members in the 16-member standing committee, Zalke was the sole contestant. Congress, NCP and BSP did not file any nomination.

“I will present NMC’s budget either on March 31 or April 15. I will seek suggestions from all and prepare a budget for the public. I will not increase taxes but will generate revenue and improve civic amenities further,” said Zalke.

A graduate in industrial engineering, Zalke admitted that the situation in NMC was not good as Mundhe is at loggerheads with ruling party BJP. “I accept it as a challenge. I love working and proving my mettle in difficult situations. Earlier, after the election of standing committee chairperson, the administration would arrange for the swearing-in ceremony. But, in my case, nothing is being done. I arranged the programme at my cost today,” he said.

Zalke, who is a contractor, is the 54th standing committee chairman and will be responsible to take all policy decisions related to NMC’s finance which is over Rs3,200 crore per annum.

With the experience of being chairman of NMC’s water works consultative committee since 2018 behind him, Zalke said he will establish mini sewage treatment plants (STPs) across the city and supply treated sewage for construction sites, gardens etc.

“This will ensure scientific disposal of sewage, conserve environment, bring revenue to the NMC and save drinking water. I will also prepare detailed project report to tackle collapsed sewage and drain system of the city,” he said.

A close aide of South Nagpur MLA Mohan Mate, Zalke faces a big challenge as Mundhe is expected to present a work-wise budget. He too will have to do the same.

In the past, excluding two fiscals, budgets were never work-wise. Chairpersons used to allocate lump sum amounts and later decide the nature of works keeping powers to select the works and areas in their hands. But work-wise budget helps in expediting execution.

85,['6/03/2020'],Gujarat: Congress to re-enact Dandi March,"File photo

GANDHINAGAR: In an organized effort to rejuvenate the party cadre ahead of the Rajya Sabha and panchayat polls this year, the entire top brass of the Congress party led by members of the Gandhi family will participate in a march from Ahmedabad to Dandi in south Gujarat .

To mark 150 years of the Mahatma’s birth, the Dandi march organized by the Congress party will begin from Sabarmati Ashram on March 12 and end at Dandi on April 6. Mahatma Gandhi had launched the civil disobedience movement with the famous Dandi march between March 12 and April 6, 1930.

Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda said 80 workers each of Seva Dal from different states will join the march. “Party president Sonia Gandhi is expected to be present for the valedictory function of the march, while Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will be present when the march is flagged off. Chief ministers of all Congress-ruled states and all national office bearers of the party will participate on different days of the march,” Chavda said. He added that thousands of Congress workers will join the march from districts along the route.

Although Congress leaders maintain that the march is being organized to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the party is clearly looking to garner public support ahead of the crucial panchayat polls to be held in the state later this year.

86,['6/03/2020'],No AMC inquiry on Mughal-era gate loss,"File photo of the 250-year-old structure at Geeta Mandir, now demolished

AHMEDABAD: It’s been three months since a 250-year-old and 15-feet tall Mughal era heritage wall and gate at Geeta Mandir bus stand was demolished by Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC). However, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is yet to launch any inquiry into the incident, according to the latest RTI reply in the issue.

The civic authorities had stood as mute spectators when it gave the GSRTC development permission to build at the site, and in November last year, contractors had pulled down the historic wall. The AMC had back then claimed that it had withdrawn the development permission ‘rajja chhiti’ for the second phase of the central bus stand project after the incident. Munaf Ahmed , the RTI applicant in the issue says, “Clearly AMC had given development permission to the GSRTC, despite its own heritage department warning against demolition of the wall. On what basis was the development permission issued, is surely a matter of investigation,” opines Ahmed. The RTI reply also denies of any report available with them pertaining to the issue.

On July 25, 2016, the GSRTC, through an official order, had allowed the contractor, M/s Hubtown Limited, to demolish the ‘old gate’ for Rs 44,945 and the scrap value of the rubble was estimated to be Rs 1.31 lakh. The contractor was to salvage an amount of Rs 86,936 from the entire jobwork.

In a letter dated March 22, 2018, heritage conservation committee chairman P K Ghosh wrote to Sonal Mishra, chairman of GSRTC, that there is an ‘old structure’ which happens to be in the vicinity of the buffer zone of the historic city.

Soon after the wall was demolished in November, municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra had deputed a team of town development and estate officers to inspect the site and look for all relevant permissions issued by the AMC. The AMC had also urged the GSRTC to salvage the second gate present on the north side of the compound and make it part of the development plan.

87,['6/03/2020'],‘MVA govt left Rs684Cr NMC works cleared by Fadnavis in limbo’,"Nagpur: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ruling in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), has alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has left works worth Rs683.83 crore approved by the past government in limbo. Saffron party leaders said road widening projects have been affected to a great extent.

Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane and BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari said at a press conference on Wednesday Rs371.83 crore approved by the Devendra Fadnavis government for widening six roads have been stopped by the MVA government.

“Fadnavis had approved civic amenities works of Rs100 crore during his tenure as chief minister. Works worth Rs100 crore approved by Chandrashekar Bawankule during his tenure as guardian minister too are stuck. Bawankule had approved works taking cognisance of complaints received from citizens during Janata Durbar. Fadnavis had also approved Rs50 crore under Cement Concrete Road Project phase-III. All these funds have been stopped by MVA government,” they said.

Pohane said municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe stopped works of Rs62 crore even though they were approved by the standing committee. “Works to develop footpaths, squares on newly constructed cement concrete roads were approved by standing committee. NMC has installed 9,000 street light poles in outer areas. The Rs12 crore approved for installation of LED lights on these poles has been stopped by Mundhe,” he said.

BJP city president Pravin Datke told TOI, “Fadnavis had approved Rs642.05 crore for acquisition of land for widening of six roads in 2018. State was supposed to give 70% and remaining 30% was to be borne by the NMC. So, Rs77.6 crore were released during Fadnavis’ tenure. NMC spent its share of Rs192.61 crore. NMC also spent another Rs64 crore so that it may adjust it later from funds to be released by the government. But all these funds have been halted. Works on all six roads are affected,” he said.

Datke added Mundhe stopped works since MVA government posted him in NMC to stop development of the city. “Mundhe is known as a no nonsense officer. Then, why is Mundhe not asking the government to release approved funds,” he asked.

Pohane, who will soon be replaced by Vijay Zalke, claimed he was successful as standing committee chairman and issued work orders of Rs772 crore of total planned works of Rs1,200 crore. “Total number of approved works were 971. Past municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar had imposed 25% cut on budget so some works were stopped. Mundhe has not forwarded even a single file since he assumed charge in January. I could have ensured approval and execution of all proposed works if works were not stopped,” he said.

Ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav said mayor Sandip Joshi is holding discussions with guardian minister Nitin Raut for release of stuck funds. “It is the responsibility of civic chief to pursue the government to get the funds,” he said.

Pohane added he was successful in beginning rainwater harvesting works and establishing enforcement teams in all ten zones. “I also developed city’s first women-special garden. Gyan Alok Yojana was also launched. I expedited various projects including cement roads, water supply scheme in unauthorized areas under AMRUT etc,” he said.

Deputy mayor Manisha Kothe, Zalke, chairman of NMC Legal Consultative Committee Dharampal Meshram, corporator Sunil Agrawal and others were present.

88,['6/03/2020'],Holi festivities begin with offering gulal to Shiva,"Times News Network

Varanasi: The Holi festivities commenced with celebration of Rangbhari Ekadashi in the city on Thursday. Local residents, particularly those living in old city areas, smeared colours on each other after offering gulal to Lord Shiva.

Maintaining over 350-year-old tradition, a large number of devotees joined the procession of Gauna (taking bride to home after marriage) of Lord Shiva, the presiding deity of Kashi, with religious fervour amid shower of gulal and flower petals. As per the mythology, Lord Shiva, after marrying Goddess Parvati on Maha Shivratri, comes to take the bride home on Falgun Shukla Ekadashi which is celebrated as Rangbahri Ekadashi.

The procession began from the current Tedhineem residence of former mahant of Kashi Vishwanath Temple Kulpati Towari after performing religious rituals. The procession started with silver idols of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati placed in a silver palki (palanquin). The entire area echoed with chants of Har Har Mahadev amid the beats of damru. The procession was showered with gulal and rose petals. A number of tourists including foreigners, were also present to witness the celebration.

The procession, after crossing Dundhiraj Ganesh and Annpurna Temple, reached Kashi Vishwanath temple, where the idols were taken to the sanctum sanctorum for offering prayers. “The 356 year old tradition was started by our forefathers,” said Kulpati Tiwari adding that Kashi is the abode of Lord Shiva and all living here are his devotees. Adequate security arrangements were made along the route of the procession.

89,['6/03/2020'],River linking: EPS reaches out to neighbours in style,"Chennai: Faced with challenges arising out of inter-state water disputes during his tenure, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami , who also holds the portfolio of irrigation, has taken the lead in inviting his counterparts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for talks to link the Godavari and Cauvery rivers. The move assumed significance coming as it does a year ahead of Tamil Nadu assembly election.

A day after sending a delegation of TN ministers to personally invite Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, Palaniswami wasted no time in inviting Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao. “Palaniswami is trying to assert his leadership in the run up to the polls. The CM-level meeting could take place in April-end,” said a source. Insiders say “influential individuals” had a role in trying to organise the high-profile meeting of the southern chief ministers, which is unlikely to take place in Chennai. Retired bureaucrat, M Sheela Priya, one of the secretaries of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, and who was appointed as chairperson of the Fourth Police Commission last October, was spotted with the TN delegation that visited AP and Telangana.

The National Water Development Agency of the Union Jal Shakti ministry prepared the draft detailed project report and sent it to the party states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for comments in March last year. The initial plan is to divert 247tmcft of water from Godavari to Cauvery. Palaniswami has his task cut out as Telangana has been demanding more share from the link given that water will be diverted from Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila) — Cauvery (Grand Anicut). As per the draft detailed project, the link will benefit about 9.38 lakh hectares, of which 1.84 lakh hectares fall in Telangana.

The opposition has criticized EPS for omitting the existing heavily polluting industries in his ambitious Cauvery agricultural zone, but Palaniswami has preferred to focus on the river-link project hoping to score another win. “He has a clear strategy on what has to be done for the people of Tamil Nadu. He understands what will work politically. Right now, he is in the driver’s seat and accelerating fast,” AIADMK spokesperson Kovai Satyan said.

The plan is to complete the identification of suitable land at the earliest to complete the relocation of fishermen living in the 50-metre limit of the sea to safer location.

The Punargeham project of the fisheries department aims to relocate fishermen families living in the close vicinity of the sea to safer locations by identifying suitable land. So far 210 fishermen families in the district have applied for housing benefit under Punargeham project.

We have identified land to construct houses for 21 beneficiaries, said an official with the fisheries department. The list of beneficiaries and the land details have been submitted to the district-level monitoring committee, the official said.

The department will spend Rs 10 lakh each on every applicant. The amount will be utilized for the purchase of land and for construction activities.

While the government has decided to allot Rs 6 lakh for purchase of land, the remaining Rs 4 lakh will be used for the construction of house. If it is possible to get land for a lesser price then the excess amount will also be invested for the construction of house.

A total of Rs 21 crore has been allocated for the project’s first phase, comprising construction of 210 houses. Officials expect more applications after the completion of the first phase.

AHMEDABAD: A Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) jawan of the city police on Wednesday filed a complaint alleging that he was attacked by a bootlegger in Odhav when he tried to arrest him.

The LRD jawan, Hardev Aja, 25, stated that he is posted with a joint enforcement team (JET) of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the city police. He said that he has been working with Odhav police for three days and earlier worked for the surveillance squad.

On Wednesday, Aja was on JET work and saw the accused and bootlegger, Sunil Khatik alias Kachori, at a tea stall. “I saw Sunil Khatik talking with Goral Khatik and Chetak Shah. As I recognized Sunil, who is a known bootlegger, I called Odhav police and asked if he was involved in any crime recently,” stated the FIR.

Aja was told that Sunil is accused in a case of assault. On hearing this, Aja tried to catch Sunil but the accused first tried to flee from then began attacking Aja.

Aja claimed that the alleged bootlegger not only thrashed him but also abused him in front of the public. As people gathered around, some of them called the police and an Odhav police team arrived and arrested Sunil.

Odhav police registered a case for causing hurt and using abusive words against Sunil and began an investigation.

The assistant professor Santosh Kumar Singh had lodged an FIR three days ago, alleging that a student identified as Shashank Singh and 11 other unidentified students had threatened him of dire consequences, apparently owing to the drive he carried out against students staying illegally in AU hostels.

Inspector (Colonelganj) Arun Tyagi said, “In his FIR, the assistant professor, who is also the superintendent of Sir Sundar Lal Hostel, stated that the incident took place on Sunday night, when a student from the hostel made an urgent call to him and urged him to meet at Laxmi Talkies crossing at 11 pm.” The superintendent, however, informed his colleagues and others about the same before heading towards the crossing. When he reached the spot, he noticed more students arriving there. They tried to take him to an unidentified location which did not have any CCTV cameras.

Before he could make sense of anything, the students started threatening him of dire consequences without mentioning any context, and went away. Professor Singh told police that since he carried out a drive against illegal inmates staying in AU hostels, many of them were apparently targeting him for the same.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Principal secretary (revenue) V Venu has taken strong exception to the government decision to remove survey director V R Premkumar from the post. In a note to the chief secretary, a copy of which has also been marked to the chief minister’s and revenue minister’s office, he has asked the chief secretary to persuade the government to reconsider the decision.

In his note, accessed by TOI, the revenue secretary has said that it is shocking that Premkumar has been removed from the post without any provocation or discernible reason. “If there had been any complaint against him from any quarter, I should have been consulted as he reports to me. The abrupt transfer of a young IAS officer will not only demotivate him, but also send a negative signal to the IAS officers serving in sensitive and responsible positions,” the note said.

He further said that there were several decisions in the past prescribing the procedures before shifting an officer, such as convening a civil services board (CSB), to ensure stable tenure to officers, which have not been considered while transferring the officer.

He said that Premkumar’s work in the department has been completely satisfactory, and as the captain of the team, it is his responsibility to take up the matter that affects the morale of his officers. He urged the chief secretary to take up the matter for reconsideration of the chief minister as well as the cabinet to reinstate Premkumar back in the post of director of survey and land records.

It is also reliably learnt that Venu has also conveyed to the revenue minister that he will go on leave in protest.

Meanwhile, the IAS fraternity has come in support of the view of the revenue secretary and has said that, not only in the case of Premkumar, this has been happening with others as well. “When our legally assured minimum tenure is two years, it has come down to six months. Civil services board has become literally non-existent. When the government ask officers to deliver on a multitude of programmes, we fail to deliver, but also fail to convey that with this kind of uncertainty and a short tenure, we will be unable to deliver,” a senior official said. Senior IAS officers have also demanded that the IAS association meet at the earliest and discuss the matter. Meanwhile, the association is yet to respond in the matter.

Premkumar, an officer from 2014 batch of the IAS was posted as the director of survey and land records few months ago. He had earlier served as additional district magistrate in charge of Sabarimala, and sub-collector in Devikulam and Mananthavadi.

96,['6/03/2020'],Pattern of frequent wet spells this season may be linked to record Arctic freeze,"Rain, wind bring pollution down

NEW DELHI: North India , which is in the midst of a wet spell that’s likely to last till Saturday, can expect more rain just after Holi next week, with temperatures generally remaining below normal for the next 14 days, the met department forecasts.This is a continuing pattern of very frequent weather disturbances, which set in after the record-breaking chill across the region in December. Meteorologists say this pattern of rapid succession of western disturbances (WDs) hitting north India may be linked to unusual weather unfolding far, far away — a record freeze in the Arctic region.Arctic sea ice cover — for long a stark reminder of global warming because of its rapid decline — is actually at a 10-year high this winter, according to Weather.com.What’s causing the freeze is a wind circulation called the polar vortex, which has been the strongest on record this season.The polar vortex is an anti-clockwise moving current that circles the Arctic region. A strong vortex keeps the Arctic cold trapped within the polar region.“A record strong polar vortex supported by other global forcings has led to 20 WDs hitting north India since January 1, which is likely to be a record of sorts,” said R K Jenamani , senior scientist at the IMD ’s National Weather Forecasting Centre here.A western disturbance is a pulse of low pressure that travels east from southern Europe, and usually brings wet weather to north India. The normal number of such WDs impacting north India in January-February is around 12. This year, however, there has been one every three-four days.Not all WDs bring rain/snow in north India. But the disturbance does lead to a change in wind direction, a rise in temperature during the approach and a fall thereafter. The high frequency of WDs has prevented temperature extremes during this winter, after the record cold spell in December,” Jenamani said.There were as many as 10 WDs this January. Six of these were “active”, which mean these caused rain and snow. This resulted in countrywide rainfall being 73% higher than normal. While nine WDs were recorded in February, only two were active ones. Which is why February recorded subdued rainfall.However, the WD that hit India on March 3 is an active one, and is likely to cause rainfall and snow in the higher hills till Saturday. Till 8.30am on Thursday, Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory recorded 4.2mm rainfall, while Palam recorded 5.6mm.Friday is forecast to be cloudy with moderate rain or thundershowers, and hailstorms in a few areas. The maximum and minimum temperatures in the city will be around 23 and 14 degrees Celsius, respectively.The frequent WDs, and the resulting rain, change in wind direction and/or strong winds, have also helped keep air pollution levels down. Thursday’s rain was no exception. “An improvement to the lower end of satisfactory to the good category is expected on Friday. The air quality is likely to stay in the good to the satisfactory category on Saturday, while the satisfactory category is predicted for Sunday,” a SAFAR report said.Another active WD is likely to impact north India on March 11 to 13, which is likely to bring wet weather across the region, the met department said.These two wet spells are also likely to keep temperatures below normal in the region for the next two weeks, according to IMD’s extended range forecast. Maximum temperatures are likely to stay below normal on average across the country during this period, according to the forecast.It is difficult to predict for how long this pattern of frequent WDs will continue, Jenamani said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74502395,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-492016,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pattern-of-frequent-wet-spells-this-season-may-be-linked-to-record-arctic-freeze/articleshow/74502401.cms

AGRA: Parents of students studying in St Peter’s College and its junior wing St Felix Nursery School created a ruckus on Thursday. Parents wanted the school administration to keep the school shut for a few days as a precautionary method against Covid-19.

Under the supervision of health department officials, both the school premises were sanitized by mopping of sodium hypochlorite solution.

College authorities informed the parents that they can’t close the schools because examinations are taking place. “All possible precautions are being taken for the safety of students. The school will be shut down only after the orders of the district administration,” authorities said.

However, St Felix Nursery School was closed for the second day on Thursday on parents’ request.

The principal of St Peter’s College Father Andrew Correia said, “Under the supervision of health department officials, sanitization of the school premises has been done. Parents need not panic. We are making the best possible arrangements for the wellbeing of our students.”

“In the morning assembly, I informed students about the precautions to be taken. In this regard, notices have also been placed in the classrooms. Teachers have been asked to keep a watch on the health of children and immediately inform if any student is found suffering from cold, fewer or bad throat,” he added.

Mother of two, Vinita Goyal, who had come to drop her kids to school wearing N95 masks said, “I have informed my kids about the dos and dont’s to prevent coronavirus infection. Besides N95 masks, I have given them hand sanitizer to use at regular intervals.”

Divisional joint director (education) Mukesh Agarwal said, “A task force of 50 scouts and guides has been constituted to spread awareness about coronavirus. They will be trained by teachers and experts to explain the subject in an interesting way. Groups of these volunteers will be visiting different schools very soon.”

NAINITAL: The Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has announced that it has cancelled the holidays of over 600 guards and regular workers as it aims to tighten the security before Holi to prevent poachers from entering the reserve.

Speaking to TOI, CTR officials said that the chances of poachers entering the protected forest area increases during the festive season and, therefore, the entire 50-km border of CTR with Uttar Pradesh will remain sealed till Holi. “We have cancelled the leaves of almost all our staff and they have been deployed across the forest to prevent any case of poaching or illegal activity here. Over the years, we have seen several cases in which smugglers infiltrated CTR during festive seasons such as Holi and Diwali. Meanwhile, it has been decided that the entire border with neighbouring Uttar Pradesh will remain sealed till Holi,” said CTR director Rahul.

He added, “We have installed eight thermal imaging cameras at several locations across the reserve to maintain vigil. Four more will also be procured and installed soon. Apart from this, seven drones have also been deployed to look for any suspected movement.”

Meanwhile, hotel owners have said that resorts in and around the CTR have been pre-booked for Holi. “The entire forest sprawls over an area of more than 500 sqkm and it is for the first time in the past four years that CTR will remain open for tourists even during Holi. This makes it necessary that tight security is maintained and the focus on tourists do not lead to any illegal activity in the protected area,” Rahul said.

101,['6/03/2020'],What ban? Single-use plastic is back in Chennai,"CHENNAI: Fourteen months after the Tamil Nadu government banned single-use plastic, the menace has surfaced again. At grocery shops, fancy stores, push carts and road side stalls, use of plastic carry bags has become usual again.Is slack enforcement by Greater Chennai Corporation a reason?According to official releases of the civic body, only 11,000kg (11 tonnes) plastic was seized in the past five months as against the 3,06,000kg (306 tonnes) confiscated from traders and manufacturers across the city from January to October last year.When asked, a civic body official brushed aside the numbers and said raids have been carried out from time to time even while monsoon preparedness and other civic work were going on during the latter half of 2019.“Since only small-time traders are using plastic bags, the seized quantity seems minimal,” said an official with the corporation’s health department.Though the ban was in effect from January last year, the civic body began penalising establishments from June 2019. Recently, a tea stall on Strahans Road, 3km from the corporation headquarters, was shut down after it was found that the owner was a repeat offender. A footwear showroom on Kundrathur Main Road, Porur, which used banned plastic bags, faced a similar fate two months ago. Despite these, the bags find a way into the market.According to S Rakappan, president of Tamil Nadu Plastic Manufacturers Association, plastic carry bags come from other states. “We cannot deny that it is still available in the market. Some still manufacture it stealthily and sell them at high rates,” Rakappan said.Rakappan said the use of compostable plastic bags as an alternative to plastic bags has led to duplication.“At present, only two companies are allowed to manufacture these biodegradable bags. They cost Rs 450 a kilogram. But, there are products available at Rs 200 a kilogram. This shows that these are fakes,” Rakappan said stressing that the government took a knee jerk reaction without bothering about the industries and about five lakh people who were employed. “Had waste management been effective, there was no need to ban plastic,” Rakappan said.Traders in the city, on the other hand, are irate that civic body officials had been heavy-handed. “Officials barge into shops, sometimes unaware of which items are banned, and behave in an authoritarian manner despite our co-operation,” said A M Vikramaraja, president, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangam Peramaippu.Vikramaraja said that plastic bags were still used in small shops. “Authorities will be aware from where these are coming. They have to initiate action,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74503109,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-186570,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/what-ban-single-use-plastic-is-back-in-town/articleshow/74501983.cms

However, the government issued a new advisory on Thursday which asked the Italians to get in touch with their embassy in Delhi.

In the fresh order to all the district collectors, health department mentioned, “The earlier order issued on March 4 are being withdrawn with immediate effect.”

The order further says, “The government of India directions were only meant to ask the Italian nationals to contact their deputy chief de Mission (DCM) at their embassy in New Delhi, in case they were facing any difficulty or anxiety on account of their 17 compatriots, who travelled in Rajasthan during February 21 to February 28 having tested positive for Covid-19.”

The order says, “Rajasthan is known for its hospitality and has always welcomed tourists, both domestic and international. We regret any confusion or inconvenience caused due to the earlier order that was a result of an inadvertent communication gap.”

The order pointed out that with reference to the earlier advisory, it is being clarified that the earlier advice was issued inadvertently due to communication gap. There were no instructions from the Centre to advise the tourists from Italy to go back to Delhi and contact the embassy. On March 4, the health department had issued an advisory.

104,['6/03/2020'],"Part of Modi's pet plan, Kedar projects being done unscientifically, can trigger disaster anytime: Scientists","File photo of Narendra Modi

DEHRADUN: Scientists have termed a 100 metre-wide and 50 feet-deep pit being dug for the Shankaracharya samadhi in Kedarnath, as well as a road on glacial sediments built between Gaurikund to the Kedarnath temple, “a recipe for disaster.”

These works are being done as part of the Kedarnath redevelopment plan which is a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Delivering a presentation on Thursday at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in the presence of principal scientific advisor (PSA) to the PM, K Vijay Raghavan, on how the fragile ecology of Kedarnath was being disturbed due to these works, MPS Bisht, director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC), an autonomous organisation under the department of science and technology that works in association with ISRO, said, “Just 50 metres behind the Kedarnath temple, a pit has been dug that is 100 metres wide and 50 feet deep for the samadhi. This pit is going to turn out to be extremely dangerous in future.""

Bisht added, ""We already have huge glaciers in that topography and on top of that we are digging such a huge pit. This is bound to disturb the fragile ecology of the region. We have been seeing increasing seismic activity and earthquakes. Why are we creating a situation for another disaster like the 2013 tragedy to take place again?” He made the comments at a conference on Gross Environment Product (GEP), an ecological concept equivalent to Gross Domestic Product, which was chaired by Raghavan.

Claiming that he was “extremely pained at the situation that is now developing in the Kedar valley”, Bisht cited another example of “unabated unscientific work going on in the valley.” He said, “There was earlier a road from Rambara to the Kedarnath temple from the right bend of the Mandakini river. But now this is being constructed from the left bend. This is completely unscientific. There was a reason why the road was originally constructed on the right bend by our ancestors. This was because the left bend has ‘loose glacial sediments’ which means that any structure here is prone to rampant avalanches, and landslides.”

The scientist added that “instead of constructing a road, a ropeway from Rambara to Kedarnath would have sufficed but now this vulnerable topography is being made to sustain the burden of lakhs of pilgrims”.

Other scientists at the conference agreed with concerns raised by Bisht. “Kedar means swamp land, and digging a 50 feet deep pit here will only invite trouble considering that there are glaciers nearby like Chorabari (whose bursting had triggered the 2013 disaster),” said a scientist from the Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology. He added: “The road from Rambara to Kedarnath is being built and widened on the most vulnerable area of Kedarnath valley and may any day collapse under the pressure of so many glacier shoots which are directly opening on the road.”

Raghavan, while speaking to TOI, acknowledged that revelations provided by the scientists were “an eye-opener” and may be “tipping points.” He said, “There are two types of environmental concerns — those which are slow and others which are tipping points. Tipping points happen because there is some major environmental change which has now reached its threshold. In both cases, it is important to analyse data and take action in a calm way.”

PALAKKAD: The emergency action plan ( EAP ) for six of the seven major dams in Bharathapuzha basin in the district presented at the stakeholder consultation meeting here on Thursday aims “to minimise the loss of life and property in case of occurrence of any emergency.”

The action plan identifies potential emergency conditions and specified pre-planned actions to be followed in the event of dam failure or release of water during extreme weather conditions that will save lives and reduce property damage.

It outlines “who does what, where, when and how” in an emergency situation or during an unusual occurrence in dams, said K A Joshi, chief engineer (investigation), state irrigation department.

The main five-step process of EAP is event detection, emergency-level determination, notification and communication, emergency actions and termination and follow-up actions, he said.

Emergency-level determinations are blue emergency which is the situation developing slowly and under control with no danger of immediate failure. The orange emergency is situation developing rapidly with possibility of failure and red emergency is failure imminent or already in progress.

The EAP is prepared for Malampuzha, Pothundy, Meenkara, Chulliyar, Walayar and Kanjirapuzha.

The EAP of Mangalam Dam is at its final stage, said Sudheer Padikkal, superintending engineer of Siruvani project.

The EAP is being prepared for the 16 major dams of the state under the irrigation department, he said. “Safety evaluation of existing dams shall be conducted by the dam owner as per the guidelines and remedial measures if any required to rehabilitate the dams shall be carried out in time. Besides, the dam owner shall be equipped with an action plan to minimize the loss of life and property damage in case of occurrence of emergency events. In this perspective, Central Water Commission (CWC) had published ‘Guidelines for Developing Emergency Action Plans for Dams,” said Gulshan Raj, chief engineer of CWC.

The meeting was presided over by district collector D Balamurali. Those who presented papers include World Bank consultants David Gonzakex Diaz and Ajith Patnaik; Kerala water resources department deputy secretary Marunmai Joshi, Geological Survey of India director K Aravind and state irrigation department chief engineer S Thilakan, among others.

110,['6/03/2020'],Talks begin for unified ticket system in city,"Chennai: A common ticketing system for suburban trains, metro rail and buses in Chennai may finally take off.

On Thursday, World Bank initiated a meeting between officials of Southern Railway, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd (CMRL) and Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) to lay the groundwork for a common ticketing system.

A senior official said this was part of a plan to have a common card for all modes of transport in every major city in India. Along with this, the World Bank also wants a seamless connectivity between all modes of transport, with digital boards showing all timings. For instance, Dr MGR Chennai Central station should have timings of the next metro train leaving Chennai Central towards airport, Washermenpet and St Thomas Mount and the metro station should have timings for the next bus and suburban trains.

This development comes at a time when a similar plan under the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) floated by the Tamil Nadu government has not taken off.

Official sources who were present at the meeting said the preliminary focus was on collection of primary data of the type of passenger flow. “World Bank has asked us to collect data on how many commuters leave suburban trains and take buses and how many take metro. We have been asked to map this data on a real-time basis. However, we don’t have the resources to do this,” said a senior official who was part of the meeting.

Senior railway officials who have been part of unified ticketing discussion in the past said Southern Railway’s commercial wing has shown great interest in bringing out such a card for the past seven years. However, the finance department wants exact accounting procedures to be followed. For example, it has stated that money accrued by railways from a multi-modal passenger should be deposited in railways account on the same day; but other agencies have objected to it as the accrual will only come after a day or two.

“However, these are minor issues which can be resolved in this digital age very easily,” a railway official said.

Kollam: Life is always unpredictable and you never know what is coming next. It was not different for five-year-old Sivajith of Mavedi, near Kottarakkara, who died of snakebite while sleeping at home on Tuesday.

Sivajith was the son of Manikuttan and Prasanna of ‘Manimandiram’. The boy died of snakebite under the dilapidated thatched roof where he slept with his parents. His father named the shack Manimandiram (meaning big mansion) but it couldn’t protect the boy or prevent the snake from getting inside.

On Tuesday, by 5.30am Sivajith, an LKG student of Mavedi Government LP school, woke up and told his parents that something had bit him. When they examined they could see the blood stain below his right knee. They went to a traditional snake-bite healer who administered him some first aid and directed them to take the boy to a hospital since he had collapsed.

Sivajith was taken to a nearby private hospital at Puthoor and later to the government taluk hospital, Kottarakkara.

However, his life could not be saved.

Even when the government and opposition fight over the success and failures of the LIFE Mission project, the tragedy of Sivajith points towards the serious neglect meted out to the family by authorities citing technical reasons. Manikuttan’s relatives said his application for a house under LIFE Mission scheme was rejected as the family had only partial claim to the 10 cents which was yet to be partitioned.

Manikuttan’s family neither had ration card nor Aadhaar to claim the benefits. A manual labourer, Manikkuttan was finding it impossible to construct a proper dwelling for his children. The family is worried about the future of Sivajith’s sister Sivaganga, a fourth standard student of the same school where Sivajith studied.

Meanwhile, district collector B Abdul Nazar has instructed the Kottarakkara tahsildar to file a report on why the family was not sanctioned a house.

When contacted, the Kulakkada grama panchayat authorities said that despite their persuasion Manikuttan or Prasanna did not try to get the relevant documents, including ration card, to make them eligible for the house. Grama panchayat president G Saraswathy said panchayat would take all steps to provide the family a house once they produce the required documents.

The family of the late acting legend, Sivaji Ganesan, which owns the property, announced on Thursday that it had given up plans to have a multiplex in the commercial complex that has come up after the theatre was demolished. The last screening was on May 15, 2016.

The only link to Sivaji Ganesan that will remain are embossed portraits of some of his iconic roles, including that in ‘Parashakti’, in the lobby of the six-storeyed building that has come up offering 87,000 square feet of office space. The gates also have names of popular Sivaji Ganesan movies on them.

Briefing reporters, actor Prabhu, younger son of Sivaji Ganesan, said it was the collective decision of the family to have office space only in the building. “Earlier, I had said there would be a theatre, but now it is the decision of our family along with plans of the developer to have office space for IT firms,” he said.

Constructed in 1961 by G Umapathy and D Shanmuga Raja, Shanti Theatre was later bought by Sivaji Ganesan and has been with his family ever since. The 1,200-seat theatre transformed into a two-screen complex, which ran the Rajnikanth-starrer ‘Chandramukhi’ of ‘Sivaji Productions’ for a record 890 days from April 14, 2005.

Chitty Babu, chairman & CEO of Akshaya Pvt Ltd, builders of the complex, said the business model for the commercial building was designed based on viability. “No road in and around the city can match the infrastructure of Anna Salai. We are open for lease or sale of the office suites,” he said. The complex will also have 134 parking spaces.

Noting that Anna Salai is bouncing back to normal business activity, he said, metro connectivity is changing the business dynamics of office spaces on the arterial road.

Christo said, “I had gone to attend the temple festival. When I saw a separate toilet board for Brahmins, I was shocked and took a picture. I posted it on social media and now it has gone viral.

MEERUT: The count of people from west UP killed in Delhi riots reached 11 on Thursday with the identification of one more dead.

The confirmation of Hamza Ansari’s identity at a mortuary in a Delhi hospital dashed all the hopes back home in Meerut’s Lisari gate area, where the family still had some hope of finding him alive.

Ansari (25) used to run an eatery kiosk in Delhi’s New Mustafabad area, and lived with his sister and brother-in-law. He went missing on February 25. His body was pulled out from a drain, almost decomposed a few days ago.

Family’s frantic search ended at post-mortem house as kin identified one of the bodies fished out of drain to be that of Ansari.

Ansari’s body is being brought to Meerut’s Shahjahan colony and the family is gearing up for the last rites. Meanwhile, the death toll in the riots soared to 53 on Thursday.

Several bodies of riot victims have been found in drains since Wednesday, including that of IB staffer Ankit Sharma after violence ebbed. Killing of Sharma, a native of Itawah village in UP’s Muzaffarnagar district had triggered massive outrage as the family blamed local AAP corporator Tahir Hussian for it.

Earlier, the body of a 21-year-old Bijnor resident Mohammed Aftab , which bore several torture marks hinting at brutal assault, was recovered from a drain. “It was very difficult to identify the body, it had decomposed. We identified Aftab by his clothes and a mole on his chin. There were red spots near his eyes. It was not clear what had happened to him. He was a victim of hatred,” Furqan, Aftab's elder brother had said.

Some bodies recovered from drain have decomposed beyond recognition forcing authorities to resort to DNA test. A family in UP’s Hapur district is still hopeful of return of their son Mohsin who has been missing since February 25 from Karawal Nagar area in the national capital.

HYDERABAD: The budget session of assembly will begin on Friday with governor Tamilisai Soundararajan addressing both Houses. The session is likely to continue for two weeks.

The budget will be presented on Sunday after the vote of thanks for the governor’s address on Saturday. The TRS government has decided to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) in this session. Sources said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao would make a statement on implementation of National Population Register (NPR) on the floor of the assembly.

Apart from debating on various demands, the government is likely to introduce the new Revenue Act and GHMC Act. KCR had already announced that the Revenue Act would be introduced in this budget session to bring in much-needed reforms in the revenue department.

Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said the GHMC Act would be introduced to pave the way for the Building Permission Approval and Self-Certification System (B-PASS) which would make building permission approval time-bound and self-certification up to 600 square yards.

Meanwhile, the opposition parties are gearing up to corner the government on issues like CAA, NPR and pending promises made by the government like enhancement of retirement age from 58 to 61 years to government employees, loan waiver, Rythu Bandhu and implementation of Pay Revision Commission salaries to government employees.

UTORDA: Given the high density of cargo vessels transiting through the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the increase in air traffic, accidents at sea could increase, for which coordination between aeronautical and maritime rescue agencies needs to be enhanced, said senior government officials on Thursday at the National Maritime Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX-2020).

Speaking at the conference, defence secretary Ajay Kumar said that national and international search and rescue (SAR) agencies will require better cooperation and coordination to tackle such emergencies.

Director general of Indian Coast Guard Krishnaswamy Natarajan, who also spoke at the inaugural, said the two-day HAMSAR (Harmonizing Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue) exercise is an effort to bring about cohesiveness.

The Indian Army and Indian Air Force , along with state government officials are participating in the exercise off Goa’s coast with representatives of 19 countries. The exercise will simulate a maritime accident just off Caranzalem beach. A mock drill will see various agencies working together to rescue the injured and treat them at Caranzalem beach.

“As human endeavours take us deeper into the seas, harmonisation of maritime and aeronautics is going to become more important,” said Kumar. “A significant fraction of our overall trade comes from the maritime route, increased airline traffic over the seas, all these are factors that point to a greater need for increase and better technological and logistics coordination for SAR in maritime zones deeper into the seas,” he pointed out.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who appeared in a court here as an accused in Muzaffarnagar riots, later said that suspended AAP corporator Tahir Hussain is a terrorist and people like him “should be shot dead publicly”. Hussain, who has been made an accused in the murder of IB staffer Ankit Sharma during the last week’s riots in Delhi, was arrested on Thursday.

Known for making sensational statements, Som told reporters outside the court, “‘Aise log (Tahir Hussain) aatankwadi hai, aaise logon ko chauraahe par khada karke goli maar deni chahiye.’” It roughly translates as, “Tahir Hussain is a terrorist. He should be made to stand on a busy crossing and shot dead.” He was asked to comment on Hussain's arrest.

He added, “Whoever killed Ankit Sharma will get strong punishment. The government will also not take back CAA, no matter how much anyone opposes.”

132,['6/03/2020'],"Karnataka budget: No package for sugar mills, Mandya farmers upset","MANDYA: Farmers of Mandya have given thumbs down to the state budget presented by chief minister Yediyurappa on Thursday as no package was announced to revive the defunct Mysugar and PSSK sugar mills.

Disappointing the Vokkaliga heartland even after favouring BJP in the KR Pet bypoll and helping party open its account in Mandya for the first time in December, farmers accused the CM of not standing by his word and smashing all their hopes.

Earlier, Yediyurappa had promised to revive the defunct Mysugar and PSSK sugar mills in his ‘home district’ Mandya. The farmers were hoping that the CM would either allocate funds to revive the factories or announce the measures to save them.

“We had pinned our hopes on Yediyurappa. We were expecting a package to resuscitate the two factories. Despite voting for BJP and helping them gain foothold here, Yediyurappa smashed our hopes about Mandya getting a fair share in budget,” said Nagaraju , a farmer.

M B Nagannagowda, a political thinker, said: “By not giving any package, especially for reviving the Mysugar and PSSK sugar mills, BJP seems to have lost its track in furthering its grip over Mandya electorate.”

“Though, it is not good to interpret allocation or non-allocation of funds in state’s budget through a political prism, Yediyurappa should not have betrayed the Mandya voters who had shown enormous faith in him,” he said.

Yediyurappa is also being heavily trolled on social media platforms for ignoring Mandya in the budget.

134,['6/03/2020'],Sweet ending: Intern doctors ‘celebrate’ assaulted GMCH clerk’s birthday,"Nagpur: Intern doctors who had attacked a junior clerk Sharad Sabale at Super Specialty Hospital (SSH) on Tuesday afternoon celebrated his 31st birthday at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) as a gesture of apology on Wednesday. Doctors gave Sabale a bouquet and wished him the best. However, it took almost two hours of drama for GMCH authorities to bring the issue to such ‘sweet ending’.

Five to six interns from GMCH had allegedly attacked Sabale on Tuesday. Labour unions had announced they would take up this issue with the dean on Wednesday.

As announced , hundreds of Class IV and Class III employees as well as some nursing staff gathered in front of the dean’s office at GMCH on Wednesday at 10.30 am and started a sit-in. They shouted slogan against interns who had attacked the on-duty clerk.

Trisharan Sahare, leader of medical college workers union attached to INTUC, announced staffers won’t return to work until GMCH administration suspended the doctors for at least six months.

Doctors too were ready with their union support. Office-bearers of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors ( MARD ) also reached the venue and requested the dean not to let the students suffer loss of academic year.

Dean Dr Sajal Mitra and medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande conducted several rounds of discussions with both the parties. “MARD mediated between administration and interns. We understand both doctors and staff coexist in the institute and are interdependent. We strongly supported not making any academic loss of the students,” said Dr Mukul Deshpande, president of MARD GMCH and general secretary of Central MARD.

“Finally, it was decided that dean and the committee will continue the probe and we will accept whatever this committee decides. We have faith in the dean and administration,” he added.

Medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande took lead in pacifying the agitating staffers. “All employees and doctors are integral parts of GMCH so we resolved this issue mutually. During discussion, we came to know it was Sharad Sabale’s birthday today. So, interns who had issues with him till yesterday decided to wish him and finish all disagreements,” said Dr Gawande.

Workers union also accepted the committee formed by dean will decide what punishment is to be given to the interns. Finally, all staffers, doctors, MARD office bearers, and GMCH authorities together celebrated Sabale’s birthday.

135,['6/03/2020'],No sign of Narendra Dabholkar murder trial commencing soon in Pune,"Representative image

PUNE: The trial in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case appears far from beginning soon before the special UAPA court in the city, more than six years after he was shot dead.

The case is pending at the stage of framing of charges that will pave the way for the commencement of the trial. Between September 2016 and November 2019, the CBI has filed three chargesheets. The agency is continuing with its investigation, monitored by the Bombay high court.

The delay is partly attributed to the CBI’s effort to trace the firearms used in the murder. The lawyers associated with the case pointed out that a single judge bench of the high court had issued an interim order in 2016, restraining the (Pune) trial court from framing charges “till further orders”. The interim directive stands extended from time to time, they added.

Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryawanshi, representing the CBI before the Pune court, said, “The high court and the trial court here has given us (CBI) time for the ongoing investigation, focused on the recovery of firearm.”

The CBI has so far arrested eight suspects, including main conspirator and Panvel-based ENT specialist Virendrasinh Tawde; Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, the two men accused of shooting Dabholkar dead on a bridge near Balgandharva Rangmandir in the city around 7.20am on August 20, 2013; and Vikram Bhave, accused of helping the shooters conduct a recce.

The CBI has described Tawde as “the then deputy chief organiser of Hindu Jan Jagruti Samiti, a sister outfit of Sanatan Sanstha”, who was at loggerheads with Dabholkar over the latter’s anti-superstition drive.

The probe agency has till date filed chargesheets against Tawde on September 6, 2016; against Andure and Kalaskar on February 13, 2019; and the third on November 20, 2019, against Bhave and Sanjiv Punalekar, the Mumbai lawyer arrested with Bhave in May last year and currently out on bail.

Three other accused — Amol Kale, Rakesh Bangera and Amit Digwekar — got a default bail after the CBI failed to file a chargesheet within 90 days or seek an extension of time for filing the chargesheet under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act provisions. Kale, Bangera and Digwekar, also accused in journalist-turned-activist Gauri Lankesh’s murder, are currently lodged in a Bengaluru jail in that case.

A senior officer from the CBI’s special crime branch in Mumbai told TOI over telephone on Thursday, “The high court has not explicitly stayed the trial, but there was an interim stay, which is being extended from time to time. For logical end, some more work is being done (by CBI).”

Dharmraj Chandel, one of the defence lawyers, told TOI, “A single judge bench of the high court had passed an order in 2016 restraining the trial court from framing charges till further orders. Tawde and Kalaskar are lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail, while Andure is lodged in Aurangabad jail and Bhave is lodged in Pune’s Yerawada central jail.”

HYDERABAD: An incident of attempted suicide strengthened her resolve to become a doctor and serve women in need, said governor Tamilisai Soundararajan at a women’s day event at University College for Women in Koti on Thursday.

“I was a house surgeon in medical college where a nine-month pregnant woman who had immolated herself in an attempt to commit suicide was brought in. Her baby died. When I asked why she did it, the woman told me that it was because of dowry harassment. That day I decided to be more than a doctor for all the women in the country,” Soundararajan said.

Referring to the recent Disha gangrape and murder case, the governor urged all women to be alert and learn self-defence and martial arts. “When I was a first-year medical student, the seniors would rag us and ask us to put flowers on our hair. I would stand up against them. Women have to be courageous,” she said.

Speaking about her experience as a politician, the governor said, “I am the most trolled politician. People ridicule me and say I am short and dark. I say yes I am short, but my talent is tall enough.”

City police commissioner Anjani Kumar said that the police department was improving its operations to ensure better safety to women.

LUCKNOW: Three flyers from China who touched down at Lucknow airport on different dates last week are untraceable, ringing alarm bells in the state health department, who are scrambling for clues to track them down.

The trio was screened at Chaudhury Charan Singh Airport, Lucknow, and found asymptomatic to Covid-19 and allowed to proceed to their homes in Maharajganj and Deoria districts with a rider that they would remain quarantined for 14 days.

Health department officials were told to track the three as per protocol. When health teams from Maharajganj and Deoria reached their homes as per address details in passport, they were found missing.

Sources in the office of chief medical officer (CMO) said the missing trio includes two women — a 27-year-old resident of Bhanauli Paniyara area and a 23-year-old native of Maharajganj.

Neighbours revealed the first could be staying at a private girls’ hostel in Indiranagar area of Lucknow while the younger one could be residing adjacent to a private hospital on Faizabad Road. The third untraceable person is a 22-year-old native of Deoria.

“Neighbours told the health team the women lived in the area decades ago and could now be staying with a relative in Lucknow,” said an official in Maharajganj.

CMO of Maharajganj spoke to his counterpart in Lucknow to check the authenticity of addresses.

“We tried to track them down from addresses mentioned in the passport. Now, separate teams have been formed and we sought help from Lucknow police commissioner to trace down,” said Dr Narendra Agarwal, CMO, Lucknow.

The trio was part of a group 18 passengers, who returned from China last week on different dates.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s economic growth rate during 2019-20 will be the lowest since 2012 (the base year) at 5.7%, according to the state’s economic survey released on Thursday. In 2018-19 the actual growth rate was 6% though the estimate was 7.5%.

The figures for the past two years clearly indicate a slowdown in the country’s largest state economy, said officials, but the expected growth rate for 2019-20 is still higher than that for all of India, which is estimated at 5%.

The survey report, tabled in the legislative assembly by finance minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday, shows a decline in estimated growth rate for industrial sector from 5.5% to 3.3% and for the service sector from 8.1% to 7.6%. The worst-hit in industry is the manufacturing sector, where growth rate is set to go down from 6% in 2018-19 to just 2.7%.

But amid the gloom, agriculture shows a positive growth of 3.1% as against the negative (-) 2.2% last year. This is largely due to abundant rainfall received last year, which was 112.6% of the state’s normal rainfall during monsoon.

Previous government to blame: Ajit Pawar

The survey states crop production in the rabi (winter) season is expected to be better than in the kharif season compared to the previous year. Growth rate in the crop sector is expected to be 2.5% as against (-) 3.8 per cent last year, livestock is set to be steady at 6%, forestry and logging is set to turn positive at 0.4% as against (-) 7.4% in 2018-19, and the growth in fisheries and aquaculture is estimated at 1.7% against (-) 10.5 % the previous year.

The government, however, has been slow in disbursing loans to the agriculture sector. Having set a target of Rs 87,322 crore for 2019-20, it had, up to December 2019, disbursed Rs 24,897 crore through financial institutions as against Rs 31,283 crore during 2018-19. Up to September 2019, agricultural term loans of Rs 18,147 crore had been disbursed as against Rs 36,631 crore during 2018-19.

The state’s financial position continues to be a concern, with debt estimated at Rs 4.7 lakh crore from Rs 4.14 lakh crore in 2018-19. The state says it is 16.4% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), well within the 24.4% of GSDP recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. The interest payment is estimated at Rs 35,207 crore, revenue deficit at Rs 20,293 crore and fiscal deficit at Rs 61,670 crore.

Revenue receipts for 2019-20 are estimated at Rs 3.15 lakh crore. The actual revenue receipts during April to December 2019 were Rs 2.14 lakh crore (68% of budget estimates). The revenue expenditure is estimated at Rs 3.4 lakh crore, as against Rs 3 lakh crore the previous year. While capital receipts are expected to increase by 4.5% (Rs 89,887 crore) over the previous year, capital expenditure is set to decrease by 2.7% (Rs 70,000 crore).

Though the average share of Maharashtra ’s contribution to India’s GDP, at 14.3%, is the highest among all states, it is down by 0.7% compared to 2018-19, when it was 15%.

The GSDP, though, is expected to increase by Rs 2.5 lakh crore to Rs 29 lakh crore as against Rs 26 lakh crore last year. The per capita income during 2019-20 is expected at Rs 2.07 lakh as against Rs 1.91 lakh in 2018-19, with Tamil Nadu overtaking it and the state now standing fifth behind Haryana, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.

The year-on-year rate of inflation based on average consumer price index during April–December 2019 was 9.2% for rural areas and 6.2% for urban areas as against 0.6% and 1.9% respectively during April–December 2018.

While the state has remained a favoured destination for foreign direct investment with 29% of the total FDI inflows from 2000 to 2019, Karnataka has inched ahead of Maharashtra in 2019, having received an inflow of Rs 32,431 crore as against Maharashtra’s Rs 25,316 crore.

On the employment front, the Employment Market Information Programme shows employment in public and private sectors was down to 72 lakh up to June 2019 as against 74 lakh in 2018-19. Regarding government jobs, the state government’s sanctioned posts from groups A to D in July 2019 were 7.19 lakh, of which 5.12 lakh had been filled.

Ajit Pawar blamed the “wrong policies” of the previous BJP-led government for the situation. “Several issues in the economic survey are a cause for concern. It is due to the wrong policies pursued during the past five years by the previous government. The decline in industry, services sector, employment and GDP is very serious. We will not keep reiterating the wrongs of the previous government but will focus on correcting the mistakes. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will focus on using every opportunity that presents itself and make every effort to recover Maharashtra’s number one position in agriculture, industry, commerce, education and FDI.”

Police had charged them under various sections of IPC, under section 3/4 of Public Property Damage Act, under Arms Act, and Criminal Amendment Act.

In his bail application, Omar said he had not committed any crime and was being wrongly implicated.

He claimed, “On December 20, 2019 he had gone to offer Friday prayers at Eidgah around and returned around 5.30pm. On January 30, police arrested me from my house without any warrant and took me to Anwarganj police station.”

Omar said he took private tuitions to earn and should therefore be granted bail. Opposing the bail application, additional district government counsel Shiv Bhagwan said on December 20, 2019, Omar and other co-accused had hurled petrol bombs, acid bombs and bottles on police party after namaz. Several police officials had sustained injuries and some people had died. The accused had also burnt motorcycles of policemen. The evidence on record indicated that accused and co-accused had indulged in violence along with crowd and had damaged national property which was a serious criminal offence.

Omar was identified and arrested after his mobile call details showed he was involved in the riots, therefore his bail application must be rejected.

Hashmi also claimed police had arrested him from his house which was 8 km away from the spot of violence. After going through the evidence on record, the judge rejected both bail applications.

UTORDA: The Indian Coast Guard ’s long wait for surveillance and rescue helicopters to replace the ageing fleet of Chetak helicopters could end with defence secretary Ajay Kumar announcing on Thursday that the defence ministry may issue the request for proposal (RFP) for 14 twin-engine helicopters by March-end.

The Indian Coast Guard had sought the helicopters to undertake longer maritime surveillance missions as well as search and rescue missions out at sea.

“We are acquiring 14 multi-role heavy helicopters to go deep into the seas. Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has given approval for this multi-thousand crore project a couple of months ago and we hope the RFP will be issued by the month-end,” Kumar said. The helicopters are being procured as part of a capability enhancement plan for the Indian Coast Guard, Kumar said at the National Maritime Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX-2020) here.

As part of this plan, 16 advanced light helicopters (ALH) are also being purchased from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.

The Coast Guard needs long-range medium to heavy lift helicopters with an endurance of five to six hours of surveillance to replace the ageing Chetaks. Besides Chetaks , the force also flies the indigenous ALH for coastal patrol and rescue missions.

The Coast Guard will also setup 29 sub-centres along the coastline by 2025 in order to improve the response time to disasters or emergencies.

“The government of India has laid out a vision to further strengthen the overall capabilities of the Indian Coast Guard. Detailed plan for digital Coast Guard will be there and in the future it will become a network centric force,” the defence secretary said.

The force plans to have 200 ships and 100 aircraft in its fleet by 2025. “Effective search and rescue in the maritime domain continues to remain a challenge amidst increasing merchant and fishing traffic coupled by formation of frequent cyclones,” director general of Indian Coast Guard Krishnaswamy Natarajan said.

148,['6/03/2020'],Telangana spent 69% funds on development in past 5 years,"HYDERABAD: Telangana is among very few states in the country which spends higher than the national average developmental expenditure (63%). Between 2015-20, Telangana spent 69% of its funds on developmental expenditure.Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan spent more than 70% of their budget on developmental expenditure. Developmental expenditure refers to the expenditure of the government which helps in economic development by increasing production and real income. Experts said developmental expenditure on revenue is divided into developmental expenditure on revenue account and developmental expenditure on capital account.Budget expenditure has two categories of developmental and non-developmental expenditure. A developmental expenditure helps in increasing the production and productivity of a state’s economy. The developmental expenditure involves both revenue expenditure and capital outlay. This expenditure consists of social services, which includes expenditure on education, health, water supply and sanitation, housing, urban development, and welfare of backward communities,On the economic front, expenditure includes money spent on agriculture and allied activities, rural development, irrigation, energy, and transportation infrastructure.Non-developmental expenditure consists of general services, which includes expenditure on administrative services, police and payment of interest and pensions.In this 2015-18 period, some states raised 9% less revenue than their budget estimates. “In that scenario, states would need to either cut their expenditure or increase their borrowings to compensate for their shortfall in receipts,” an expert said.Among the four categories of revenue receipts, higher shortfall is seen in grants-in-aid from the centre (22%), and own non-tax revenue (13%). During the 2015-18 period, Assam (25%), Tripura (25%), and Telangana (20%) have seen higher shortfall in revenue as compared to other states.

150,['6/03/2020'],Road map for Gairsain summer capital will be ready soon: CM Rawat,"In what was termed as a ‘masterstroke’, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat left everyone, including his BJP colleagues and opposition Congress, stumped by announcing Gairsain as the summer capital of Uttarakhand on Wednesday. In an interaction with TOI’s Kautilya Singh on Thursday, the CM spoke about the reasons that prompted him to take the decision.

What made you take the call and what was the motivation?

The purpose of creating a new state was to take development to far-flung and remote areas. The thought was the overall development of the state. Our statehood agitators sacrificed their life for a new state and my decision is a tribute to all those who were a part of the statehood movement. I turned emotional after I made the announcement because I have seen with my own eyes the hardships people faced in their fight.

Congress says the decision was taken in haste and that there is no provision for Gairsain in the budget?

I have nothing to comment on what the Congress is saying. They are the opposition party and it is the nature (dharma) of an opposition party to oppose whatever the ruling dispensation does. This is a well-thought out decision by us. I have spoken to the respective departments and we will sit together to chalk out the modalities.

How do you intend to improve infrastructure at Gairsain?

As we all know that at present, Gairsain is not in a condition to take too much of load. Therefore, we need to work on infrastructure development in a sustained manner. We will invite experts and planners and after talking to all of them, we will work out the exact requirements and start on developing the required infrastructure.

Will the government function for six months from the summer capital?

It is still too early to comment on the total duration for which the government will operate from here.

Congress claims that if voted to power, it will make Gairsain the permanent capital?

Congress has been in power in Uttarakhand for 10 years, so my question to them is that why didn’t you do what you are claiming now, when you were in power? As for the question on permanent capital, I have laid the foundation work and we will consolidate on it further.

What is the progress of Kumbh 2021 preparations?

I expect a total expenditure of Rs 2,000 crore for Kumbh. Majority of the work will be completed by July, others by November and one project, which is in the outskirts area, will be over by December. Earlier, the Kumbh was held on a 600-hectare land, which has been increased to 1,500-hectare area this time.

What is your reaction to persistent rumours that you will be replaced as CM?

Change is the law of nature and no one can stop it. I have become used to such rumours and news now.

Cabinet expansion has also been pending for a long time?

Wait for some time. We will take a call after March 18 (when the BJP government completes three years in power).

Satyanaryana Reddy, 50, used to run a fertiliser store in Karimanagr while his wife, Radha alias Radhika, 50, was a government teacher. Radhika was the sister of TRS MLA Dasari Manohar Reddy. The couple along with their daughter, Vinaya Sri, 25, a BDS student, left their house in Karimnagar town on January 27 and went missing.

The decomposed bodies of the family were removed from the car and it was suspected that the vehicle accidentally fell in the canal when the family was leaving Karimnagar town.

Two days ago, Karimnagar police conducted a search at Satyanarayana’s house and his shop and seized two diaries. According to sources, the diary, which purportedly belongs to Satyanarayana, was found at the shop, while the book of his wife was found at the house. In his diary, Satyanarayana purportedly had written about donating his property to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam after his death.

The suspected Covid-19 patient is a resident of Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram area and has been admitted to Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Also, five of the six patients from Agra undergoing treatment at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital have tested positive for the virus.

Assuring that adequate steps are being taken to contain the risk in the state, Singh said: “Tracking of possible coronavirus cases is underway at all possible entry points in the state. UP has adequate beds and trained doctors to contain the situation and everything is under control.”

Briefing reporters on the Covid-19 situation, principal secretary health Amit Mohan Prasad said: “So far, 175 suspected cases have been identified in UP. Of these, 158 tested negative. Of the remaining 17, five from Agra have tested positive. Samples of the patient from Ghaziabad have also been sent to NIV Pune. The samples of remaining 11 persons have been sent to KGMU Lucknow for tests and the reports are awaited.”

Claiming that there was no need to panic, director, communicable diseases, Mithlesh Chaturvedi said: “In wake of positive cases in Agra and Ghaziabad, the state has changed its strategy from ‘disease prevention’ to ‘disease containment’. As a result, within 24 hours of identification of Agra cases, 66 contacts were tracked and tested, possible second line contact bases — such as factory owned by the Covid-19 positive patient, schools in which his children studied and 3km radius of his residence – were sanitised.”

Citing the WHO China joint commission report on Coronavirus, health officials urged people not to panic.

“The infectivity rate of coronavirus is much lower than that of measles. While Covid-19 can affect 2.5 persons, measles affects 16 persons. Likewise, the mortality rate of coronavirus is less than 0.2% which is much lower than that for SARS. Prevention can help in keeping all trouble away,” she said.

Vijayawada: Road Transport Authority (RTA) has pulled up JC Uma Reddy and C Gopal Reddy (both family members of JC Diwakar Reddy’s brother JC Prabhakar Reddy) for attempting to pass off Bharat Standard (BS) III vehicles illegally registered at in Nagaland as BS-IV vehicles using fake documents. The vehicles were transferred to Anantapur and sold. RTA officials suspect the role of department officials in the scam.

RTA has identified 156 BS-III trailer lorries operating in southern India against Supreme Court guidelines. Of the vehicles, 29 trucks were registered in Anantapur as BS-IV vehicles. RTA officials seized 23 vehicles and are working on seizing the rest to cancel their registration. The RTA officials have asked the police to register criminal cases against the fraudsters.

Joint commissioner of Transport SAV Prasad Rao (Vigilance and Road Safety Committee) on Thursday said RTA received a complaint from a person saying 66 trucks of Ashok Leyland plying in Anantapur and a few other parts of Rayalaseema region were not BS-IV compliant. The BS-III trucks were illegally registered in Nagaland and moved to Tadipatri of Anantapur district with a no objection certificate (NOC) from Nagaland.

Using the chassis and engine numbers of the 66 trucks, we cross-checked with Ashok Leyland in January. The company revealed the trucks had been sold as scrap as they were unregistrable and no-records were uploaded onto the Vahan Portal (National Vehicle Portal). When we dug out the permanent and temporary address of the persons (owners of the vehicles) in Nagaland, the signature on the registration documents pertained to JC Uma Reddy and C Gopal Reddy, representing C Gopal Reddy and Company and Jatadhara Industries Private Limited with headquarters at Tadipatri

The 66 vehicles were re-registered in Andhra Pradesh and sold to several people. The owners of the vehicles incurred profits by selling BS-III scrap as BS-IV original vehicles, Prasad Rao added.

“As per the apex court directive, from April 1, 2017, BS-III vehicles are not to be registered. Suspecting the scam could be bigger, we formed a special team to dig deeper into the scam and found that apart from the 66 vehicles, 88 more BS-III vehicles were registered as BS-IV vehicles, including 29 vehicles registered in Anantapur district,” Prasad Rao added.

JC Uma Reddy and C Gopal Reddy allegedly offered money to buyers to not to approach the police.

QUEPEM: After mounting public criticism over the move to impose property tax on rented rooms and houses, the Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) has decided to call for a council meeting to review its earlier resolution.

TOI had reported on February 29 that residents of Quepem had fiercely opposed payment of property tax after the QMC issued notices to hundreds of them directing that they pay up arrears from 2016 to 2020.

A large group led by former chairperson Tereza Travasso had marched to deputy chief minister and local MLA Chandrakant Kavalekar ’s residence on Wednesday, urging him to direct QMC chairperson Dayesh Naik to relax property tax on rented houses.

Kavalekar subsequently called for a meeting with Naik on Thursday and requested him to review the issue. At least 150 residents from different wards were also present at the meeting.

Naik later told TOI that he would hold a special council meeting immediately to revoke the May 23, 2017 resolution regarding the imposition of property tax. “As we are facing financial crises, the deputy chief minister has promised us that government funds will be allocated to us to meet our expenditure. Hence, we will revoke our earlier decision,” he said.

The number of local tourists has also gone down from 16,451 in 2019 to 11,766 this year.

“There are school examinations and Holi during this time, so local tourists dip. But this year, the coronavirus threat has decreased number of tourists, especially foreign ones,” said a guide wearing mask at Bara Imambara, requesting anonymity.

Meanwhile, Agra administration started thermal screening of foreign tourists at Taj Mahal with hand-held devices on Thursday, even as the number of tourists has dipped.

The screening is being done at the east gate parking area.

With large gatherings seen as being high risk, big and small events alike are being cancelled by the hour.Like Mariah Carey cancelling her Hawaii concert or the new James Bond movie release being postponed, Indian artistes too are either unwilling to fly abroad or are being denied visas for having earlier visited virus-suspect countries. As a result, events are being cancelled or postponed, and associated businesses such as sound and lighting, venues and security are taking a hit. The industry expects this sorry state to prevail for three months at least.Dev Bhatia of artiste management and booking agency Unmute posted on his social media page: “Right, so to everyone working in the live events industry (or any industry), brace yourselves for the impact of the #CoronaVirus outbreak and good luck for managing the losses our businesses are going to incur. Stay strong!”Bhatia told TOI that in the past 72 hours, he had only heard of cancellations and estimated that around 80 events across India had been withdrawn. “If the coronavirus spread is not contained in the next 15-20 days, one can expect events for next three months to be cancelled or postponed,” he said. “This will impact not only the artiste management agencies, but also venues, service providers, sound and illumination companies and host destinations.”Among major events nullified are FDCI’s Fashion Week, a music festival in Hyderabad and Holi Moo, the Holi festival in Delhi featuring music from India and abroad. Ardaman Dua of Nightvibe, a company that curates international artiste tours and Indian music festivals, worried about gig cancellations. He has seen friends in the industry posting cancellation notices for half of around 20 performances planned for the next two months. “Cancellation impacts our livelihood,” Dua asserted.Holi is a major time for day parties, and vendors involved with floral and fabric décor and the local halwais undertaking the catering are caught in a sudden slump. A fabricator who invested heavily to decorate almost 25 venues in the city has seen all the events being cancelled. His associate, a caterer who was banking on the festival season, is also feeling the pinch. “People are scared even to host family functions this year,” he rued.For restaurateurs like Umang Tewari of Big Fish Ventures, which runs multiple outlets known for their music and late-night parties, the coming weekend will be the first big test after the news of a growing number of people testing positive for the novel coronavirus in India . “We will get to know the impact on the venues this weekend,” he said. “So far, the sentiment has certainly been impacted, but we are doing everything within our control to maintain the standards of hygiene to reassure our clientele.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74504537,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-244737,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/event-industry-eateries-face-the-music/articleshow/74502053.cms

MYSURU: The state budget presented by chief minister BS Yediyurappa received a mixed response as no new major projects have been announced for any districts of south interior Karnataka . Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has been allocated Rs 148 crore, while Rs 40 crore has been proposed for the Shivamogga City Corporation .

Other big announcements for the region include Rs 500 crore for the development of Jog falls and local tourism circuit infrastructure development, two tribal medicine units in Mysuru and Shivamogga, a health and wellness cluster in Shivamogga and upgrading the brail printing unit in Mysuru and Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS).

Mysuru district will receive Rs 1,391.2 crore for various schemes to be implemented at zilla panchayat, taluk panchayat and gram panchayat . levels.

MLA Haratalu Halappa said that under the Rs 500 grants, various tourist destinations of the region will be developed including the Jog Falls in the next three years.

But what has disappointed one and all is there is no announcement of any new projects. C Narayana Gowda , president of the Hotel Owners’ Association, said that the budget has come as a big shock. “There is nothing for Mysuru city in the budget. Film City has been moved out. There is no proposal of rope way and auditorium of international standard. We are really disappointed,” he said.

LUCKNOW: Panic buying of N95 respirators in the city amid a global coronavirus outbreak has triggered a crisis of these special masks that block tiny airborne particles and offer fair protection against disease-causing microbes.

A TOI reality check in Hazratganj, Gomtinagar, Kaiserbagh, Bhoothnath, Chowk, Niralanagar and Lalbagh on Thursday revealed hand sanitisers are flying off shelves as quickly as the masks. Home hoarding and eroding supply at wholesale markets are encouraging price-gouging by those who still have masks and sanitisers in stock.

Medical stores in Indiranagar conceded that they had run out of N95 respirators, which are sold for Rs 200 to Rs 500, while hand sanitisers were in short supply. “We turned back 50 customers today,” said Sanjay, who owns a store.

The situation in Gomtinagar was no different. Crisis of masks and sanitisers has prompted wholesalers to jack up prices, complained retailers. “There has been massive overnight sales, leading to the crunch. Prices of N95 masks range from Rs 150 to Rs 300,” said the owner of a pharmacy near RML hospital.

A pharmacy proprietor in Patrakarpuram observed lack of public awareness had triggered the panic buying. The N95 mask is designed to block at least 95% of 0.3 micron test particles.

Pharmacies told TOI that raw materials for masks were imported from China and since the outbreak, many factories had shut down. With reprieve not in sight, respirators are selling for a premium in the grey market.

Any staff member, be it security, service, kitchen or delivery, with the slightest of flu symptoms needs to be off duty and to return when fully fit. These are some of the clear instructions that a popular restaurant chain has issued to its staff. With people concerned at the spread of the novel coronavirus , allaying the fears of diners is of paramount importance to restaurants.The restaurant, which did not want to be identified, said it is routine practice to change the tablecloth, napkins and cutlery after a meal. But guests now expect the whole to be disinfected too, and eateries have to show their commitment to hygiene by doing this in front of diners.With Covid-19 an ever-present threat, diners are avoiding stepping out for ‘non-essential’ activities, and dining out appears to be a big casualty. Businessman Vivek Mehta who had a busy weekend schedule of birthdays, house warming and Holi parties to attend has been getting cancellation updates from hosts. No one in his social circle, Mehta reveals, is taking chances, no matter how reputed the venue of a gathering.Restaurants and hotels do not admit this in open, but privately concede to a dip in customers since the first case of Covid-19 in India was confirmed. Business during the week was down 20-25% at some outlets, said their owners. Wariness about packaging and food hygiene has also forced people to curb ordering in. The company spokesperson for Zomato assured, “We are working with our delivery and restaurant partners to ensure proper precautions.”Chef Shamsul Wahid of Social and Smoke House Deli said strict hygiene procedures were being followed in all the outlets across India. International procurement of ingredients such as meats and cheese has been stopped, food is cooked to 75-80 degrees Celsius, the kitchen is sanitised and disinfected, and hand sanitisers are easily available for both guests and staff. “We are ensuring steaks, lamb racks and fish dishes are well-done, and staff maintain the best hand hygiene while guaranteeing everything on the premises is disinfected,” Wahid elaborated.Food courts and malls too aren’t taking chances. Jaideep Bhandari of Bhandari Infra, which has food courts at a metro station and a mall, has issued strict instructions to tenants in Janpath, Connaught Place and Kalkaji on hygiene. At his establishments, additional hand-wash stations have been installed and hand sanitisers at within an arm’s reach.

A woman’s car was stuck at Kartarpura nullah. She was rescued by a passer-by. Heavy flow of water at Kartarpura nullah had claimed three lives in the past after which a railing was installed. However, it still seems inadequate given the low height of the bridge which makes it prone to waterlogging during rain. JDA has issued an advisory that residents must not cross the nullah to prevent any mishap.

Many places faced severe waterlogging. District administration sent machines to pump out the water.

“We received complaints from areas around Kartarpura nullah, Civil Lines and Brahmpuri after which the JMC team was alerted. We have our control rooms and JMC also has its flood control team. All the complaints were resolved later on,” said collector Joga Ram.

JMC officials said that there are three flood control rooms in the city functioning from the fire stations at Mansarovar, Ghat Gate and Bani Park. They are prepared for rains.

There are around 867 small drains and 20 nullahs in the city. JMC officials had claimed that cleaning of all the drains had been completed. However, Thursday’s rain watered down their assurances.

JAIPUR: A governing council meeting of the Rajasthan State Flying School was held on Thursday. The council has decided to reopen the school at Sanganer in city.

The meeting was held under the chairmanship of chief minister Ashok Gehlot . It was decided that the school would be reopened under public-private partnership (PPP) mode. The move would not only help use of air strips but also provide opportunities in the aviation sector.

Gehlot said that 19 air strips were available in the state. These strips would be strengthened and the government would explore all opportunities in the aviation sector.

The CM also directed to take full advantage of the regional connectivity scheme Udaan to invite major airline operators and explore possibilities of air connectivity with major cities in the state. He suggested to explore the possibility of relaunching intra-state air service which would boost the tourism sector.

Officials said that at present the flying school has two planes and a motor glider to train aspiring pilots. “The flying school has a Cessna 172 four-seater plane and Cessna 152 two-seater plane. The school plans to add two more planes soon,” said an official.

As per the plan, a batch of 20 students would be given admission initially, officials said. The flying school hit headlines in 2008 when ACB exposed a scam in which one of the trainees of the school Nidhi Vashishtha approached the agency claiming that she was trained only for 22 hours whereas the chief flying officer Mahendra Chaudhary had mentioned 169 hours of flying in the school record and sent it to DGCA .

During investigation, it was revealed that 14 pilots had been issued flying certificates through dubious means by chief flying inspector of the school. These certificates were used by the pilots to get commercial pilot licences (CPL) from DGCA. Similar arrests were made in Delhi and Haryana too.

I couldn’t find N95 mask in the market and am making do with a surgical one, as something is better than nothing,” Sharma said. “You can’t avoid crowds during office hours...I hold my breath for as long as I can whenever someone sneezes or coughs,” she said. “Also, I use a sanitiser immediately after getting out of the metro station.”Like Sharma, several other commuters can be seen wearing masks of all types, shapes and sizes — and the number of people covering their nose and mouth with handkerchiefs and dupattas is almost as high.“It is not unusual to find many metro users wearing masks during winters when the air quality dips in Delhi. But this time, it’s different,” said Ramesh Ahuja, a Sheikh Sarai resident. “I’m avoiding touching common surfaces, such as handrails, elevator switches, handles (hand grips), poles etc, to avoid any kind of infection,” he said.Avinash Mathur, a Dilshad Colony resident, is, in fact, practising travelling without taking his hands out of the trouser pockets, except while using the smart card. “I look for a corner in the train that I can lean on without the need to touch a pole or a handle. But it is not always possible when the train is crowded,” he said.Shilpi Kumar, a Laxmi Nagar resident, has stopped boarding trains that are crowded even if it means being late to work. “My office is in south Delhi and I can’t afford an auto-rickshaw or a cab ride every day,” she said. “I avoid touching any surface that others might have touched,” she said.The Blue Line, which is the busiest in the city and sees a daily footfall of 16 lakh, saw a thin crowd on Thursday. A group of women who got in from Janakpuri East Metro station was surprised to manage seats. However, they could be heard talking about going for alternative means of travel. “I will surely be spending a little more on cabs than I usually do than when I travel by metro, but then at least I will not have to worry about catching the infection,” said Sakshi Tanwar, a 32-year-old woman heading to Tagore Garden.Another passenger, Arpita, who wore a mask and entered the metro station at Rajouri Garden, said she didn’t have the means to afford a personal mode of transport. “I can only ensure that I take all steps to not catch the flu. I will be extra cautious,” she said.For its part, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is taking several precautionary measures. A DMRC spokesperson said they had increased the frequency of cleaning the premises and the trains. Metro is also running do’s and dont’s instruction in English and Hindi on digital screens at busy stations, such as Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Central Secretariat, Chandni Chowk and New Delhi.“In the wake of identification of a few cases of coronavirus in recent days by the authorities in Delhi-NCR, Delhi Metro has decided to undertake several measures.

JAIPUR: For some, it was a day of fun as they happily clicked pictures of the unseasonal rain and hailstorm on their phones on Thursday while the commuters had a harrowing time.

Many colonies witnessed heavy waterlogging . At least 5-6 people in a car got trapped on the underpass at Sudarshanpura . They were rescued by the public.

Heavy rain lashed the city at 3pm and lasted for over an hour. It started from Ajmer road and spread to Vaishali Nagar, Jhotwara and adjoining colonies. In a span of 30 minutes, it covered entire Jaipur.

At many places, people were surprised to see pellet-sized hailstones. They started clicking pictures and making videos to upload on their social media accounts.

Interestingly, a fruit seller at Johari Bazaar collected the hailstones and displayed them at his cart claiming they were for sale too.

Majority of the city roads were flooded after the rain that made commuting chaotic in the evening. Tonk Road, Statue Circle, Janpath, SMS Highway and Kalwar Road witnessed waterlogging.

Jaipur received a rainfall of almost 20mm. Hailstones accumulated at various parks in city.

“My son had never seen hailstorm, today he did,” said Shalini Sharma, a homemaker at Bapu Nagar.

The sudden rainfall also guided the mercury to take a dip. After a brief warm spell, people were seen swaddled in woollens again.

During evening, many people, especially youngsters, came out on bikes to enjoy the weather. The Jaipur Met office has predicted more rain and hailstorm in the next 24 hours in city.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has issued an order to probe the alleged leak of the CAG report which had criticized the police department on a host of issues. Though the order said that an inquiry team was constituted, the details of the team was not mentioned.

Earlier in the day, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the assembly that the home department will probe the alleged leak. Though speaker P Sreeramakrishnan had said before the commencement of assembly session that the report was not leaked before it was tabled in the assembly, the chief minister was of the view that it had been leaked.

The CAG report’s findings that bullets and rifles were missing in the police department had stoked a controversy.

Chief secretary Tom Jose had given a statement that the details of CAG report might have been leaked before the report was submitted in the assembly.

“There are doubts about details of CAG report getting leaked before it was tabled in assembly. Normally, media and others access such reports after they are tabled in the assembly. Now, doubts have risen that a few details were leaked,” he had said.

Meanwhile, Pinarayi Vijayan had said in the assembly that the government had taken up the issue. “It is a document that is part of the assembly. It is a fact that CAG report, which was to be tabled in the Assembly, was leaked. It is not a healthy practice,” he had said.

BIHARSHARIF/PATNA: A government doctor was shot dead in Nalanda on Thursday while he was on his way to a primary health centre on a motorbike.

The deceased is a close relative of former Harnaut JD(U) MLA Sunil Kumar.

“Dr Priyaranjan Kumar Priyadarshi’s bike was intercepted around 11am by some miscreants who were also on bikes and they pumped four bullets into his chest.

He was on way to Gokul Math additional primary health centre (APHC) under Rahui block of the district,” a police officer said.

As soon as the news spread, doctors suspended work at Biharsharif sadar hospital and other government hospitals. Many doctors rushed to the hospital to express solidarity with the family of the deceased doctor.

Nalanda SP Nilesh Kumar, who reached the spot, said it was too early to say anything on the incident. The SP along with Biharsharif SDPO Imran Perwez and other police officers were at the spot and shifted the body to Biharsharif Sadar hospital for post mortem.

The deceased doctor, who was a native of Nosra village under Noorsarai block in Nalanda, is survived by his wife and an eight-year-old son Tanmoy.

Former MLA Sunil Kumar told TOI that the doctor lived at his in-law's house in Naisarai locality under Bihasharif Town police station area. “The doctor was a thorough gentleman and he had no animosity with anyone,” the former MLA said when asked about possible cause of his murder.

Doctors across the state are agitated over the daylight murder. As soon as the news of Dr Priyadarshi’s murder reached Patna , Bihar state unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) called an emergent meeting to discuss the situation.

The meeting, presided over by IMA state president Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, strongly condemned the cold-blooded murder of Dr Priyadarshi. “We have urged the state government to ensure the arrest of the assailants within 72 hours, otherwise the IMA would be compelled to announce a state-wide agitation to press for arrest of the killers,” IMA state secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said.

Agitated over the murder, a number of government and private doctors and relatives of the deceased blocked Patna-Ranchi main road near Hospital Mor for around an hour in the evening and demanded the arrest of the criminals besides a government job for the widow of the deceased and a compensation of Rs 2 crore to the family. They lifted the blockade after Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh assured them of all possible help.

Angry over the incident, Nalanda district IMA president Dr Shyam Bihari Singh said the law and order has completely collapsed in the state.

They also said the approval of the irrigation department authorities has not been taken.

The group has demanded that building permissions in these areas be revoked. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should stop allotting completion certificates, building permissions and plinth completion for structures here.

“The GIS-based flood lines are different than the original prepared and handed over to PMC,” Sarang Yadwadkar, an environmentalist, said at a press conference on Thursday.

City engineer Prashant Waghmare said, “The development plan was handed over to the state government by the PMC for completion. The state government has completed it,” he said.

The activists have written to the commissioner’s office. The letter states that on November 4, 2016, the flood line maps based on GIS data were prepared and handed over to PMC by the irrigation department.

According to the state government resolution, the letter says, “The chief engineer (of the irrigation department) is to approve the flood zone and flood line maps. The powers to approve such flood zones and flood line maps should not be delegated to any officer below the rank of chief engineer.”

“As per our information, these maps were not supported by any approval letter of the chief engineer of the irrigation department. Even so, these GIS-based flood lines are incorporated in Pune city’s development plan maps,” Yadwadkar said.

He said the PMC was apprised of the GIS-based flood lines being different from the original flood lines prepared and handed over to PMC on March 5, 2011. In spite of repeated reminders, no heed was paid by PMC.

“We want the correct flood lines prepared and updated in the DP . It is a matter of life and death for citizens, who are going to live along the riverside. We will urge the elected members and civic officials to work on this. We will also approach the courts,” Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh has a national share of over 13% of the most “investment-worthy” projects listed on the India Investment Grid (IIG), a central government initiative which lists investment opportunities in 25 sectors across all states and Union territories in the country.

State industries minister Satish Mahana on Thursday said that interest in investing in UP had also risen sharply over last year, going up by 18.6%. “Growing interest in investment can be understood by MoUs which the government signs and proposals for industries among others,” Mahana said. He added that monitoring of projects had also gone up by 51% and these together would help provide employment to around 30,000 youth.

“We have held one investors’ summit and two groundbreaking ceremonies. We are also preparing to hold an international investors summit later this year. I am personally monitoring progress of projects and MoUs and this has instilled confidence among investors,” Mahana said.

The minister said that the IIG listed projects were operating in 68 districts out of 75. The top five countries which have been actively in touch with the government over investment in the state include the US, Canada, Japan, Indonesia and China.

“As a result of the successful implementation of reforms recommended by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, UP is now an ‘achiever state’ and was ranked 12th in 2018. We are already providing 125 services through Nivesh Mitra, the state government’s digital single window system for investors through which we have already issued 1 lakh approvals.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress MLA V T Balram has levelled allegations of corruption against Industries minister E P Jayarajan pointing out that Coconics laptops being marketed as Kerala’s own product was that of a private company, in which Keltron’s stake was just 26%.

Taking part in the discussion on demand for grants for the industries department in the assembly on Thursday, the Congress legislator also alleged that the shifting of industries and mining and geology director K Biju from the post was to approve more number of quarries in the state.

“The company is actually in the private sector with 51% stake (49% for UST Global and 2% a startup company), while KSIDC has 23% share. And this company is just an assembling unit of a Chinese laptop manufacturer,” he said.

However, during his reply, the minister said it was the UDF rule which paved way for the downfall of Keltron and that the LDF government will bring it back to its past glory. “The allegation with regard to Coconics laptop is baseless,” he said.

The minister also said that mining and geology director was removed from the post as he got appointed as LSGD special secretary. “The government has not given approval for any quarry after his removal from the post. The report saying that there is a move to hand over mineral sand mining to private sector is also wrong,” he added. tnn

So far, the SSG Hospital (SSGH) at Vadodara was the only treatment centre for suspected virus-infected patients.

SSGH hospital had prepared an isolation ward with 12 beds to treat serious COVID-19 cases. It also had an additional ward with 60 cases for treatment of cases of the disease that were not very serious.

Now, the Godhra civil hospital has also prepared a 10-bedded ward to treat any possible COVID-19 cases. Officials of the district administration in Panchmahal held meetings with health department officials to discuss preparedness for the disease.

188,['6/03/2020'],"Telangana and Andhra Pradesh apex church body rejects CAA, NRC, NPR","HYDERABAD: Federation of Telugu Churches, an apex body of Bishops and church heads of all denominations in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, rejected the ‘present process of CAA , NPR and NRC’.

The annual general body of the federation on March 3 at St John’s regionals seminary at Ramanthapur has made a resolution asking people to reject CAA, NPR and NRC and warned of ‘inherent dangers’ in it.

“We demand the state and central governments to stop the whole process until the threats and fears are allayed. Proper assurances and amended are needed, and required guarantees are to be put in place,” said Father Dr Anthoniraj Thumma, the executive secretary of the federation.

FTC outrightly rejected the manner in which the processes are proposed to be implemented at present with latest amendments and additions to their enumeration forms unlike in the past. “We understand that they are closely linked, one leading to the other as part of one process, creating fear among citizens. This has lead to violent protests all over our country, and resulting in some States like UP and Delhi in many deaths and lot of destruction,” the resolution said.

“Citizenship Amendment Act links citizenship with religion for the first time, treating Muslims differently from other religions, violating the right to equality and secularism enshrined in our Constitution. Hence, Muslims across India rightly feel threatened as it will be easier now to label them illegal under NRC. This will lead to unequal citizenship to which any other religious or caste communities can easily be added in the future. While we welcome citizenship to persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries, this should be done without excluding anyone and irrespective of one's religious or ideological affiliations,” Dr Thumma said.

Replying to a submission by Aluva MLA Anwar Sadat in this regard, the minister said that as per the judgment of the high court in its order on June 6, 2017, those who have purchased paddy land after August 12, 2008 (when the Kerala conservation of paddy land and wetland act, 2008 came into force) will not be eligible for the exception provided under section 9 (1) of the act.

As per the section three of the act, the owner of a paddy land should not undertake any activity for the conversion and reclamation of the land, unless in accordance with the provisions of the act. However, the section 9 (1) of the act gives an exception and says that the district collector can constitute a committee that can consider the applications for reclamation of paddy land for the construction of houses. It also says that such a reclamation cannot be more than five cents in municipalities and 10 cents in panchayats.

The minister said that the advocate general has informed the government that unless an amendment in the act is brought about, the verdict of the high court will hold.

The act allows for reclamation of paddy land under section 9 (1) with four conditions. It says that such a conversion should be allowed only if it will not affect the ecological condition and cultivation in the adjoining paddy land, the owner of the paddy land does not own any other suitable land for constructing a house in that district, the building is constructed for his own purpose and the land to be filled is not surrounded by paddy lands on all sides.

Pimpri Chinchwad: A two-month old female leopard cub, found at Nirgude village in Junnar taluka on Monday morning, was reunited with its mother the same night.

Nirgude village is located 5-6km from Hunnar town of Junnar and around 98km from Pune.

Aptale round officer Shashikant Madake said, “The cub had wandered out of a thicket while sugar cane was being harvested on a field around 10.30am. The field-owner and the sugar cane cutters spotted the animal and informed the forest department.”

The leopard rescue centre (LRC) at Manikdoh declared the cub fit for release after conducting a thorough medical examination.

LRC veterinary assistant Mahendra Dhore said, “The cub was too young to survive on her own in the wild. We decided to reunite her with her mother the same night.”

The leopard cub was kept in a safe box at the same spot where she was found. “The mother leopard stealthily came and took the cub away with her around 10.30pm,” he said.

Sugar cane is the main crop grown in Nirgude and surrounding villages. Sugar cane fields provide ideal hiding place for leopards, a forest department official said.

193,['6/03/2020'],"After 2 months, tiger claims 5th victim","Chandrapur: A fresh tiger kill in Rajura forest range has jolted the forest department as it has happened after a gap of over two months. One Maroti Tekam of Chunala village was killed in the tiger attack. His body was found on Saturday morning.

Chandrapur forest division CCF SV Ramarao suspects that the tiger, which made four earlier kills in Rajura and the adjacent Virur range, had claimed its fifth victim. Forest officials are trying to confirm the identity the killer tiger.

Ramarao said that tranquilizing orders for the problem tiger is already issued and forest teams are out to capture it.

Sources informed that Tekam had gone to collect firewood on Friday afternoon when the tiger attacked him in revenue survey no. 336 in the outskirts of the forest. As Tekam did not return home in the evening, his kin and villagers started searching but failed to trace him.

Tekam’s body was found on Saturday morning. On getting information, RFO Videshkumar Galgat reached the spot and shifted the body for post mortem.

There was brief tension in the village following the incident. Forest officials have given a ex gratia aid of Rs 1 lakh to the kin of Tekam.

The tiger attacks in Rajura range have been happening since the last 14 months. A tiger made the first kill on January 18, 2019 in Khambada forest under Rajura range. Later, it killed two persons in November and December 2019 in Rajura range and in January 2020 in adjacent Virur range.

After it was confirmed that the same tiger was responsible for the human kills, the forest department here moved an application for its capture. The same tiger had also killed more than 25 cattle in the area during the same period. Forest officials have installed camera traps to identify the tiger.

“PCCF (wildlife) had granted permission for capturing the problem tiger in January. However, it has been eluding our teams,” said Ramarao adding that the efforts would be intensified now.

This is the sixth human kill in Chandrapur this year so far. Earlier, wild animals had killed 23 people in Chandrapur district during 2019. 20 of them are tiger victims. Two other were killed by leopards and one by an elephant.

LUCKNOW: UP power minister Shrikant Sharma on Thursday said the power transmission capacity of the state grew by 8000MW in the past three years of Yogi government. Presiding over a review meeting, Sharma said the transmission capacity jumped from 16,500MW in 2016-17 to 24,500MW at present.

Sharma said the high transmission capacity will allow the government to bear the peak demand electricity load of upto 24,500MW. The high transmission capacity would be a great boost to UP where high load often results in prolonged power outages.

Also, the total transmission capacity — indicative of power import load from outside the state — has been increased from 8,700 MW to 13,400MW. “Under power for all, the state government has completed construction of 92 new transmission sub-stations at an estimated cost of over Rs 8,800 crore,” he said.

In the wake of the upcoming summer season, the department has ordered completion of 20 underconstruction transmission sub-stations by March end, said Sharma.

In order to fix responsibility of the regional officers of the UPPCL for bringing down the alarming transmission and distribution losses in the state and for correct billing, will also tour all over the state from March 11.

Sharma told TOI said that to ensure the March 31 deadline for drastic improvement in every department of the UPPCL, mainly the implementation of phase II of the Saubhagya scheme, lodging of criminal cases against tainted contractors and faulty billing agencies, he would hold meetings at the divisional headquarters.

Gairsain: A day after CM Trivendra Singh Rawat announced Gairsain as the summer capital of Uttarakhand, the issue remained on everybody's lips.

From residents to opposition Cong and even the BJP, all were busy either discussing or commenting on the pros and cons of the long-pending decision.

While most residents welcomed the move, some said that with little infrastructure, there is a possibility that Gairsain will be nothing but a picnic spot for legislators for the next few years.

Sudama Singh, 65, a resident of Gairsain, said, “Though it is a start, it would have been better if the government had made it a permanent capital.”

Echoing similar sentiments, Arvind Gaur , a local shop owner, said that people are quick to take credit. “A number of officials use these broken roads of Gairsain but no one has even talked about repairing them. Be it the Congress or the BJP, people have suffered in the tenure of both parties. Gairsain has a small community health centre and for even small matters, patients are referred to Karanprayag and Gopeshwar. Our sufferings have continued,” he said.

Meanwhile, before starting proceedings on Thursday, the CM along with other BJP MLAs celebrated with the local residents.

However, the move didn’t go down well with the opposition Congress who slammed the CM for wearing a garland inside the assembly premises. This led to a heated exchange of words between urban development minister Madan Kaushik and Congress state chief Pritam Singh.

Former CM Harish Rawat , too, jumped in saying that “another temporary capital has been decided for a state that already has a temporary capital”.

He said, “This decision has come from a government which is in panic. Dehradun is already a temporary capital and now they have announced Gairsain as summer capital. So my question is that where they are planning to build the capital?”

Also, a section of the saffron camp in Uttarakhand was taken aback by the CM’s decision to announce Gairsain as the summer capital alleging that no one — core committee, MPs, MLAs and senior leadership — was kept in the loop.

Responding to a query if the CM’s decision was backed by the BJP central leadership, Shyam Jaju, BJP state in-charge, said, “This question has to be answered by the CM only.”

Another BJP leader in Dehradun said, “Declaring a place as the summer capital involves a lot of spadework and consultations with central leadership which has not taken place as of now.”

Raut was categorical in saying that Ram temple has never been at the core of ideology of Congress or NCP though we formed the government with them in Maharashtra. “Which is why only Shiv Sena ministers, MLAs and MPs would be accompanying Uddhavji when he visits Ayodhya,” he said.

RAJKOT: Rajkot Congress is gearing up to meet the challenges of the upcoming municipal corporation election scheduled to be held in November this year.

The party held a meeting on Wednesday where it decided to appoint 380 coordinators in 18 wards and also start new member registration online.

The city unit of the party also decided to appoint two ‘ Jan Mitras ’ — male and female — in each ward and train them about the ideology of the Congress and the party’s contribution in nation building.

Rajkot city Congress president Ashok Dangar said, “These ‘Jan Mitras’ will go door to door to spread the ideology of the party and convey to the voters why they should vote for the party.”

The co coordinators will also help in organizing booth-level activity including maintaining voters list and preparing unresolved issues in each ward.

Congress won 34 seats out of 72 in 2015 election when the Patidar reservation agitation was in its peak. Meanwhile, the ruling BJP has asked the state government to merge five surrounding villages with Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) before the election.

Addressing a talk on CAA and NRC here on Thursday, he said Owaisi, being a lawyer himself, was instigating Muslims. “CAA is not against any Indian citizen, but he is instigating people,” he said.

He faulted Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi for opposing NPR and NRC and said Delhi riots was the handiwork of Congress.

BJP state president K Laxman, who was at the meeting, said CM K Chandrasekhar Rao was opposing NPR only out of facing a backlash from his party’s ally, AIMIM. “TRS says it is opposing CAA as it does not include Muslim refugees.

Pune: Noted painter Milind Mulick said on Thursday that awareness about art was low among people as compared to music for which the education system was responsible to some extent.

He was interacting with Milind Kulkarni as part of the Katta Unplugged segment of the Amstrad Times Celebrate Pune festival powered by Phoenix Marketcity, co-sponsored by Sankla Buildcon. The interaction was held at Art2Day gallery.

“It has always been easier for music to reach people due to the advent of radio in the early ages and then through other mediums of entertainment . Art, painting or drawing do not fall under the ambit of popular entertainment. The education system is responsible for this to some extent. Pune and Maharashtra have a tradition of water colour painting. In fact, Maharashtra and West Bengal have two styles or gharanas of water painting,” said Mulick, a noted water colour artist.

Mulick learnt the ropes of the trade from his father and noted painter Pratap Mulick . But instead of taking up a painting course for his undergraduate studies, he completed engineering from the College of Engineering Pune.

Speaking about the unrealistic expectation of parents who sometimes come to enquire about courses, Mulick said, “People expect immediate results. They don't understand that it is an ever-improving field of work and requires patience. You can learn the skills, but you need practice to improve.” Taking a dig at minimalism, Mulick said, “I am not against minimalism. But to understand minimalism, you need expertise and experience in conventional painting. Without that, just drawing something and calling it minimalism is not right,” said Mulick.

208,['6/03/2020'],"Coronavirus measures: Indian airports checking 80,000 international arrivals daily","NEW DELHI: Airports in India face the mammoth task of screening thousands of people who fly into the country, irrespective of where they are coming from, daily, and identifying those who display symptoms of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19).DGCA data shows 78.4 lakh people flew into India between January and March 2019, an average of more than 87,000 daily in that period. After factoring in flight cancellations and the scare, Indian airports could be looking at screening about 80,000 international arrivals daily with staff of the health ministry’s Airport Health Organisation (APHO).This screening means international arrivals may need to spend 30-40 minutes more before ‘çleared’ passengers leave airports.“Those with symptoms of the coronavirus will be sent to hospitals. Airlines have been asked to give self-declaration forms to passengers before landing. The thermal screeners being used can check four passengers in a minute. One counter can check about 200 passengers in an hour,” said a senior aviation official overseeing preparedness at airports.The Airports Authority of India (AAI) says 30 airports in the country get international flights. The major chunk of international flights is handled by the six metro airports. India’s busiest airport, Delhi’s IGI Airport, witnesses anywhere from 850 to 2,100 international passengers flying every hour during lean and peak hours.“The maximum rush is from 11pm to 3am when IGI Airport sees about 6,000 international arrivals from 35 flights in these four hours,” said Delhi airport sources.The second busiest airport, Mumbai, gets about 100 international flights daily.Are the airports and APHO prepared for the mammoth — and unprecedented — task at hand? “The maximum international passenger arrival is at the metro airports and Kerala ’s four airports also see a lot of daily traffic from the Gulf. States are chipping in with doctors and other medical support staff from their hospitals, apart from APHO people. Lakhs of self-declaration forms have been printed and all airlines have been asked to pick them up so that they can in a couple of days start giving them to passengers to fill up before the plane lands. While all passengers will be screened on arrival, those with a recent history of travel to some countries will be looked at closely,” said the official.How was Day One of screening all international arrivals? On Thursday itself a passenger tweeted to aviation minister H S Puri about flying into India and leaving the airport without being screened. Puri sought details from the passenger to examine what had happened.Since the order to screen all international arrivals was issued Wednesday, all stakeholders are rushing to make arrangements. For instance, a Mumbai airport official said: “We have set up adequate health counters in pre-immigration. APHO is manning at least four screening counters (at all times) and manning will be increased based upon passenger load. APHO has stationed 65 staff (doctor and paramedics), trained professionals, in three shifts at health counters to screen passengers. Additional screening staff are coming from the state government.”Mumbai airport hopes to have “minimal delay (read more time) in the time passengers spend at the airport after landing due to adequate staff and devices provided by APHO to expedite the screening process”.Bengaluru peak international arrivals are between 2am and 4.30am with 11 flights in those hours. “The screening takes a maximum of an additional 10 minutes for passengers,” said an official.An AAI official said: “Sufficient counters have been set up for screening the passengers at all international airports as per health ministry guidelines. There is a delay in exit time due to screening of passengers for Covid-19 at airports.”Hyderabad airport gets about 5,000 international arrivals daily. “The peak hour is 2am and 7pm, for an hour each, when we get about 1,000 international arrivals in that hour each,” said an official.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74502416,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-623773,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-airports-checking-80000-international-arrivals-daily/articleshow/74502414.cms

Justice Shircy V declined to grant anticipatory bail to 54-year-old Sajan John of Nooranadu in Alappuzha.

He is the sole accused in the crime registered by Kadavanthra police for criminal breach of trust and cheating. As per prosecution, Sajan approached the de facto complainant and offered seat for MBBS course for his son in University of Traditional Medicine at Armenia and received Rs 6.73 lakh. But he failed to arrange an MBBS seat, thereby cheating the de facto complainant, it is alleged.

A counsel representing the complainant had told the court that Rs 4.73 lakh was deposited to Sajan’s bank account and the balance was paid in cash.

The complainant’s son was taken by Sajan to Armenia and admitted in a coaching class and no MBBS seat was arranged. Thus, he lost one academic year and Rs 6.73 lakh, the court was told.

Sajan’s counsel argued that the petitioner has not received the amount allegedly paid by the complainant and that he has not cheated the complainant. The complainant’s son went to Armenia and attended a course for a month but he returned due to home sickness, the counsel submitted.

Senior public prosecutor CN Prabhakaran opposed the plea, contending that Rs 4.73 lakh has actually been deposited in Sajan’s account. A provisional admission letter was given to the complainant’s son but it was not for attending the MBBS course but a course so as to prepare for MBBS studies. It was only a tuition class or something like that which was arranged by Sajan, the prosecutor submitted.

Declining to grant anticipatory bail, the court said, “Considering the nature of the accusations… prima facie it appears that he has committed an offence as alleged by the prosecution. Since detailed probe is required, granting of pre-arrest bail may give an opportunity for him to abscond or otherwise misuse his liberty...”

KOZHIKODE: Town police recorded the statements of Jaspreet Singh ’s family members on Thursday. The final year degree student of Malabar Christian College had committed suicide on Sunday after being disqualified from writing exams following attendance shortage.

Town police, which registered a case of unnatural death in connection with the suicide, received a complaint from the family which said that the head of economics department, a lady teacher and principal of MCC were responsible for the suicide of Singh as they adopted an inconsiderate stand on the attendance issue.

They said Singh had 68% attendance (as against the required 75%) as the family had to go to Punjab following the demise of his grandmother. This was conveyed to the college, but due consideration was denied. Inspector A Umesh said that police will collect information from Calicut University (CU).

Meanwhile, the varsity’s students’ grievance cell will hold a hearing on March 9 to consider the complaint received from students regarding Singh’s disqualification.

The cell, which is a statutory body in CU to hear complaints of students, will hear the complaint and record statements of MCC principal. The cell has four syndicate members along with dean of students’ welfare as members.

Syndicate member K K Haneefa said that the panel would investigate whether Singh’s attendance was calculated properly and if any eligible relaxation in attendance was denied to the student.

Meanwhile, student protests over the issue continued at the college on the fourth day on Thursday with ABVP and Yuva Morcha taking out protest marches.

213,['6/03/2020'],Kochi: Legacy waste likely to be cleared in phased manner,"Representative image

KOCHI: The legacy waste which remains piled up at Brahmapuram has been polluting air, water and earth. So, after the takeover, the state government may take steps to clear the legacy waste in a phased manner and properly treat the garbage brought to the solid waste treatment plant on a daily basis.

According to a rough estimate prepared by Kochi Corporation , there is around one lakh metric tonne of waste stacked at the premises of the solid waste treatment plant. The National Green Tribunal (NGT), team, which had visited the plant premises several times following back-to-back incidents of fire outbreaks, had instructed the local body to take certain immediate measures to address the waste disposal issue.

As per the NGT order, the corporation had invited tenders for biomining the legacy waste. After retendering the work thrice, the local body selected a Tirupur-based company for carrying out biomining. The total cost of removing the legacy waste as per corporation’s proposal was around Rs 25 crore. The local body authorities watered down many of the conditions for bidders to qualify for taking part in the tender. Only then, the Tirupur-based firm became eligible for attending the tender process. Still, the private firm’s experience in the field is limited. Its role was that of a subcontractor in the treatment of solid waste at a municipality in Tamil Nadu.

Opposition councillors objected to the corporation’s attempt to entrust the work with the Tirupur-based firm, which they found as incompetent and ineligible. The opposition alleged corruption behind the deal.

A Pondicherry-based firm had offered to remove all the legacy waste without causing any financial burden on the corporation. The plan was to supply the waste collected to cement manufacturing companies.

University of Petroleum and Energy Studies had expressed willingness to set up a plant for generating fuel from the waste piled up at Brahmapuram. The corporation had to just provide 15,000 sq ft of land for setting up the plant. But the local body has not even responded to the proposal even after several months.

According to figures, in 2018, the total domestic passenger traffic stood at 78.92 lakh. Last year, the figure was 88.19 lakh.

When it comes to domestic cargo however, the airport handled 41,515 metric tonne of cargo in 2018, which increased by only 5,763 metric tonne last year.

In addition, the international passenger traffic of the airport recorded a slight dip in 2019. The airport had recorded 2.51 lakh international passengers in 2018, and 2.50 lakh in 2019.

Mumbai airport witnessed a significant drop of 4.5 lakh domestic passengers in 2018-19 as compared to the previous fiscal, the survey showed. At Nagpur airport, passenger traffic had gone up from 20.8 lakh to 26.9 lakh in a year. The increase was marginal at Aurangabad airport which saw 7,000 more flyers in 2018-19 as compared to the previous fiscal.

Sources at Pune airport said land unavailability was a problem. “While the domestic passenger traffic is good, we expected more international passengers. This was affected as many international flights from Pune were grounded last year, while there are no signs of new flights starting anytime soon,” the source said.

“The length of the runway has been a problem and things are not moving forward due to the land issues. This has hit cargo movement,” the source said.

A total of 33 acres of private land was promised for airport expansion. The previous airport director, Ajay Kumar, had said in January that they had been assured of 10 acres for the cargo handling facility. “The current international cargo hold’s location is a hindrance to the construction of the new terminal,” Kumar had said.

Around 114 metric tonne of international cargo was dispatched in 2019, compared to 51 metric tonnes in 2018. Airport director Kuldeep Singh, however, was not impressed by the over 100% increase. “Our plans to shift cargo operations from present location to new location have still not been finalized. I am sure if and when we get a new cargo complex, our operations will witness a huge a surge,” Singh said.

On Wednesday night, police arrested one Shahrukh from Bhilwara, the main accused who was behind the abduction, loot and rape of two people from Udaipur outskirts on Sunday night.

Accused Shahrukh and five others, including Fardeen, Chota Mewati, Moin and Pradeep, had stayed at the hotel from where they allegedly abducted the rape survivor and her ‘friend’ after a ‘deal’ went awry.

“Three women, including the rape survivor, lived in a room provided by Om Prakash Jain, the owner of Nakoda event management company, at his residence in Savina area. The company is actually an escort service that supplied girls to customers through online bookings,” a police officer associated with the case’s investigation said.

Shahrukh had ‘booked’ a girl for the night for two persons and a deal was struck for Rs 9,000, said police.

The rape survivor was taken to the hotel where the accused were staying by her ‘friend’ and agent-cum-driver.

When the ‘friend’ demanded an advance payment from the accused to let the woman go inside the hotel, a heated argument ensued.

One of the accused, Fardeen, then took out his gun and overpowered the ‘friend’ and got into the driver’s seat, said police. Three others too got into the same vehicle. The remaining accused followed them in a separate car. The two were taken to several places in and around the city and outskirts and sexually assaulted.

At Debari railway crossing, they stopped near a secluded plot where two accused raped her while Fardeen forced the ‘friend’ into having oral sex, said police.

Police took the complainants to the spot and the team found a used condom and other evidences which has been handed over to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for investigation.

The survivor told the police that the accused had stripped them both, made nude videos, blackmailed them and demanded Rs 2 lakh.

They snatched the woman’s gold chain and looted the cash they had in hand. In the morning after the accused released them, the survivor called Om Prakash who met her on the Thokar Choraha-Pratap Nagar road.

She narrated the entire incident to him and requested him to take her to the police station. But fearing his racket would be exposed, Om Prakash pacified her and asked her to go to her room and take medicines.

In the evening, the survivor forced both Om Prakash and her ‘friend’ to report the case. But they hid the facts from the police which came to light after the arrest of the accused.

The hotel room where the accused stayed was booked by Fardeen. Another accused Pradeep, son of Bhanwar Meghwal, was arrested on Monday and remanded to police custody.

SECUNDERABAD: A 22-year-old woman was nabbed by Malkajgiri police on Thursday for facilitating the marriage of a minor girl in December last year with a man involved in a theft case. Police arrested the woman based on the complaint of the victim’s mother.

The accused was identified as Kundella Nagamani from Bojagutta, Mehdipatnam. The victim’s parents from Hanuman Nagar colony, Moula Ali were in prison three months ago. During that time, they handed over the responsibility of their daughter and son to Nagamani and her husband, Sudhakar, who was known to the family.

While the couple was taking care of the children, the victim came in contact with Nagamani and Sudhakar’s friend, Venu Kumar (21) and Bharat (19), who were absconding while police were allegedly searching for them in a theft case.

The four, along with the victim initially travelled to Goa and then to Vijaywada to hide from cops. On December 23 last year, Nagamani and Sudhakar lured the victim, knowing that she is a minor and performed her marriage with Venu Kumar, who had developed a physical relationship with her.

They later went to Komaravelly but police brought Sudhakar, along with others to Jagadgirigutta, while Venu and Bharat surrendered themselves before KPHB police in January. Sudhakar, Venu and Bharat were sent to prison, while the victim was staying with Nagamani in Moula Ali, Secunderabad.

In February, when the victim’s mother was released from jail, she found out about her daughter’s marriage and approached the police. Subsequently, Nagamani was nabbed on Thursday and all were booked for harassment, rape , performing marriage ceremony fraudulently without lawful marriage and relevant sections of POCSO Act.

AYODHYA: Exactly a month after the Ram Mandir trust was set up by the Centre, a bank account was formally opened in the name of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust on Thursday afternoon at State Bank of India’s Ayodhya branch. The first deposit in the zero-balance current account will be from donations of the past 15 days in the collection box at the Ram Lalla makeshift temple.

The new account of the Trust will overtake the 27-year-old account in the SBI’s Faizabad branch, which was opened soon after the Babri demolition to deposit donations by pilgrims for the constructions of Ram Temple. “The old account operated by the divisional commissioner has a credit balance of Rs 10 crore. The money will be transferred to the new account after we receive documents exempting the Trust from income tax,” said Trust member Anil Mishra.

219,['6/03/2020'],Daily average of PMPML buses on roads up by just 25,"Pune: The average number of public transport buses out on the city’s roads increased by a meagre 25 in 2019, according to the state government’s economic survey report.

The data in the report, published on Thursday, show that on an average, 1,972 Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses were on the roads in 2019. The year before that, the number stood at 1,947.

Also, the report found that the average ridership in PMPML buses witnessed a slight dip. While 10.89 lakh people on average rode in PMPML buses in 2018, 54,000 fewer passengers used public transport buses last year.

A PMPML official said they consider the increase in the number of buses a silver lining. “Though the average number of buses on the roads has only slightly gone up, the fact that it has gone up is good news. New buses are being added to the fleet since mid-2019. At present, there 120 electric buses, with more set to arrive. The plan is to have an additional 350 electric buses by March 2020,” the official said.

“PMPML on average has 1,400-1,500 buses on roads per day, which is an improvement, considering that the number used to be 1,300 earlier,” another official said.

Last year’s survey showed that a daily average of 1,382 buses plied on the road in 2017. “It will take PMPML some time to fully revamp its services. On Bus Day, PMPML plies 1,800-1,900 buses, which shows that the transport body definitely has the capacity,” the transport body official added.

Sanjay Shitole of PMP Pravasi Manch, however, said that the drop in the number of passengers was worrisome. “They need a scientific approach which, unfortunately, isn’t there,” he said. “ An average 60-70 PMPML-owned break down every day. The buses also need to be on time,” Shitole pointed out.

“Novel steps are needed to increase the number of passengers travelling by bus,” a PMPML official conceded.

PMPML joint managing director Ajay Charthankar said people’s lack of confidence in PMPML was a major reason. “If we get old buses, the older buses are scrapped. So the fleet size doesn’t change. At 1,700, were are short by around 600 buses. This year, we plan to have more than 1,000 new buses and increase the fleet strength to 2,300,” he told TOI.

220,['6/03/2020'],Forged exam receipts scam busted in Junagadh,"cap

Rajkot: The first day of Class X and XII exams of the state school board began on a scandalous note on Thursday with Junagadh police busting a racket of using forged receipts to push in dummy writers for students.

The receipt is an entry letter issued by the Gujarat State Higher and Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) based on which a student is permitted to enter into the examination hall. The letter also contains the original picture of the candidate along with his/her full name.

Acting on specific information, the special operations group (SOG) of Junagadh police raided a house and found 44 bogus receipts late on Wednesday night.

So far, police have arrested three persons identified as Rajesh Gujarati, a resident of Junagadh, Rana Taparia, a resident of Kodinar and Pravin Solanki a resident of Keshod. Fourth Ranjeet Gadhvi is still at large.

Preliminary investigation revealed that majority of the 44 students who had contacted the accused to make forged receipts are repeaters. They have also been named in the FIR but are yet to be arrested.

The receipts were of students from Junagadh, Gir-Somnath, Porbandar and Rajkot districts.

Police also seized a laptop, scanning machine, two stamp making machines, a plastic sheet used for lamination of the receipt, butter paper, seven bottles of the liquid used for making rubber stamp, 17 stamps and three round seals of principals of various schools.

SOG inspector Jayraj Vala said, “Rajesh is the mastermind of the scam and he was printing the receipts at his house. He was charging Rs 3,000 per receipt. Students who were poor in studies wanted dummy candidates to write papers for them for which they were willing to pay Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000 per paper. In some cases, the accused persons also helped such students find suitable dummy writer.”

The fourth accused Ranjeet Gadhvi, a resident of Keshod, was involved in finding academically weak students in Gir-Somnath and Junagadh district

Talking to TOI, Junagadh superintendent of police (SP) Saurabh Singh said,“We are investigating if parents of these students are also involved in this racket and those whose role is found will be arrested.”

District Education officer of Junagadh, B S Kaila, said, “I have sent the report about the police findings to GSHSEB. According to our information, most of the students whose bogus receipts were found were repeaters. I have sought the board’s advice if these students should be allowed to take the examination or not and what actions including blacklisting should be taken against them.”

The arrested persons have been booked under IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 467 (forgery), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal, etc., with intent to commit forgery) and section 476 (possessing counterfeit marked material.)

221,['6/03/2020'],NMC used staff pension money to clear bills of contractors,"Representative Image

NAGPUR: In a major violation, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has spent Rs150.82 crore deducted from salaries of employees for general provident fund (GPF) and Defined Contribution Pension Scheme (DCPS) to clear bills of contractors.

Four MLAs of Shiv Sena from Mumbai, in their calling attention motion submitted in ongoing budget session of state legislature, have mentioned this and termed it as a crime. However, they have not mentioned the exact amount.

NMC sources told TOI the amount is Rs150.82 crore. “NMC deducts around Rs3 crore from salaries of its 9,600 employees for GPF and DCPS every month. GPF is applicable for employees who joined before November 2005, and DCPS for those who joined later. NMC is supposed to deposit the entire deducted amount in its GPF and DCPS accounts. This money cannot be used other than for giving emergency loans to employees. NMC spent Rs101.82 crore from GPF and Rs49 crore from DCPS to clear bills of ongoing works in last few years, and did not deposit the money in respective accounts,” sources said.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had informed this in general body meeting on February 20.

Also, NMC has used Rs5.19 crore reserved for paying employees at the time of retirement. The civic body also used Rs3.5 crore deducted from salaries of employees for repayment of loans in NMC Employees Cooperative Bank .

This is the situation even though the state government under Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister had given the second capital special grants of Rs300 crore and increased GST grant from Rs52.57 crore per month to Rs86.16 crore per month in last fiscal.

A couple of months ago, legislators had accused NMC of utilizing funds meant for their works and approved by the government for clearing bills of its own works. They had also said this affected works proposed by them.

NMC’s financial situation may well get worse. Despite cut of 25% imposed by civic chief in budget in December last year, bills of around Rs800 crore are pending with NMC.

As per a report submitted in NMC house recently, future liabilities of NMC are over Rs2,500 crore. These are NMC’s share in government projects, repayment in PPP model projects, repayment of loans, committed payments for private operators of city bus service, water supply, LED street light and solid waste management.

However, NMC has been managing salaries of employees by 10th every month and payment of PF amount at retirement. Various development projects are delayed due to the financial crisis. Contractors are staging agitations over long pending bills for last over one year.

Another major violation related to finance is that cash-strapped NMC has continued to sponsor crores for fairs, fests and cultural activities, even though they were strongly opposed by Nandlal Committee and strictures passed by Nagpur bench of Bombay high court.

Activist Anil Wadpalliwar said all these issues require proper inquiry and dissolution of the existing NMC body. “NMC has become famous for unnecessary expenditure and corruption. At the same time, recovery of property tax and water bills is low. Despite a local self governing body, NMC is mostly dependent on the government,” he said.

222,['6/03/2020'],Enlarged prostate gland removed from patient in Kochi,"KOCHI: An enlarged prostate gland weighing about 306g was removed without a cut from the body of a 66-year-old patient in a city hospital using the endoscopic route. The mean weight of the normal prostate in an adult male usually ranges between 7g and 16g.

Normally, using the holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) 50g to 60g enlarged prostate gland is removed. The largest gland so far removed using HoLEP is from UK – 500g — three years ago. HoLEP is a treatment for men with enlarged prostate gland. The laser surgery removes blockages of urine flow and this treatment is done without any incisions on the body.

It was performed on Shamsudheen (73) from Chavakkad, at Renai Medicity. He was in distress for the past five years due to frequent illness associated with enlarged prostate. He was advised by doctors in several other hospitals to undergo open transvesical prostatectomy (TURP) that would require a cut on his abdomen.

The doctors at Renai Medicity suggested that he should opt for HoLEP as it lessens bleeding and risk of regrowth, and reduces hospital stay.

“We successfully removed the prostate with the help of holmium and thulium laser. Patient was discharged on the fifth day and he is doing fine now,” said Dr Sandeep Prabhakaran , head of urology, Renai Medicity.

“I was working in the Gulf and as my pain increased, I had to leave my job and return. As I was unable to urinate, doctors put a tube and I got stone in the bladder,” said Shamsudeen. During the surgery, Shamsudeen was awake and was listening to music. “The total cost of the surgery and hospitalization is about Rs 1 lakh,” added Dr Prabhakaran .

RAJKOT: A man was killed in a clash between two groups over a trivial issue on Vora-Kotada Road in Gondal of Rajkot district on Wednesday night. Police detained 17 persons from both the groups on Thursday in connection with the fracas in which four people also received injuries.

Cops identified the deceased as Ilyas Sawan (34) and said that the clash erupted between the groups led by Sawan and Jagdeesh Thunga.

According to police, the group belonging to Bharwad community led by Thunga frequented the house of a woman on Vora-Kotada Road. These visits were strongly objected to by the Muslims in the area, especially the group led by Sawan, who asked the Bharwads not to come to their area. As a retaliation, the Bharwads would pass comments and hurl abuses whenever they passed through the area.

“Sawan and Akbar Sumra led a group of their community to strike a compromise with Thunga and Anil Batala. However, an altercation broke out which soon snowballed into a clash in which members of both the groups attacked each other with swords, knives, iron pipes, bats and stones. While three persons from the Bharwad group along with one from the Muslim group received injuries, Sawan died in the melee,” said K N Ramanuj, inspector with Gondal city police station.

Both Sawan and Sumra were taken to Gondal Civil Hospital from where they had been referred to Rajkot Civil Hospital, where Sawan succumbed to his injuries. The family members of Sawan refused to accept his body, demanding the immediate arrest of the accused.

225,['6/03/2020'],‘Safe room’ likely in every edu district to protect free laptops,"Madurai: After 10 of the free laptops issued to students were reported stolen from a government higher secondary school in Alanganallur last week, district chief educational officer (CEO) R Swaminathan has said the department is considering providing a ‘safe room’ for each educational district to store them.

It was on February 29 that the headmaster of NCSM government higher secondary school found that the doors of his room had been broken open and ten of the laptops to be given to 2017-2018 batch Class XII students, including one used by himself, were stolen. After the incident, the Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School Principals’ Association requested the CEO to collect such laptops and store them in a safe place instead of forcing headmasters to take the responsibility.

“Around 8,000 laptops to be given to students, each costing between Rs 8000 and Rs 20,000, are in government schools in Madurai district alone. Most schools, particularly in rural areas, don’t have proper security guards and many don’t even have compound walls. So, how can the laptops be safe?” asked K Anand Ram, legal secretary of the association and headmaster of T Kallupatti government higher secondary school. CEO Swaminathan said, “The practice was to store them in the district collector office. However, it has not been followed in recent times. In light of the theft at Alanganallur, the department is considering to keep a ‘safe room’ for the laptops with police security,” he said.

Headmasters of government higher secondary schools say that at present there is no provision by the government to take back laptops left behind. “The laptops were initially procured to be given to all students. But later, instructions were given to give it only to students who clear Class XII exams and also opt for higher studies. This means that many laptops had to be left behind,” explained S Christober Jeyaseelan, vice-president of the principals’ association and headmaster of A Vallalapatti government higher secondary school. About 40% of Class XII students in government schools tend to not go for higher studies, added principals.

Further, headmasters are the ones who are being solely held responsible for the laptops. “In 2019, 11 laptops were stolen from a school in M Kallupatti. The headmaster was forced to take accountability after the laptops were never found. She had to pay around Rs 3 lakh and is yet to get retirement benefit,” said Christober.

226,['6/03/2020'],London police to inquire Bhopal land-deal fraud complaint,"Bhopal: Sale of a plot of land in Bhopal has become a matter of investigation for London Police's National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) even as Bhopal police have booked a citizen of the United Kingdom in the case.

The land — in the posh Koh-e-Fiza area — has an estimated market value of Rs 50 crore, say sources. The income tax and enforcement directorate have also been informed about the monetary transactions involved, say sources.

Koh-e-Fiza police registered an FIR against Alamgir Mohammad Khan, a resident of Worcestershire, and others, a couple of days ago, in compliance with an order issued by a district court, following a petition filed by Bhopal resident Jaleel Mohammad Khan

According to Jaleel, a resident of Azad Market, he had created a partnership firm — M/s Lake Town Developers and Builders — along with Atul Gupta and Shailesh Gupta, residents of Lakherapura and Marwadi Road respectively. Jaleel had a share of 34% while Atul and Shailesh had 33% each, say sources.

They entered into an agreement deed to buy agricultural land owned by Alamgir at Katara Hill in 2012. Alamgir allegedly executed power of attorney before the officials of Indian high commission at UK, appointing Syed Mohammad Ali as his attorney to act on his behalf to sell the land.

For payments, Alamgir opened an NRO savings account (Non-Resident Ordinary account) with a bank in Indore with permission from RBI. Jaleel claims that Rs 3.50 crore was transferred to the NRO account as per the agreement, but at the time of registry, Alamgir allegedly joined hands with Jaleel’s partners.

“They created a new firm named Mahakaushal Developers and Mahakaushal Real Estate Developers and registered the land in the name this firm. In the new deal, Alamgir kept 10% share with himself and 90% with some other people, who are close relatives of my partners and therefore committed fraud and breach of trust,” Jameel alleges in his complaint. He has sent copies of his complaint to multiple agencies, including secretary of homeland security, UK, high commissioner of India in UK, British High Commission, RBI and ministry of external affairs.

Action Fraud, London’s national fraud and cybercrime reporting unit, took cognizance of Jameel’s complaint and has initiated inquiry. “I am sorry to hear you have been a victim of crime…your report has been sent to the national fraud intelligence bureau (NFIB) for review. Experts at NFIB will examine the information you provide. Where possible, the information is also matched against other available data in order to enrich and corroborate the details of the fraud. An assessment will be made as to whether there are viable lines of enquiry that would enable a law enforcement body, such as police service, to investigate. The NIFB aim to provide you with an update on your report within 28 days,” head of Action Fraud has replied to Jameel.

Koh-e-Fiza police have begun investigating the complaint. “A case has been registered against Alamgir Mohammad Khan and others. Investigations are underway,” TI Sudhir Argaria told TOI. Diplomatic channels would be used if necessary, given that the accused is a foreign national, said the officer. Atul Gupta and Shailesh Gupta have denied the allegations levelled by Jameel. “We have not committed any fraud. Ask Jameel how he arranged the money. His allegations are baseless,” said Atul. Shailesh also rejected the allegations and said he had no information on the complaints and investigation.

227,['6/03/2020'],Has BJP even laid a single brick at Gairsain: Uttarakhand Congress chief,"Representative image

Congress state chief Pritam Singh on Thursday accused the BJP of taking credit of a project for which his party “had done all the homework”.

How do you look at the CM’s decision on Gairsain?

My simple question is this: Has the BJP even laid a single brick for this massive infrastructure set up by the previous Congress government. Yes, the BJP can take credit for getting glass fitted on this building, but apart from that they have not done anything.

The Congress has been quite vocal on the issue?

There is no reason why we will we sit silent on the issue. During the tenure of Vijay Bahuguna , the Congress organised cabinet meetings at Gairsain and assembly session was first held in tents. Be it the assembly building or the other infrastructure at Bhararisain, all have been developed by the Congress.

What do you make of the fact that making Gairsain the capital has been the demand of people?

What CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and BJP have done is play with the emotions of people of Uttarakhand. When Uttarakhand was created, the entire confusion was created by the BJP and it has again caused confusion. In 2000, it did not declare Dehradun as the permanent capital, but now it has announced Gairsain as the summer capital. Whereas, our intention was to develop Gairsain as the permanent state capital.

Then why the Congress government did not take a call during its tenure?

We did not want to take decision in a haste. Therefore, the focus was on developing infrastructure and then declare Gairsain as the capital. Without developing the infrastructure, it is not possible to declare it as the summer capital. We stick to our stand. The day the Congress comes to power, Gairsain will be made the permanent capital of Uttarakhand.

What makes the Congress think that the BJP took the decision in haste?

If you look at the budget, the BJP has not allocated a single penny for the infrastructural development of Gairsain. The CM just made the announcement out of the blue.

228,['6/03/2020'],NMC gets only 31% tax; 60% fresh defaulters,"Nagpur: Much of the financial crisis at Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is self-made. With just 25 days remaining in current fiscal, the civic body has recovered only 31% property tax . Around 60% taxpayers are yet to pay current fiscal’s tax whereas recovery of arrears is at a meagre 24%. It is likely to keep the civic body finances in the red and affect civic amenities and development projects.

The recovery of property tax remains low despite NMC for the first time having started distribution of demand notes from April onwards. Also, tax amount for properties has gone up 2-3 times under new assessment system introduced two years ago.

Demand notes were issued to 5.74 lakh properties. Total demand was for Rs 685 crore, including Rs 220 crore was for current fiscal and Rs 465 crore arrears. Data from NMC Property Tax Department reveals only 2.29 lakh (39.93%) of total 5.74 lakh properties have their paid property tax from April 1 last year so far. Recovery is just Rs 99 crore (45%) against a demand of Rs 220 crore.

As far as arrears are concerned, 1.15 lakh defaulters paid Rs 110 crore (24%) as against demand of Rs 465 crore.

Thus, total recovery as is Rs 209 crore (30.51%) as against total demand of Rs 685 crore. The standing committee had set a target of Rs 443.70 crore in the budget which seems a distant dream.

Property tax department under assistant commissioner Milind Meshram had completed revaluation of existing properties and assessment of new properties in last two years and increased number of property taxpayers to 6.50 lakh. Demand notes to remaining are pending as most are open lands with owners not known.

NMC official told TOI recovery was higher this year compared to corresponding date last year. “It will increase as government taxpayers pay in March end. Also, owners of some big properties pay late,” he said.

The official also said action has been initiated against defaulters for the last one year. “155 properties owing arrears since long have been registered in NMC’s name. 12 properties were successfully sold in auction. Large number of open plots owing tax have been attached. List of all defaulters have been sent to water works department for disconnection of water supply,” he said.

The official added warrant will be issued automatically after completion of 90 days from demand notes from next fiscal. “For decades, we have been issuing warrants manually. We will start distribution of demand notes from April onwards. System will generate warrant automatically after 90 days. This will help initiate action immediately,” he said.

The official said, “All counters at NMC head office and ten zone offices will remain open on all days till March 31 excluding Holi. Online payment system on NMC’s website and App is open 24x7 but less than 15% are using it,” he said.

Revenue from property and water tax are two major sources for NMC. Like property tax, recovery of water bills is also very low. NMC has to hence mostly depend upon government grants. Oing to financial crisis, civic chief Tukaram Mundhe has stopped all works yet to be executed.

229,['6/03/2020'],Kochi: Government yet to take action on high-charging water tankers,"KOCHI: Despite growing public resentment there seems to be no end in sight to fleecing by tanker trucks that supply water to city residents. The tanker truckers have been charging high rates ever since the Operation Pure Water, a drive to ensure supply clean drinking, was launched in December 2019.

When the Operation Pure Water came to force, the district administration fixed the rates for supplying water through trucks. These rates were higher than what used to be charged by the trucks. The reason was that truckers had to pay Kerala Water Authority (KWA), which provided them water. Moreover, the trucks had to fill water from the hydrants at the water treatment plants at Aluva and Maradu and transport it to other regions in the city.

“With the state government issuing fresh guidelines in February 2020, tanker trucks can now collect water from sources other than KWA’s filling points. And, they don’t have to pay for this water, which is of very poor quality. However, the trucks continue to charge the higher rates that were imposed when Operation Pure Water was in force,” said an officer bearer of an apartment owner’s association, on condition of anonymity.

The Operation Pure Water was enforced in the city on the recommendation of Kerala Legislative Assembly Committee on Petitions. All Kerala Apartment Owners' Apex Association (AKAOAA) said that there is no uniformity regarding the rates charged by tanker trucks. There is no particular authority that residents can approach with complaints regarding the charges levied for the water they get.

“Sometimes it is a kind of bargaining. Individual associations bargain with truck operators, and then finalise a rate. There are no hard and fast rules, and residents do not know before whom they should file a complaint. That’s the reason why the matter is often taken up before the district collector,” said AKAOAA president VK Sankarankutty .

As summer intensifies, the demand for water supplied through trucks will also go up. The depletion in groundwater and other water sources could adversely affect water supply. Residents associations, water experts and KWA officials fear that the tuckers would further increase rates in case of water scarcity.

“There is a nexus between politicians, tanker truck operators and government officials. Their lobby controls water supply in the city. It needs political will to address water scarcity and provide quality drinking water to citizens. Though the state government issued fresh guidelines, there is ambiguity regarding rates that can be charged by the trucks. The quality of the water is also a major concern. It is unfortunate that the government is compromising public health,” said a Kochi-based water expert.

It is learnt that the government has proposed holding polls to all mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTC) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTC) on March 21, 110 municipal towns and 13 municipal corporations on March 24 and over 11,000 village panchayaths on March 27.

Gopalakrishna Dwivedi, principal secretary, rural development and panchayat raj, KSRK Vijaya Kumar, commissioner and director, municipal administration on Thursday met the state election commissioner Dr N Ramesh Kumar at the Election Commission office and discussed the issue of going to polls in a single phase.

According to sources, the senior government officials expressed the government’s preparedness to handle the entire exercise simultaneously as it was the only option to save the funds to be released by the Finance Commission to local bodies.

“The panchayats and municipal towns will lose funds unless we complete the process before March 31. We have proposed different dates for the elections to MPTC, ZPTC, municipal and village panchayats. But all MPTC, ZPTC, municipal towns and all the 11,000 village panchayats should go to elections on a single day to complete the process as per the schedule,” the senior officials told the commissioner.

The officials said the state went to polls simultaneously for all 25 Lok Sabha and 175 assembly constituencies last year. Dwivedi was chief electoral officer during the general elections in 2019.

Sources, however, said the SEC said the commission would look into the issue after getting the report from chief secretary and director-general of police (DGP) on the availability of police forces.

Sources said the SEC was ready to hold the elections in a single phase provided the state government was ready to provide full security required for the smooth conduct.

231,['6/03/2020'],Kozhikode: Puthumala rehab plan gets cabinet approval,"Representative image

KOZHIKODE: State government approved the proposal to set up a model village to rehabilitate Puthumala landslide victims on estate land at Puthakolli near Meppadi at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting. The government also decided to approve the change in status of land which is currently under the category of plantation land.

A media house has promised to provide seven acres for the model village at Puthakolli estate. As it is plantation land, the status must be changed in revenue records to enable rehabilitations of flood victims at the site.

Kalpetta MLA C K Saseendran said government has also decided to provide relaxation in land registration costs, and rehabilitation works can now commence after the GO is issued in this regard. The delay of over six months in rehabilitating the residents of Puthumala, who had lost their homes, was a cause for concern.

Wayanad district authorities had earlier identified eight acres at Vazhakkala estate, Kalladi, for the project but it had to be dropped as the land was caught up in a civil case over ownership dispute.

Meppadi panchayat president K K Sahad said that the plan is to build 60 houses in phase-I. Already, authorities have received commitment from sponsors to build 60 homes in the model village.

The landslide on August 8, 2019, had totally wiped out the plantation village. But, residents had expressed their desire to live together rather than being rehabilitated individually.

233,['6/03/2020'],"Weather effect: Fewer, less delicious Dussehris this yr","Lucknow: Mangoes won’t be delectable this year. Dussehri, the most popular variety of the king of fruits, would dip both in taste and volume. Same would be the case with other mango varieties such as chausa, langda and safeda, which are produced in UP.

Reason: Extended winter this year and the hailstorm on Thursday has hit the crop.

Mango is a weather sensitive crop during flowering stage. Weather conditions influence panicle (cluster of flowers) emergence, which is the first stage of the crop.

Extended winters this time have made panicles (called baur in Hindi) emerge very late, as late as mid-February, when usually they should have come up in January.

“What’s worrying is that by now only 30% panicles have grown. If rains continue there would be no more ‘baur’ and only ‘kopal’ (tiny leaves) on trees,” said All India Mango Growers’ Association president Insram Ali.

“Now that rains has been predicted over the next few days we are prepared for the worst,” he said.

Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) director Shailendra Rajan said, “Delayed panicle emergence is a matter of concern as during temperature would rise further in March and panicles would get lesser time to attain the required growth.” Considering that usually fruit sets in by March-April, the mango cycle of the state is already delayed. And with weather turning erratic at the start of the mango season, the fruit may not grow fully and have good quality. Repeated rains would affect the crop and may increase possibility of disease outbreak in the fruit.

Ram Manohar, a mango grower in Maal, said, “We fear the fruit may lack in taste as well because winter spell is returning with rains.”

234,['6/03/2020'],Cabinet expansion murmurs get louder amid poaching row,"Bhopal: Amid political turmoil and allegations of poaching of ruling party MLAs, AICC general secretary in-charge of state affairs Deepak Babaria met chief minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday evening. After the meeting, sources said that Nath could soon expand his cabinet to pacify the disgruntled MLAs.

At present, the ministry has 29 members, including chief minister Kamal Nath. A maximum of six more ministers can be accommodated, but the problem before the government is that more than two dozen MLAs are vying for ministerial berths. Even those who had not gone missing, there are MLAs like Lakshman Singh who seem to be displeased. Sounding a discordant note, Chachoura MLA Lakshman Singh told reporters on Wednesday, “Bhagwan Kamal Nath ko sadbuddhi de. (God give wisdom to Kamal Nath). When people cannot believe the chief minister, how will MLAs believe him?.”

Sources in the state Congress said that chief minister could adjust some of the aspirants as chairpersons in independent boards and corporations. But the question is whether these appointments will be made before the Holi festival or after the budget session and Rajya Sabha elections.

The rejig buzz grew louder on Thursday when state animal husbandry minister Lakhan Singh Yadav said that senior leaders and former ministers, who had been left out earlier, may be included in the next cabinet. “There are a few senior MLAs who could not get ministerial berth earlier. In the upcoming expansion of the cabinet, all these leaders will be included in the team. Moreover, some Independent and members of alliance parties could also be adjusted in the ministry,” said Yadav.

The minister also hinted that the cabinet reshuffle could happen soon. Sources said that after the poaching row, a large number of Congress leaders are expecting reshuffle in the cabinet and appointments to boards and corporations. Even MLAs from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and Independent are eyeing a berth in the Congress government. “I am trying for a responsibility since last one year. The Congress government may take a decision after this political turmoil blows over,” said SP MLA from Bijawar, Rajesh Kumar Shukla.

Sources in Congress said that Kamal Nath can include senior leaders like KP Singh, tribal leader Bisahulal Singh and Aindal Singh Kansana as ministers. They had been ministers in erstwhile Digvijaya Singh government. A few leaders from BSP or Independent could also be considered for the berth. Sources said some of the controversial minister could also be dropped from the cabinet in the forthcoming reshuffle of the Congress team.

The court was hearing a plea by a person seeking not to conduct the indirect election after he alleged that his mother, who was one of the candidates contesting for the post of chairperson, was abducted by the rival party members.

R Vimaleshwaran, in his petition, stated that his mother R Shanthi belonging to the AIADMK was elected as ward councillor. Thereafter, she filed her nomination for contesting for the post of chairperson. However, due to the ruckus created by the rival party candidates, the indirect election was postponed twice and election was scheduled on March 4.

Meanwhile, his mother who had gone to her relative’s house went missing on March 3. Since her mother went missing before the day of election, he suspected that she might have been abducted by the rival party members to prevent her from participating in the election.

Based on his complaint, the Bodinayakkanur rural police station issued a CSR. However, no steps were taken to trace his missing mother.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to forbear the authorities from conducting the indirect election till the whereabouts of his mother is known. When the petition was taken up for hearing on Thursday, the counsel appearing for the petitioner informed that the election has been conducted and two women from the rival party were elected and sworn in as chairperson and vice-chairperson.

Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi granted interim injunction for one week. The judges also directed the police to secure and produce the woman before the court and adjourned the case to a further date.

KOCHI: Funds sanctioned by the central government as part of its share of the project to treat children with rare diseases should not be used for any other purpose by the state government, the high court has ordered.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly issued the order after the central government informed that sanction has been given by the Union health ministry on February 13 to pay Rs 1.5 crore to the state corpus for the project. The payment is subject to the condition that it should not be utilized for any other purpose, the court was told.

In the order, the court said the amount sanctioned should not be utilized for any purpose other than treatment for rare diseases, in particular (i) Pompe (ii) Gaucher (iii) MPS-1 (Hurler syndrome) (iv) Fabry (v) RLER Syndrome and (vi) MPS-2 (Hurler syndrome).

Further, the court directed the state government to inform the Union health ministry the details like how the amount has been accounted, etc within one week. Once such a request is received, the ministry should respond expeditiously, no later than two weeks, the court ordered.

Responding to senior government pleader M R Sabu’s submission that a separate ‘head of account’ can be created for the purpose, the court said that the central government should be informed about it and the amount should be deposited in the newly-created account.

In January, the court had ordered the Centre to deposit its share for the project within 15 days, even though it had withdrawn its 2017 policy for treating children with rare diseases by 2018.

The divisional secretary of the board, Nitin Upasani, said that the flying squad members have been asked to be on high alert every day during the examination.

“Since the flying squad is permitted to carry cellphones in the examination centre premises, we have asked them to take pictures of any suspicious activity taking place,” Upasani said.

The centre in-charges and their teams are also asked to maintain the decorum of the examination and not to loiter around without any reason. The on-duty staff have been asked not to leave the school premises until the examination gets over, he added.

The board has formed 24 flying squads, six in each of the four districts of Nashik, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar. The in-charges of these squads are the education officers of primary, secondary and adult education, assistant deputy director, deputy education officer and district institute of Education and Training (DIET).

""The whole drama was planned just before the Rajya Sabha elections as the Congress government has failed to fulfil promises made to the public. The government and the Congress have betrayed the poor and farmers. To divert the attention from problems, this political drama was orchestrated.

The health department has asked to screen all foreigners who are coming for putting the pongala on March 9.

All hotels, resorts and homestays have been informed to report to the district medical office about the foreigners who have reserved rooms for the pongala festival. However, it would be a daunting task for the health department to screen the people who are coming from other states for putting the pongala. “It is humanly impossible for us to screen the people who are coming from other states. We have only set up health desks at the airports. It is not possible to screen the people coming by trains and also by road. Hence, we can only provide awareness on what should be taken care of,’’ said a health department official.

The information education and communication unit will be distributing the dos and don’ts that have to be practised to NGOs and other associations who are coordinating with the pongala festival. They have also decided to approach the residents’ associations to distribute the pamphlets for creating awareness.

At present 547 people in the state are under observation in the state of which 39 people are kept in isolation wards of different hospitals of the state.

Meanwhile, a team from Telangana has reached the state to study into the surveillance system Kerala had adopted when the first positive case was reported. “The delegation has come to know how we carried out the surveillance soon after the virus had spread in China. They had discussions with us and we shared the methods we followed for the surveillance and isolation of the people who had symptoms,’’ said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer for public health emergencies.

BAREILLY: Two cases of swine flu — one from Bareilly district and another from Pilibhit — have been reported in Bareilly division this week, even as no case of H1N1 virus was reported in the first two months.

According to health department officials, an octogenarian man, a resident of Civil Lines locality here, was tested positive for swine flu. Recently, he returned from a trip to Sri Lanka and was taken ill, following which he visited a private hospital in Delhi and tested positive for swine flu. Currently, he has been quarantined at his home here. “We have given medicines to those people who came in contact with the infected person as a precautionary measure,” said Dr Meesam Abbas , epidemiologist , Bareilly district.

Similarly, a Pilibhit resident was tested positive for swine flu in Lucknow, following which officials at King George Medical University notified the health department in Pilibhit.

Additional director (health) Dr Rakesh Dubey said, “This time around swine flu is not as severe as it had been the previous year. The condition of both patients is stable. Moreover, no casualty has been reported in Bareilly division.”

In the past two months, the Bareilly health department sent samples of 14 suspected cases, but only one was tested positive.

Last month, however, a six-year-old girl from neighbouring Uttarakhand’s Khatima was tested positive for H1N1 virus in Bareilly, following which local officials notified the Udham Singh Nagar health department about the matter.

In 2019, 65 people were tested positive, while three succumbed to H1N1 virus in Bareilly division. Of these 65 people, 60 — including those died — were from Bareilly district, four from Shahjahanpur and one from Budaun.

In 2018, Bareilly district had reported only a single case of swine flu, while 54 were tested positive here in 2017.

According to experts, swine flu is an airborne contagious disease, which spreads when a person sneezes and sprays infected droplets around, which land on nearby objects like tables or mobile phones and infects healthy people when they come in contact.

244,['6/03/2020'],Hyd’s 9-year-old anti-drug crusader,"Hyderabad: It is hard to imagine a nine-year-old student shaming a shopkeeper into shutting his cigarette store; but with Amberpet’s Taniya Begum , anything seems possible. The seemingly frail, bespectacled and soft-spoken child is the junior ambassador for Foundation for a Drug-Free World, India. So far, she has distributed over 35,000 booklets on ‘truth about drugs’ and participated in over 100 events to raise awareness about several social issues, primarily drug abuse.

“Nobody should use drugs. It destroys lives,” said Taniya when TOI met her at her school, Unison International. Taniya’s father Sheik Salauddin, a social activist himself, chipped in, “I don’t know what goes on in her head. She is so young. She watches the news with me every day and asks questions. I try to explain as far as possible.”

Taniya’s journey began two years ago when a major drug bust shook Hyderabad. Appalled citizens had started to hold awareness events on drug abuse. In one such event at Necklace Road, while her father participated in a run, she held up a board, which read ‘say no to drugs’.

Following the response to the incident, she made up her mind to campaign against drug abuse. “Usually when she walks on the road, if she sees anybody smoking, she goes up to them and tells them it is a bad habit; or if she sees a drunk man lying on the road, rather than being afraid, she approaches him and tells him why he should stop drinking alcohol,” her father said.

It was hence of little surprise that her oft-repeated speech at anti-drug campaigns reads: “My goal in life is to fight against drugs, to see a drug-free society. I firmly want to bring awareness in people and help our society.”

Speaking about her work to TOI, Vasu Yajnik-Setia, executive director of Drug-Free World India, said, “She is an inspiration,” recalling an incident in 2017 when Taniya campaigned against a wine shop proposed to be set up opposite the young girl’s school. Eventually, the plan was scrapped.

Officials with Kerala Water Authority (KWA) said that while the rates have been fixed for the water supplied to the trucks from their filling points, they are clueless about how much the trucks charge for the water sourced from other places.

“KWA has no control over the trucks. Tokens and receipts are issued for filling water from the hydrants at Aluva and Maradu. The authority charges the rates fixed by the government. If trucks draw water from other sources, we do not know how much the trucks pay at the source or whether they get the water for free. Moreover, we do not know how much the trucks charge residents,” said a senior official with KWA.

Officials with district administration said that when Operation Pure Water was in force, the district administration had fixed rates for transportation costs. The water charges were on the higher side as it has to be transported to long distances. But even after the new guidelines issued by the state government came into force, truckers continue to charge the same rates fixed as part of Operation Pure Water.

“Now, the administration does not have any control over the rates charged by trucks. The state government will have get involved in the issue. Otherwise, the truckers will charge as they wish,” said an officer with district administration.

However, repeated attempts to contact office bearers of Ernakulam district drinking water transporters welfare association did not turn fruitful.

District administration officials said the facility will resemble a lingam when viewed from above and is being constructed on 3.35 acres of land at an estimated Rs 28 crore to accommodate 430 people in 123 rooms.

The 123 rooms include 24 cottage-type rooms in the ‘A’ block, 63 normal rooms in the ‘B’ block and 36 rooms in the ‘C’ block. In addition to it, a hotel and separate rooms to lodge drivers will also be provided.

Addressing reporters, Kandasamy said that as the yatri nivas was constructed exclusively for devotees who visit the Arunachaleswarar temple, it was specially designed to resemble a lingam from above. “Almost 90% of the construction work has been completed and the remaining, including installation of lifts and airconditioners, will be completed in a month. After discussions with the HR&CE department and state government, the yatri nivas will be soon opened for devotees,” he said.

248,['6/03/2020'],YSRC burns Naidu effigy over quota plea in SC,"Vijayawada: YSRC leaders on Thursday staged protests across the state and burnt the effigy of TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu over the TDP filing a case in the Supreme Court seeking increase in the BC quota for local body polls.

The AP high court has fixed the overall quota at 50 per cent and the TDP has challenged it in the apex court.

YSRC blamed Naidu and TDP for attempting to stall the poll process in the state. If elections in the state are not held by March 31, the state will lose a central assistance of about Rs 5,000 crore.

YSRCP has accused the TDP leadership of delaying the poll process so that AP loses the central assistance. YSRC activists fanned out all over the state and burnt the effigy of Naidu. They accused Naidu of shedding crocodile tears for the BCs.

Earlier, addressing the media, minister for marketing M Venkatramana alleged that Naidu has been changing his his version on BC quota like a chameleon when in power and in opposition. “During the TDP rule in 2018, he went to the Supreme Court by stating that they are committed to 50 percent quota in local body elections. Today in order to delay the election and incur a financial loss to the state, Chandrababu Naidu intentionally filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of High Court,” Venkataramana alleged.

“It is chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who is committed to providing equal opportunities for the backward and weaker sections and thus brought 59 % reservations. It is a TDP person Birru Pratap Reddy, who moved the high court against the government decision. The court gave judgment limiting the reservations to 50 %. Respecting the court orders, we have decided to go accordingly rather than wasting time and delaying the elections,” he said.

LUCKNOW: Taking further its outreach towards dalits and backwards, the Bharatiya Janata Party has recruited 42% of its functionaries at the district level committees from the SC and OBC communities. This is almost six times of what their number was five years ago when only 7% functionaries were from these two sections at the the state BJP committees, which work at the grass-roots levels.

A top BJP leader who has been overseeing the constitution of district and regional-level committees said that the increase in the number of dalits and OBC was being done in accordance with their percentage of population. While dalits account for around 21% of UP's population, OBC form nearly 42%.

When asked to comment, UP BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that the BJP goes by the principle of `Sarv Sparshi', `Sarv Grahi' and ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. ""This is why there has been an increased focus on the backward communities which form the biggest chunk in the population,” he said.

In the state BJP, there are 91 district-level committees which have already been formed by the ruling party even as it gears up to take on the opposition in the run-up to 2022 assembly elections.

Outreach to Dalits, OBCs

Dalits, OBCs and women have also been given bigger representation in the six regional committees which have also undergone a reshuffle exercise, party sources said.

UP BJP leadership’s move to make an aggressive outreach out to OBCs and dalits comes in the backdrop of the fact that two key regional players -- Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party -- draw their strength from these two sections respectively. Political experts said that the BJP’s aggressive dalit and backward outreach affirms its strategy in the wake of recent electoral reverses -- the lates one in Delhi. Sources said that the BJP has been eyeing dalit leaders at the local level who could potentially woo voters of their caste towards the saffron camp.

250,['6/03/2020'],Thiruvananthapuram: Surendran’s family seeks justice,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after T Surendran collapsed and died at East Fort bus bay during the lightning strike called by KSRTC employees, his family demanded justice.

On Wednesday, police recorded the statement of his son-in-law KV Vinod , who said that the family did not have complaints over his death.

“My statement was recorded a couple of hours after his death and we were unaware of the circumstances that led to his death then. We were still in shock,” said Vinod, adding that the only thing he considered while giving his statement was whether Surendran was manhandled by someone during the commotion.

“We have an almost-clear idea of what happened at East Fort and we have reasons to believe that he could have been saved had he been rushed to a hospital,” he said adding that the family may change their initial statement given to authorities. Surendran’s body was cremated at his ancestral residence in Vithura on Thursday after an autopsy.

His family used to reside at Chenthilode near Kadakampally, which is the native place of his wife Prameela. Two years ago, the family shifted to Prameela’s sister’s house at Erayamkode near Kachani after giving their home on rent as they needed money to marry off the second daughter. They also pledged the property to a bank to raise additional funds.

Despite ill health, Surendran started going to work again after the bank served a notice to attach the property for defaulting on interest payment. Surendran’s monthly expenditure on medicines was Rs 5,000.

Meanwhile, collector K Gopalakrishnan launched a probe on Thursday to know the unfortunate incidents that happened in city following the strike by KSRTC employees.

The collector said that he had already submitted a preliminary report to the government and a detailed report will be filed within two days.

The collector visited the spot where the events unfolded as part of his inquiry and recorded statements of KSRTC authorities. Surveillance camera footages in the region were also collected for detailed examination.

He hinted that, prima facie, KSRTC employees, who launched a lightning strike leaving hundreds of passengers in the lurch, were at fault.

KSRTC employees are facing four cases in connection with the agitation. While two of them are related to manhandling a private bus staff and an auto driver, one is for assaulting police officers. Police had registered a case invoking provisions of Essential Services and Maintenance Act.

RAJKOT: Unseasonal rains occurred at isolated places in Saurashtra and Kutch regions on Thursday resulting in damage to standing wheat crop in some parts of Bhavnagar and Kutch districts.

Weather department officials said that the western disturbance-induced cyclonic circulation over south-west Rajasthan had resulted in weather change in several parts of Gujarat .

Jayanta Sarkar, regional director, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “Several parts of Saurashtra, north and central Gujarat reported light rains on Thursday. There would be cloudy sky on Friday but there are very less chances of rainfall.”

“If it happens, it would be in some parts of south Gujarat. Other parts of Gujarat are likely to remain dry,” he added.

Ghanshyamsinh Mori, a farmer from Khambha village of Shihore taluka in Bhavnagar said he lost half of his standing wheat crop. “The wheat crop on my 10 bigha land was about to be harvested in few weeks. But the unexpected rain with squally weather has damaged standing crop in 5 bigha land,” Mori told TOI. He had suffered loss during the monsoon seasons also due to heavy rains. According to Bhavnagar district agriculture officer Mahesh Vaghamshi, the unseasonal rains may have damaged the standing crops of cumin, fennel seeds, mustard and onions. “Primary reports suggest crop damage in Sihore and Palitana talukas which received rains. The exact number we will get on Friday,” said Vaghamshi.

In Bhavnagar, at Krushnakumar Sinhji Gohel Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), 10,000 gunny bags (50kg each) of onions were soaked in rain. “Of the 16,000 bags of onion that arrived on Wednesday, 6,000 bags were auctioned and dispatched. However, the 10,000 bags left in the open were drenched in the rain,” said Dashratsinh Gohil, director of the APMC.

Asked why she went incommunicado for over two days and where she was during this time, she said in Damoh on Tuesday: “Yeh raajniti hai, isse raaj hee rahne do (It’s a political secret, let it remain so). I do not lie and also don’t want to reveal the truth.”

Unlike a year ago, when she had made claims of “karodo ke offer (offers worth crores)” from BJP, this time she told a group of journalists: “There was no horse-trading, and no offers. No one can take me anywhere. Wherever I go, I go willingly. I don’t act under pressure.” Rambai told mediapersons: “First, interview BJP and Congress, Jitu Patwari and Jaivardhan and then come to me. I will tell who is lying and who is not.”

The 39-yearold legislator from Patharia in Damoh rattles the alliance government every now and then, but has always said that she supports CM Kamal Nath.

Hoping to get a cabinet berth after the recent crisis, she reiterated her support to the CM. “When such is the situation, who would not like to be a minister. I’d also,” she said, adding: “The truth is that I was with Kamal Nath dada and I will continue to be with him. Our leader Mayawatiji has supported Kamal Nath and whatever she (Mayawati) wants me to do, I will follow.”

Denying all charges of horse-trading, Rambai neither criticized BJP nor Congress. “I have interacted with everyone, leaders from both parties, while talking about the forthcoming budget,” she said, adding, “My daughter lives in Delhi and I had gone to met her.” She claimed that she had met Bhupendra Singh at the airport. “If I travel by train, many others are also in it,” she argued.

Experts say it shows either that the lion population has touched the 1,000 mark or there has been a disease outbreak in the lion habitat in Saurashtra .In reply to a question by Khambhalia MLA Vikram Madam said that of the 261 lions deaths in two years, 17 were unnatural. The government also stated that the number of leopard deaths in the state was 340 including 90 cubs in the two years since January 1, 2018. These included 95 unnatural deaths, including those in accidents.In 2018, there were 113 lion deaths which included the 29 deaths following the canine distemper virus (CDV) outbreak. The number suddenly rose to 148 in 2019, a 30% increase. Officials said that there is a possibility that the CDV effect continued in early 2019.Experts say that the census is due this year and only once the count is arrived at can one say that the deaths were abnormally high or within expected limits. Y V Jhala, the Wildlife Institute of India expert on big cats, said, “The number of deaths depends on the population, for which there are no reliable scientific estimates. Currently neither leopard nor lion estimation is done with reliable scientific methods, so I cannot comment on what this mortality means in terms of population viability.”AJT Johnsingh, a big cat expert associated with Nature Conservation Foundation, said, “The lions in Gir are not truly wild lions. Outside and within the sanctuary area, they feed on dead and weak animals and as a result their hunting stills are deteriorating and they are getting vulnerable to disease. The CDV outbreak of 2018 was the result of such feeding by the forest department. What we need is a healthy population in an area of about 1,000 sq km that is free of Maldharis and cattle. If the population in these areas falls below 100, the state should not worry but should try and conserve those that survive in such as area. Artificially feeding them is making the lions lose their hunting skills. The government must think of translocating some lions to Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh to establish a separate population.”State forest minister Ganpat Vasava said the forest department has been active in the entire lion habitat area and this has helped the department controlling accidental deaths, which fell to 10 in 2018 and seven in 2019. He said the department has been taking several measures to conserve lions. Radio collaring is one example.”Another expert, who asked not to be named, said, “We are going by the number 523 counted in 2015. The population has certainly crossed the 1,000 mark. It t remains to be seen what number is declared in 2020.” He said that going by the 1,000 figure, the 150 lion deaths is not unusual as 15% deaths per year is acceptable in the wild.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74503217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-288852,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/261-lions-340-leopards-died-in-2-yrs/articleshow/74501485.cms

The federation executive secretaries Anthoniraj Thumma and B Danam, in a statement on Thursday, said the CAA, NPR and NRC were against the basic principle of the Constitution, which guarantees equality. They said the federation met in Hyderabad on March 3 and resolved to oppose the CAA, NPR and NRC.

“We, the archbishops, bishops, heads of churches and leaders of Christian denominations, reject the manner in which the CAA, NRC and NPR are proposed to be implemented. We understand that they are closely linked together, creating fear in most of the citizens, leading to violent protests all over our country,” the executive secretaries said.

The federation found fault with the CAA linking citizenship with religion for the first time, treating Muslims differently from other religions, violating the right to equality and secularism enshrined in the Constitution.

“While we welcome citizenship for persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries, this should be done without excluding anyone irrespective of religious or ideological affiliations,” the federation said.“The present NPR and NRC are hazardous to anyone who cannot show the documents of their birth and of their parents. As it has already happened in Assam, the poor, landless, women, minorities, Dalits, Adivasis, illiterates, and nomadic and migrant communities will be most affected to which ever religion they may belong,” the federation said.

The victim Bhautik Vekariya registered a complaint of cheating under Information Technology Act at Karjan police station on Wednesday.

In his complaint, Vekariya said he received a call from a man on February 19 who identified himself as Nikhil and said he was calling from an online shopping company. The man told the complainant that he was chosen as a lucky winner who could get a smart phone or laptop or an LED television. Vekariya hung up the call but was called again the next day with the same offer. After getting a second call, Vekariya assumed it to be a genuine offer. He was asked to buy something from the website to be eligible for the offer and so he purchased garments and paid Rs 940 through universal payment interface (UPI) application to a bank account mentioned by the accused.

Next day, after he verified his email address, Vekariya was told that he will either get a laptop or smart phone. Vekariya chose to take the laptop but was asked to pay Rs 12,700 as GST charges and additional Rs 19,990 for insurance. Few hours later, Vekariya got a call to inform that the insurance money was not transferred. He was asked to pay the amount again, but with the assurance that the earlier payment will be refunded to his account. Within the next three days, Vekariya paid Rs 18,203 to the bank account as asked by the accused.

These three MLAs — BSP’s Ram Bai Govind Singh and Sanjeev Kushwah and SP’s Rajesh Shukla — were among the six brought back to Bhopal from New Delhi in a chartered plane by finance minister Tarun Bhanot on Wednesday evening.

Ram Bai, the legislator from Pathariya , admitted that she went to New Delhi with former BJP minister Bhupendra Singh, but sees nothing wrong in it. “They (Congress ministers) are claiming that we were taken forcefully. Can anyone take a person forcefully anywhere? Whoever went, went on their own and returned on their own. No minister played any part in it,” she claimed, two days after the post-midnight drama at a hotel in Manesar .

That night’s video shots show minister for urban administration Jaivardhan Singh pulling Ram Bai’s blue-coloured strolley, while senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh told the media that she was courageous and “fought off those who tried to stop her from leaving the hotel”. In one of the videos, a minister is heard telling police, “Do not touch the lady.”

But Ram Bai said, “No one can touch me. I can manage that bit myself. All these things are lies. Why don’t you people (media) go and ask those who were there. Ask Jitu Patwari (minister for higher education) and Jaivardhan Singh, who were there. I was going to my daughter in Delhi. So, can’t I travel with Bhupendra Singh?”

The second BSP MLA, Sanjeev Kushwah, also denied that BJP had “taken him to Delhi”. “I did not go to Delhi under anyone’s pressure. A family member is admitted to a hospital there. Congress leaders should say where we were ‘abducted’ from and where we were ‘held hostage’. This is a game within Congress to increase one’s status.”

Samajwadi Party MLA Rajesh Shukla aka Bablu said, “We met (BJP leader) Narottam Mishra several times in the past 14 months.” Congress alleges that Mishra played a key role in the “poaching bid”.

Ram Bai remarked that BJP is a “strong opposition” in the state. “The difference between the government and opposition is very small,” she said, adding: “Budget session starts on March 16 and the opposition will not be quiet. The stronger the opposition, the better the government works.” On Rajya Sabha elections, the BSP MLA said she would follow the orders of her party supremo, Mayawati.

State Congress spokesman and CM Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Congress did not issue any list about who were ‘held by BJP’ in the hotel, and who we freed. The names were never made public. We said that some of our MLAs were held captive and some of them we have been able to release. Who has issued the names? The names of those MLAs will be revealed later.”

260,['6/03/2020'],"When he collapsed, her training kicked in...","Thiruvananthapuram: Renju V’s phone has not stopped ringing since Wednesday evening. The senior staff nurse at PRS Hospital’s critical care wing was initially unaware that her effort to save the life of a fellow passenger was being lauded by people after a video of the same was widely circulated on social media.

For Renju, it was just another day as she was heading home after night duty, until her phone started ringing with appreciation from many people. But, Renju said that she would have been happy if Surendran was alive. Surendran (63) was waiting at a bus bay in East Fort during the sudden strike by KSRTC employees, when he collapsed. Renju, who was there at the bus stand with her husband Binu S Nair, started CPR and asked bystanders to call an ambulance.

“The passenger (Surendran) complained about uneasiness and thought it might be due to low blood sugar; other passengers bought a juice and then he collapsed. When I checked him, there was no pulse and I started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Policemen and fellow passengers helped me to lay him on floor and maintain airway patency. I continued CPR till the ambulance came. The ambulance came within 15 minutes and I did what I could to save his life. When I reached home, I came to know through media reports that he did not survive,” said Renju, who has a working experience of 15 years.

Renju also recollected a similar instance in her life around 10 years ago, when she had completed the general nursing course from PRS Hospital. She had performed CPR on a senior citizen, who had fainted at Attukal temple premises.

“I have been receiving calls from a lot of people, including senior officials, from the hospital. We are all trained to provide emergency care when need arises. I just hope that there will be more social awareness among people to help fellow beings. Emergency care equipment such as automated external defibrillator should be made available at transit location like East Fort,” added Renju.

In a complaint registered with superintendent of police, Sambhal, Yamuna Prasad, the woman, who is in her early 20s, claimed that her father-in-law had also robbed her of all her jewellery.

Though the crime allegedly took place on February 28 in a village under Asmoli police station limits in Sambhal district, the FIR was lodged on Wednesday after the survivor met the SP.

The woman alleged that initially she had approached the local police station but to no avail. On Wednesday, she met Sambhal police chief Yamuna Prasad and then police swung into action and lodged an FIR.

According to the survivor, her husband is a labourer at a brick kiln in the area. Since her marriage, her father-in-law had an evil eye on her. In fact, she had complained about him to her mother-in-law, who had rebuked her husband. Angry at her for telling on him, her father-in-law had thrashed her, she claimed.

On February 28, she was alone in her room in the night. Her father-in-law barged into the room and raped her at gunpoint. She narrated her ordeal to her mother-in-law. This infuriated her father-in-law and the next day, he along with three of his accomplices, allegedly beat her up and robbed her of all her jewellery. Hearing her cries, her neighbours rushed to her aid and saved her.

Ranveer Singh, SHO, said an FIR under IPC section 376 (rape) was lodged against the man, who along with three others was also booked under section 452 (house trespass).

For most people, the piece of art and history holds little meaning. The names written using pebbles show how ignorance and vandalism pose a threat to this megalithic site in Chengalpet, which had witnessed two major excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1950 and in 1952. Megaliths such as cairn circles and dolmenoid cists (box-shaped stone burial chambers) were excavated from the site, confirming that it was a burial ground during the prehistoric times.

271,['6/03/2020'],Ullagaram: Just 437 water connections in 10 yrs,"Chennai: A decade after launching the ambitious Ullagaram-Puzhuthivakkam water supply scheme to provide connections to residents, only 437 connections have been provided by Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board ( CMWSSB ).

This is just 4% of the 7 ,890 connections the state government had promised to give when the scheme was commissioned.

These details were provided by CMWSSB in response to an RTI filed by a resident. TOI has copies of the RTI reply.

The scheme was launched in 2007 and work was awarded in 2010 to the contractor. It was supposed to be completed in 2012, but was partially commissioned only in 2016.

The RTI reply shows that the original contract was terminated in 2017 and work orders were again issued to complete the pending work in four zones. As on date, the physical progress is 93.44%. Rs 20 crore has been paid to the contractor, the RTI reply says.

However, applications for only 667 connections have been received, of which only 437 have been processed, while 178 have been put on hold.

Even for houses where the connections were given, water is being supplied only for 60-90 minutes a week, the RTI shows. Residents say the actual time is lesser.

Due to this, residents have to depend on water tankers during summer as well as in other seasons, which puts a strain on their monthly household expenses.

CMWSSB has failed to keep pace with realising its own projections of population and water demand. The document shows that population in the area would rise to 1.62 lakh with 22 MLD of water demand.

The area engineer of CMWSSB told TOI that the number of connections was less because only few had applied. However, he admitted that the project was delayed as final ‘rectification’ work was underway. “From December we have started giving more connections,” he said. However, the RTI reply, which shows only 4% realisation of projected connections, was dated February 20. In addition, the RTI reply states that CMWSSB has taken promotional steps through press publications and information through residents’ welfare associations.

272,['6/03/2020'],Study reveals pain points during rush hour,"KOCHI: Kochi is fast growing, in fact the growth is in such a pace that more and more people are spending more and more time in traffic snarls. Add to it the poor condition of roads, intersections and signals and then you know why the city’s traffic is one of the slowest in the state.

The average speed of a vehicle plying on city roads is around 22.35km per hour, far below the standard speed limit set by the motor vehicles department (MVD) for cars and bikes in urban limits, according to a study by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac).

As per MVD standards, the speed limit of cars and bikes in urban limit is 50kmph. The study conducted by Natpac on 13 major road stretches shows that the traffic is slowest on the 190m stretch between Madhava Pharmacy Junction and Kacheripady Junction. The average vehicle speed on the stretch is 10.77kmph at peak hour and the study cites the signal at Madhava Pharmacy Junction as the reason for the delay. It is followed by the 630m-long stretch from Ravipuram to Pallimukku Junction with a vehicle speed of 12.19kmph.

The study team travelled 57km on the city roads, including the stretches from Kundannur Junction to Vytilla, Cochin Port Trust Junction to Shanthi Nagar and from Kathrikadavu Junction to Kaloor Junction, among others, at peak hours to find the average speed of vehicles on the city limit.

The study was conducted as part of preparing a masterplan for Kochi by the town planning department.

As signals delay the speed of vehicles, the study has proposed the construction of flyovers on certain particular areas. Since, the proposal is not practical on the Metro stretch, it has suggested to construct bypasses outside the city in order to discourage vehicles going to other destinations from entering the city limits.

The study also recommends the government to bring down passenger fares on the Metro to lure more people to public transport system. A major proposal in the report is to provide more bus routes along north - south and east-west corridors of the city.

“Currently, the major bus routes on north- south direction of Kochi is along MG Road, Sahodaran Ayyappan Road and Shanmugham Road. Providing more bus routes will help people to switch from private vehicles to public vehicles,” said an official.

“We will recommend turning more routes parallel to MG Road into bus routes. We have also proposed to develop a new corridor between Atlantis Junction—Panampilly Nagar— Chilavannur— Thykoodam—Petta by widening existing roads on the stretch. When the corridor is developed, we can bring down traffic congestion on SA Road. When we develop new corridors, more buses need to be taken to roads. Since the private bus industry in the state faces a lot of problems to sustain their business, we will recommend the government to address their problems for a larger cause,” he added.

BHOPAL: Faraz Khan , an assistant coach at the MP Equestrian Academy, stunned the Asian medallists when he won the individual gold medal in the championship in the national pre novice eventing 2020, organised in Meerut on Wednesday.

Eventing is an Olympic equestrian event where riders compete in the three disciplines of dressage, cross-country and show jumping. This event has its roots in a comprehensive cavalry test that requires mastery of several types of riding.

Riding a German horse Herlicen, Faraz demonstrated excellent skills. He dominated in all three disciplines of the event. Second position went to Lt Col Sameer Choudhary while Pradeep Kumar stood third in the category. Asian medallists Ashish Malik and Rakesh Kumar also participated in the event.

28-year-old Faraz is a constable in the 7th Battalion of MP Police. His coach Bhagirath Prasad said Faraz is a talented player. “He had joined the academy in 2007. Ever since, he has been a consistent performer. This should be gauged from the fact that he has won over 100 medals in his career so far that included 17 national medals and five international medals,” said Bhagirath.

Faraz’ father M Khan is SI in the 7th Battalion.

Talking to TOI, Faraz said that the MP Academy played a crucial role in making his career. “I was only 14 when I joined the academy. Even after getting a job, I continued my association with the academy, because such equestrian atmosphere is not available anywhere else,” said Faraz.

Hailing his horse Herlicen, Faraz said, “This horse is with me for over a year. It is the excellent coordination between me and Herlicen that ended in winning the gold medal.”

The competition may be run as a one-day event (ODE), where all three events are completed in one day (dressage, followed by show jumping and then the cross-country phase) or a three-day event (3DE), which is more commonly now run over four days, with dressage on the first two days, followed by cross-country the next day and then show jumping in reverse order on the final day.

276,['6/03/2020'],"After 25-year wait, Bhopal finally gets a masterplan","BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh capital’s first master plan after a gap of 25 years was placed in public domain, here on Thursday. Urban development officials claimed that this is the first city development plan in India based on extensive use of GPS tech.

The plan allows for revenue generation through premium floor area ratio (FAR) and saving through TDR generation. The new plan would enhance mixed use development, specifically in MP Nagar, New Market, Karond and Misrod. Heritage and green cover conservation has also been proposed.

“We have delivered on our promise,” said MP urban development minister, Jaivardhan Singh while unveiling the Bhopal Development Plan 2031. The document would be the guideline for development of the state capital. It was one of the main poll promises of the Congress party. The last master plan of Bhopal in 1995 was released when Digvijaya Singh was the chief minister.

However, the last Bhopal master plan of 1995 was valid till 2005. “In the last 15 years, development of Bhopal has been without a detailed plan. Planning area has nearly doubled to 1,016 sq km, compared with the last plan of 1995,” Jaivardhan Singh explained.

“Master plan has been developed to cater to the needs of a city with a population of 35 lakh,” said Singh.

The population of Bhopal was about 10 to 15 lakh in 1995. Currently, it stands between 18 to 23 lakh. The city development plan is also based on transit-oriented development (TOD), whereby areas along BRTS and Metro rail development would benefit from additional Floor Area Ratio (FAR), going by indications in the draft proposal. For the next 30 days, objections and suggestion for the plan would be invited. After that, it would take the authorities another 60 days to before the final document gazette.

277,['6/03/2020'],KSRTC employees’ flash strike on Wednesday,"Representative image

The KSRTC employees’ flash strike on Wednesday is one of those incidents that makes one wonder if Kerala, for all its outward transformation, has really changed at all.

The state transport corporation is an organisation that has been in the red for ages, on life support from tax payers’ money, and the concern of its rapidly dwindling permanent staff should, on any given day, be how to work harder and ensure their own survival by ensuring the company’s success. Instead, what we witnessed on Wednesday was brazen display of militancy, a throwback to the eighties when trade unions held the state hostage to their socialist whims and parochial fancies.

Kanam Rajendran’s outburst on Thursday only confirms this. He did not even pretend to condole the unfortunate death of a citizen, collateral damage of the flash strike. Instead, he chose to get all worked up and self-righteous, even venturing to ask what option the KSRTC drivers and conductors had, “whether they could park their buses in the sky”? Not particularly confidence-inspiring words from one of the leading rights of the Left who, especially since his party is in the government, is supposed to speak for all citizens not just the blue-collared variety. While Kanam was at least candid, the CPM’s Kadanapally Ramachandran beat around the bush on the CITU’s involvement in the strike but, when confronted with the evidence, deftly rolled with the punch. One leader impervious to reason, the other insincere, both uncaring. Has anything really changed?

278,['6/03/2020'],"Autorickshaw rams bicycle on BRTS route, youth suffers head injuries","Pune: A 20-year-old youth suffered serious injuries on head after a speeding autorickshaw hit his cycle from the rear on the Bus Rapid Transit System route at Rahatani Phata in Wakad on the night of March 2.

The cyclist, Raju Mahesh Yadav from Darbhanga district in Bihar and currently residing at Wakad, is recuperating in the intensive care unit of a private hospital at Moshi. The injured victim’s uncle, Raju Ruplal Yadav, lodged an FIR against the autorickshaw driver under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act with the Wakad police on Wednesday.

Investigation officer Vilas Birajdar from the Wakad police on Thursday said, “The BRTS here is open only for civic buses and the general traffic is not allowed to ply like other places in the city. Raju entered the dedicated route from Rahatani Phata and was heading towards Kalewadi Phata. The speeding autorickshaw driver lost control over his vehicle and hit the cycle from the rear around 9pm, damaging the cycle. The panicked autorickshaw diver abandoned his vehicle and fled without informing police about the accident.”

He said, “The injured youth suffered serious injuries on head. Passers-by rushed him to a private hospital. We reached the accident spot after 30 minutes and seized the vehicle (autorickshaw).”

He said, “We conducted an inquiry into the incident and registered an FIR against the driver. A notice would be issued to him under the relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code for joining the police in investigations because he was booked for committing a bailable offence.”

Birajdar added, “The PMPML has deployed security guards on the BRTS stretch. They try their best to stop private vehicles from plying on the stretch but most of the vehicle owners do not listen to them. Plying of private vehicles in high speed and speeding on the route is a common problem here.”

The injured patient’s uncle, Raju Ruplal, told TOI over phone, “My nephew suffered injury on the right side of his head. He was first taken to a nearby private hospital and from there, we rushed him to a government hospital. As no intensive care unit room was vacant there, we admitted him to a private hospital at Moshi and spent Rs2 lakh on a surgery. We don’t know how much more money will be required for his treatment.”

He said, “My nephew, Raju Mahesh, has been staying at Wakad from 2016. He regained consciousness 25 hours after the accident, identified me and spoke to me in a frail voice. The accident could have been averted if he had not used the BRTS route,” Yadav said, adding that he wanted the police to arrest the autorickshaw driver as soon as possible.

Raju cooks food for bachelors in a housing society at Wakad.

280,['6/03/2020'],Bailout plan for telcos may be presented to Cabinet,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A rescue package for the telecom sector could be presented to the Union Cabinet as concerns grow over the financial viability of companies and their ability to pay the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues, as mandated by the Supreme Court.

Top sources in the telecom department said the government is worried that a heavy payout, based on the AGR order, may result in the collapse of some companies.

“While the first priority is to ensure adherence to the SC order, solutions to provide a way out are also being worked upon. Any such relief will be for the entire industry, and not just for one or two operators. Also, it will be taken to the Cabinet,” a source said.

The development comes a day after DoT sent notices to the defaulting telcos — Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Tata group (that has sold its telco business to Airtel) — to immediately pay the full amount as ordered by the Supreme Court.

DoT’s recovery notice asks the companies to deposit nearly Rs 77,000 crore ""without any further delay” to comply with the Supreme Court’s orders. So far, the companies have cumulatively paid Rs 25,701 crore to the government out of the Rs 1.02 lakh crore asked from the three of them.

The biggest burden of this demand is on Vodafone Idea that now needs to pay Rs 49,538 crore to the DoT, as per the Rs 53,038 crore demand raised on the company. It has only paid Rs 3500 crore so far, and has expressed inability to pay up fully due to financial constraints.

Vodafone Idea is now seeking a bailout, something that is expected to come up on Friday when Vodafone’s global CEO Nick Read comes calling on finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad (he may also meet Home Minister Amit Shah ).

And while the government looks at a relief package for the sector, the statutory action against non-payment of dues also continues.

The telecom department is moving ahead with the “next steps” and has sought legal opinion on encashment of bank guarantees submitted by Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tatas.

Sources in the telecom ministry said that the DoT has approached its legal department for a view on the invocation of the guarantees, estimated at around Rs 12000 crore.

“This is the process and it needs to be followed up. We expect to get a firm view on encashment of the guarantees very soon,” a source said.

The government is also awaiting a final view from the Attorney General on the matter as encashment of bank guarantees is the penultimate step before cancellation of the telecom license of companies.

Sources also said that the government does not agree with the self-assessment calculation of mobile operators on the AGR issue.

282,['6/03/2020'],Thiruvananthapuram: Government-opposition trade barbs over strike,"Representative image

Thiruvananthapuram: The ruling and opposition benches fought in the assembly over the flash strike conducted by KSRTC employees in the capital on Wednesday.

Though government also agreed with the opposition that the strike was unwarranted and unjust, opposition alleged that government was adopting a lukewarm response in this matter as it is not serious about acting against employees who held the capital to ransom for six hours.

Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran replied to the notice, seeking leave for an adjournment motion, moved by Congress MLA M Vincent on behalf of the government. He said flash strikes cannot be justified.

“Lapses on the part of officials will be probed. Collector will ensure a probe; a preliminary report has been received. After receiving a detailed report, action will be taken,” he said.

But, opposition members alleged that the absence of chief minister and transport minister during discussions in the house were reasons enough to gauge the government’s sincerity.

The opposition rushed to the speaker’s dais when Surendran said that if the matter was that important, opposition could have entrusted it to someone senior instead of Vincent.

The speaker said that any member can raise the matter as everyone had equal rights and government too can decide who should answer on its behalf.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said it was strange that government asked the district collector, who didn’t intervene when the strike paralyzed the city, to conduct a probe. He said that government was taking the matter lightly and the chief minister, who was present in his office inside the assembly complex, failed to turn up for discussions in the house.

Vincent, who piloted the leave for adjournment motion, said government should provide financial compensation as well a job to the family of Surendran, who collapsed and died while waiting for a bus during the strike. The opposition also staged a walkout after the speaker refused to admit the adjournment motion.

283,['6/03/2020'],Old wave: From TNCA 4th divisionto world record,"Chennai: The expansion of the Ranji Trophy a couple of seasons ago to include Puducherry, Uttarakhand and the north-eastern states has allowed many players from little-known destinations to get a taste of first-class cricket . Puducherry’s S Santhamoorthy is one such cricketer, who now finds his name in the record books for a unique feat.

The medium-pacer made his first-class debut for Pondicherry during a Ranji Trophy match against Nagaland last month at the age of 40 years and 155 days and picked up a five-wicket haul, becoming the oldest to achieve the feat on first-class debut. He broke a 125-year old record of England’s Fred Wright – who took 5 for 78 for Leicestershire against Derbyshire at the age of 40 years and 49 days. The achievement has been validated by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians, a group which tracks and maintains first-class and international cricket records.

Playing as a medium-pacer in Pondicherry’s final Ranji outing for the season, Santhamoorthy took 2/51 in the first innings before taking 5/79 in the second. The opportunity came only due to an injury to frontline seamer Ashith Rajiv, but the encouragement that came from teammate and former India seamer Vinay Kumar following the match spurred him to keep at it for the next couple of seasons. During the season, the Puducherry native also made his debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy.

""After the match Vinay Kumar praised my bowling and said I am incredibly fit for someone who is 40. He feels I can continue playing for the next 2-3 years. I am motivated to keep playing,"" Santhamoorthy, a sports coach at the Government Law College in Puducherry, told TOI.

While Santhamoorthy beams with pride now, his has been a long and arduous journey for nearly two decades in the TNCA league. Working up from fourth division to the second division, he has played for teams like Madras Cricket Club (MCC) and Swaraj CC, and also made an appearance for Karaikudi Kaalai in the Tamil Nadu Premier League in 2016.

""I started playing in the TNCA league in 2000, playing mostly in the second division. I could not be part of the 2019-20 season because I was training with the Pondicherry team,"" said Santhamoorthy.

Ironically, his commitments with the Ranji side have put a strain on his finances. ""I work on a contract basis with the law college. Because I was with the Pondicherry team, I haven’t been paid for the past five months. I have been managing with the daily allowance that we get from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. I hope to get a permanent job with the college,"" he said.

Despite the hitches, Santhamoorthy never gave up on his passion. ""No one ever suggested that I should give up cricket. After every season in the TNCA league, I used to get offers from other teams, so that kept me going,"" he said.

It remains to be seen whether Santhamoorthy will get another chance for Pondicherry next season given his age, but he can take comfort from the fact that he has made the most of the opportunities that have come his way.

About the online process, Vikram said that officials prepare a list of the things which were lost and later found at the airport. “We upload the list regularly so that the passengers could check it from anywhere in the world and take it back whenever it is possible for them,” he added.

He, however, said that despite availability of the online process, the passengers are still using the offline approach to get back their lost stuff. “As the scheme was launched recently, it might be possible that passengers have not got a proper understating about it. We have informed the people and also request them to take benefit of the scheme,” said Vikram.

He made it clear that sooner or later, the offline process will be stopped. “The online process is smooth and easy. I hope that passengers will start using the online process completely,” said Vikram.

The forest department tried to reunite the mother leopard with her male cub, but it did not come back. Finally, the cub was sent to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, near Mumbai.

290,['6/03/2020'],Getting building permit in Bhopal will be easier now,"Representative image

BHOPAL: If the road width and existing civic infrastructure can match requirements, getting building permissions would be a cakewalk in Bhopal, going by the draft master plan of Bhopal 2031, released here on Thursday.

“The permissions would depend on carrying capacity of the areas like existing civic infrastructure,” said MP urban development principal secretary, Sanjay Dubey. Heritage and green TDR, premium floor area ratio (FAR/FSI) could also spur development in the state capital. “The base FAR has been finalised. Excessive FAR can be purchased for an additional charge, it has been proposed in the plan,” said Dubey.

Just from premium FAR, the state government is looking at Rs 8,149 crore revenue generation for residential zones alone. Full consumption of commercial space of around 1,058 hectare in Bhopal could raise another Rs 1,400 crore, it includes TDR and premium FAR.

“Bhopal’s master plan is a rare event. The city’s development in between has been catered to, including future development of the city. It is a first master plan in many respects for any city in India,” he said.

“We will execute the plan. Land pooling policy has been adopted by the state government. Road development will be without hindrance to the public at large,” said Dubey, explaining that the use of new technology has allowed planners to exactly pin-point the proposed development land and not interfere with private land. Village development has also been catered to, he added. Besides, the plan envisages separate land pooling policy for conservation of the lakes.

Residential area into five zones: For residents, the draft Bhopal development plan 2031 puts forth zoning proposals to facilitate regeneration of the existing urban areas in the city by incentivising mixed use residential zone.

Five residential general or RG zones have been categorised. RG 1 would be areas along Kamla Park — the plan incentivises redevelopment and allow regeneration of the existing urban areas. Further, RG 2 allows limited mixed use, RG 3 pertains to areas (Arera Colony, Chunahatti, Shyamla Hills and Vijay Nagar) where limited development would be permitted to ‘retain the identity and character’.

50k trees to be planted: Loss of green cover in Bhopal smart city development area stands at 2,500 trees. As many as 50,000 trees will be planted in 23.5 hectare area of the smart city, said urban development minister, Jaivardhan Singh. “A lake development authority for planning and development of Upper Lake and other water bodies is proposed,” he said.

291,['6/03/2020'],GRH dean directed to perform postmortem on accident victim,"Madurai: Madras high court has directed doctors of the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) to perform postmortem on a person who succumbed to injuries in a road accident and hand over the body to his family members. The court said this after taking cognizance of the fact that the body was not handed over to the family as police officials did not give requisition for performing postmortem.

Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order while hearing a plea moved by the victim’s son, S Abilash, seeking for a direction to the Madurai city police officials to give requisition to the dean of GRH for performing postmortem and hand over his father’s body.

The judge observed that the petitioner’s father, Selvaraj, who was doing business at Bengaluru met with an accident on February 23 when he was riding his two-wheeler. He was admitted in the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (Nimhans) and thereafter shifted to a private hospital.

He was discharged from the private hospital and admitted to the GRH on February 29. Selvaraj, who was in a comatose condition passed away on March 4 at 5pm and his body is kept in the mortuary.

The judge observed that the postmortem was not performed as the inspector of police of Madhichiyam police refused to give requisition stating that the accident did not take place within their jurisdiction. When the petitioner approached the jurisdictional police station at Karnataka, the inspector of police stated that the petitioner’s family did not lodge any complaint immediately after the accident took place and the death did not take place with their jurisdiction.

“The body of the petitioner’s father is still in mortuary. The petitioner and other members of his family are anxious to perform the final rites. I can understand the agony and pain of the petitioner’s family. This is not a matter in which one can adopt a technical approach as it appears to be a case of natural death,” observed the judge.

Taking cognizance of the submission by the petitioner’s counsel stating that no claim would be made against the police in Madurai in the future and the stand of the police, the judge directed the dean to make arrangements to conduct postmortem and hand over the body to the petitioner’s family on Thursday itself.

293,['6/03/2020'],Work on translocating Amaria tigers to begin soon: PTR official,"The addition of each tiger means expansion of big cat territory, posing a threat to the farming community in t... Read More

PILIBHIT: The process to translocate some 10 tigers that have made the agricultural belt around Deuni dam home in Pilibhit’s Amaria block has begun in an effort to prevent any man–big cat conflict, according to H Rajamohan, field director of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve .

Deuni dam is 18 km from PTR. A tigress with three cubs had migrated from PTR’s Mahof forest range to Amaria way back in November 2012. Since then, the tiger population has proliferated in the area and is estimated to have risen to 10, a number that many tiger reserves across the country cannot boast of.

The addition of each tiger means expansion of big cat territory, posing a threat to the farming community in the area.

The PTR authorities’ proposal has been approved in principle by the principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) of UP, Sunil Pandey . “We will be seeking technical and scientific support from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Kanha Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, World Wide Fund for Nature and Wildlife Trust of India as and when needed, said Rajamohan.

“The process will start within two or three days with precise estimation of total tiger population in Amaria area through photos captured by camera traps. As reports have revealed inter-region movement of transient tigers of Uttarakhand’s East Terai forest division up to the agricultural belt of Amaria block, we will segregate them after making their proper identification through the data base of tiger pictures available with the WII,” said Rajamohan.

The authorities plan to capture two tigers at a time. The captured tigers will be kept in special enclosures -- one each in a 15-hectare area in Mala and Mahof forest ranges -- for a period of at least two years to get them to acclimatize to their new surroundings, the field director said. the aim is to ensure that they do not come in contact with any human being and the ""imprint of human contact"" is wiped out from their memory.

“Due to availability of limited space, we will be able to trap only two Amaria tigers at a time,” said Rajamohan.

After the two years, these tigers will be fitted with radio collars, translocated and released into new locations with environmental similarity with the terai belt of UP.

Forest areas in Sohagibarwa Wildlife Sanctuary in Mahrajganj and Sohelwa Wildlife Sanctuary with a joint forest area of Shravasti, Balrampur and Gonda near the Indo-Nepal border are being considered, Rajamohan said.

VADODARA: After the family of five who had gone to visit the Statue of Unity (SoU) on March 1 created a stir with their sudden disappearance from the highway, the mystery deepened on Thursday when the car and bodies of four were recovered from the Narmada canal in Dabhoi.Despite hunting for three km in the vicinity of the car, the body of the fifth person could not be located. The car was found floating in the canal near Tentalav village.Kalpesh Parmar, his wife Trupti, their two children and his mother had gone to visit the SoU on Sunday morning and left for the city at around 7pm in their car.Kalpesh, who is a stock broker, even called up his relative informing him about their returning home. However, the entire family went missing later.When they did not return home till late night, Kalpesh’s grandfather, Bhailal Parmar, who stays in Navapura called up some relatives to inquire if they have visited them. But, when the relatives denied, he approached the Navapura police on Monday which informed the Kevadia police station.A hunt was launched to find out the missing car in which the Parmars were travelling. “We checked CCTV footage of SoU and learnt that the entire family left the premises at about 7 pm. CCTV footage of Vadodara-Dabhoi highway was also scanned and we learnt that the family had stopped at Jayveer Hotel on Dabhoi Road at about 9pm for dinner,” said A M Parmar, PSI, Kevadia police station.Thereafter the car wasn’t seen on the highway in any CCTV recordings en route.Police then focused on Kalpesh’s mobile phone location which revealed that it had got switched off at about 9.45pm near Tentalav, an interior part of Dabhoi and far away from the highway,” said Kalpesh Solanki, deputy SP, Dabhoi.Police suspected that the car may have slipped into the canal and immediately stopped water supply so that levels could recede on Wednesday night.On Thursday morning, a diver spotted the car. Kalpesh, his two children and mother’s body was found inside, but his wife Trupti is still missing. Fire brigade searched for Trupti’s body in the radius of three km in the canal but couldn’t locate her.While the hunt is on to trace the fifth missing person, cops are baffled as to why Kalpesh went off the highway and drove into the interior area.“We have registered a case of accidental death and awaiting post-mortem report.

295,['6/03/2020'],"Authorities remove illegal sheds, stone markers put up on Korattur water body","Chennai: Public Works Department officials and police on Thursday removed stone markers and temporary sheds illegally put up on the Korattur lake , following a TOI news report on February 27. There was some opposition from two people who officials said were lawyers before the demolition was carried out.

A senior PWD official said four acres along the foreshore of the 660-acre water body , which was once a major drinking water source for residents in the vicinity, had been encroached upon. The problem began about four months ago, when a group of people claiming to have ‘bought’ a swathe of the lake began setting up sheds. The group constructed a house there.

Subsequently, a few others laid stones on the same part of the lake, ‘marking’ out their territory for future development. They also dumped construction debris and laid several smaller stones along a stretch that they claimed was the boundary of the lake, the official said. All the violations were committed under the ‘supervision’ of two residents of the area who claimed they had obtained orders from the Madras high court to live in the place.

On Thursday morning, when the PWD authorities visited the spot to remove the encroachments , the two people arrived and resisted the attempt. However, when the officials wanted to see a copy of the order issued by the high court, they were unable to produce it. The two men, officials said, were lawyers who were trying to protect squatters on the lake.

Sekharan, Korattur Yeri Makkal Padhukappu Iyakkam secretary, said another portion of the lake was also encroached upon and named Muthamizh Nagar Housing, with at least 15 concrete homes. The authorities have begun attempts to raze them, but the operation is yet to be completed, he said.

The PWD official said earlier efforts to demolish the structures built on the lake could not be completed as planned. Now, the department is set to remove all encroachments from the lake. The state government has proposed to take up eco-restoration of the lake and will soon make an announcement, he added.

Sekharan said revenue officials had on two occasions in the past demarcated the boundary of the lake, but it had failed to deter encroachers. To avoid further encroachments, the PWD authorities should raise a bund after marking the boundary, he added. “If this is done properly, no encroachments will come up on water bodies.”

The commissioner has asked the officials to lodge police cases against the offenders apart from slapping fines. The civic administration has already started imposing fine on traders for using plastics, but legal action has not been taken against any trader yet.

“In the past five days, the NMC squads, including sanitation and divisional sanitation inspectors, have slapped fines worth Rs 30,000 on six traders for single use plastic,” an NMC official said.

The civic body will also begin a special drive to collect single use plastic from households and six collection centres would soon be set up in all six divisions of the NMC. The NMC has already announced that by May 1 it would make the city free of single use plastic.

“The municipal commissioner recently had a meeting with all six divisional officers to plan and make the city free of single use plastic. The commissioner has directed to fine the traders and lodge FIR against them for violating the plastic ban,” an NMC official said.

“We have been given instructions to collect plastics dumped on the roadside, open spaces, rivers and nullahs across the city. Our target is to make all government and semi-government offices, schools and colleges plastic free by April-end as the municipal commissioner plans to declare the city plastic-free on Maharashtra Diwas i.e. on May 1,” he added.

The official said that a similar drive was conducted across the city in October last year and had received good response from the residents. “We had collected 9 tonne of banned plastics from city residents in just one day,” he said.

Single use plastic has been banned by the state government since June 2018, but the ban is not being implemented effectively.

Taking cognizance of this, state environment minister Aditya Thackeray had recently held a video conference with municipal commissioners and MPCB officials over the ban on single use plastic and had expressed his concerns over lack of implementation of the plastic ban.

VADODARA: Three persons, including a forest department staffer, were arrested on Wednesday for chopping off 677 fully grown trees in Shinor taluka of Vadodara. A local court remanded the trio in police custody until March 11 on Thursday. Accused Arif Mansuri was given contract for chopping off 691 trees for broadening a 12-kilometre stretch of Segva-Malsar road. Arif along with sub-contractor Imran Mansuri chopped off additional 677 trees under supervision of in-charge range forest officer Kaushik Parekh. Forest department officials said that the additional trees which were chopped off include peepal, gulmohar, neem, banyan among others. The value of these trees is Rs45 lakh, cops said.

According to police, forest department had given permission in June 2018 to remove the trees so that the road can be broadened. The department had put markings on the trees which were to be removed. While removing the marked trees, Arif and Imran removed additional trees on both sides of the road. Parekh was responsible to make a daily report of the trees being chopped-off, but he did not report about the additional trees which were removed.

When the forest department learned about the irregularity, an inquiry was conducted by an assistant conservator of forest and the trio was found responsible. Based on the inquiry report, an FIR for cheating and criminal breach of trust was registered at Shinor police station on Wednesday and the trio was arrested. The accused have, however, not revealed what they did with the chopped trees. “Along with chopping off trees, the contractor was also responsible for disposing them off. They would have sold them off to some timber traders,” said a police official.

The best way to stay safe is to clean our hands frequently whenever we touch a new object,” he said.The IPM director said they were supplying preventive equipment like glouses, shoe covers, spectacles, etc., to doctors and medical staff at all the hospitals where patients were being tested. “Nine hospitals in various districts have been identified and testing facilities are being extended to them,” he added.Reddy said any laboratory to test the virus could be established only under the aegis of National Institute of Virology , Pune, and the Indian Council of Medical Research. “One such authorised lab has been established in Gandhi Hospital, which has capacity to test and analyse 100 to 200 samples every day,” he informed the court.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74503048,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-focus-on-slums-to-check-virus-spread/articleshow/74501311.cms

Even residents of Padmaraonagar too want the isolation ward be moved out of their vicinity.Junior doctors on Thursday gave a representation to Gandhi Hospital superintendent Dr Shravan Kumar to take immediate measures to shift the isolation ward from the hospital to the outskirts. “We request you to kindly look at shifting the isolation centre from Gandhi hospital to a better location. Gandhi being a super-specialty hospital consisting of many immunocompromised patients, the disease can spread easily. Since people from across Telangana come here for treatment, it makes it easy for transmission of disease into villages,” the doctors said in their letter.When TOI visited the hospital, it was observed that the isolation ward for corona is on the seventh floor of the building which is located at a distance from main building of the hospital. Sources inside the hospital informed that the building housing the isolation ward has a few other wards but there is a 30 to 40 metre distance between wards.However, despite authorities clarifying that measures were being taken, medical students suggested that the isolation ward be shifted to the outskirts of the city. “Even as the entry into the main building is restricted to the suspects of Coronavirus, other in-patient wards are located in the same building where the isolation ward has been set up,” a medical student told TOI.Meanwhile, the Padmaraonagar Colony association has shot off a representation to health minister Eatala Rajender urging that the isolation ward be shifted out of Gandhi Hospital. Citing that the four family members of the Covid-19 positive patient had tested negative despite being in close contact with the patient, state health minister Eatala Rajender said: “The demand by junior doctors is an irresponsible one as transmission doesn’t happen whenever a person comes in contact with a patient. It spreads through cough and sneeze droplets and is not air-borne.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74501360,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89625,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gandhi-medicos-want-isolation-wards-moved-to-city-outskirts/articleshow/74501363.cms

305,['6/03/2020'],"In 10 years, state saw 15k H1N1 cases and 532 deaths","Bengaluru: Karnataka has reported 14,917 cases of H1N1 Influenza A since 2010, of which 532 led to deaths. This includes the 256 cases and three deaths — one each in Bengaluru Rural, Davanagere and Tumakuru districts — witnessed between January 1 to March 4 this year.

The viral infection had created a panic situation in 2008-09 with people standing in queues for hours together at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Disease (RGICD) where the drug, Tamiflu, was available. Over the years, H1N1 hasn’t triggered panic like Covid-19 as people have developed herd immunity against it.

Dr Shashidhar Buggi, who helmed RGICD during the H1N1 outbreak in 2008-09, said, “The man v/s viruses is a recurring fight. The only difference between the Covid-19 threat now and the H1N1 outbreak in 2008 is that we had medicines ready then. Tamiflu was given to all family members of the patient. People developed herd immunity over months and the fear subsided.”

According to Dr Mahesh Kumar, senior consultant physician at Narayana Health, H1N1 cases are seen routinely and some have led to complications. “H1N1 can lead to viral pneumonia in some cases, which can be serious. We have three such cases in our ICU at present. All three are middle-aged male patients who are constantly being monitored. In contrast to this, no Covid-19 case in India till now has seen any complication apart from fever. In a hot country like India, the virus will not survive for a longer duration,” he said.

He said when healthy people wear masks, they constantly touch their face to adjust it, which is riskier. “There is no need for healthy people to wear masks. Those who cough or sneeze can wear them to prevent the infection from spreading to others,” he added.

“Avoid being in crowded places. Washing hands is very important. So is active tracing of cases,” said Dr Buggi.

Dr KS Satish, pulmonologist, said there is no drastic increase or decrease in H1N1 cases seen in the city. “It’s no more a seasonal infection. There is herd immunity and the fear has reduced over the years. We know how to identify, diagnose and treat such H1N1 cases. The same will happen with Covid-19 also in the days to come,” he said.

307,['6/03/2020'],Smart City construction dust a health hazard at TT stadium,"Construction under the Smart City project is underway next to the stadium

BHOPAL: At the first look, Tatya Tope stadium — housing 18 sports academies and 450 national and international players — might appear clean, but presence of minute dust particles, due to ongoing construction of Smart City, has become a health hazard for the athletes here.

Training as well as health of some of the most promising national and international medallists at Tatya Tope stadium is currently at stake.

The situation is such that even athletes of outdoor games are forced to practice in rooms or halls. The annual summer camp organised at the stadium, which sees around 5000 children each year, hangs in limbo due to this.

Staff of the sports medicine centre told TOI, that health of the players is in danger due to this perpetual dust; strong measures have to taken to eradicate the problem. “Dust may contain microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are small enough to get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems,” said Dr Jince Thomas Mathew and added, “The particle size is a major determinant of how seriously it will affect the health, especially when it comes to lung diseases and heart ailment. Here at Tatya Tope stadium, both small and large particles are present. This issue needs immediate attention.”

Small particles of less than 2.5 micrometres in aerodynamic diameter (called PM2.5) pose the greatest threat because they can get deep into the lungs and some may enter the bloodstream. Particles that are smaller than 10 micrometres in aerodynamic diameter (called PM10) can also have serious health effect on susceptible individuals if the concentration is high enough,” he said.

Assistant director of the stadium, Vikas Kharadkar said, “We are not against the construction work but our biggest concern is our players. We run over a dozen sports academies where national and international medallists are training, so we have to safeguard their health. We have already raised the issue with the concern authorities.”

Some of the international players have also expressed their concern about the dust at the stadium. “It is indeed a major issue. For the development, construction is required, but that should not be at the cost of players’ health who are making the state and country proud at the national and international level,” said well-known snooker player, Kamal Chawla.

On the cancellation of the convocation, Sarabhai wrote that she was not given a reason (for the same). ‘I have still not been contacted. A convocation sans chief guest will take place on the 7th,’ she wrote in the post, adding that she’s posting the speech she was ‘not allowed to give.’The 300-plus students from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Bengaluru campus were left in the lurch when the convocation was cancelled four days prior to the event. Internal communication suggested a re-scheduled event on March 7 but so far NID has not given out any official invites or put the event on their website or social media accounts.In her speech, she pointed out that prior to her, only one woman – Kapila Vatsyayan – was the chief guest at the ceremony. She also expressed her early fascination with design, texture and textiles thanks to ‘Amma,’ her mother and celebrated danseuse Mrinalini. She also brushed upon her jewellery venture ‘Tamasha.’ She reminisced photo shoots with traditional Gujarati fare.“We live in troubling times. Over the last few hundred years humans have come to believe that we are the centre of the universe and the universe exists to serve us… This system values the biggest as the best.

310,['6/03/2020'],Shiv Sena to boycott standing panel chairman election today,"Nashik: Shiv Sena has decided to boycott the polls for electing the standing committee chairman of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) scheduled to be held on Friday.

Only Ganesh Gite, a BJP candidate, has filed his nomination for the post. Sena did not field any candidate as per the party’s legal experts’ opinion.

Sena sources said the party has decided to keep away from polls as they can inform the high court on Monday about not taking part in the elections since its demand for increasing the party’s strength is yet to be met.

The election for the post of the standing committee chairperson is being held following high court’s directive to the civic administration to hold election with secret ballot on March 6.

The directive came after BJP group leader, Jagdish Patil, had moved court challenging state urban development department’s stay over appointment of eight new members of the standing committee and town secretary’s decision to stay elections for the post of the standing panel chairman.

Sena group leader Vilas Shinde had complained to the urban development department accusing mayor Satish Kulkarni of appointing more BJP members in the panel although its strength in the civic body had reduced after the state assembly polls.

After the high court directive, on Monday, the administration started the election process and Thursday was the last day for filing nominations.

The urban development department of the state government had also directed the municipal commissioner to submit the status reports on comparative strength of political parties in standing committee.

Accordingly, the municipal commissioner on Tuesday sent the status report which indicated that the strength of Shiv Sena in the standing committee should be increased by one member and strength of the BJP should be slashed by one.

“Legal experts have advised us not to contest elections as it will give a message that the party has agreed to the process being carried out. We will file a separate petition in court based on the status reports of the civic chief,” a senior Shiv Sena leader said.

“We are confident that Gite will be the next standing committee chairman of NMC,” the mayor said.

MADURAI: A one-month-old baby girl was murdered by her parents and buried next to their house in a suspected case of female infanticide, in a village near Checkanurani in Madurai district. DSP A Raja said they suspect that the child was murdered by feeding cactus milk, an age-old practice once prevalent in the Usilampatti region, infamous for female infanticide.

The sudden demise of the baby born on January 30 created a stir in the village. Suspecting that she could have been murdered, it was the villagers who alerted the local police. Subsequently, district superintendent of police N Manivannan ordered a detailed inquiry. A team led by Usilampatti deputy superintendent of police A Raja was pressed into action under the guidance of additional superintendent of police S Vanitha. The police picked up the baby’s parents V Sowmiya, 22, and S Vairamurugan, 32, from Pullaneri village as also Vairamurugan’s father S Singathevar.

Police officials said the accused spilled the beans during the inquiry. Checkanurani police registered a case under IPC section 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and arrested the trio after obtaining a complaint from village administrative officer Mandhakalai. They will be produced before judicial magistrate and lodged in prison. S Vanitha told TOI that the couple already had a two-and-a-half-year-old girl when Sowmiya gave birth to another girl at a PHC in Chellampatti.

Although they have registered a murder case, they have not invoked the act related to female infanticide. That will be decided during the course of inquiry based on its merit, she said. However, it will be clear only after getting the postmortem report. The body was exhumed in the presence of revenue officials on Thursday and postmortem conducted with the help of a medical team on the spot, he said. Vairamurugan was working as a load man in Simmakkal. They had told villagers that the child, who frequently fell ill, died due to a health problem. But that did not convince the villagers and one of them called up the police, DSP Raja said.

It was in November that a 15-day-old baby girl died under unexplained circumstances at Kunjampatt village near Usilampatti and was buried without informing the police. The body of the children was subsequently exhumed and postmortem conducted. Officials say they had registered a suspicious death case and are waiting for lab reports to proceed further in the case.

Vehicular movement was disrupted for over half an hour as the protesters blocked the highway and threw onions. The protest was led by Nashik district president of NCP, Ravindra Pagar.

“The rise in onion production has led to crash in wholesale prices. The ban on onion export should be immediately lifted, but the government has declared the rollback will be from March 15,” said Pagar.

The NCP leader said the government should have immediately withdrawn the ban as it will help in stabilising the onion prices, which have been falling due to rise in supply.

“The demand for onions from the country is decreasing in the global market due to continuous interference of the BJP government at the Centre. Farmers are in financial trouble because they are not even being able to meet the production cost,” he said.

On March 02, farmers had stopped onion auction at various APMCs in Nashik district, including Lasalgaon due to a crash in prices. The average wholesale price declined from Rs 2,150 per quintal on Friday to Rs 1,450 per quintal on Monday.

Some farmers had even blocked roads near APMCs like Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon, Deola and Yeola in protest against the Centre for not withdrawing the ban on onion export.

On Monday, the Union commerce ministry issued a notification regarding lifting of ban on onion export on March 15.

Meanwhile, the average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 1,550 per quintal at Lasalgaon APMC on Thursday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 500 and Rs 1,730 per quintal respectively.

KOLLAM: The state’s oldest students, Bhageerathi Amma and Karthyayani Amma , will be honoured with the Naari Shakti Puraskar, instituted by the Union ministry of woman and child development.

Bhageerathi Amma, aged 105, had cleared the fourth standard equivalency exam of the Kerala state literacy mission.

Karthiyayani Amma, 96, of Haripad won first rank in the Aksharalaksham literacy examination in 2018. She scored 98 out of 100 marks and is now preparing for the fourth standard equivalency course.

Though both are to receive the award from President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapathi Bhavan on Women’s Day which falls on Sunday, an excited Bhageerathi Amma informed the Kollam district collector that she would not be travelling to New Delhi.

The award comprises a citation and memento each and a purse of Rs 2 lakh, which would be shared by the two women.

The state government is now trying to send a representative on Bhageerathi Amma’s behalf to New Delhi to receive the award, or arrange for handing over the award at her residence in Prakkulam in a befitting manner.

Karthyayani Amma said she is eagerly waiting for meeting the President. “I also wish to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi . I don’t know whether it will happen or not,” she said.

TOI had reported Bhageerathi Amma's attempt to appear for the literacy 4th standard equivalency examination on November 20, 2019. It was also reported that she was not considered for social security pension since she did not possess a Aadhaar card. Advanced age was making it difficult to record her biometric details.

Responding to the report, officials of the Bank of India’s Nirmanakara branch approached the TOI and offered to take extra efforts to record her biometric details. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned her achievement in his monthly Mann Ki Baat. Following this, bank officials and Aadhaar authorities jointly recorded her biometric details last week, and she will get her Aadhaar card in a few days.

Thrikkaruva panchayath authorities have assured her of completing the formalities for granting her pension on the same day the Aadhaar is generated.

Saravana Selvarathnam stores made the cheque payment based on the direction of the consumer grievances redressal forum in Tirunelveli district last week.

Counsel A Bramma, who appeared for the consumer, C Chokendra Pandian, 59, said his client purchased lamp oil from the Saravana Selvarathnam store located on South bypass road at Melapalayam, Tirunelveli city, on March 1, 2018 for Rs 102. “While the bar-coded sticker fixed by the manufacturer read Rs 102, the actual MRP label of the company stated that the price was Rs 95 in Tamil Nadu and Rs 100 for rest of India,” the counsel said and added that Chokendra Pandian brought it to the notice of the branch manager. However, the manager refused to give back the extra money and also insulted the consumer in the presence of others. The upset consumer called the office of the shop owner but he was once again humiliated by the person at the other end. Unable to get a solution from the store and officials concerned, he approached the consumer grievances redressal forum.

On completion of the trial, forum president F Devadas and members S Sivanmoorthi and M Muthulakshmi passed the orders last week directing the store to pay a compensation of Rs 20,007 to the consumer. It included a compensation of Rs 15,000, legal expenses of Rs 5,000 borne by the consumer and repayment of Rs 7 charged extra from him.

Currently, a team of 65 personnel from APHO works in shifts to carry out round-the-clock medical screening of international arriving passengers, said a source. On Wednesday, the government extended the screening to all international passengers.

“Each passenger isn’t individually screened for high temperature or other symptoms like cough and breathlessness. Most pass through thermal scanners, which are monitored by APHO staff. But given the high volumes handled by the Mumbai airport, we need more staff if effective screening of all passengers has to be done,” said a source.

So what is the procedure currently followed at the airport? “On board an arriving flight, announcements are made and passengers on all international flights have to fill out a self-declaration form,” said an airline source. The form asks for the list the countries the passenger visited in the past 14 days, whether they have high temperature, cough, and so on.

“On landing, every international passenger passes through zones that are being captured by thermal scanners. Some are readily visible, you can see the stationary cameras pointed to take images of passengers walking by. Some are stealthily hidden, probably to screen passengers who try to avoid the scanners,” said an airline pilot who operated an international flight on Wednesday.

The second kind of screening is more intrusive and is largely used for passengers arriving on direct flights from countries battling a Covid-19 outbreak. After exiting the aerobridge and before reaching the immigration counter, passengers fall into a queue where they face a hand-held camera that scans for high body temperatures, said a source. “The airport has four stationary thermal scanner cameras and 25 hand-held devices that take the temperature,” said a source. Depending on the traffic, there are four-eight counters for hand-held thermometers.

Passengers who have fever or cough are sent for further medical examination where they are asked about their travel and health-related details to ascertain if they should be quarantined.

Meanwhile, National Disaster Response Force has begun conducting Coronavirus awareness programs for immigration, ground staff and luggage handlers, said Mahesh Nalavade, deputy commandant, NDRF. A total of 65,621 passengers have been screened since January 18.

317,['6/03/2020'],Detailed project reports of Rs 217cr to upgrade 4 STPs,"Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has sent detailed project reports (DPRs) worth Rs 217 crore to the state government for upgrading four sewage treatment plants (STP).

The DPRs will be forwarded by the state government to National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD). Currently, there are a total of 10 STPs in the city of which, nine are old — including three at Panchaki and two each at Chehedi, Agar Takli and Tapovan.

The tenth STP was built recently at Gangapur and it started operations around four ago. The total sewage treating capacity of these 10 STPs is 350 million litre daily (MLD). The 9 old STPs are treating 290 MLD of sewage.

According to Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), the Biological oxygen demand (BOD) of nine old STPs is up to 26-30 and it wants the NMC to bring it down to 10. This is also one of the reasons causing pollution of Godavari river as the treated sewage with higher BOD is being released.

Now, the NMC has decided to upgrade the existing STPs to reduce the BOD and the work will start after the funds are received from the Centre.

While the DRP cost for two STPs in Tapovan is estimated at Rs 111 crore, the cost of other two STPs in Agartakli area of the city is estimated at Rs 106 crore.

“We have deployed an Ahmedabad-based agency to chalk out the DPR for upgrading the nine STPs. The agency has submitted the DPR of four STPs following proper study and inspection,” a civic official said.

“We are in the process to prepare DPRs for upgrading other five STPs through the same agency. We are expecting to complete the DPRs in next few months,” he added.

Jagdish Patil, group leader of ruling BJP in the NMC, said a delegation of BJP corporators will meet the union ministers in Delhi next month to get the necessary funds for various civic development works.

318,['6/03/2020'],Amayizhanjan Canal back to its sorry state,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Barely a year after the city corporation launched a project to clean the Amayizhanjan Canal at Thampanoor, the water body has returned to its old state, choking with all kinds of trash. The flow of water has also been affected as waste has accumulated in the water body.

In 2019, the city corporation launched Amayizhanjan canal cleaning project at a cost of Rs 50 lakh and backed out owing to multiple challenges. The cleaning was done from Panavila to Thampanoor. While disposal of waste had been a major concern, access to the canal was equally difficult. A temporary pathway was made at a spot near Panavila to facilitate entry of earth mover. Two manual labourers were engaged to clear the waste. The presence of a huge water tank near railway station also posed trouble for deploying the machines. The civic body had convened an all-party meeting in which it was decided to set up aerobic bins and material recovery facilities at Rajaji Nagar to deal with waste generated in the colony.

A two-day cleaning drive was held in May 2019 to clean Amayizhanjan Canal from Kannamoola to Akkulam.

In 2015, a major cleaning drive for the canal was held as part of Operation Anantha. The results of this work did not reflect for long as the canal soon turned to be a dumping spot for illegal waste collectors and waste from neighbouring households. Of late, the canal has been irremediably filled with plastic waste and the flow of the canal had stopped months back.

The local residents have been on protest mode near the Mosque Lane due to clogging of waste in the canal.

The irrigation department is also set to launch a project for Amayizhanjan canal worth Rs 25 crore. Chief engineer (irrigation and administration) had prepared a proposal to the tune of Rs 25 crore for cleaning of Amayizhanjan Canal along the Kannamoola–Akkulam Lake stretch and for construction of retaining walls to prevent flooding.

The officials have repeatedly pointed out that until the households in the nearby areas of the canal become self-sufficient in waste management, the investment that would go into Amayizhanjan Canal would be a sheer waste.

In spite of several efforts of the city corporation many residents have not co-operated with decentralized waste management plan. With corporation strengthening patrol in highways, many illegal waste collectors have been dumping waste in water bodies, including the Amayizhanjan Canal.

BHOPAL: In an affidavit submitted to a division bench of the high court on Wednesday, the Union government’s department of health & research (DHR) has claimed to have done all it could do to revive the Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre ( BMHRC ), a premier hospital constructed at the behest of the Supreme Court to provide medical care to survivors of 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.

The affidavit signed by Agnes Xalxo, deputy director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that post-graduate medical courses would commence at BMHRC soon and all the efforts are being made to fill up the vacant faculty positions so that the hospital can function efficiently.

“All efforts are being made to fill up the vacant faculty positions so that the hospital can function efficiently. Availability of adequate faculty shall also facilitate approval of competent authorities for commencement of post-graduate medical courses in the hospital”, the ICMR official said in the affidavit.

He said that since the last hearing in the case the competent authority has approved commencement of PG courses in BMHRC.

The affidavit said, “To begin with, the PG course will start in the department of anaesthesia, which has the requisite faculty and subsequently in other departments after obtaining essentiality certificate from the state government and consent from the affiliating university.”

Deputy director general of ICMR said commencement of post-graduate medical courses at BMHRC would not only help and retain doctors but also help in mitigation of shortage of specialist doctors in various disciplines. “With the faculty in position, BMHRC will be able to put in greater efforts into teaching, research and innovations in medical education and public health areas”, he said.

Regarding appointment of new doctors, the official said, “Interviews for selection of candidates for direct recruitment as assistant professor, associate professors and professors were held from February 8 to 11, 2020. Eight suitable candidates — seven assistant professors and one associate professor — were selected and results declared. The offer of appointments to seven selected candidates were issued till March 27, 2020 and appointment to the remaining candidate will be issued as soon as his medical report is received”, he said.

But, co-convener of Bhopal Group for Information &Action, Rachna Dhingra said, “Most of what they have said in the affidavit is incorrect and an attempt to mislead the court. The court had asked them to give step-by-step account on what they have done in compliance to the Supreme Court order of August, 2012 but they didn’t do that. As far as fresh recruitment of doctors is concerned, not a single doctor has joined the hospital till now”.

Police have identified the victim as S M Muniappan, an earthmover operator and the accused as A Veerasangili Murugan, 28, who is married to Muniappan’s younger sister.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that Murugan, an alcoholic used to fight frequently with his wife and family members. There was also a property dispute between Muniappan’s family and some of their relatives.

Despite the dispute, Muniappan’s family invited those families for the wedding. This infuriated Murugan as he felt disrespected by his in-laws.

Late on Wednesday night, Murugan went to Muniappan’s house in an inebriated condition and picked up a quarrel with his in-laws. An argument broke out between Muniappan and Murugan during which the former slapped the latter. Feeling humiliated, Murugan left the place and slept in the neighbour’s house, police said.

At around 1.30am on Thursday, when Muniappan, his mother and sister were sleeping, Murugan entered the house and murdered Muniappan by slitting his throat with a vegetable knife.

The Sivagiri police rushed to the spot and sent the body to the Sivagiri government hospital for autopsy. Murugan was arrested.

The village was sunk in grief as the murder took place a day before the wedding.

This was communicated in separate responses to TOI and Kanyakumari MP H Vasanthakumar.

“The Embassy of India, Tehran and our Consulate in Bandar Abbas is in constant touch with the Indian fishermen stranded in Bushehr province (in the city of Asaluyeh) and Hormozgan province (in Kish Island and Chiruyeh). As per our inquiries, the fishermen are in good health and are not infected with COVID-19. They have been advised to follow necessary precautions during their stay here,” it said in response to email queries sent by TOI.

Though the embassy is in the process of collecting particulars of Indians – including fishermen and students – they have not made any mention of efforts taken by them for repatriating them to India, which is the prime demand put forward by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and the fishermen. “Two days ago three embassy officials went to Kish Island and talked to the fishermen there,” said a fisherman adding that they were talking in favour of the boat owners. Videos recorded by Indian fishermen showing embassy officials explaining that there is no COVID-19 scare in Kish are also being circulated in social media. “We have not been to sea for eight days. Looks like embassy officials are supporting Kafils (boat owners),” a fisherman said adding they are under pressure from Kafils to go fishing. Fishermen who are in the Chiruyeh fishing harbour claim that embassy officials have not been there. “We filled forms sent by them with our particulars and have been expecting them here over the last two days,” a fisherman said. It is said that there are about 320 Indian fishermen including 188 from TN and 120 from Gujarat in Chiruyeh.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Corporation, which spends a considerable sum for collection and transportation of dry waste in city, is set for a tie-up with Clean Kerala Company (CKC) to collect and transport empty beer and liquor bottles.

In what is being touted as a pilot project under extended producer responsibility (EPR), CKC has proposed setting up collection bins in select material recovery centres (MRC) of the corporation. CKC has inked another pact with Kerala state beverages corporation (Bevco) for collection and recycling of empty liquor and beer bottles.

As per the proposal, corporation will earn Rs 5/kg for glass bottles and beer bottles, Rs 10/kg for plastic bottles and Rs 7.50/kg for cans. CKC has identified 10 MRCs where collection bins, exclusively for beer and liquor bottles, would be placed.

As per the order issued by environment department regarding the ban on plastic, Bevco, Kerafed, Milma and KWA were directed to take up EPR by which plastic products being sold will be taken back, based on specified rates.

EPR is a statutory requirement for all producers and brand owners who sell or import electronic goods, plastic products, packaged goods and all manufacturers of disposable products such as tin, glass, plastic packaging, etc. Pollution control board (PCB) has mandated that it is the duty of producers and brand owners to take steps to channelize waste to authorized dismantler or recycler to ensure environment-friendly waste management.

A position paper on EPR prepared by corporation showed that collection and transportation of plastic waste through MRC accounts for 20-30% of the actual cost being incurred for disposal of dry waste from households in city. The civic body spends a sizable sum for manual labour being employed at collection centres and for conducting special collection drives based on dry waste collection calendar.

At present, corporation collects Rs 820/tonne for collection and transportation of glass waste. The civic body also earns rates for six types of waste as well ranging between 50 paise to Rs 4/kg for segregated dry waste, coconut shell, husk, firewood, e-waste and hard plastic.

The new venture with CKC is expected to relieve the financial burden of corporation that has decided to broaden non-biodegradable waste management with micro-level segregation and storage focusing on recovery of saleable types.

The dry waste, which is now being collected and stored through special collection drives, dry waste collection hubs and MRC will be categorized as 16 different types which will include paper, pet bottles, hard plastic, white plastic covers, colour plastic, milk cover, oil cover, multi-layer cover, carry bags, bags, sandals, rubber, coconut shell, firewood, clothes and others.

The persons also used a forged rubber stamp of the tehsildar’s office in the document and submitted it to the Pashan property registration office. The police on Wednesday lodged an FIR and booked the unidentified persons after nayab tehsildar Sanjay Pandurang Bhosale (50) of Aundh lodged a complaint.

Senior police inspector Anil Shewale said, “The document urged the authorities to remove the names of two women from the property papers. The local talati became suspicious after seeing the signature of the tehsildar and the rubber stamp mark in the document.”

He told TOI, “The signature and the rubber stamp had the date of May 2019. It was found following an inquiry within the office that no such document was processed by the tehsildar’s office. The revenue officials realized that the tehsildar’s signature was forged and the rubber stamp fabricated.”

The officer said the persons had prepared the fabricated document to make fresh entries of names in the property papers without the two women’s mention.

“The suspects also tried to make fresh land records of the property, such as 7/12 land extract, without the women’s names. We have called the property holders to discuss the issue with them and find clues about who had prepared and submitted the fake document,” Shewale said.

Of the amount donated by Vijay Raundal of the 1983 school batch, Rs 42 lakh has been set aside to build a seminar hall and sports activity area in the memory of his parents.

The Rs 4 lakh cash donated by the teachers will be used for build a concrete assembly area of 1,500 sqft, confirmed the school authorities.

School principal Gulabrao Bhamre said, “A total of 4,400 students study in our school in two shifts. We conduct several activities, for which we required some concrete space. The teachers said that donating for the students would be of a greater cause and I could not resist their proposal,” he said.

“The area will also have a basketball post. It will be ready for the students in 15 days.”

The Maratha Vidya Prasarak Samaj trust runs the school, which was built in 1936 and has undergone several changes since then. It currently has 59 divisions from Class V to Class X.

Neelimatai Pawar, general secretary of the trust, said “Raundal has donated Rs 1 crore last year, of which some part was given for the infrastructure of the school and the rest will be used for the scholarship of the students. It is a big gesture by the alumnus.”

Hindi teacher P L Murkute said that students gather daily and sing the national anthem before the classes begin. “Their clothes get dirty if they sit on the ground. They never complain but we felt that constructing a concrete assembly area would be a small thing for us to do.”

“Raundal is a businessman from Pune who has studied in our school. The hall that he wants to build on an area of 7,000 sqft will be ready by June this year. The students will be able to play indoor games, like table tennis, and have co-curricular activities,” said Bhamre.

“I have donated Rs 1 crore to the school in March 2019, of which Rs 42 lakh is being used for the school infrastructure. A provision of Rs 40 lakh has been made by the school to give as scholarships to the best male and female athletes every year. With the rest of the money, we have bought a dialysis machine for the medical college run by the trust. It is the least I could do for my alma mater,” Raundal told TOI.

The alumni of the school had also donated Rs 38,000 and Rs 34,000 in the past, from which 32 classrooms were turned into smart classes.

H V Mahale, the accountant of the school, said, “Nearly 500 of our alumni are in constant touch with us. They make it a point to visit the school after settling in life. We never ask them for donations but they insist on contributing.”

No one deserves to go to sleep on an empty stomach,” says Dr Neelima Arya, founder of NGO Apple Homes that aims to tackle such problems.

Most prominent among Dr Neelima’s initiatives is ‘Feed the Need’ under which she has installed free-for-all refrigerators across Hyderabad. “One person’s excess can be sustenance for someone else. Through Feed the Need, we seek to bridge that gap. If one has excess food, instead of throwing it away, they can put it in one of our refrigerators from where a person in need can take it,” says Dr Neelima.

So far, her team has set up 35 kiosks across the city in places such as Madhapur, Banjara Hills, Ameerpet among others. The initiative, has been met with stupendous response. Started with a personal investment of Rs 7 lakh, it is now carried forward by donations from private individuals and groups.

“My wife is admitted at the Indo-American cancer hospital and a lot of my savings have gone in treatment and transportation. I was told about the refrigerator by another patient’s attendant. It has come as a major relief,” says a patient’s attendant using the refrigerator on Banjara Hills, Road No 10.

Through this initiative, Dr Neelima hopes to inspire more people to replicate the model in other parts of India. But her efforts don’t stop at this. Under her second programme, ‘She Needs’ that aims to tackle taboos associated with menstrual hygiene, her NGO provides sanitary napkin dispensers and incinerators at public places. The third initiative ‘We Need’ works on empowering farmers.

“Under it, I want to promote organic farming and agriculture education,” Dr Neelima says, adding, “We know nothing about how the food on our table is produced. Through this initiative farmers, while earning from their produce, will also become educators.”

Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh said that a special drive was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday to check if shopkeepers and pan stall owners near schools, colleges and others were selling tobacco products.

Officials from all units of the crime branch took part in the drive.

While 132 establishments were found selling tobacco products, such as cigarettes, pan masala, raw tobacco and others, near educational institutions on Wednesday, 50 cases were filed till late afternoon on Thursday.

The seized tobacco products on Wednesday amounted to Rs1.21lakh. Police have filed compounding offences against shopkeepers and pan stall owners whose products were seized. The worth of the products seized on Thursday is yet to be ascertained.

The offences against the establishments were filed under the provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003.

Many citizens had complained to the police about illegal sale of tobacco products near the educational premises in the city.

Police said that majority of shopkeepers and pan stall owners found in the vicinity of schools or colleges were from the old parts of the city, Satara Road, Deccan and other places.

Smoking of cigarettes near the premises of educational institutions is also banned, police said.

Singh said that many tobacco products seized by the police do not have the statutory health hazard warning on the packets.

The law states that tobacco products cannot be sold to persons below the age of 18 years, and in places within the 100-yard radius from the outer boundary of an institution, such as school, colleges and institutions of higher learning established or recognised by an appropriate authority.

But if the vehicle is not removed by the owner, then we will record it as an abandoned vehicle,” she said.

Such abandoned vehicles will then be towed away to Moshi. A record of these vehicles will be kept at police stations and traffic police branches for public to peruse. “The traffic police will give the owners one month to claim these vehicles,” Jadhav said.

Through a circular in 2018, the state government had issued guidelines to traffic police and the RTO to register details of abandoned vehicles and remove them.

Shrikant Savane, joint city engineer, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, said, “The municipal bodies have been told to provide necessary facilities/land to store these vehicles after they are removed from the roads. The RTO will find the details of the owners and collect fine — comprising towing charges, security expenditure and other sundries.”

The civic body has appointed two contractors to provide towing facilities. “We have also provided a one hectare plot in Moshi for this purpose. The plot will have CCTV surveillance, adequate lighting and security guards,” Savane said.

Last year, PCMC’s Pune counterpart had spent nearly Rs16 lakh towing vehicles abandoned along the riverbed to a lot in Balewadi. The Pune civic body has spent a total of Rs50 lakh towing abandoned vehicles from across the city to the riverbed.

331,['6/03/2020'],Coronavirus check: Organisers of big events must furnish affidavit,"Nashik: With the rising number of coronavirus cases being reported from across the country, the Nashik district administration is taking steps to discourage people from holding mass gatherings. The officials said people will not be allowed to host big gatherings unless they provide an affidavit saying that they would strictly follow the advisory against the spread of the virus.

The district administration has also warned people against hoarding medicines, overcharging the same and giving false medical advice to others.

Collector Suraj Mandhare — while briefing the media after the video conference conducted by state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta — said there was no reason for panic, but at the same time appealed to people to join the fight against the virus by using preventive measures.

“First, we will have to stop all mass gatherings across the district to ensure that people do not come in contact with known or unknown carriers of the disease. Second, if people must conduct any event, they will have to furnish an affidavit saying that they would take all the measures required to contain the spread of the virus,” Mandhare said.

The measures include ensuring at least 3-ft distance between two people, instruments to thermally scan people, ample supply of alcohol-based handwash, complete travel history of any persons coming from abroad — foreign national or Indian — and many others.

The collector said this virus can be treated symptomatically, though a single compound to fight it is not available yet. Mandhare added if anyone fails to abide by the guidelines, the administration would not allow the event.

The administration has also warned the chemists and druggists against hoarding medicines that may be required by the common man to treat other illnesses. “If anybody is found hoarding medicines, the medical masks and other things, the administration will take the strictest action against them. The same will be the fate of those found selling goods at exorbitant rates and the ones who are propagating fake messages through any media,” Mandhare added.

332,['6/03/2020'],"Rain seeping deep cause for Palghar tremors, says study","PUNE: Rain could be responsible for the consecutive, low intensity, earthquakes in Palghar near Mumbai, scientists from National Centre for Seismology, India Meteorological Department and CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad and other institutes have found.So far, more than 16,000 earthquakes of magnitude −0.5 to 3.8 have been recorded. They continue even now.After heavy rain in this region, copious water seeped into the earth and its movement could be causing tremors, the scientists said. Palghar district is the northernmost part of Konkan which experiences heavy rain.There is fear that the smaller earthquakes in this region could be a prelude to an imminent, bigger and more catastrophic earthquake. The research that attributes the tremors to rain allays such fears.In November 2018, a low magnitude earthquake swarm, a sequence of seismic events in a local area in a short time, with a rumbling sound occurred close to Dhundhalwadi villages in Palghar.The swarm started after the monsoon season and was on the decline in May–June 2019, but the frequency increased during the monsoon in June 2019.The enhanced earthquake activity suggests that the swarm was probably triggered by the monsoon.“The satellite analysis revealed shallow below-surface process of precipitated rain water movement, leading to the collapse of underground earth cavities in the village. Therefore, the earthquakes in Palghar may not be linked with the tectonic plate movement, but with rain,” Vineet K Gahalaut, scientist, CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad said.Scientists have been monitoring the tremor, locating them accurately, finding them in a 30km area surrounding Dhundhalwadi village at a shallow depth of up to 6km with very clustered epicentres, Gahalaut said.“It is most likely that these earthquakes are caused by the percolation of rainfall water at a depth and the collapse of underground cavities due to this gushing flow. Such occurrences may not lead to a bigger earthquake,” he added.Two methods were adopted in the study, including earthquake monitoring and interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Five seismographs were installed around the region of earthquakes.Other institutes involved in the study included National Centre for Seismology, New Delhi, ISRO-Space Applications Centre Ahmedabad, Institute of Seismological Research, Ahmedabad.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city police are winning praises on social media for their intervention in returning a stolen helmet to a two-wheeler owner within 24 hours of a complaint being registered. The police personnel at Kazhakoottam police station under Kazhakootam Cyber City police subdivision are the one who are receiving the laurels after the complainant, Jerin, a techie hailing from Tamil Nadu posted his experience on social media. It was the quick and responsible action of the police on a seemingly unimportant complaint related to a helmet theft that prompted Jerin to post it on social media.

Jerin had lost his costly helmet on Saturday at the Kariavattom Greenfield Stadium where the annual celebrations of the company he works for was held. Two days later, he spotted his helmet listed on the website of OLX where people place advertisements for selling used products.

He had conducted a search on OLX and similar websites, assuming that the thief would try to sell the helmet as it was a costly one.

He then approached the Kazhakootam police with a complaint on Monday night, albeit with little hope. To his surprise, the next day itself the police summoned him to the police station and gave back his helmet. Jerin wrote on social media that he wasn’t expecting a quick action because he felt that police had more important cases to attend to.

Officers with the Kazhakootam police station said that the helmet went through three hands before ending up on OLX.

“A staff of a roadside eatery near the entrance of the stadium had spotted the helmet lying beside the road. He took it and gave it to a friend. His friend, who already had a helmet, gave it to another friend. Since he too had a helmet, he tried to sell it,” said sub-inspector Santhosh Kumar adding that the men were given a warning and let off after being told that they should approach the police next time they found a lost object.

The SI added that the thief could have abandoned the helmet after stealing it for the fear of getting caught.

According to police, the dharna was initially launched by a group of women at Mohd Ali Park, but it was later called off after the protesters submitted a memorandum to district and police officials. However, the accused had coaxed the women protesters to resume the demonstration and protest continue protesting.

The crowd of protesters had assembled in the middle of the road, which affected traffic movement in the entire area. They had also reportedly heckled police personnel and also raised communally sensitive slogans. “The protest was in violation of the order on unlawful assembly issued by district administration,” said sub-inspector of Chamanganj police station Pramod Rao .

The SI added that the unlawful assembly of crowd also caused inconvenience to other residents of the area.

“The accused have been booked under sections141, 142, 143, 145, 147 of the Indian Penal Code and for unlawful assembly. Currently, we are trying to identify the accused,” said the SI.

The introduction of the new citizenship law had triggered violent protests across the state, including Babupurwa and Yateemkhana areas of Kanpur. The protesters had demaded that the law should be revoked as it makes religion a criterion for granting citizenship in the country and was a violation of the spirit of the Indian Constitution.

More than three people had died and 10 others were injured during the violent protests whihc occurred on December 20 and 21.

The new bridge will come up at a cost of Rs 27.5 crore with Rs 23 crore being contributed through the Infrastructure and Amenities Fund, while the remaining Rs 4.5 crore will be contributed by the corporation.

“The new bridge will be 1.5m higher than the existing bridge. It will also be little wider than the existing one with a total width of of 17.5m, including a two-metre-wide pedestrian pathway, on either side. The total length of the bridge will be 223.20m,” a corporation official said.

The existing bridge is visibly weak with most of the concrete structure underneath having eroded due to test of time. Though heavy vehicles continue to use the bridge, the corporation has decided to construct a new bridge, another official said.

The bridge will complement the road widening work taking place on both banks of Vaigai river. The single road is being widened to lay a double road.

It will be ready to handle more traffic as vehicle movement will increase in Vaigai bank roads after the completion of the widening process.

Another official said that once work begins it will be completed in 18 months time. A decision would be take on when to start the project as the Chithirai festival is fast approaching. T

BHOPAL: Economic offences wing (EOW) of Madhya Pradesh has constituted a seven-member SIT to probe the alleged Rs 3,800 crore ‘Bundelkhand package scam’, in which signed and stamped documents would have you believe that 5 tonnes of stone were transported on a scooter, and hundreds of goats dropped dead in a span of two weeks across the region. This team will be headed by AIG, Dhananjay Shah, who is known for his investigative skills, said insiders.

Teams would be dispatched to various districts soon, claim sources. In 2009, it was then AICC general secretary, Rahul Gandhi, who had pushed for the Bundelkhand package worth Rs 7,266-crore for development of 13 districts — six in Madhya Pradesh and seven in Uttar Pradesh. It was aimed at transforming the region, but was wracked by corruption.

The scam would have probably gone undetected but for Tikamgarh resident, Pawan Ghuwara, who blew the whistle in 2012 after noticing bizarre mismatch in vehicle numbers. The Centre sent a three-member probe team to Panna, and the scam was out in the open. Motorcycles, scooters, cars and jeeps were shown as JCB machines on paper by the forest department in Panna. It was only the tip of the iceberg, claim sources. In 2014, the Jabalpur bench of high court had ordered a probe into the alleged siphoning of central funds from the special Bundelkhand package given to MP. By the time the investigation negotiated administrative corridors, the then chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had lost his post after being defeated in the 2018 assembly polls. The Congress government has now given its nod to EOW, sources told TOI. In 2015, the then chief secretary had asked chief technical examination department to investigate the scam.

340,['6/03/2020'],"Economists, social scientists for NPR, Census de-linking","edited

Pune: As many as 190 economists and social scientists from leading universities in the state and the country have written an open letter to the government, expressing concerns over the simultaneous exercise of the NPR and Census from April.

The signatories, including Maitreesh Ghatak of London School of Economics, S Irfan Habib and Jayati Ghosh of Jawaharlal Nehru University and privacy and technology expert Vickram Crishna, said the two exercises should be de-linked.

The signatories said the fear among substantial sections of the respondents was rising about the possibilities of the investigators might determine their citizenship as “doubtful” in connection with the National Population Register (NPR) exercise. They said conducting NPR simultaneously with the decennial census “also violate Clause 15 of the Census Act, 1948” that bars anyone from “accessing any book, register or record made by a census-officer in the discharge of his duty”.

“We are economists and social scientists, who are deeply concerned about the major implications for the Indian statistical system, of the attempt to combine data collection for the 2021 Census of India with that for the proposed National Population Register...” the letter stated, requesting de-linking of the Census process from the NPR exercise.

Crishna told TOI, “While Census has been a laudable success for decades, the NPR reflects a shallow and highly motivated, sectarian and divisive concern promoted by a few politicians. Its methodology ought to be understood far more clearly in the light of the clarity of the Supreme Court order on personal privacy as a fundamental right.’’

The Census is conducted every 10 years. The data form the basis of many important indicators that reveal the living conditions of Indians and their access to basic facilities, laying the foundation for economic and social policymaking.

One major difference between Census and NPR is that while the former does not identify individuals, the latter collects both demographic and biometric information of a person.

Concerns were raised from various sections after the government decided to update the NPR data between April and September 2020, along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021.

The economists and social scientists said it was essential to ensure that the “exercise of data collection for Census 2021 is absolutely safe, comprehensive and uncontaminated by any other factors.”

Their statement read: “The Census of India, which provides a basic household and population listing based on anonymous data, is an essential requirement for the country and provides the statistical basis for all assessments of the conditions of the population and for necessary social and economic policies. The Census data are also important in enabling central and state governments to exercise their basic functions and meet their responsibilities to the people.”

The corporation has begun discussions on giving out these shopping complexes under public-private partnership, identifying the need to upgrade the look and feel of small commercial establishments in the city.

According to multiple sources, the corporation has finalised a three-pronged strategy. The complexes which are dilapidated will be demolished, while some others will be modernised by giving them out to builders.

The ones that are in a semi-decent shape will be partially modified, while those which are in good condition will be touched up with a coat of paint and other external embellishments.

Not only would this be a better utilisation of space, it would also generate revenue for the cash-strapped civic body, said officials.

As on date, the corporation has 152 complexes across 15 zones wherein there are around 6,000 shops.

Every year, approximately Rs 200 crore is earned as revenue from the shopkeepers. The Royapuram and Teynampet zones have 64 such buildings.

According to official data, some of these structures were built in the 1960s and 1970s and are in a ramshackle condition. The youngest complex, the Adyar fruit market, is around four years old, while many are 10-20 years old.

These complexes also host Amma canteens and various government offices, including courts like the National Green Tribunal.

Based on information that narcotic drugs could be smuggled through postal parcels from Africa, the postal intelligence unit of air customs seized a parcel , which had arrived from Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), at the Foreign Post Office (FPO), Chennai.

Customs officials said since the parcel did not carry any declaration regarding its contents, it was taken up for examination. It was found to have eight packets wrapped in silver/pink metallic gift wrapper. On opening the gift wrap paper, pink polythene bags were found. Inside the bags, green dried leaves suspected to be ‘khat’ were found stuffed. As much as 15.6kg of dried leaves valued at Rs 40 lakh was seized under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.

Customs officials said khat or Catha edulis, also known as miraa, is a stimulant, and is prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

Khat has an effect similar to psychotropic drug amphetamine.

Samples of the leaves have been sent for tests, the officials said.

Customs officials said the city has a sizeable population of African students and some may be addicted to khat.

Khat is an evergreen shrub mainly cultivated in East Africa and South Yemen. It contains alkaloids cathinone and cathine, which are amphetamine-like stimulants that cause euphoria. The leaves are chewed for its soporific effect but some people boil the leaves in water and drink it like tea. The substance is addictive .

“In May 2018, we seized a postal parcel which had arrived from Kenya containing 7.9kg khat leaves at the FPO,” the official said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Venjarammoodu police who are probing the alleged murder of 32-year-old Sini of Pullanpara have issued a lookout circular for her husband, Kuttan, 33, who is still absconding.

Police on Thursday carried out searches at different parts of Kollam, such as Kottarakkara and Ochira, as part of the probe. They also met Kuttan’s former employer and made some inquiries.

“He used to work in the field of digging of wells and his employer had taken him to various parts of the state and also Karnataka as part of the work. We have collected the names of all the places they have gone thus,” said Venjarammoodu SI Bineesh Lal. The police will be conducting searches in those places, he said.

Tomatoes which sold for Rs 20 last week cost only Rs 7 in the wholesale market on Thursday. Markets, especially central, have been receiving about 25 to 30 loads of tomatoes, each comprising 250 boxes of 15 kilogram each. However, retailers sold tomatoes for Rs 15 a kilogram. Sethu, a trader, said that tomato production was in its peak season and hence even local ones of good quality were coming to the market in large quantities. “It is purchased from farmers at Rs 3 a kilogram, but it doesn’t help us if we reduce the selling price below Rs 8 as it also involves transport,” he said. Even the price of drumstick, which sold at Rs 200 a kilogram in December, has come down to Rs 30. It sold for Rs 17 in Oddanchathiram market , the largest vegetable market in the south.

Lady’s finger has also been produced in abundance in villages in Theni district and sold for Rs 10 a kilogram in the market. The price of onions which gave people a scare two months ago selling at more than Rs 200, came down to Rs 30 a kilogram. Shallots too were priced at about Rs 35 to Rs 40 in the central market and about Rs 50 in the farmers’ markets.

Vegetarian hotel owners are happy as they are able to source the vegetables at such a low price after many months. President of Madurai Central Market at Mattuthavani P S Murugan said that the prices of all vegetables had gone down as it is not the wedding season. “Only onions can be kept for a week and tomatoes spoil the very next day. We are throwing away a large quantity of remaining vegetables to cows every day,’’ he said.

352,['6/03/2020'],‘Use of concrete best for construction’,"hetan Raikar speaks on use of concrete in heritage conservation, on Wednesday

Nagpur: Cement and concrete have high compressive strength and low cohesion which is useful in grouting. Affinity to water in them is advantageous for construction in wet or damp areas, said Chetan Raikar, chairman and managing director of Structwel, Navi Mumbai, on Wednesday.

He was speaking at the ICI-Ultra Tech outstanding concrete structures awards ceremony held at a city hotel. Those present at the function included V Ramachandra, YTVV Prasad, Mangesh Wagh, immediate past president of ICI Vivek Naik, chairman ICI Arun Uttarwar, and secretary ICI Virendra Dehadrai were present.

Citing the example of renovation of Rajwada (palace) at Indore after it was damaged by fire, Raikar said he used concrete as it strengthens the structure. Wagh Mandir at Morbi in Gujarat, damaged by earthquake, was also renovated by using the same technique, he added.

He said conservation and repair are two different aspects. While constructing buildings, ceilings and other structures, use of concrete is the best option. There is a misconception about use of concrete in people’s mind which needs to be cleared, he added.

Principal of Government Engineering College MB Kumthekar, who was the chief guest, said, “Construction and cement industries are inseparable. The progress of civil engineering can best be termed as journey of mankind.”

There is a need for skilled workforce for which engineering colleges should take initiative, he added.

Awards were given in four categories. The recipients are Dinesh Kinkhede (individual bungalow), Vijay Keswani (residential flats/apartments), M/s Sudhir Construction (commercial/industrial) and M/s DV Patel and Company (jury’s special award).

Secretary of ICI Virendra Dehadrai proposed a vote of thanks.

Several areas reported waterlogging. North and central parts of Gujarat and Saurashtra also received light to moderate showers.

Jayanta Sarkar, regional director of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said a western disturbance-induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan had resulted in the changed weather in parts of Gujarat.

“Several parts of Saurashtra, north and central Gujarat reported light rains on Thursday. There will be a cloudy sky on Friday but very little chance of rainfall,” said Sarkar. “If it happens, it will be in parts of south Gujarat. Other parts of Gujarat are likely to remain dry.”

The spell has health experts worried. A city-based infectious diseases expert said the novel coronavirus spreads more in colder weather. “While this could be a small spell, it could result in greater transmission of the virus and we advise caution to those having other ailments. Hopefully, higher temperatures will arrest the spread,” said an official of a city-based hospital.

Due to the change in the weather, the maximum temperature on Monday dipped by 3.2 degrees celsius to 30.8°C degrees. “No large change in minimum temperature during the next 48 hours; thereafter a fall by 2-3 degrees celsius in the subsequent 24 hours; thereafter a rise by 2-3 degrees celsius in 48 hours over the region very likely,” the IMD forcast states.

“The rain caught us unawares. While there was a bit of a drizzle in the evening, we never expected such a shower. I was going to relatives but had to rush back home so I don’t catch a cold,” said Samarth Patel, a resident of Vastrapur.

Gandhinagar and areas around Ahmedabad such as Ambli and Bopal also saw rain and strong winds. The flyover at Anjali Crossroads was closed temporarily after a few commuters fell after their vehicles slipped. Waterlogging was reported on CG Road along with a few other areas in western parts of the city.

NEW DELHI: National Green Tribunal on Thursday ordered Delhi Development Authority to constitute a special purpose vehicle within two weeks to clean and rejuvenate the Yamuna.

A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel asked the Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments to take expeditious action on sewage management, industrial pollutants and solid waste being discharged into the river.

The tribunal said the functions of the special purpose vehicle would include ecological restoration of floodplain zones, setting up of bio-diversity parks, artificial wetlands, phytoremediation of drains at the river mouths, maintaining vigil and undertaking flow measurement, creating ecological services and removing encroachment. “It may also take steps to attract and educate citizens and nature enthusiasts on nature-related activities,” said the bench.

Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) should issue notices to the entities accountable to pay compensation, and in case of non-payment, seek execution by moving the tribunal, the bench said. It also directed Delhi government to set up within two weeks an “integrated drain management cell” (IDMC) under the chief secretary for remediation and management of drains.

“The CEO , DJB, will be the ex-officio member secretary of IDMC, which may meet at least once a week. The constitution of IDMC will not affect the ownership of the drains. The cell shall send its reports to this tribunal every two months,” the bench said.

The tribunal also directed the AAP government to review its “free sewer scheme” saying such policy was contrary to the basic tenets of civic life. It added that there was a need for stringent compliance with directions to ensure sewage and sludge management and other pollution aspects for the protection of environment and rejuvenation of the Yamuna.

“Despite repeated directions from the Supreme Court and NGT in the past 25 years, there has been no compliance by the authorities,” the bench observed.

“Work on the revetment, a stone facing to prevent erosion, on the slope of the walking track has been going on briskly,” said Jason Wilson, who is part of the group overlooking the revival of the lake. He added that this is a fundamental part of the work to be carried out before the lake is restored.

Besides the revetment work, guards have been deployed at the lake to prevent encroachments and miscreants from wandering about.

“At present, two guards come in at 8 am and their shift ends at around 4.30 pm. We are requesting officials that someone is deployed to keep an eye on miscreants at night as well,” Wilson said. He said that after the guards were deployed, fewer people are dumping waste into the lake, but added that more awareness is needed.

Water hyacinth still remains a major problem at the lake. “We can tackle the problem within a week, but funding has been a problem,” said Raju L Kanchibhotla , who has paid out of his own pocket on several occasions to get the hyacinth removed. He said that around Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12 lakh would be needed for the effort.

Officials have been looking out for corporates to fund lake revival work.

Venkata Prasida, assistant engineer, irrigation department said, “the next major work to be taken up is sewage diversion. We plan to divert polluted water downstream to a channel after which it will be treated.”

356,['6/03/2020'],"Civic body in poor financial shape, dissolve it, say 4 Mum Sena MLAs","Nagpur: Four MLAs of the Shiv Sena from Mumbai — Sunil Prabhu, Prakash Phaterpekar, Ramesh Korgaonkar and Ajay Choudhari — have submitted a calling attention motion in the ongoing budget session of state legislature on Wednesday, demanding dissolution of the BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). After speaker Nana Patole accepted the motion, a reply has been sought from urban development minister Eknath Shinde, one of the topmost Sena leaders.

The urban development department on Thursday asked the NMC to submit a reply as soon as possible.

A letter dated March 4, sent by secretariat of Maharashtra legislature to the principal secretary, urban development department, says four Sena MLAs have cited collapse of NMC’s financial condition, zero planning, and crimes committed in its functioning, while stressing the need for dissolution of the NMC body. “The government overlooked all these issues in NMC. Citizens of Nagpur are deprived of basic amenities and development due to all these issues,” they said.

Prabhu refused to comment, saying they had submitted a proposal to the speaker, but it was yet to be tabled in the assembly. “We’ve submitted the proposal after reading about the civic body’s financial mess in the media. We don’t have sufficient details as of now,” he told TOI while assuring to talk on the subject after the motion is discussed in the lower house, probably next week.

A copy of the letter with TOI shows the four MLAs also said, “It has come to fore on March 2 that NMC has pending bills of Rs500 crore to Rs800 crore of ongoing works. NMC was supposed to complete various projects approved by the government in five years but has failed to finish them in 8-10 years as it lacks finances for its share in the projects. NMC approved works more than revenue in budget. All these resulted in pending bills rising to crores. NMC also committed a crime by utilizing money from general pension fund and pension fund deducted from NMC employees to clear dues of contractors,” the MLAs said.

The legislators added, “NMC created huge liabilities by approving new works when bills of ongoing works are still pending. All this has resulted in financial emergency in NMC.”

Citing exactly the issues raised by the four Sena MLAs in the calling attention motion, Mundhe had some days ago stopped execution of all works yet to be started. Mundhe’s move has irked office bearers in the NMC, which is ruled by the BJP.

To press for restarting works, NMC general body on February 20 passed a resolution directing Mundhe to resume works till he places financial data of NMC’s last 12 years before it. Mundhe is yet to implement this decision. On March 3, mayor Sandip Joshi had asked Mundhe to inform him about the decision taken regarding the general body resolution.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe was in Mumbai on Wednesday. A tweet by NCP minister Jayant Patil showed Mundhe met him at Vidhan Bhavan.

Mundhe had placed NMC’s financial status before the urban development department when issue related to implementation of 7th Pay Commission to NMC employees came up some days ago.

In September 2001, Congress-led government in state had dissolved NMC, which was ruled by BJP then too. All 119 corporators were disqualified and the then municipal commissioner T Chandrashekhar was appointed as administrator. The decision was taken citing a report of Nandlal Committee exposing numerous irregularities, violations and poor financial condition of NMC. The current BJP regime in NMC has completed three years on Thursday, with two years remaining for next election.

Since taking oath, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP has taken steps to take over NMC, which has been ruled by BJP for the last 13 consecutive years. MVA had replaced Abhijit Bangar with Mundhe in January despite the former having completed only 14 months as against normal tenure of three years. A committee of ministers was constituted to execute and monitor Nag River Pollution Abatement Project. MVA also asked for opinion of NMC and NIT on giving back planning authority status of Gunthewari areas from NMC to NIT.

Former CM Devendra Fadnavis, now leader of opposition, is from Nagpur and facing political challenge from Sena. Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari are always in touch regarding issues related to NMC.

357,['6/03/2020'],Mundhe conspired with Sena MLAs seeking NMC’s dissolution: Joshi,"Nagpur: Mayor Sandip Joshi on Thursday accused municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe of hatching a conspiracy against BJP for dissolving the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

Addressing the media, Joshi pointed out that Mundhe was in Mumbai on Wednesday and was seen in a tweet posted by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) state chief and senior cabinet minister Jayant Patil.

The mayor claimed that the details provided in the calling attention motion by four Shiv Sena MLAs from Mumbai — Sunil Prabhu, Prakash Phaterpekar, Ramesh Korgaonkar and Ajay Choudhari — demanding dissolution of the NMC were exactly the same as uttered by the municipal commissioner during the NMC general body meeting on February 20.

The calling attention motion was admitted by speaker Nana Patole and is likely to come up in the House either on Friday or Monday.

“Ironically, the issue being raised by four Mumbai MLAs is not endorsed by even a single Congress MLA from the city, including city Congress president and MLA Vikas Thakre. This indicates that the motion is a move by Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi just to defame the BJP-ruled NMC,” Joshi said.

“Even Vikas Thakre told me over phone that the calling attention motion by four Shiv Sena MLAs has tarnished the city’s image,” he said.

According to Joshi, it was due to immense efforts taken by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the city witnessed huge development works including AIIMS, Metro rail, National Law University, IIM and IIIT etc from 2014 to 2019. “This apparently did not go down well with the Shiv Sena-led government,” he said.

The mayor also reviewed all six queries raised by the Shiv Sena MLAs and claimed that the general body has already sought detailed information on rise in NMC’s liabilities from Rs500 crore to Rs800 crore. He will present the details of NMC’s financial status of the last 12 years in the general body meeting this month.

According to him, the past municipal commissioners had regularly monitored the NMC’s financial condition and they revised the budget of the standing committee chairmen whenever they felt necessary.

“Since Mundhe joined the NMC on January 28 this year, the civic body’s image is being projected as financially weak. Is it that until Mundhe took over, there was no issues with the NMC’s financial condition?” he said in a caustic remark.

Joshi said if the situation of the NMC was so poor then why didn’t it default on any loan instalments.

He also claimed that due to poor administration, the NMC is yet to receive state government’s share of Rs982 crore for major projects.

Refuting the allegation that standing committee chairmen diverted provident fund contributions and other mandatory dues of employees to pay outstanding dues of contractors, the mayor said it was chief accounts and finance officer (CAFO) who makes the payments. “The then CAFO Madan Gadge had diverted Rs8 crore of PF contributions to pay the dues of contractors. Similarly, the then CAFO Mona Thakur used Rs40 crore to clear the bills of contractors,” he claimed.

Joshi said the Sena MLAs made contradictory statements in their calling attention motion. “On one hand, they blamed the NMC for diverting funds of PF dues to clear bills of contractors and on the other hand, they claimed that the BJP-ruled civic body had deprived citizens of basic civic amenities,” he said.

“There is no financial crisis in the NMC as development works including cement road works, 24X7 water supply project, garbage free city etc are being carried out in a very planned manner,” he said. The mayor urged the four Shiv Sena MLAs not to tarnish the city’s image.

“If we did anything wrong, conduct an inquiry and we are ready to face any action,” he said.

To a query, Joshi said that the BJP ruled civic body has no intention to bring no-confidence motion against the municipal commissioner. “We are satisfied with the works he has undertaken like anti-encroachment drives, instilling discipline in NMC’s work culture etc,” the mayor said.

The mayor also declared that if the MVA government dissolves the BJP-ruled civic body, they will challenge the decision and hit the streets to fight the decision tooth and nail.

Mangaluru: A budget proposal by chief minister B S Yediyurappa on the Hassan-Mangaluru Rail Development Corporation (HMRDC) is expected to bring cheer to train activists in this part of the state.

HMRDC, a joint venture of the ministry of railways and state government, as per the budget proposal, is planning to make investments in 2020-21 to enhance the capacity of the rail lines in the ghat section between Sakleshapur and Subramanya stations.

Affirming the announcement, a senior official of the HMRDC, on condition of anonymity, told TOI that the company is aiming to become a Rs 500 crore net worth company by 2025, and will take up works related to state-of-the-art signalling in the ghat section at a cost of Rs 5 crore.

This will help reduce the block section, the official said, adding this was a long-pending demand that will help in optimal utilisation of the rail line and give scope for more trains.

Noting that the work will be completed in 3 to 4 months, the official said the company has taken statutory approvals from the ministry of railways to execute the work.

The proposal stated that this will not only enhance the speed of the commute between Bengaluru and Mangaluru, but will also help start additional rail facilities.

“We are striving to introduce both freight and passenger trains in equal measure, after improvement in signalling facilities,” the official said.

Acknowledging the personal effort taken by Aparna Garg, divisional railway manager, Mysuru, of South Western Railway in taking up this proposal with HMRDC, the official said this will be a win-win situation, not just for the company, but also the public.

“HMRDC for obvious reasons has resisted introduction of passenger trains at the cost of freight revenue, and this new investment will help it strike a balance between the two,” the official noted.

Incidentally, the company with its vision to become a Rs 500 crore company, has stated that augmenting line capacity, vigorous marketing along with SWR, NMPT and MEL and tapping the commercial or tourist potential of the section as among its avowed objectives.

It is also banking on creative use of technology, taking up non-safety related works and identifying efficient methods and processes to reduce operational costs in meeting these objectives.

The FIR comes weeks after the Madras high court, hearing the case filed by one of the affected girl students, directed MSU registrar S Santhosh Baboo to file a formal complaint with the police. A case has been registered against Vinodh under section 509 (4) of the IPC, which deals with sexual harassment by verbal means. Police said that investigation is under way and the accused has not been arrested so far. The Madurai bench of the high court had also directed that Pettai police should conclude the investigation within three months of registering the FIR.

The girl students had come forward with the sexual harassment complaint in 2015 after which an internal committee formed to look into it found the assistant professor guilty. Though Vinodh had been suspended and his two increments were stopped, he started to work again at MSU’s constituent college in Nagalapuram. Meanwhile, the internal committee failed to forward the complaint to the police. The affected students hence went to court and filed a case in 2016.tnn

362,['6/03/2020'],Hyderabad: Revanth in jail for flying drone to take photos of KT Rama Rao's farm,"Revanth at Narsingi police station where he was later arrested

HYDERABAD: In a new twist to the ongoing feud between Congress leader A Revanth Reddy and IT minister KT Rama Rao, the Malkajgiri MP was arrested on Thursday for his alleged role in using a drone to capture images of a farmhouse leased by TRS working president’s family. He was remanded in judicial custody till March 18. Later in the evening he was sent to Cherlapalli jail.

A day earlier, six persons were arrested for using the drone to photograph the farmhouse of KTR’s family at Janwada in neighbouring Rangareddy district. Revanth was named prime accused in the case booked under Sections 184(Driving dangerously), 187 ( Omission to assist public servant when bound by law to give assistance) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 11A R/W 5A of the Aircraft Act.

There was high drama on Thursday afternoon when Revanth went straight to Narsingi police station from Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA). Interestingly, when Cyberabad police sent a notice to Revanth’s Jubilee Hills residence on Wednesday to appear before police, he reportedly refused to accept it. On Thursday, he walked into the police station with his followers.

He went into the chamber of Narsingi station house officer (SHO) and argued with inspector Gangadhar about how a case could be registered against him and his associates for using a drone to capture images of the farmhouse.

Narsingi police, who had already declared Revanth as the prime accused, decided to arrest him when he was at the police station. Since Revanth’s sympathisers, family and NSUI activists had gathered at the police station, they decided to lock the gate to deny them entry. His followers were constantly raising slogans against police and TRS government. Mulugu MLA D Anasuya (Seethakka) also landed at the police station and spoke to him from across the gate.

Late on Thursday evening, police formally declared Revanth’s arrest. The MP was shifted into a police vehicle and taken to a government hospital at Golconda for medical examination. Subsequently, he was taken to the residence of a magistrate at Nalanda Nagar in Rajendranagar. The magistrate sent Revanth to judicial custody till March 18. The Congress MP did not move any bail application before the magistrate. He was later taken to the Cherlapalli jail.

On Monday, Revanth and other Congress leaders tried to gatecrash into the farmhouse at Janwada. However, police thwarted his bid. Alleging that KTR had purchased the 25 acre land by threatening owners and built structures violating GO111, he released aerial photographs of the property, including a palatial house with a swimming pool, to the media.

Prior to that, a controversy had erupted over the ownership of a parcel of land involving Revanth and his family members in Gopannapally.

MUMBAI: The festival of Holi coming up on March 10 could be a damp affair due to efforts to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. Certain prominent clubs have cancelled celebrations while housing societies are encouraging members to take precautions.

Cricket Club of India (CCI), Churchgate, and NSCI, Worli, have announced they will not organize Dhuleti or colour festivities. CCI has called off its ensuing members’ night and five-day yoga camp too. Access to the swimming pool is restricted.

NSCI had already sold 800 passes whose cost will be refunded to buyers. It had requisitioned two DJs, lined up a rain dance and lavish meal with competitions and prizes, all of which stand cancelled. “Around 5,000 people attend our Holi programme which is one of the biggest events of our club. Our committee felt it is better to be safe since playing with colours and water or shaking hands can raise chances of infection. These measures have been taken to avoid crowd gathering and for safety,” said committee member Viren Shah.

Yet another prominent party at MMRDA Grounds, Bandra, will go ahead as tickets have been sold. Celebration Club, Lokhandwala, has outsourced its Holi programme ""where there will not be any pichkaris, just dry organic colour,” said spokesman Hemant Nair.

Neptune housing society in Thakur Village, Kandivli, will keep up its 14-year tradition of Holi festivity. “Albeit, we are doing our best to stave off the threat of infection. We have kept hand sanitizer for use in our lobby. Also, we have put up a notice asking residents to take precautions by using masks. I had ordered 100 masks but the chemists are out of stock. Still, we will go ahead with the gathering by asking residents to procure masks themselves. How can we order people to stop celebrating Holi?” said chairman Rahul Tangri.

Meanwhile, sale of Chinese pichkaris has dropped to a trickle as people are avoiding Made in China goods. At APMC Vashi, sales are doown to barely 15% of previous years. A dealer at Abdul Rehman Street said he was making do with last year’s leftover stock of pichkaris.

MUMBAI: India has 5,986 ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWI), each with over US$ 30 million (around Rs 215 crore), and it is globally ranked 12th on the list of countries with most such people.

The US dominates the ranking with over 2.4 lakh UHNWIs, followed by China with 61,587 and Germany 23,078, according to the Knight Frank Wealth Report 2020 released on Thursday. Globally, over 31,000 additional UHNWIs were created in 2019, bringing the total to more than 513,200.

“The number of UHNWIs in India is predicted to grow by a whopping 73% in the next five years, almost doubling the count to 10,354 from 5,986 in 2019,” said the report. By 2024, Asia will be the world’s second largest wealth hub outperforming Europe, with a five-year growth forecast of 44%. Despite such a steep rise, it will reach only half the size of North America’s UHNWI population, which is predicted to rise 22% over the same period.

Inspite of wealth growth and record low interest rates in most advanced economies, the global economic slowdown weighed on prime property prices across the globe. For instance, Mumbai saw a tepid growth of 0.5% last year, Delhi 4.7% and Bengaluru 2.1%. Frankfurt and Lisbon topped the list with an annual price change of 10.3% and 9.6%, respectively. When it comes to luxury properties, Monaco remains the world’s most expensive city where US$1 million (Rs 7.2 crore) can buy you a mere 16.4 square metre or 176 square feet of space. Comparatively in Mumbai, you can buy 102.2 sq m or 1,098 sq ft (approximate size of a decent two-bedroom flat in the city).

Shishir Baijal, chairman & MD, Knight Frank India, said, “While prime property prices have stayed stable in the past five years, the relative stability of the Indian rupee still allows investors and end-users to buy more prime real estate in India today than in 2015. At -1% for 2020, prime property price growth in Mumbai is expected to face challenges, as the current economic slowdown will continue to influence market liquidity.” Equity investments remained the most attractive asset class for Indian UHNWIs with 83% of them in India plan to increase or maintain their allocations in equities, followed by bonds (77%) and property (51%). So, which are the best cities for UHNWIs to live, invest and do business in? According to the Knight Frank City Wealth Index, New York captured the top spot from London based on wealth, investment and lifestyle. With London in the second spot, Paris, Hong Kong and Los Angeles round out the top five cities.

The Luxury Investment Index shows that ‘collectable handbags’ has topped the index, rising in value by 13% over the 12 months to Q4 2019, knocking rare whisky off its number one position. “The index results show that on an annual basis, handbags outperformed both whisky and art, which both recorded growth of 5%. Classic cars, another strong performer in recent years, slipped 7%. However, when we look at the results over a 10-year period, it is a different picture. Rare whisky continues to top the charts rising 564% followed by cars (194%),” it said.

For they are the ones who are at a maximum risk to develop serious complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure on getting infected with Covid-19 – the novel coronavirus infection – that has affected at least 30 Indians, as on Thursday.According to a study published in the American Medical Association journal, which analysed the epidemiology data of Covid-19 outbreak in China, the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% (1,023 deaths among 44,672 confirmed cases).“No deaths occurred in the group of nine years and younger, but cases in the 70-79 years had an 8% CFR, while those in the 80 years bracket and older had a 14.8% CFR,” found the study conducted by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.The mortality rate or CFR was higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions — 10.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer, the study stated.In view of this, the doctors said that it was most important to keep the elders safe. “If they develop a breathing difficulty or pneumonia, they must be hospitalised immediately.

The move comes after the forensic science report said there were traces of two people’s semen in her body. While one of the samples matched with that of a 34-year-old man, who was arrested and sentenced to death in the case, the court had ordered police to conduct further investigation to find out the remaining culprit.

Subsequently, district superintendent of police Sujit Kumar had appointed police inspector Ananthanayaki as the investigating officer and additional deputy superintendent of police G S Anitha as the supervising officer. Ananthanayaki held inquiry with the family members, relatives and friends of K Santhoshkumar, who was arrested in the case. She then moved the special court, seeking permission to collect blood samples of 10 suspects for DNA test. The court allowed her plea.

Two weeks ago, police had taken the 10 to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital to collect blood samples, which were sent to the forensic science lab in Chennai through the court for DNA test. “If any of their DNA matches with the one found in the minor’s body, that person will be arrested and produced before the special court,” a police source said. The source, however, said it would take at least three months to get the DNA reports.

The minor girl went missing from her home near Thudiyalur on March 25, 2019 and her body was found near her house the next day. Seven days later, police arrested K Santhoshkumar, of Uliyampalayam, for raping and murdering the girl. Semen samples taken from the body was sent for the forensic test and the report, which was released on November 11, said traces of two people’s semen, including that of Santhoshkumar, was found in the body.

On December 26, the girl’s mother filed a petition before the district mahila court, seeking further investigation to nab the remaining culprit. The next day, the court awarded death penalty to Santhoshkumar and ordered police to conduct further investigation.

The BJP is in majority in the civic body.

Tanaji Wanwe, the leader of opposition and senior Congress corporator, said the MVA government is playing “dirty politics”. “By bringing Tukaram Mundhe as NMC commissioner, the state government made its intent of wanting to dissolve the NMC very clear,” added Wanve.

He wanted to know how four Shiv Sena MLAs can seek NMC’s dissolution. “Dissolving an elected body will amount to cheating the people of Nagpur city,” said Wanve.

BSP corporator and party leader Vaishali Narnaware criticized the motion of Shiv Sena MLAs. “Politics should not be vindictive. We were elected by the people and they should decide whether the civic body should be dissolved or not. If at all the MVA government suspects misuse of funds by the BJP, it should constitute an inquiry and if something wrong comes out then they have the option to take necessary action,” she said.

Kishore Kumeriya, one of the two Shiv Sena corporators in the civic body and the party leader, distanced himself from making any statement saying he will follow the party line. “I will not comment on the issue,” he said.

BJP MLA Krishna Khopde said in 2000 CM Vilasrao Deshmukh too had dissolved the civic body. “But the government failed to prove any corruption. Shiv Sena too is trying the same and the party will be thwarted,” he said.

Despite repeated attempts, other city MLAs, including two from Congress, were not available for comments.

Welcoming the move, senior independent corporator Abha Pande said that the BJP has “destroyed the city in the last 13 years”. “It has misused the taxpayers’ money as per their whims and fancies,” she said citing the example of holding cultural events at a time when the civic body was reeling under acute financial crisis.

“Now, it is going to hold the Baisakh festival. The money spent on cultural events could have been used on improving basic amenities,” said Pande.

According to Pande, misuse of development funds is forcing citizens of her constituency to remain deprived of sanctioned Rs2 crore development works. “Due to dearth of funds, no work has even started,” she said.

SECUNDERABAD: Students of Osmania University (OU) pursuing German and French diploma courses have raised objections over the exorbitant exam fee being charged by the administration. The OU offers part-time courses in German and French at diploma, junior, senior and advanced levels. While the junior and senior courses have two written papers, students have to appear for three written papers at the advanced level.

In a letter to the registrar, students sought reduction of the exam fee, which is Rs 2,100. “Inspite of having just two and three written papers respectively, the examination fee is Rs 2,100, which goes on increasing every four months.

The examination fee for post-graduate courses with five written papers is only Rs 1,000 and for PhD with three papers it is Rs 400,” read the letter. The students demanded the authorities to collect fee on a par with regular postgraduate courses, which is Rs 200 per paper.

There are close to 200 to 250 students pursuing these diploma courses. With the examinations scheduled to be held in April, students have sought reduction of the fees for German and French diploma courses.

Officials said that a decision with regards to the fees is taken by the executive council, which was recently appointed at the university.

It may be recalled that last year in March, the OU’s move to double the revaluation fee for bachelor of engineering course and other social science courses had led to a massive outcry among students.

372,['6/03/2020'],Corpn scouts for more land to set up Miyawaki forests,"Trichy: The trees and flowering plants planted by Trichy City Corporation at Srirangam two months ago as part of introducing the Miyawaki method have registered good growth in their incubation period. The success of the mass plantation drive has encouraged the urban local body to scout for potential vacant lands including private properties in the heart of the city to set up more Miyawaki forests.

Srirangam zone of the corporation availed permission of the HR&CE department to utilize the 1.25-acre vacant land of Ranganathaswamy temple in South Devi Street to plant trees on December 20. The area was cleaned by the local body to mark a layout for walking tracks and space to plant the saplings. The corporation sourced 10,000 flowers and fruit-bearing native trees that grow in the soil. Periodical maintenance such as watering for two hours a day was ensured, and many of the saplings have registered a growth of five feet. “Mortality of saplings happens within the first month since planting. If the saplings registered 3-5 foot growth, they will certainly survive further,” Dr R Jagadeesan, a senior horticulturist, said. The corporation followed Miyawaki method, a Japanese method to raise dense forest in urban space. The afforestation drive at Srirangam was carried out at the rate of planting three tree saplings per square metre.

“Drip irrigation was set up for plantation, which helped us to register the desired growth in a short span of time. Manure produced by the corporation’s micro compost centres was used as a soil nutrient,” S Vaithyanathan, assistant commissioner, Srirangam zone, said. In the next few months, walking tracks will be laid in the plantation, officials said.

The civic body is now scouting for more land in heart of the city such as Chathiram bus stand and Cantonment to set up such plantations.

375,['6/03/2020'],Review ‘free’ sewer scheme: NGT to Delhi government,"National Green Tribunal (File photo)

NEW DELHI: National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked Delhi government on Thursday to review its “free sewer scheme”, stating that such a policy is contrary to the basic tenets of civic life.

A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the approach of Delhi government in preventing the discharge of untreated sewage and pollutants in the Yamuna was against the concern for environment and the rule of law. The continued pollution of the river could certainly be attributed to governance deficit and an absence of sound management practices, it added.

The green court said there was no adequate sewage connectivity in Delhi and sewage charges were not being collected on account of the Mukhyamantri Free Sewer scheme. “Such a policy is contrary to the basic tenets of civic life and the fundamental duties of the authorities in-charge to deter pollution of the environment. There may be no objection to freeship if, in spite of freeship, the administration discharges basic obligations to prevent discharge of untreated sewage into waterbodies, which is not happening,” it said.

The bench said poor people were the worst victims as they were the most vulnerable. A citizen is not required to pay for treatment of sewage and even the state is unable to ensure such treatment from its own resources. “Resources of the state are not meant to help a polluter. Pollution remains unabated, which affects the rights of the citizens to a clean environment. It is better to provide a clean environment and recover the cost of remedying the pollution than declaring free sewage treatment and not treating the sewage,” it observed.

NGT took note of the observations of the Yamuna Monitoring Committee, which said residents of unsewered colonies continued to release their sewage into drains, caused pollution and did not pay anything as sewerage charges.

377,['6/03/2020'],"On parallel tracks: Railway official who paints, sculpts","Nagpur: What does an Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS) officer have to do with art and painting? A lot, if the officer is Krishnath S Patil (38), senior divisional commercial manager (SrDCM) with Central Railway, Nagpur. His pastime of painting and sculpting, infusing life into canvass and dead wood, has matured enough to hold a solo show from March 7.

Patil, who hails from obscure Shelewadi village in Kolhapur district, heads the commercial department, where achieving targets through goods, ticket checking and coaching is the sole goal. Balancing his challenging job with his passion, Patil has completed more than 100 paintings and over 50 sculptures in wood.

Talking to TOI ahead of his maiden two-day exhibition of paintings and sculptures, which will be opened by DRM Somesh Kumar at Central Museum in Civil Lines, Patil said, “This hobby acts as a stress buster and increases my creativity. People take to various ways to get rid of stress, I look towards art and culture.”

Patil took to painting and sculpting in 2013, when he was posted in Nagpur as assistant operating manager (AOM). However, his fellow railway officials have no idea about his hidden talent.

His first painting done on September 1, 2013, called ‘Nativity’ was a gift to his doctor wife Deepika when their son Tej was born. “The symbolic painting was of a woman with a new born baby in her hand,” says Patil.

“My journey as an artist started from Nagpur, and hence this exhibition has been organized here. Secondly, there were not enough paintings and sculptures to showcase until now.”

“I use the free time from my tight schedule to create art. I’m working on one of my paintings for last 1.5 years, and it still incomplete,” he says.

Patil’s acrylic paintings speak for themselves. Every painting is unique and depicts an abstract thought. Asked about a woman gazing out of the window, Patil explains, “I wanted to show the limited knowledge humans get from windows of senses and perception.”

“For me both sculpturing and painting are two sides of the same coin, as both need thinking and creativity,” explains Patil.

Most of Patil’s sculptures on wood portray spiritual art, apart from nature and birds. One of the pieces in making is Bramha, creator of the universe as depicted in Hindu cosmology.

Patil says, “Job is my priority and then comes art.” In last one year, since he joined as SrDCM at Nagpur, Central Railway has achieved non-fare revenue of Rs2.85 crore. Revenue from other sources is also on the higher side.

Patil is as passionate about his art, and wherever he goes he looks out for pieces of wood and what could be created from it. Great abstract painter late Vasudeo Gaitonde and specialist designer in timber and bamboo art Manohar Sapre are his inspirations.

“When I’m out on tour and collect some pieces of wood, my staff is always puzzled and ask me why I am collecting dead wood. But only an artist can know how valuable that wood is,” he says.

Patil has a social mission too in his art. “I wish to auction my paintings and utilize the money for charity,” he adds.

Delegates of IMR Group met chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy at his camp office at Tadepalli here on Thursday and agreed for the investment. The steel plant would have annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes. This would be the second steel plant proposed in Kadapa.

The first steel plant was part of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 and to be constructed by the Central government.

However, as the central government has not yet come forward to establish the plant, the state government took up the issue and laid foundation stone.

IMR has operations spread over Indonesia, South Africa, Mexico, Columbia, Italy, Ukraine and India handling coal, iron ore and gold mines excavation and is also involved in the power production and steel industries.

The IMR representatives said that they have entered into a deal with NMDC for supply of iron ore to the proposed steel plant.

The chief minister said Krishnapatnam port, railway connectivity and highways were readily available for transportation purposes. Moreover, it would provide better employment opportunities to the local people. The IMR representatives said that the steel plant would help in transforming the region into a steel hub.

Chief secretary Neelam Sawhney, industries special chief secretary Rajat Bhargav, IMR-AG chairman Hans Radolf Weld, company director Anirudh Misra, project president Arindam De, finance director Sanjay Sinha, and AP Integrated Steel managing director P Madhusudhan were among those present in the meeting.

In her FIR at Sola police station, Prarthna Zala, a resident of Ashray Apartments in New Ranip, stated that she works with RB Tank and Company in Sola and has a savings account in the Law Garden branch of a nationalized bank.

On February 17 afternoon, when she was at office, she received a text message on her mobile phone informing her that Rs 64,900 had been debited from her account. Moments later, she got another message about a Rs 23,289 debit and there was just Rs 1,952.95 left in her bank account, the FIR states. These transactions were made at a point of sale.

She looked for her debit card and found that it was not with her. She stated that she does not know how her debit card went missing and how someone else knew her passcode and withdrew the money.

She called the police control room and the inquiry was handed over to cyber crime police station. After being given a ticket number, she was directed to file a complaint at the concerned police station.

Zala later approached Sola police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust along with charges under the Information Technology Act. Police officials said the accused could have first learned the passcode from the complainant and after stealing the card, withdrew the money.

Work has been taken up to convert the existing two lanes into four-lane with provisions for car parking, bicycle tracks and pedestrian platforms.

The stretch became the most sought after destination among commercial outlets after other streets became saturated. Also, many companies came up on the road over the past few years. In June 2019, the corporation proposed to widen the road into a four-lane stretch and floated a tender for the project funded under Infrastructure Gap Filling Fund (IGFF). However, launch of the civil work was delayed.

Recently, the work to install stormwater drains on either end of the road over which pedestrian pathway shall be established began. The road will also get a centre median to erect LED lamps.

The ministers maintained that measures were being taken to encourage production of APIs locally and policies are being framed for this.

About the recent curbs on exports of APIs from India, P D Vaghela, secretary, department of pharmaceuticals, ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, said, “This is a very temporary measure. We are reviewing the situation every day.”

The Centre this week restricted exports of 26 APIs from the country. These pharma ingredients include paracetamol, antibiotics like metronidazole and neomycin as well as some vitamins.

“We have got to know that factories in some provinces of China have begun production. However, factories are yet to resume production in Hubei province. We are currently not getting supplies from this region. Hence, we will have to restrict exports to avoid any a possible scarcity in India,” said Vaghela.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has planned a major crackdown on car parking mafia who have been extorting motorists. Mayor Firhad Hakim on Thursday launched two 24×7 helpline numbers — 155360 and 1800 345 3375 — where one can lodge complaints and seek redressal from civic authorities. Hakim also inaugurated vans that will move across the city to make citizens aware about the rights and duties while parking vehicles.

Hakim said that the civic body was fighting to ensure rights of motorists at the city’s car parking zones. “I must admit that a powerful racket and middlemen are responsible for fleecing motorists. But this must stop. We shall not spare agencies who don’t follow our guidelines for car parking,” Hakim said.

Sources in the KMC car parking department said the civic top brass had to decide on the crackdown on a section of agencies running Kolkata’s car parking lots, following complaints from car owners who accused some of the attendants of fleecing and misbehaving with them. “We have been receiving plenty of complaints. We identified some of these attendants and asked the agencies running the parking lots to remove them immediately,” an official said.

However, a section of officials said that some agencies compel the attendants to mop up revenue fast. This was why the attendants refused stick to the civic body’s parking rates and charged extra. Whoever refuses to pay extra is harassed by the attendants under pressure to reach the revenue target as set by the owners of the car parking agencies,” another senior KMC official said.

Sources in the KMC said they were focusing on some prime car parking areas, which have become “vice dens”. Burrabazar, BBD Bagh, Esplanade, Lindsay Street, Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Camac Street, Bhowanipore, New Alipore, Gariahat are few such trouble spots where car owners are often fleeced by a section of the parking attendants.

A civic official said that with help from a section of ruling party politicians, some agencies ran fake car parking lots not authorized by the civic body. “We are keeping a close watch on the activities of a section of car parking agencies and will take appropriate steps,” Debasis Kumar, member mayor-in-council, overseeing the KMC car parking department, said.

MANGALURU: A move by chief minister B S Yediyurappa to set aside Rs 1,500 crore in the state budget 2020-21 for the Yettinahole Integrated Drinking Water Project has riled greens in Dakshina Kannada district.

With Visvesvaraya Jala Nigam Limited (VJNL) tasked with implementing this project, greens have dubbed this project perpetual ‘ATM’ for governments irrespective of the political dispensation at the Vidhana Soudha.

Dinesh Holla, coordinator of Sahyadri Sanchaya that has been in the forefront of fight against the project told TOI that Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd that was first tasked with implementing the project and VJNL now implementing the project have both admitted there is no surplus water available at Yettinahole that can be diverted for potable use. “This project will go on for another 25 years with no tangible end result in sight,” Holla surmised.

When people of ‘Bayaluseeme,’ Malnad and even ‘Karavali’ (coast) have all been opposing the project, one must wonder why and for whom is this government striving to implement it for, he said.

Holla dared VJNL authorities to show availability of water in the catchment areas of the project – namely Kadagarahalli, Hiradanahalli, Hebbasale, Heggade and Maranahalli. These areas were blasted during the project implementation stage and there is no sign of water, he said, adding the blasting activities have had a major impact on the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats .

This can be gauged from the fact that the Western Ghats region saw extensive landslips during the last monsoon, he said. Holla feels the project will only perpetuate water scarcity in the district in future.

Increased human activities in areas that are the originating spots for Aniyoor and Mruthyunjaya rivulets, tributaries of the Nethravathi, homestay resorts, mushrooming of coffee estates have only added to the ecological imbalance. There has been growing instances of forest fires in these regions, he said adding there needs to be an urgent rethink on this project.

Hidayathul Sunnath Jamath at Vedambal Nagar in Ganapathy had come under attack around 1am, police sources said. “The kerosene bomb did not go off. People who were sleeping inside the mosque found the broken bottle and wick and alerted the Saravanampatti police,” a police officer told TOI.

Hindu Munnani (HM) district secretary M Anand, 33, of Bazaar Street at Podanur was attacked when he was returning home on his motorcycle after attending the pro-CAA dharna held at Gandhipuram on Wednesday night. “When he reached the flyover on Nanjundapuram-Podanur Road, men on two motorcycles attacked him with an iron rod,” the officer said.

The injured man was rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), where he was given first aid. The Podanur police have registered a case and have formed three special teams to arrest the attackers. They are collecting CCTV footage from the Gandhipuram-Nanjundapuram stretch.

Around 10.30am, members of several Hindu outfits who had gathered at CMCH, attacked Mohammed Khani, an autorickshaw driver. Police saved him from the attackers. Khani, who suffered injuries to his head, was admitted to a private hospital. Members of the Tamil Nadu Meter Auto Association petitioned city police commissioner on Thursday afternoon demanding action against the people who attacked him.

In view of the incidents, additional director general of police Jayanth Murali and ADGP Shankar Jiwal conducted a meeting with senior police officers. As many as 1,500 cops and rapid action force (RAF) personnel have been deployed in the city to maintain law and order, police commissioner Sumit Sharan said.

Meanwhile, HM state president Kadeswara C Subramaniam said Muslims won’t be affected by CAA. “Opposition parties are spreading rumours against CAA and are inciting violence. Extremists are executing their plans under cover of anti-CAA protests,” he said.

Commercial establishments across the district will remain closed tomorrow to condemn the attack on Anand, HM said. The Federation of Islamic Association is also planning to conduct a similar protest to condemn the attack on the mosque.

The Coimbatore District Federation of All Jamath and Islamic Organisations have petitioned the police commissioner, demanding the arrest of the miscreants, who had hurled the kerosene bomb at the mosque.

KOLKATA: It was slated to be a dream union — the couple had met through Facebook; the groom from Nadia had just bought an apartment at Chinar Park near Baguiati; an “IT engineer with a top firm”, the would-be groom even owned a car. The bride’s family found little to object and the wedding was fixed for March 10. The shock came when the bride learnt that the groom was actually unemployed and trying to pull off a con job.

The bride, from the Jheel Road in Garfa, went on a shopping spree — buying furniture and jewellery. However, a couple of weeks ago, when she called her “fiance” Subhodip Bhowal to move some of the items to his home, he kept putting it off on some pretext. When he finally relented, she found herself with the guy and a broker at an under-construction building. This raised the suspicion that he had not bought the apartment like he had initially claimed. Upon digging into the matter a little, she came to know that Bhowal was not employed at all.

The woman finally took Bhowal to an IT firm office in New Town, where he had claimed he worked, the man broke down and confessed it was a con job. The Jadavpur police then arrested Bhowal and detained his family for questioning.

“The four accused — Subhodip and his relatives Nirmal Kumar Bhowal , Jharna Bhowal , and Gour Saha trying to pull off a con job and was — entered into a criminal conspiracy and induced the complainant’s sister-in-law for marriage by feeding false information about the Subhodip’s job and property. The woman’s family had distributed the wedding cards, booked a venue, bought ornaments and booked a caterer,” an investigating officer said.

“We found that the accused does not have a history of fraud. Subhodip said he believed that he would manage to pull off the con job. We are questioning his family to understand their roles. We have sent a team to his Nadia home to dig out more information,” he added.

CUTTACK: From the place of his birth, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday launched a new chapter for Odisha, one that aims to provide world class healthcare services to its people. Laying the foundation stone towards transforming SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack into a world class institute, the chief minister said it will add a new chapter in the state’s journey towards progress and prosperity.

Addressing a huge gathering at the historic Baliyatra ground to mark the completion of 20 years of his government, that also coincides with the 104th birth anniversary of his father Biju Patnaik , Naveen struck an emotional chord with the people by recalling the special bond that his family shares with the millennium city.

“Biju babu had a close bonding with Cuttack. He was brought up in the city. He had fought against the British and travelled from Cuttack to Peshawar (now Pakistan) on a bicycle. Our family had special ties with Cuttack,” Naveen said amid loud cheers from the crowd of more than 50,000.

Naveen was born on October 16, 1946 in Cuttack’s Anand Bhawan , the ancestral house of Biju, which has now been converted into a museum. While the 73-year-old chief minister had spent only a few years of his childhood in Cuttack, his father had completed his school and college education in the city.

The state government plans to spend around Rs 1,000 crore in two years to upgrade the 76-year-old SCB Medical College and Hospital. A 3000-bed superspecialty hospital, international-standard infrastructure for medical education, accommodation for doctors, students and others, an integrated sports complex, direct access from the six-lane ring road and affordable lodging for attendants of patients are on the anvil.

While the campus at present is spread over about 100 acres, another 40 to 50 acres will be added by acquiring private property and clearing encroachments.

“The SCB Medical College and Hospital is the ray of hope of people from within and outside the state, who come here for treatment. Hence, there is a need to develop its infrastructure,” said Naveen at the function that was attended by several BJD MLAs and ministers.

The government has recently formed a team of 10 eminent doctors to advice it and to bring in new ideas in healthcare in the institute that handles around 1.5 lakh patients every month.

Expressing his gratitude to the people of the state, Naveen said the 4.5 crore Odia people are like his family members. He sought people’s blessings to realize his dream of an empowered and prosperous Odisha.

The chief minister also launched the distribution of entitlement card for pucca housing at the state level panchayti raj day celebration in the state capital. The state government plans to distribute entitlement cards to 20 lakh people, to be covered under various rural housing schemes, in phases. Naveen also announced that March 5 will be celebrated as Lok Seva divas along with panchayati raj day.

392,['6/03/2020'],Tapas wife mulls legal step over viral ‘planchette’ clip,"Representative image

KOLKATA: Widow of actor Tapas Paul, Nandini, has threatened to take action against a tantric for uploading a video of a ‘planchette’ of the actor-turned-politician, who passed away on February 18, on social media. Nandini has threatened to move court unless the video is deleted.

Nandini acknowledged that she had learnt about the video but was yet to check the content. Her lawyer Ayan Chakraborti said they were contemplating action against the person who had uploaded the video. The nearly 1.5-minute-long video was uploaded on YouTube on February 26 with a disclaimer that it was not shot to hurt or cheat anyone. The tantric, however, could not be contacted.

Kanak Bhattacharya, a close aide of Paul, who has produced several folk theatres in which Paul had acted, called it a “heinous offence” to post the video of a planchette. “It was in very bad taste. It was done to gain cheap publicity. Such things need to be stopped and police should take action,” Bhattacharya said. Psychologist Amit Chakraborty added, “None of us are aware about life beyond death. So planchette is simply a hoax. There is nothing scientific in the process. Such controversies are deliberately raked up to gain views and increase the number of followers.”

“The Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, is rarely enforced. Those who claim to have spoken with the dead are misleading and fooling people,” he said. “Most people are said to be acting as a medium and often act under hypnotic influence or act as hysteric patient during a planchette session. For many, this is just fun,” he added.

According to psychologist and mental health activist Tapas Kumar Ray, there is no basis for planchette and it is simply a figment of imagination. “It is a hoax and there is no scientific rationale behind it. People must not be fooled,” he said. For psychiatrist Arnab Banerjee, planchette is a highly debatable subject and it depended on the faith of people. “It has no scientific basis. But Tagore is said to have been involved in planchette sessions,” he said.

Amarnath Mullick, another psychiatrist, said planchette is part of para-psychology and remained a mystery. Dipanjan Dey, founder of Batanagar Paranormal Society , who had seen the video, said it was a drama to gain cheap publicity. “We do not support planchette,” he said.

393,['6/03/2020'],"TA soldier ends life, note says ‘pained’ by unit’s relocation","Nagpur: The controversy over Sitabuldi Fort took a tragic turn when Mangesh Bhagat Jinvar, a soldier in the 118 territorial army (TA) battalion committed suicide on Wednesday at Bhusawal, where the unit has been recently shifted from Nagpur. The fort had remained the battalion’s base for the last 80 years.

Jinvar shot himself with a service weapon. Sources in the unit said that Jinvar has left a suicide note which reads that he was disturbed after the battalion’s headquarters was moved from Nagpur to Bhusawal.

Panjabrao Ugale, superintendent of police (Jalgaon) whose jurisdiction also covers Bhusawal, confirmed that a letter was recovered from the suicide spot. “The letter mentioned that Jinvar was facing inconvenience due to shifting of the battalion’s base from Nagpur to Bhusawal,” Ugale told TOI.

The defence spokesperson at Nagpur too issued a statement saying that deceased had a troubled marital life and the suicide had nothing to do with the move to shift the unit to Bhusawal. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the cause of death.

Jinvar had been posted in Jammu & Kashmir (J & K) since 2012 and had returned to the headquarters only on February 17. His family is based at Murtijapur tehsil of Akola district, says the defence spokesperson’s statement.

A source pointed out that since his family was based at Murtizapur, shifting to Bhusawal would have only brought Jinvar closer to his home by 100km. He also ran a training institute for army aspirants at Murtizapur.

The decision to shift the battalion headquarters had evoked criticism from a group of ex-servicemen of the unit and activists. Protests rallies to oppose the move were taken out in last two months.

The army’s sub-area office for Uttar Maharashtra and Gujarat (UMANG), that shifted from Mumbai to Nagpur over a year ago, is the new occupant of the fort. The TA was shifted to make way for the UMANG sub-area.

However, quickly another lobby of ex-servicemen, mainly officers, has supported the move calling it to be part of routine shifting of an army unit and criticized the opposition as interference in army’s work.

The group that is opposing shifting is stressing that since TA is not a regular army and remains based in a specific region, the sudden shifting will only uproot the families who have been staying in Nagpur for years.

The other group says even otherwise the unit is posted in field areas like J & K for large part of time, leaving a rear party at Nagpur.

Avinash Kakde of Kisan Seva Sangh, who is leading the protest against the shifting, said that his outfit will raise the issue at every level. “The incident shows that after farmers even the solders are committing suicide and government’s apathy is to be blamed for it,” he said.

Kakde alleges that shifting the TA can be a prelude to handing over the heritage fort to civilian authorities as it has been demanded by a section of politicians. Meanwhile, Jinvar’s picture hailing him as a martyr is already doing rounds on social media.

394,['6/03/2020'],"Cantt area set to get 13 anganwadis, recruitment drive to begin post polls","Aurangabad: Residents and activists of the Cantonment Board finally got a reason to rejoice on Thursday as the state women and child welfare department has approved the establishment of 13 anganwadis in the Cantonment area, following the directives of the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court.

TOI has been following up on the issue for the last two years. Clippings of TOI reports stressing on the need for anganwadis in Aurangabad Cantonment was also attached to the PIL filed by activists in the court.

In November 2019, activists of Cantonment Jan Adhikar Manch (CJAM) filed a public interest litigation (PIL) at the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court seeking the establishment of anganwadis in Aurangabad Cantonment. During the hearing on February 20, Abhay Rathod, who was representing the petitioners, had told the bench of the high court that the district women and child development (WCD) department had conducted a survey in the Cantonment area to explore suitable places and that a proposal had been sent to the commissioner of child integration, Mumbai, for approval of 13 anganwadis in the area.

On February 27, the state government approved the establishment of the 13 anganwadis at the locations identified by district WCD department in Aurangabad Cantonment. Residents in the Cantonmnent area on Thursday celebrated the release of the letter approving anganwadis in the area.

Sunil Maske, CJAM convenor and also a petitioner in the case, said that the Government of India had introduced the concept of anganwadis in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), of which it is a signatory. “Anganwadis uphold children’s right to survival,” said Maske.

Laxman Deshmukh, one of the petitioners, said, “The actual establishment and operations of the approved anganwadis should start at the earliest.”

Pramod Yendole, the child development project officer of Aurangabad-urban A, said that now that the anganwadis in the Cantonment area have been approved, they have to recruit workers (sevika and madatnis) for each of the facility.

“We were going to start the recruitment drive in April. However, as the elections for the Aurangbad Cantonment are likely to be held in May, the model code of conduct may come into effect in April. Therefore, the recruitment process will be held after the elections,” said Yendole adding that the anganwadis may start full-fledged operations in around six months.

Nagpur: Treading the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi is not easy. People have to first realize that they can err in their actions. It would be better for the mankind if sooner they realize the wrongs they did and take corrective measures, said Terry Beitzel, director of Mahatma Gandhi Center for Global Non-violence and professor of justice studies at James Madison University, USA, on Wednesday.

He was delivering the keynote address on ‘Reflections on Mahatma Gandhi: The global perspective’, organized by the departments of English and Gandhian Thought of Nagpur University. Chandrakant Langare, professor at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, SD Palwekar, DM Shende and Pramod Watkar of the department of Gandhian Thought, were present.

Beitzel said the world was and will strongly be connected with what Gandhi preached. The theory of non-violence propounded by Gandhi has many merits provided it is properly practised, he added.

Talking about criminal justice, he said, it is not about how a crime was committed but justifying how one was harmed. Criminals are sent to jail after their involvement in crime is proved. In most cases, criminals again take to crime after serving the sentence. This needs to be changed by making efforts to reform them, he said.

In such a situation, Beitzel said, restorative justice is an alternative where one can draw a line. The mindset of criminals can be changed if they understand what kind of help the society needs, he said.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane said honesty and non-violence were the greatest traits of Gandhi. But it is difficult to lead the life like Gandhi as it requires perseverance. Those who have inner strength alone can follow his principles in totality, he said.

Baljit Mudliar conducted the proceedings while SD Palwekar proposed a vote of thanks.

401,['6/03/2020'],Authorities gear up ahead of summer,"Only GPS-assisted tanker trucks will be used for water distribution

KOZHIKODE: The district administration and local self-government bodies have started initiatives to face drought and other heat-related issues . The district collector has directed irrigation , water authority and other departments to take steps to address drinking water shortage and related issues.

“A meeting to review drought preparedness was held a few days ago and the local bodies are directed to coordinate drought-related activities,” said Shamin Sebastian, deputy collector, disaster management.

The local bodies were directed to identify drought-hit areas in the district and arrange the supply of drinking water by tanker trucks to the residents there. Only GPS-assisted tanker trucks will be used for water distribution.

The state government has also issued an order to the local bodies to start water supply in areas concerned, she said. The government has directed the local bodies to depend completely on GPS-assisted trucks for water supply to avoid irregularity, said an official with the office of the deputy director of panchayats. “We have been using GPS-assisted vehicles since 2017,” the official said. The local bodies will also have to maintain log book of the water distribution. The source of water and the quality of water will also be checked before starting supply.

The district collector has also directed the health and food safety departments to remain alert about health issues.

The district collector has directed the irrigation department and local bodies to focus on the repair and maintenance of check dams and VCB (Vacuum Circuit Breaker controls supply of water). The check dams and VCBs are expected to address water shortage during the summer.

The closing of check dams will help to maintain water levels of wells. The irrigation department officials have also started inspection of existing check dams across the district as part of drought-preparatory works.

The possibility of temporarily increasing the height of the check dams will be also be checked by the officials. The work force of the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme will be used for completing the work, said an official with disaster management wing.

The district administration has also initiated measures to prevent heat stroke and sun burn.

404,['6/03/2020'],Arvi gets country’s 1st unique sewerage system,"Nagpur: Death toll of sewer cleaners in the country has been on the higher side. Taking serious note of it, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has designed the country’s first ‘decentralized shallow sewerage system’ for Arvi, a city in Wardha district.

The system, designed under the expertise of Neeri director Rakesh Kumar, is based on a decentralized approach and natural gravity flow. “The topography of Arvi is such that the sewerage system runs on 100% gravity flow, which eliminates the cost of pumping station, laying of pumping mains and huge amount of recurring maintenance,” said Ritesh Vijay, principal scientist and head of Mumbai zonal centre.

At over 57% coverage area, the depth of the network is around 1.5 meters. “The depth in conventional sewerage systems is much more. Toxic gases like methane are formed which pose a serious health threat to cleaners. With low depth, this shallow system can be cleaned easily, thus doing away with the need for cleaners to go deep down,” added Vijay.

Last month, a 17-year-old boy died of asphyxiation inside a manhole in Bengaluru after he went inside to clean it.

Apart from being cost-effective, the system is also environment-friendly. “Minimal disturbance to soil profile of Arvi was accounted as there is hardly any excavation. The system also reduced further pollution load of extensive digging and filling activities during sewerage network, which led to environment friendly construction,” said Vijay, adding that the project can be a blueprint for implementing decentralized approach model for sewage conveyance of towns having population less than 1 lakh.

The system is under implementation in Arvi where the sewage would go directly in open drains. The decentralized system is divided into two parts. The first sewage treatment plant (STP) is based on phytorid technology which uses plants to absorb nutrients directly from waste water. The second STP is a moving bed biofilm reactor which is made of an activated sludge aeration system.

According to scientists, decentralized sewerage system is more effective compared to centralized one. Citing Nagpur’s example, Vjay said, “At present, only 50% of the city’s sewage is getting treated. Remaining 50% is going to rivers like Nag, Pora and Pili.”

Recently, Neeri set up Telangana’s first phytorid-based sewage treatment plant at the campus of International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI) in Hyderabad.

406,['6/03/2020'],District sweats it out as mercury touches a new high,"Coimbatore: Summer nights seem to be getting hotter and stuffier in the district. Night temperatures in the first few days of this March are at least 5 degree Celsius to 7 degree Celsius hotter than what it was in 2018. It is also 2.5 degree Celsius higher than the average night temperature for the period. Weather experts say these conditions are not favourable for plants and crops, and they may require more water.

On Wednesday night (March 4), the district recorded a minimum of temperature of 24.7 degree Celsius, according to the meteorological department, and 25 degree Celsius, according to the weather station at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). In the comparable period last year, the temperature recorded was 23.8 degree Celsius and the year before that (2018) it was just 18.7 degree Celsius. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) says this is 4.2 degree Celsius higher than the average nighttime temperature recorded on March 4 over the past many decades. It is also 5.3 degree Celsius higher than the temperatures recorded just two years ago.

Tuesday night’s temperatures, which stood at 23.2 degree Celsius according to IMD and 24 degree Celsius as per TNAU, too is at least 2.7 degree Celsius higher than the average temperatures for March 3. The temperature for the same day last year was 22.8 degree Celsius and just 17.2 degree Celsius in 2018.

S P Ramanathan, director, agro climate research centre, TNAU, said, “There is no doubt that nights are getting hotter and our data for the past four decades also shows summers in general are becoming hotter, both during day and night. There are signs of climate change.”

Weather experts agree that increasing night temperatures or minimum temperatures are a direct result of the greenhouse effect. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at Skymet weather services, says, “While the low nighttime temperatures in 2018 could be a random occurrence due to high day time temperatures and low cloud formation, there is a gradual increase in night temperatures. It is because the hot air gets trapped between the earth’s surface and the greenhouse gases, not having a way to escape at night.”

Interestingly, the maximum temperatures in the first five days of March have either dropped slightly or remain the same. For example, Wednesday recorded 35 degree Celsius, compared to 35.5 degree Celsius recorded on March 4 last year and 35.3 degree Celsius in 2018. At 34 degree Celsius, the temperature recorded on Tuesday (March 3) was also 0.2 degree Celsius lesser than last year and 0.5 degree Celsius lower than 2018.

BHUBANESWAR: State police have begun an inquiry against the inspector in charge (IIC) of government railway police (GRP) station in Bhubaneswar, Bharat Sahoo, in connection with the alleged theft of ganja seized from his custody in August last year. The complainant in the case was a havildar of the same station.

On February 29, the intelligence wing of state police wrote to the ADGP (railways), Pranabindu Acharya , to conduct an inquiry against Sahoo. The letter said the intelligence wing had received a complaint and two photographs as evidence against Sahoo from GRP havildar, Dinabandhu Sahu.

“Please find the original petition (complaint) and two colour photographs received from havildar Dinabandhu Sahu against inspector Bharat Sahoo of Bhubaneswar GRP station. Action as deemed proper may please be taken at your end,” reads the intelligence wing’s letter.

In the petition, havildar Dinabandhu wrote that he and five of his colleagues found three bags containing ganja weighing 21kg from Utkal Express when they were deployed at Bhubaneswar station on the night of August 3, 2019. “The ganja was seized from the possession of an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Bhubaneswar GRP station. We took the seized ganja to the GRP station. IIC Bharat Sahoo ordered us to keep the seized bags in his chamber. After two or three days, the IIC gave the bags to the ASI, from whose possession we had seized the ganja,” the petition said.

In the complaint, the havildar also accused the GRP station’s IIC and the ASI of having helped ganja smugglers transport the substance in trains from Bhubaneswar. “We are inquiring into the charges against the GRP station’s inspector. An SP has been assigned to conduct the probe and submit the inquiry report,” Acharya told TOI.

Sahoo dismissed the allegations. “I am not involved in any wrongdoing,” he said.

“In the past decade, numerous unidentified people have intruded into our country. We have to pin down the terrorists who had sneaked in by using the opportunity. Our party is on a mission to explain this fact to the people,” Radhakrishnan told the reporters in Trichy.

Accusing that the opposition parties were blowing the issue out of proportions, Radhakrishnan sought to allay the fear of Muslims and called for a truce by giving up protests.

Maintaining that the DMK was incapable of explaining to people about the nitty-gritty of CAA, Radhakrishnan appealed to Muslims not to fall prey to its call for protecting Muslims. The DMK is ‘persuading’ Muslim youths and students to take to the streets against CAA, he said. “Muslims should understand the double-standard of the DMK. The Congress also follows the DMK. Muslims will never be forced to leave the country,” he said. Holding the Congress party responsible for the religious rift in the country, Radhakrishnan demanded an apology from the Congress for causing divide in the country.

417,['6/03/2020'],Hopes of cooler summer crumble,"Coimbatore: The last remnants of “spring” in the district seemed to disappear on Wednesday and Thursday, when the mercury hit 35.1 degree Celsius. If the afternoons were hot and sultry, the nights too were stuffy, requiring high-speed fans or air coolers. Weather experts attribute the relatively cooler February to the late onset of summer due to a trough that is extending from Vidarbha in the North to the comorin area in the South.

With temperatures remaining under 33.5 degree Celsius for most part of February, the city residents, who are used to an early onset of summer, hoped that the entire hot season this year would be comparatively milder. They couldn’t be blamed with even the first few days of March being at least 1 degree Celsius cooler than the past several years.

Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at Skymet weather services, said, “The reason the late February and the first few days of March were cooler was due to the trough extending from the North to the South, including central Kerala and interior Tamil Nadu. The trough was bringing light rainfall on and off to parts of Kerala and hilly regions of Tamil Nadu. As such, its effect was felt in the adjacent regions and on the plains too.”

However, with temperatures crossing 34 degree Celsius from Tuesday and hitting 35 degree Celsius on Wednesday, hopes of a cooler summer seemed to crumble. R Raveendran, a marathon runner and jogger in Saravanampatti, said, “We usually push our jog start timings from 6.45am to 5.4 5am by February 10 every year, because it gets too hot by the time we finish. I was surprised when we sustained our 6.45am schedule till March first week. But for the past two days it became too hot and draining when we finished. We have to start earlier now.”.

It was only after feeling dehydrated on Thursday, did Raveendran bother checking his weather app on his mobile phone. IMD and TNAU’s data confirmed his suspicions. The maximum temperature in the city has increased from 33.5 degree Celsius on March 1 to 35.1 on Wednesday.

S P Ramanathan, director, agro climate research centre, TNAU, said, “However, temperatures will remain the same for another week or so, due to the trough and then shoot up by around 2 degree Celsius or so.”

418,['6/03/2020'],Parents seek stay on closure of SAI’s gymnastics facility,"Aurangabad: Parents of many athletes and the gymnastics association have shot a letter to the minister of youths affairs and sports, Government of India, seeking a stay on the closure of the gymnastics centre at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) training centre (west zone) in Aurangabad.

Around a fortnight ago, Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel had met minister of youth affairs and sports Kiren Rijiju and given him a letter addressing the concerns of sportspersons and their parents on shifting six sporting disciplines — judo, volleyball, handball, kabaddi, football and gymnastics — from SAI’s training centre in the city. “He had said that he would ask his department to review the decision. After that, there was no correspondence from their side. Tomorrow, I will speak to him and ensure the six sporting disciplines are retained with the training centre in Aurangabad,” Jaleel told TOI on Thursday.

Maharashtra Amateur Gymnastics Association (MAGA) and the Athlete Parents’ Association SAI centre, Aurangabad, have written letters to Rijiju requesting him to stop the closure of these games at the centre here. According to president of parents’ association Pravin Hattekar, the authorities have not officially informed about shifting the gymnastics centre. However, the athletes are being verbally told to shift to centres in Kolkata and Delhi.

“The players practicing at the centre here are from across Maharashtra. For the last three years, Maharashtra has been at the top in junior gymnastics. When there is so much potential for the sport in the state, why are they closing the centre?” asked Hattekar.

According to MAGA honorary secretary Makarand Joshi, players practicing in the SAI centre, Aurangabad, have been selected from across Maharashtra and have reached to international platforms at the junior levels. “Aurangabad has produced 30 gymnasts who have been honoured with state government’s Shiv Chhatrapati sports awards,” said Joshi.

The officials seized 500 kilograms of fish unfit for consumption from the shops at popular market during the raid.

Designated food safety officer K Tamil Selvan had constituted four teams after receiving complaints from public about the sale of stale fish. The teams raided several fish shops across the district.

The team led by food safety officer Vijayaraja, which aided the wholesale and retail fish market at Ukkadam, found that the traders were selling fish laced with formalin.

As many as 60 shops in the market have been conducting business for several years. While the price of fish sold at the market was lower than that of the retail shops elsewhere in the city, the quality was often below par.

While the team seized 70 kilograms of formalin-laced fish, they also found 430 kilograms of stale fish sold in some of the shops at the market. The seized fish were destroyed in the presence of the traders.

The officials also gave a stern warning to the traders not to sell rotten fish or use chemicals to prolong the shelf life.

Formalin is a solution of formaldehyde, a toxic chemical linked to cancer.

420,['6/03/2020'],State records third cadaveric kidney transplant in a month,"BHUBANESWAR: In a big achievement for the state’s healthcare sector, Odisha recorded its third case of cadaveric kidney transplant in a month on Thursday. The kidneys of Rajalaxmi Das, a brain dead patient of Delanga in Puri district, were transplanted on to two patients of SCB Medical College and Hospital.

Das (45) was admitted in Hi-Tech Medical College and Hospital here on March 1 after a road accident and was declared brain dead by doctors on Wednesday. After undergoing counselling, her family agreed to donate her kidneys. The hospital then informed the State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (Sotto), the state-level nodal body for organ transplantation.

“As per guidelines, one kidney of a donor is given to the donor hospital and the other to a patient on the waiting list prepared by Sotto. Since seven patients at the top of the waiting list were not fit for kidney transplant, the organs were given to two patients at SCB,” said Chitta Ranjan Kar , nodal officer of Sotto. The recipients are Ritarani Mahanta of Mayurbhanj and Ratnakar Mohanty of Kamakhyanagar in Dhenkanal.

The first cadaveric kidney transplant was done in February 5, followed by the second one on February 27. All recipients are doing fine, sources said.

“We are happy that organ donation is picking up in Odisha but it would be better if other organs of brain dead patients could also be retrieved and transplanted. The focus now should be on successful transplant of other organs,” said Pravas Acharya , president of Body and Organ Donation Society of India.

421,['6/03/2020'],Explain policy measures on abortion for rape survivors: Rajasthan high court,"Image used for representational purpose only

JAIPUR: A division bench of Rajasthan high court on Thursday asked the state government to explain what steps are being taken to frame a policy for voluntary termination of pregnancy by rape survivors. The court has also issued notices to the chief secretary, government of Rajasthan, the principal secretary, heath, the home secretary, the principal secretary social justice and empowerment and director general of police.

Notices were issued by the division bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice Narendra Singh Dhadha following a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Shalini Sheoran, a lawyer.

“In many cases of rape, the survivor conceives and neither she nor her family members wish for her to give birth to the child. However, the process of abortion becomes complicated for her after there is an FIR of rape. During the investigation she is not supposed to get an abortion in terms of health and other reasons. Also, the DNA testing of foetus is also not been done in these cases,” Shalini said in her petition.

She added that in many cases during the trial the rape survivor due to sudden medical complications has to undergo abortion or other measures due to which the DNA is not protected. “Such things favour the accused in the trial. Thus, I have filed this PIL to advocate for a policy for voluntary abortion in the cases of rape. Apart from this, their record and DNA of the foetus should be kept intact so that it can be used by the police for investigation purpose,” she added. “There is no database by the state government of vulnerable survivors of rape telling how many FIRs of rapes are filed and out of these in how many cases police submitted final report and in how many cases abortion was done,” she added.

The petition also urged that the police, legal services authority and health department provide counselling to the rape survivors and provide them assistance for abortion. “There is no system of conducting the DNA profiling of the foetus with the accused before filing a final report in the rape cases. Also, with the petition, we have prayed for framing of guidelines for the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill 2020 to facilitate the rape survivors,” she added.

422,['6/03/2020'],New med college to come up in Namakkal at Rs 338cr,"Namakkal: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday said 85% of seats in the 11 new government medical colleges will be allotted to students from Tamil Nadu while the rest will be admitted from all India quota.

Speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony for a government medical college to be built at the cost Rs 338.76 crore at Nallipalayam in the district on Thursday, the chief minister said, “Students from the state who clear NEET exam will also be eligible under all India quota.”

On DMK chief M K Stalin’s comment that the new medical colleges would be of no use to students from the state as students from other states would enter the colleges by clearing NEET, Palaniswami said Stalin was spreading wrong information to the public. He said the percentage pattern which was followed in previous years would be followed in future as well.

“As mentioned in Amma’s ‘Vision 2023’, we are working to achieve all the goals set by her within that year,” he added.

The chief minister assured to construct a barrage across river Cauvery at the cost of Rs 65 crore to tide over water crisis in Namakkal and Karur districts.

“The barrage construction work is going on and it will be dedicated for the public use,” he said.

He also assured to convert Namakkal-Trichy highways as four-lane at the earliest. Proposal has been sent to the Central government and work will start once the state government gets nod.

Union minister for state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey and deputy CM O Panneerselvam also participated in the function.

The CM also laid foundation stones for eight new projects in the event. He distributed welfare measures to 33,141 beneficiaries at the cost of Rs 134.37 crore.

Ministers P Thangamani (electricity), V Saroja (social welfare), C Vijayabaskar (health), Namakkal district collector K Megraj and others participated in the event.

Later, the chief minister inaugurated a government arts and science college in Senthamangalam. The college building was constructed at the cost of Rs 7.98 crore.

After the inauguration, Palaniswami said, “My government had set up 12 new government arts and science colleges in the state.”

When Jayalalithaa became chief minister in 2011, 34 students out of 100 pursued higher education in the state.

“Now, it has gone up to 49,” he said, adding that thousands of students, especially from rural areas, are eagerly pursuing higher education after the AIADMK government created a viable environment for them. When compared with other states, Tamil Nadu offers higher education at cheaper cost, he said.

The CM also unveiled the plans to divert Mettur dam’s surplus water in Tirumanimutharu river scheme to irrigate farmlands in Salem, Namakkal and Tiruchengode areas. “Public Works Department officials are studying the feasibility of the project. The project will help dry areas to go green.” He said they were also looking into the feasibility of constructing a barrage across the Cauvery between Nerur village in Karur district and Oruvanthur village in Namakkal district.

School education minister K A Sengottaiyan, higher education minister K P Anbalagan, Namakkal MP A K P Chinraj, MLAs KPP Baskar, C Chandrasekaran and others participated in the function.

A total of 150 MBBS seats were sanctioned for the college and classes started last year.

It was the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa who made the announcement for setting up a medical college in Karur district in August 2014 in the state assembly.

A government order was passed in January 2015 and Rs 269.58 crore was allocated in June 2018 by the government for establishing the hospital.

The corporation said the decision was taken to save the fund allocated for the projects from getting lapsed.

The total estimated cost for the 70 projects included in the 2019-2020 fiscal is Rs 4.36 crore. The changed projects include the linking of the punching system of corporation employees with their salary. The proposed cost for the project was Rs 5 lakh.

The renovation of the of the old corporation building using Rs 21 lakh and the setting up of a museum at the old corporation office spending Rs 15 lakh renovation of Perunthirithi ground spending Rs 40 lakh also are included in the 70 projects selected.

The fund thus saved should be diverted for other projects, including land acquisition, said P C Rajan, chairman, standing committee on development. Meantime, adv P M Suresh Babu from the opposition alleged that the ruling side was trying to postpone the projects without implementing the projects on time. The corporation failed to ensure timely preparation for the implementation of the project, the opposition alleged.

The delay in linking punching system with salary is the key reason for the lack of efficiency, they alleged. The city corporation has utilised only 36% of the earmarked fund though the financial year is about to end, the opposition alleged.

Responding to the allegation, corporation secretary Binu Francis claimed that the utilisation percentage is less as only submitted bills of 32% of the works were sanctioned by the treasury. The bills of more than 80% of the works would be submitted before the treasury before the end of the fiscal, he claimed.

426,['6/03/2020'],PM recalls Biju’s bravery on birth anniversary,"File photo of Narendra Modi

Bhubaneswar: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid a fitting tribute to Biju Patnaik on his 104th birth anniversary by tweeting a 1945-document that showed how Biju had bravely helped freedom fighter Ram Manohar Lohia.

The intelligence bureau report of October 1945 pertains to Biju, an ace pilot, flying Lohia from Delhi to Kolkata when the latter was underground. “Remembering Biju Babu on his Jayanti. This document from the pages of history (dated 1945) gives a glimpse of his courage (flying Dr. Lohia, who was then underground) and excellence. Biju Babu worked tirelessly for India’s progress and pioneered the development of Odisha,” Modi tweeted.

The intelligence bureau pointed out Biju “misused his position as a pilot by surreptitiously flying Lohia (who was the underground).” The report said, “Flying is Patnaik’s normal way of making a living; and we should prefer to see him unemployed rather than idle. If the Indian National Airways do not re-employ him, Tatas probably will because he is an excellent pilot.”

Notably, the India’s freedom struggle and the period after is replete with instance of Biju’s acts of heroism. On October 27, 1947, a day after the then Jammu and Kashmir ruler Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession with India, Biju, then an Indian Air Force pilot, had landed troops in Srinagar to secure the airport, which was crucial in preventing Kashmir from falling into the hands of Pakistani invaders.

Though he worked for British-controlled Royal Indian Air Force before Independence, Biju flew freedom fighters to secret meetings with supporters and gave shelter to Jaya Prakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali besides Lohia in his house.

As a 32-year-old pilot, Biju had in 1947 flown Indonesian leaders Mohammad Hatta and Sultan Shariar from Jakarta to Delhi, braving the Dutch threat to shoot his aircraft down, lending Indian support to Indonesian freedom struggle.

430,['6/03/2020'],‘Cloud kitchens’ come under SDMC lens,"South Delhi Municipal Corporation

NEW DELHI: Are you sure that the food that you order through delivery apps is actually prepared in a kitchen meeting the standard health trade norms? The public health department of South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) isn’t. It has now ordered a crackdown on the “cloud kitchens” operating illegally in south Delhi.

The additional commissioner (health) has directed the zonal deputy health officers that “all illegal cloud kitchens in their respective zones should be immediately closed”.

A senior civic official explained how the authorities were being taken for a ride. “Cloud kitchens operate in conjunction with online food delivery applications. These are basically take-away outlets without any dining facility. They simply operate as production units with a space for preparing food, which gets delivered to customers,” he added. Many of these outlets are operating out of unauthorised colonies while many in the rest of south Delhi also don’t have health trade licence, the official said.

“The only purpose is to cut down on delivery time and make profit but norms are being flouted to achieve them,” he pointed out. Another official said multiple restaurants were reportedly using one kitchen to cut down on delivery time.

In many cases, the health trade licence has been taken by a parent restaurant but the food being sold in its name is actually being prepared somewhere else with no regulatory supervision. “All such kitchens in the unauthorised colonies will either be closed or sealed while others need to take a separate licence,” the official clarified.

SDMC recently closed 10 “cloud kitchens” and will soon launch a drive to take action against the rest. A survey is being carried out in all four zones — Central, South, West and Najafgarh. “The Central zone has just seven authorised licensed kitchens, out of which three are operating from Okhla Industrial Phase I, two from Okhla Phase II, one from Tughlaqabad Extension and another from Kotla Mubarakpur. Similar kitchens are operating in all four zones,” an official said.

The main concern is maintaining hygiene standards. “In unauthorised colonies, many outlets don’t have a proper waste processing mechanisms. Unscientific disposal of waste is also creating problems for locals. We will issue notice to all such kitchens,” a senior official said.

The licensed restaurants will have an option to run these delivery-only kitchens only in regularised colonies but will have to take a separate licence, said the official. The units measuring more than 90sq m will also have to get a fire safety clearance.

The move will also boost SDMC’s coffer. Each outlet will have to pay a one-time registration fee of Rs 10,000 and a processing fee of Rs 1,000 while Rs 20,000 will be charged annually as the licensing fee.

431,['6/03/2020'],Close shave for 35 students as wheels of school bus come off after tyre puncture,"Vellore: It was a miraculous escape for about 35 students of a school after the left rear wheels of their school bus came off from the axle after one of the tyres burst while crossing Ramanur near Jolarpet in Tirupattur district on Thursday.

JTMS, a high school, has been functioning in Jolarpet since 2011, a police officer said. Currently, 400 students from more than 10 villages pursue education from kindergarten to Class X in the school.

The incident took place when the bus was heading to the school after picking up students from Mandalavadi, Ponneri and Chinna Ponneri villages. One of the left rear tyres of the bus burst, resulting in both tyres on the left rear side detaching from the vehicle. The driver, who lost control of the vehicle, managed to bring it to a stop after about 100 metres at Ramanur.

Fortunately, none of the students suffered injuries. Local villagers who witnessed the accident rushed to the spot and helped the stranded children, who were screaming for help in fear, get down from the vehicle.

Later, they were taken to school on another bus. The Jolarpet police are investigating the incident, said the police.

When TOI contacted Vellore chief education officer S Mars, he said, “Though the school administration failed to report the incident to the education department, we have ordered a departmental inquiry headed by the district education officer. Appropriate action would be taken against the private school administration.”

432,['6/03/2020'],Temple fined Rs 1 lakh for failure to curb littering during festival,"Udhagamandalam: The Sholur panchayat on Friday slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the authorities of Bokkapuram temple near Masinagudi for failing to curb littering of plastic bags in and around the temple premises during the five-day festival that ended on Tuesday.

Executive officer of Sholur panchayat Nandhakumar said, “As per the instruction of the district collector, a fine of Rs 1 lakh has been imposed on the temple authorities for not controlling vendors from using plastic bags and covers.”

Nagina, an activist and a resident of Bokkapuram, said, “It is sad to see the temple area littered with garbage where wild animals roam around. Though cleaning work is underway at one side, workers are burning the garbage including plastics on the other side.”

According to her, a pit near the temple is filled with food waste and plastics. If an animal falls into the pit, it will be a fatal fall, she added.

On burning garbage, local health supervisor Dharmalingam said, “Workers had burnt the garbage by mistake. We will correct them. It will not be repeated”.

Executive officer of the Bokkapuram temple Rajesh said, “We have a received a letter from the Sholur panchayat stating that a fine of Rs 1 lakh has been imposed on us. We need to consult with our higher officials in this regard”

When questioned why the temple allowed plastics inside the forest area, Rajesh said, “While floating the tender, we had stressed on the ban on plastics in the Nilgiris as one of the conditions. However, the vendors violated the condition. But we had been announcing about littering and plastic usage over mike.”

He added, “But the temple sees lakhs of visitors during the annual festival. But our staff strength is limited.”

Later in the evening on Thursday, herds of deer moved into the temple area. But the uncleaned littering was a cause of concern.

433,['6/03/2020'],Hawkers’ union demands space below flyovers for biz,"Aurangabad: A city-based hawkers’ union staged a sit-in agitation outside the civic headquarters on Thursday demanding that the green belt on Jalgaon Road and the spaces under the flyovers be designated hawkers’ zones.

Hawkers’ union Jai Bhagwan Mahasangh Kamgar Sanghatna’s Hathgadi Chalak-Malak Sanghatna submitted a memorandum to the mayor addressing the various concerns of hawkers in the city. According to president Balasaheb Sanap, hawkers were conducting businesses like selling tea, pakoda, vada pav and omelette on the roadsides from Cidco bus stand to Harsul T-Point for the last 20 to 25 years.

“However, under the name of green belt, the civic administration has done injustice to the small businessmen. At the same time, the AMC has allowed the big businesses along the road to adjust the limit of the green belt according to their whims,” said Sanap.

The AMC’s garden department has allowed hotels along the road to use the space alloacted for the 10-15ft green belt for four-wheeler parking. The union stated in the memorandum that hawkers be allowed 10-15ft space of the green belt in lieu of which the municipal body could charge them Rs 600 a month.

The hawkers cited the example of Pune and Mumbai and said that the AMC should open the spaces under flyovers for hawkers to conduct their business.

When asked, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that the process of identifying hawkers’ zone in the city as per the Street Vendors Act, 2014, was under way. “A meeting will be held with the officials, businessmen and vendors to reach a solution on the issue of the hawkers,” he Ghodele.

434,['6/03/2020'],A cut above the rest: College girls chop off lovely locks to make wigs for cancer patients,"Coimbatore: The theme of the International Women's Day , which falls on Sunday this year , seems to be hair donation.

After students of city-based PSG Institute of Management donated shiny locks of hair to make wigs for cancer patients, students of PSG College of Arts and Science came forward to donate eight to 10 inches of their hair for the cause on Thursday.

Addressing the girls, CEO of Naturals C K Kumaravelu, called them role models and likened them to Mother Teresa and Oprah Winfrey, bringing huge grins to their faces.

As many as 200 girls from the college had agreed to donate hair for the cause. Kumaravelu, an alumnus of the college who has set up a Naturals salon on the campus, said. “Every girl who donated hair is a role model. People always talk about Mother Teresa and Oprah Winfrey. But I think these girls, who took such a giant step to donate an important part of their external appearance to put a smile on a cancer patient’s face, are role models for the society and people around them,” he said. “These girls, with so much courage and confidence, took the extra mile to come out of their comfort zone. Now, these are truly beautiful models and will create a revolution and inspire more girls to come forward.”

Some of the girls who donated hair left the salon with the shortest ever hair they remembered having.

“I used to have hair till my mid-back, which I would only keep reshaping and restyling during haircuts. This is the first time I have hair as short as just my shoulders,” said V Vinothini, a final year Economics student.

“When I look at myself in the mirror, my face looks different but better actually. My parents are also proud of me,” she said.

Naturals salon, which collected the hair, plans to hand it over to Chennai-based wig maker Raj Impex and donate 10 wigs to cancer hospitals.

Making a wig costs Rs 6,000, sources said.

435,['6/03/2020'],"Fearing CAA &amp; NRC, citizens line up for birth certificates","Aurangabad: The birth and death certificate-issuing department of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has been witnessing an unusually heavy rush of applicants over the past two months. Most of them there to get their birth certificates.

An official at the birth and death registration department provided the numbers.

Earlier, the department received 10-15 birth certificate-related queries a month. However, in the past two months, the number of queries has increased to 700-800 a month. People aged 50 and above are now rushing to the department to get their birth certificates, the official said.

“Earlier, the office mainly saw applications seeking birth certificates of children up to the age of 5 years — who mostly needed the document for school admissions and benefits of government schemes. However, over the past two months, the number of applicants has gone up and these are mainly adults,” the officials added.

The fear of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) implementation is considered the key reason for the sudden spurt in the number of applications.

According to Nita Padalkar, who heads the department, the increase in the number of seekers of birth certificates is significant. However, the civic body is ensuring that the certificates are issued only when there are proper documents, she said.

“If the applicants do not have the documents required for issuing birth certificates, they are asked to go to the district court and secure a no-objection certificate. After that, we issue the certificate with due process,” Padalkar said. The AMC carries out a survey at the residence of the applicant to verify the address and secures the signatures of two guarantors before issuing the birth certificate

Zone 3, with a significantly high Muslim population, is receiving 40 to 50 applications for birth certificates every day over the last two months, against 20-22 applications filed earlier. As a result, the staff deployed at the nine zonal offices in the city and those at the 24-hour birth and death registration window at the AMC head office are required to put in extra hours.

Like elsewhere in the country, the CAA and NRC have been contentious topics in Aurangabad. In December last year, following the mammoth turnout at an anti-CAA rally in Aurangabad, the city police had imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the IPC. Assembly of four or more people without prior permission from the police will be banned from December 21 to February 18 in the city limits.

At the rally, participants raised slogans against PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah.

Requirement, sources and budget details for the water supply would be worked out by the irrigation department officials of the three states and later would be discussed by the chief ministers.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, in principle, agreed to supply drinking water to Tamil Nadu in consultation with his AP counterpart YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.A delegation from Tamil Nadu, consisting of ministers SP Velumani and D Jayakumar, and secretary of public water department K Manivasan and advisor M Sheelapriya, interacted with KCR. They later held discussions with Telangana ministers KT Rama Rao, Vemula Prashanth Reddy, Errabelli Dayakar Rao and other officials on Thursday.According to Telangana Chief Minister Office (CMO), KCR had suggested the delegation that Tamil Nadu government should send a formal request proposal to him and also to AP CM. He suggested that soon after receiving the proposal, there should be a meeting between three states at officers’ and experts’ level to prepare a report and proceed further. “Let the officers come to a consensus for taking a final decision. As and when this materialises, it would demonstrate how states can cooperate each other,” he said.KCR spoke to AP CM Jaganmohan Reddy about the TN delegation request. KCR, while interacting with the delegation, said that the neighbouring states should be benevolent for the drinking water needs of any state.“The whole country should feel ashamed for the suffering of Tamil Nadu in drinking water front. After meeting the irrigation needs of the entire country, there would still be a surplus of 30,000 tmc of water of the 70,000 tmc of water available in India. Just 10,000 tmc of water is enough for drinking water purposes in the country,” KCR said.Both AP and Telangana have been supplying drinking water to Chennai under `Telugu Ganga Project’ since 1983. It passes through Pothireddypadu-Somasila and Kandaleru to Tamil Nadu.“Three Krishna basin states of united AP, Karnataka and Maharashtra have agreed to spare 5 tmc each from their respective shares of Krishna waters totalling to 15 tmc to meet the requirements for Chennai city.

437,['6/03/2020'],"‘In 6 months, people will look at planning board differently’","File photo of chief secretary Asit Tripathy

What is your vision for the state planning board ?

I held a preliminary meeting with chief secretary Asit Tripathy , development commissioner Suresh Mohapatra and senior government officers to discuss ways to make the planning board function in an effective manner.

We are going to form two groups to work on two key areas. The modalities of this will be fixed soon. The district planning bodies will be integrated with the state planning board for effective implementation of programmes.

Which are the two key areas you are talking about?

We have decided to focus on industries and MSME sectors, and agriculture and allied sectors.

The development of industrial infrastructure will give a boost to the MSME sector and help generate employment for the youth. As far as agriculture and allied sectors are concerned, our focus will be on increasing the income of farmers.

The state planning board is often considered to be rehabilitation facility for senior leaders

The perception might exist but it is not true. I can’t comment on previous leaders of the planning board. As far as I am concerned, I have sincerely handled whatever responsibilities have been given to me by the chief minister earlier, be it in the government or in the party. I can assure you that the people’s way of looking at the planning board will change in six months.

The board last met in October 2007

As I said, I have already met senior government officers to discuss the functioning of the board. As per initial discussions, we will form two groups by the first week of April to decide on the roadmap for the next few years. We will also make a presentation to show the chief minister, who is the chairman of the planning board.

There is talk that the board will be restructured to function like the NITI Aayog

After the Planning Commission was replaced with the NITI Aayog by the Centre, there were discussions on transforming the state planning body into a professional think-tank. We need more consultation on this issue. I believe the chief minister will take the right call on this at the appropriate time.

Any specific plan for the Koraput-Balangir-Kalahandi (KBK) region?

The Centre stopped funding for the KBK region in 2015-16, but the state government has continued allocation under the Biju KBK programme. Most of the KBK districts have been included under the Centre’s aspirational districts programme. We will see what more can be done.

Why is the money in the mining fund not being used properly?

I agree with you on this. In spite of availability of huge funds under the district mineral foundation and the Odisha Mineral Bearing Areas Development Corporation, utilisation is not good.

We will examine the reasons and address them. The money should be used wisely and for the development of mineral-rich areas of the state.

KANNUR: Vehicles dumped in heaps, literally making the courtyards of government offices and police stations a graveyard of abandoned vehicles , is a common sight in most of the places, especially the premises of police stations. From the vehicles seized in connection with sand smuggling or abkari cases to those abandoned following accidents or even condemned by government departments are a pathetic sight but the district administration in Kasaragod has decided to get rid of them.

As the first step of cleaning the government office premises, the district administration has begun the process of auctioning off the impounded vehicles, said Kasaragod district collector D Sajith Babu.

“We don’t want the courtyards of the government offices to become the graveyard of vehicles and there is no obstacle for auctioning them,” he said.

“The Supreme Court has said the impounded vehicles need not be kept once the legal processes are over and hence we can auction it. Once the spaces are cleared, there will not be any inconvenience to the people,” he said.

To begin with, the administration has begun the auctioning of the trucks abandoned in police stations and revenue offices in the district, after they were impounded for sand smuggling. The vehicles in the dumping yard at Chatanchal would also be cleared.

“We have already auctioned 55 such vehicles and the remaining 229 would be auctioned by March 22,” he added.

Then, there are around 369 vehicles lying in different other police stations in the district, which would be auctioned in April. Those who have any complaints to register with regards to these vehicles, can do so and present their case in writing before the station house officer concerned within one month, said the collector.

Forty-five vehicles involved in abkari cases were also auctioned by the excise department, which would auction the remaining 20 vehicles by month end.

Among our other demands is waiver of all the loans disbursed by the Annabhau Sathe Corporation to remove the burden of debts for members of the Matang community, on the same lines as that of the farming community,” said Bhise.

The other demands include making the grazing ground in the names of those who use the land for farming. Bhise said that the organization had already made a representation to the chief minister through the Parbhani district collector.

442,['6/03/2020'],"Duped students stage stir, con couple surrenders","SAMBALPUR: At least 25 students, who were duped of Rs 9.75 lakh by a couple running a fake institution — Jamuna Devi (+2 Arts) Junior College — and failed to appear for the Plus II examination that began on Wednesday, staged a dharna in front of the residence of the Sambalpur district collector demanding immediate action against the culprits on Thursday.

Sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Sambalpur, Tapan Mohanty said the couple surrendered before the police on Thursday. “The couple has been detained and further investigation is on,” Mohanty said. Earlier, a police team was sent to Bhubaneswar to trace Tushar and Manjulata.

The students had taken admission in the fake institution that was being run by Tusar Barik and his wife, Manjulata Barik, for more than two years in the city’s Charbati area. Police said they have launched a manhunt to nab the couple.

While Tusar was the principal, Manjulata served as a teacher. They took Rs 36,000 from each student for the admission and an additional sum of Rs 3,000 as the examination fee despite not having the necessary clearance to run a college, police said.

Sahil Sahu, a student who was duped, said, “Though we took admission in the college and paid the examination fees, we could not appear for the examination. They took thousands of rupees for the admission and played with our career. We demand stringent action against the culprits.”

The protesting students, however, withdrew the dharna after district collector Subham Saxena assured them of an impartial inquiry into the incident and subsequent action. He formed a four-member team from among the students and discussed the issue.

The matter came to light after the students lodged a complaint with the Dhanupali police station in the city when they failed to appear for the ongoing plus-two arts exams.

In his complaint, Debendra Sharma of Mudipara said he had taken admission in the institute. “A few days ago, we approached the principal to provide us with the admit cards for the plus two arts exams. He told us we will have to collect the cards from the exam centre at Anchalik College, Sindhol, in Sonepur district. He also said the principal of Anchalik College will hand over the admit cards on the day of the exam,” Debendra added.

On Wednesday, when they went to Anchalik College to collect their admit cards and appear for the exam, they were denied entry. “It was then we realised we were duped,” Debendra said. “When we went to Jamuna Devi College, we found it locked. Neither the principal nor the teacher was to be found,” he added. With their options limited, the students then approached police.

While Rs 805 crore was recovered out of Rs 1,874 crore detected in Telangana, Rs 888 crore was recovered in AP. Interestingly, no prosecution has been ordered in Telangana, while only four arrests had taken place in AP.While sleuths of Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam have been active in pursuing GST evasion cases, 16,393 cases of evasion were booked by the central authorities in which evasion of Rs 70,206 crore was detected.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74500883,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93259,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-1-8k-cr-gst-evasion-in-telangana-rs-1-6k-cr-in-ap/articleshow/74500884.cms

MALAPPURAM: In a first-of-its-kind initiative in state, Kudumbasree Mission , Malappuram , has launched mobile car washing unit in the district.

‘Mobile Steam Car Spa’ was introduced by a Kudumabsree unit in Ponmundam grama panchayat, under its Yuvasree initiative. The car spa provides washing, sterilization and car polishing.

The mobile unit, which charges Rs 500 for a car, was launched by district collector of Malappuram Jafar Malik on Wednesday.

According to the Kudumbarsee Mission authorities, the total cost of the project was Rs 10.5 lakh. A total of Rs 9.5 lakh was provided as bank loan and the remaining amount was collected by the unit members. Water consumption is low as steam spa technology is used.

C K Hemalatha, district coordinator of Kudumbasree Mission, said the project was introduced as part of Yuvasree initiative which allows the family members of Kudumbasree members to join an enterprise. The Yuvasree team comprises three women and two men. The technical support to the project is being provided by a private firm.

“The vehicle, on which the steam wash system was installed, will provide on-call car wash service. A private company will provide technical support to the entrepreneurs for one-year period. If the project turns successful, we will launch more such move spa units,” she said.

445,['6/03/2020'],High court fines education institute Rs 1L,"Aurangabad: A Latur-based educational institution was fined Rs 1 lakh by the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court for colluding with the petitioner and trying to seek orders from the court to regularise the hiring of the petitioner, who was appointed without following the prescribed norms.

Sunil Atmaram Kale had filed a writ petition in 2018 making the state government, education officer (Latur), headmaster and Jaikishan Shikshan Sanstha (Palshi in Renapur taluka of Latur district) as respondents.

“Kale had claimed that he was appointed as Shikshan Sevak after interviews conducted in the school on March 11, 2012,” said additional government pleader S J Salgare.

The petitioner had approached the court to “cancel the decision of the education officer, who had rejected the proposal submitted by the head master seeking approval for the petitioner’s appointment.’’

The education officer, in his affidavit, had stated: “The appointment of the petitioner was made without following the prescribed procedure as laid down under section 5 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977.”

While dismissing the petition on February 25, the bench, comprising justices ZA Haq and SM Gavhane, said: “We see no reason to show any indulgence in the matter. The facts on record show that the petitioner was appointed without following the prescribed procedure. Apparently, the petitioner and respondent No. 3 (sanstha) are in collusion and a bold attempt is made to seek order from this court to regularise the illegality committed by the educational institute.”

446,['6/03/2020'],Delhi government hikes compensation for roit victims,"Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: The Delhi cabinet , in a meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, increased compensations for the victims of the northeast Delhi riots. The decision was taken after it was felt that the previous amounts were insufficient to rebuild a victim’s life as in many cases, a damaged building had multiple owners and tenants on different floors.

The cabinet also approved a compensation for burglary, which was not included in the previous package. Damaged schools will also be compensated. While the schools with up to 1,000 students will get Rs 5 lakh each, those with more students will be given Rs 10 lakh.

Initially, Rs 5 lakh was earmarked for the damage of a residential unit — Rs 4 lakh for the owner and Rs 1 lakh for the tenant. However, during the disbursal of compensation, officials realised many buildings had multiple owners and several tenants. Hence, each floor is now treated as a different unit.

A compensation of Rs 4 lakh will now be given to the owner of each floor and Rs 1 lakh to the tenants of a floor for loss of household items. Similarly, in case of substantial damages, Rs 2 lakh will be divided among all owners and Rs 50,000 among the tenants for loss of household items.

The compensation for minor damages has been hiked from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 while an immediate relief of Rs 25,000 will be given for each floor in case of household-item loss. A sum of Rs 50,000 will be given to e-scooties.

On the basis of the subdivisional magistrates’ survey reports, Delhi government has decided that Rs 1 lakh each would be given in cases of complete theft or burglary of residential units and Rs 50,000 for partial looting and theft. Looting/theft has also been included in the category of damages to uninsured commercial properties. In all such cases, a copy of the FIR has to be submitted.

Delhi government has so far disbursed Rs 88.5 lakh in relief to around 280 victims. According to a government report, 248 forms have been submitted for household damage, and 206 of them have been settled. Compensation has also been disbursed against all 29 forms received so far from the kin of the dead. All 45 people claiming compensation for severe injuries have also got relief. The verification process is on for 21 people claiming compensation for minor injuries.

On Thursday, labour minister Gopal Rai visited his riot-affected constituency of Babarpur. Delhi government will install gates to secure the area, he announced.

Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, too, visited several riot-affected places and advised everyone to refrain from spreading rumours.

Most foreigners have also either postponed or cancelled their India trips.Aloke Bajpai, CEO and co-founder of Ixigo, reported a 30-35% drop in airfares across international routes. “The drop is mainly due to travel advisories being issued by various countries. While there is a slowdown in the impact on the travel to top countries, there is still a high demand for other areas,” said Bajpai.“At the international front, people are now booking their vacations for places like Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan. For domestic travel, we have seen an increase in search queries for Andaman & Nicobar, Goa, Pune and Guwahati. But we expect the situation to improve closer to the summer travel season,” he added.The company has issued a full-refund policy for all flight bookings to China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Spain, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. “The policy is applicable on both one-way and return bookings for travel dates up to March 31,” said Bajpai.Gaurav Chawla, director at Swan Tours in Delhi, said many people coming to India had cancelled their trips for the next two-three months. “People who gave us advance money have postponed indefinitely, but most have cancelled their trips to India altogether.”For Indians, domestic destinations have become more lucrative now, Chawla pointed out. “The Holi weekend in Goa is completely sold out and a Delhi-Goa trip is as cheap as a Delhi-Phuket trip. Other destinations like Kerala, Himachal and Uttarakhand are also doing well and hotels have become cheaper,” he said.Sourabh Tiwari, owner of Sushant Travels in Delhi, said 60-70% of the bookings from abroad had been postponed indefinitely, while around 20-25% had been cancelled. “We had a few Chinese travellers who booked four-five months ago, they had to obviously cancel after the outbreak. Domestically, the situation is still fine and locations like Shimla, Manali, Sikkim and Darjeeling are doing well,” said Tiwari.Sarvjeet, of Ghum India Ghum, too, said international trips had been affected for the last two months, while domestic travels were slowly getting impacted after the report of positive cases in India this week. “A foreign group was planning to come especially for Holi; however with recent advisories, they decided not to come to India. Lots of people coming from abroad have already cancelled, while others have postponed.” Domestically, too, people are taking precautions and not travelling as much as normal, Sarvjeet added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74504882,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112786,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/foreign-travel-plans-trip-on-covid-19-fears/articleshow/74501859.cms

KOLKATA: Swarms of mosquitoes have invaded Salt Lake , making life miserable for residents and bringing back memories of dengue that has been wreaking havoc in the township over the past few years. At least 20 people have died and several thousands have been affected from dengue in the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area over the last three years.

The problem has become acute in localities like AE, AB, BD, AC, AL, BL blocks situated off Kestopur canal in Sector I and II and blocks HB, IC and IB situated off Eastern Drainage channel in Sector III.

“The canal water has become stagnant in most places, thereby facilitating breeding of mosquitoes. The civic authorities must do something about it,” said a resident of AC Block.

“The spurt in the number of mosquitoes has become a cause for concern. I always keep worrying about my two kids. We have keep doors and windows shut for most of the time to keep mosquitoes away,” said Mousumi Roy Chowdhury , a resident of AE Block. Her elder son had suffered from dengue a few years back.

A section of residents claimed visits by civic teams for spraying larvicide have lately become irregular. “The civic teams should visit the localities more frequently,” said a resident of AH Block.

Officials of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation conceded that there has been a spurt in the number of mosquitoes lately. “Water on Kestopur canal has become stagnant due to some work at the Chitpore lock gate. We have requested the irrigation department to look into it,” said a civic official. Also, the ongoing work to set up a foot overbridge at Chingrighata crossing just adjacent the Eastern Drainage channel has hampered flow of water on the other end.

“We are taking all possible steps, like cleaning up canal sides and spraying larvicide, to prevent the menace. Our dengue control measures continue round the year,” said Bidhannanar MMiC (health) Pranay Kumar Roy. Civic authorities, however, said that there was nothing to panic about since these are not aedes aegypti mosquitoes that spreads dengue.

NEW DELHI: With no incident of violence having been reported from north-east Delhi for sometime now, the police seem to have managed to restore peace even as relief and rehabilitation work is being carried out by various agencies. Now, the enormity of the task at hand has begun to dawn on them. They have to investigate over 650 FIRs and every case requires extensive investigations.

According to a source in the security establishment, the police are treading with extreme caution as the probe progresses in 127 cases reported by Hindus, 217 by Muslims and 92 by the police themselves till Wednesday. More FIRs were filed on Thursday, bringing the total to 654.

Going by Wednesday’s figure, 38 FIRs are related to deaths in the violence and 47 are under the Arms Act for use of illegal firearms. The police have not registered murder cases in all FIRs and are invoking section 302 only after the autopsy and prima facie probe confirms homicide during the riots. The 38 murder FIRs have been distributed equally between the two sections of the SIT for investigation.

A large number of FIRs are related to destruction of private property. Scores of houses and hundreds of vehicles besides places of worship have been damaged, a source said.

Till Thursday evening, the number of people arrested or detained had reached 1820. Only 26 people have been arrested on murder charges till now. Police commmissioner S N Shrivastava has apparently conveyed to his men that not a single innocent man should go behind bars and the real culprits should be identified and arrested. Delhi Police has held 226 peace meetings till now.

Meanwhile, Shrivastava held a meeting with the SIT on Thursday evening to take stock of the developments. Many a time, riot accused escape punishment for lack of evidence. This is why the SIT is focusing on getting concrete evidence against each accused. Shrivastava had earlier visited injured ACP Anuj Kumar at his residence on Thursday morning and enquired about his well being.

452,['6/03/2020'],‘6k Indians have ultra high net worth of over $30m’,"Mumbai: India has 5,986 ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWI), each with over US$ 30 million (around Rs 215 crore), and it is globally ranked 12th on the list of countries with most such people.

The United States dominates the ranking with over 2.4 lakh UHNWIs, followed by China with 61,587 and Germany 23,078, according to the Knight Frank Wealth Report 2020 released on Thursday. Globally, over 31,000 additional UHNWIs were created in 2019, bringing the total to more than 513,200.

“The number of UHNWIs in India is predicted to grow by a whopping 73% in the next five years, almost doubling the count to 10,354 from 5,986 in 2019,” said the report.

By 2024, Asia will be the world’s second largest wealth hub outperforming Europe, with a five-year growth forecast of 44%. Despite such a steep rise, it will reach only half the size of North America’s UHNWI population, which is predicted to rise 22% over the same period.

Despite wealth growth and record low interest rates in most advanced economies, the global economic slowdown weighed on prime property prices across the globe. For instance, Mumbai saw a tepid growth of 0.5% last year, Delhi 4.7% and Bengaluru 2.1%. Frankfurt and Lisbon topped the list with an annual price change of 10.3% and 9.6%, respectively.

When it comes to luxury properties, Monaco remains the world’s most expensive city where US$1 million (Rs 7.2 crore) can buy you a mere 16.4 square metre or 176 square feet of space. Comparatively in Mumbai, you can buy 102.2 sq m or 1,098 sq ft (approximate size of a decent two-bedroom flat in the city).

Shishir Baijal, chairman & MD, Knight Frank India, said, “While prime property prices have stayed stable in the past five years, the relative stability of the Indian rupee still allows investors and end-users to buy more prime real estate in India today than in 2015. At -1% for 2020, prime property price growth in Mumbai is expected to face challenges, as the current economic slowdown will continue to influence market liquidity.” Equity investments remained the most attractive asset class for Indian UHNWIs with 83% of them in India plan to increase or maintain their allocations in equities, followed by bonds (77%) and property (51%).

So, which are the best cities for UHNWIs to live, invest and do business in? According to the Knight Frank City Wealth Index, New York captured the top spot from London based on wealth, investment and lifestyle. With London in the second spot, Paris, Hong Kong and Los Angeles round out the top five cities.

The Luxury Investment Index shows ‘collectable handbags’ has topped the index, rising in value by 13% over 12 months to Q4 2019, knocking rare whisky off its number one spot. “The index results show that on an annual basis, handbags outperformed both whisky and art, which both recorded growth of 5%. Classic cars, another strong performer in recent years, slipped 7%,” it said.

The HC bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar observed: “Crowd of 2,000-3,000 persons had gathered in the Cidco area protesting against the incident which had taken place at Koregaon Bhima in Pune district on January 1, 2018. Police officers requested the mob to disperse, then warning was also given but the persons in the mob were not in a mood to listen. They virtually attacked the police officers, caused damage to vehicles including police vehicles, and set fire to the vehicles. According to police as they had attacked police there was an intention of finishing even the police officers.”

On a complaint by inspector Kailash Prajapati, police had booked the applicant, Ravi Gaikwad, as well as scores of others under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt), 427 (mischief causing damage) 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 140 (wearing garb) of IPC as well as under provisions of Bombay Police Act Public Property Damage Act.

However, the bench observed, “In this case the court had directed the additional public prosecutor (APP) to show statement of any person including the police constable showing that he had seen the present applicant (Gaikwad) in that mob. The APP could not show any such statement.”

The bench further noted, “It appears that some inquiry was made with the applicant himself and during inquiry made by police he admitted that he was present in the mob. This record, that is statement of the accused cannot be used against him.”

While allowing the criminal application, the bench on February 24 observed, “In view of the circumstances, this court holds that nothing can be achieved by asking the applicant to face the trail.”

The applicant was represented by P B Waghmare.

KOLKATA: A conservationist-turned-entrepreneur has developed an artificial intelligence system in collaboration with Hidco to closely monitor beehives so that diseases do not wipe out bee colonies. Arijit Das, the man behind the mission, has chosen Eco Park to start with his experiment of forming a bee corridor.

“Around 90% of food we consume will not be there if bees disappear. They play a huge role in pollination of flowers. Thus, conservation of bees is of prime importance since climate change is causing extinction of many species,” said Das, who has set up Schoppen Solutions, a start-up, to form a viable business model.

According to Das, only steady production of honey can sustain bees and their hives. The biggest threat to their existence is infection. Diseases wipe out colonies and honey production hits rock bottom. “The colour of bees is their health indicator. I monitor the change in colour and deformity in their body almost round the clock. My system generates alert the moment any anomaly is detected. The interventions are taken note of immediately,” said Das.

The bee corridor strives to successfully weave environment and technology together. At Eco Park, wooden boxes have been kept in a row stretching to a distance of 100 metres. There are 17 boxes as of now, which will later be increased once the colony expands and honey extraction increases. Since Rajarhat has been developed as a green city with urban edifices and pre-planned green landscapes, having such corridors would also bring in a rural flavour within the urban setting.

The project in unique from the perspective of bee cultivation at urban ecosystem with the aim of livelihood development for people around the place. From an environmental point of view, such efforts will restore balance of the bee population that is under threat, said Arnab Basu, IT committee chairman of the Bengal Chamber , which has incubated the venture along with Webel.

Hidco chairman and additional chief secretary Debashis Sen said it was possible to have a honey production centre in the urban backdrop. “Such a centre with minimum effort and with a dose of technology could generate revenues and improve income of thousands. Honey and nectar productions in villages and city peripheries — around Joka in south and Salt Lake and Rajarhat up north — could raise the income levels of villagers at least 10%. In the city, one can cultivate bees in balconies if one stays close to some garden,” he said.

The university is also filling the posts of deans for Arts and Social Sciences, Science and Technology, Commerce and Management and Inter-disciplinary sciences for which 13, 19, five and seven applications have been received, respectively. The interviews for these posts will held on March 7.

“The interviews for the post of director of Osmanabad sub-centre will be held on March 13,” Shinde said.

Yeole after taking charge in July last year had said that filling the vacant posts was one of his priorities.

Hailed as the chief administrative officer of university, the registrar has been vested with disciplinary authority of the varsity employees, among other important administrative roles.

The controller of examinations is considered as principal officer-in-charge of conduct of examinations and tests of the university and declaration of results.

Student activist Tukaram Saraf said it is ironical that a state university such like Bamu has its key statutory posts vacant for such a long time.

“The administration made makeshifts arrangements for these posts for over several years and this affected the university’s functioning.

In the past, it was observed that the administration was succumbing to pressure from different groups while deciding in matters of these appointments. It should not be the case during upcoming interviews,” he said.

Families across the capital are cutting down on celebrations and cancelling Holi Milan events and pool parties in particular.“I go to Holi parties every year, but am going to give it a miss this time. Just for a day of celebration, I am not going to invite trouble for me and my family,” said a 21-year-old man.Speaking to TOI, he and several others said that they have scrapped their grand Holi plans this year.Karol Bagh resident, Kavita Raj, organises Holi party at her house every year. But this time, she has booked her tickets to Goa so that she can get away from the city and go to a place, which is not frequented by tourists.“Two of my kids are pretty fond of playing Holi and it would have been tough to explain the situation to them. Travelling to Goa was the only option left,” she said.For Raman, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, his newborn girl is the reason he will stay away from the celebrations this year. “I have heard that children are very prone to catching the flu. God forbid if I catch the virus and it spreads to her. I can’t even partially expose her to the horror,” she said. “We will just apply tilak to each other at home.”A few others fret that buying Chinese items may attract virus. Amid the growing fear of coronavirus, Delhiites have already shunned the Chinese products. Besides toys and crackers, colours and water guns from China are hugely popular in Indian markets. “We want to celebrate the festival at home and are avoiding bigger gatherings, but will be using the old pichkaaris. The new ones are made in China from where the virus is coming from,” said Kanha Pratab, a resident of Gol Market.Ravi Prasad, an event organiser, said: “We are informing customers that there will be no rain dance and pool parties.

KOLKATA: Cough-and-cold patients, along with those with fever and symptoms of influenza, are being segregated from the rest at entry points of several private hospitals in Kolkata.

While some have designated an area near their emergency departments, others have deployed staff members to screen them and guide them to either the emergency or the outpatient department, making sure that they don’t come in contact with other patients. A hospital off EM Bypass has put up a shamiana at the entrance, where all cough-and-cold patients are being screened before they are allowed inside. The step was taken following a state government advisory, urging private hospitals to join the fight against Covid-19.

R N Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has designated an enclosure adjacent to its emergency ward for fever and cough patients. The area is cut off from the rest of the hospital and doesn’t share the AC facility either. “Out staff at the counters are guiding patients with viral symptoms to this zone. Posters have been put up, telling patients to visit this zone first in case they have fever or cough. They are not allowed near other patients,” said RIICS zonal director R Venkatesh, adding that though none with suspected nCoV symptoms has been identified, the move has helped dispel fear among patients.

At AMRI Hospitals, isolation rooms have been set up at all its three units at Mukundapur, Dhakuria and Salt Lake, where even patients visiting doctors at the OPD with symptoms of flu are being guided to wait. At the waiting area, they are being given masks and hand sanitizers to ensure they don’t spread the infection. Guards at all the entrances have been spraying clinically approved hand sanitizers on every visitor’s hands. Besides putting up posters, the hospital is running digital campaigns on how to prevent the spread of the virus. “We have formulated an SOP for both patients and our medical teams . Special infection-control teams have been formed that are making rounds of the units as a precaution,” said Rupak Barua, Group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. “Although no case has yet been detected at any of our units, preventive measures are being taken to ensure the virus does not spread and that patients feel safe. We are also urging the public not to spread panic and to follow the preventive measures.”

Medica Superspecialty Hospital has also set up a shamiana at the entrance, where a doctor and a nurse are screening patients with viral symptoms. Infra-red thermometers are being used to examine body temperature. “We are using contact-less infra-red thermometers to rule out chances of transmission. Following the screening protocol, we are classifying patients into low-risk, moderate-risk and high-risk groups. While low-risk patients are being taken inside the hospital for treatment, moderate- and high-risk cases will be reported to the state health department and sent to Beliaghata ID Hospital. So far, no such case has been detected,” said Medica intensivist Aviral Roy.

460,['6/03/2020'],Nine-day High court breather for JU Polish student,"File photo of Calcutta high court

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Thursday directed the Centre not to deport Polish student Kamil Siedcynski till March 18, when it will decide whether his petition against the ‘Leave India’ notice issued by the Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) is sustainable. Siedcynski, a PG student of Jadavpur University , was served the deportation notice dated February 14 after he allegedly participated in some anti-CAA events in Kolkata in December.

On a plea by advocate Phiroze Edulji, who appeared for the Union of India against Siedcynski’s petition, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya made it clear that the merit of the case is yet to be decided. This means that it is still unclear whether the petition is maintainable. As per the FRRO notice, Siedcynski was to leave India by February 9.

While Siedcynski’s counsel Jayanta Mitra had challenged the legality of the FRRO notice, Edulji submitted on Thursday that there was reasonable cause behind the deportation order. According to him, the notice was based on a field report prepared in January.

“The student has claimed in his petition that he participated in two events but we have information that he had also attended a third at Park Circus. He also participated in some other programmes organised against the central government. A foreigner with a student visa can’t challenge any Act of Parliament as he doesn’t come under Article 19 of the Constitution that grants freedom of speech to citizens. Such a person can’t participate in any agitation against a government policy. Hence, the petition is not maintainable,” Edulji submitted.

He pointed out that other students, including one from Bangladesh studying in Visva-Bharati University , have been issued similar notices. Edulji also challenged the claim by Siedcynski that the FRRO had not heard his side of the story. The lawyer submitted that he was heard for four hours and the Centre has the right to deport a foreigner.

Mitra, while contending Edulji’s submissions, said that Siedcynski may not come under Article 19 of the Constitution but can seek protection under Articles 14, 20 and 21. He also challenged the field report referred to by the Union of India.

The parents said that they were worried as their son Mohammed Fasiuddin, a pizza delivery boy, had not called them since October 21, 2019. They contacted the Indian Embassy in Poland, which after enquiring informed them on December 2, 2019, that their son is in jail for an alleged fraud case.

Mohammed Najahuddin from Monappagutta in Mahbubnagar, who is a lorry driver, said his son had called on January 20, 2020, and said that he was not involved in any financial fraud.

According to Fasiuddin’s family members, he went to Poland on a tourist visa on May 23, 2017, after an agent promised that he would be provided a job and would get a work permit. While some others, who also went with him, reportedly got jobs but Fasiuddin did not get what he was promised.

On January 22, Fasiuddin’s family received a message from the Indian Embassy in Poland that a consular officer had visited Fasiuddin in jail. “The matter is sub-judice now and we await for the investigation to be completed. The mission will extend all necessary assistance under existing rules,” the embassy said.

Fasiuddin’s parents, however, are requesting that legal assistance should be provided to their son. The embassy staff informed the family that Fasiuddin was in jail for an alleged money laundering case.

463,['6/03/2020'],Peeved Speaker unlikely to return to Lok Sabha anytime soon,"Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Having expressed unhappiness over continued ruckus in Lok Sabha by not being present in the House for two consecutive days, Speaker Om Birla is likely to continue his ‘boycott’ of proceedings until he gets an assurance from all parties on compliance with norms.

Several party delegations including from Congress have called on Birla urging him to preside over the House, but he is likely to stick to his stand of staying away for some more time. He is understood to be particularly peeved with some parties for not adhering to discussions held in his chamber and the “rude” remarks of an opposition MP during a meeting on Tuesday.

Sources close to the Speaker said he was hurt at the way opposition MPs, mainly from Congress, had behaved with him and had repeatedly demeaned the authority of the chair — with the leadership watching on — even as he tried to run the House by taking all parties into confidence.

A senior Lok Sabha secretariat functionary said he had been working since the time of Somnath Chatterjee (2004 to 2009) as Speaker and had not seen the presiding officer not taking part in proceedings. A senior opposition member said it was necessary to keep in mind that the Speaker was bound to facilitate government business even as he was expected to respond to other parties.

“We have gone through records and didn’t come across any example when the Speaker stayed away from the proceedings despite being present in Parliament,” the official said. Sources said another reason that saddened the Speaker was the way the agitating MPs had behaved with secretariat staff.

“Furniture is being damaged, papers are torn and thrown over the secretariat staff including the Lok Sabha secretary, which is unprecedented,” the official said, confirming that the Speaker would take his time to decide when to resume presiding over House proceedings.

Another official said the Speaker agreed that there should be a debate on Delhi riots for two days after Holi, but the reaction of opposition members was unprecedented as they launched personal attacks on Birla.

“One member shouted at the Speaker and approached towards him violently, the Speaker was further hurt to see the tapes of House proceedings,” the official said.

“Moreover, the Speaker held all-party meetings to reach a consensus and there was an understanding that no member will carry placards and cross sides. He made the announcement in the House only after conveying the same in the all-party meeting, still there was no change and floor leaders were inciting rather than trying to calm down them,” the official said.

Nagpur: ‘ Pregathon ’, a unique marathon curated especially for pregnant women, has been organized for the first time in Central India by JCI Nagpur Medico to mark International Women’s’ Day on Sunday.

The event will be held at Shivaji Nagar garden between 6am and 9am. The team of JCI Nagpur Medico said the event is open to all women and the registration is free.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, president Dr Swati Sarda said, “The event is not just for pregnant women. We will welcome other women to come and support each other. Basically, we want to promote light exercise among expecting mothers.”

She said that 150 minutes of exercise in a week is recommended for pregnant women. However, Sarda urged women to consult gynaecologists before participating in ‘Pregathon’.

“Every pregnancy is different. It is important you consult doctor before undertaking exercise.” Sarda also spoke about a 1987 study by Kauffman, where after studying 100 pregnant women, it was found that chances of a caesarean were high in women who did not exercise as compared to those who did light workout.

Project director Dr Swadha Kotpalliwar Jannawaar said, “We want to promote healthy motherhood. Light exercise during pregnancy not only reduces chances of C-section but also improves the baby’s health.”

Physiotherapists, doctors and medical staff will be available during the event. After the ‘Pregathon’, there will be an awareness session on breast and cervix cancer by Dr Parul Saoji and Dr Varsha Sarda. Dr Pradeep Patil will take a session on stress management through hypnosis.

Present at the press conference were president Sarda, immediate past president Dr Smita Pakhmode, vice-president Dr Pankaj Agrawal, secretary Dr Deepika Chandhokar, Dr Dinesh Sarda and Dr Sachin Deokar. Contact 9765999618 for details.

A senior police officer said A Ashokan, 35, of Raja Rajan Street in Tiruvannamalai, running a cloakroom for devotees visiting the temple at the entrance of the Raja Gopuram (tower) was threatened by the two accused, demanding bribe of Rs 25,000 to avoid his name from being included in a theft reported at his cloakroom.

The incident took place on February 25 when a devotee from Villupuram district came to collect his luggage from Ashokan after finishing worship and found that his laptop was missing. Based on a complaint lodged by the devotee, the Tiruvannamalai crime beat police, including SI Ilanchezian and SSI Anbalagan, came to the spot. While examining the CCTV camera footage they found an unidentified man had closely followed the devotee and had robbed his laptop bag as no one was present in the cloakroom.

Speaking to TOI, Devanathan DSP of DVAC, said, “The two police officers, instead of finding the accused, had threatened the cloakroom owner to hand over a bribe of Rs 25,000 to avoid his name being included in the case.”

Though Ashokan gave Rs 15,000 the next day, the two police officers persistently threatened him demanding the remaining Rs 10,000. As Ashokan explained that he cannot afford Rs 10,000, they asked him to give at least Rs 5,000 by Thursday. Following advise by his friend, Ashokan on Wednesday lodged a complaint with the Tiruvannamalai DVAC and based on his complaint the two police officers were caught red-handed while accepting the bribe. Further investigations are on.

But shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for Covid-19 patients, due to limited access to supplies such as gloves, medical masks , respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns, and aprons,” the WHO has said.It has urged the industry and the governments to act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.TOI had highlighted in a recent report how most medicine stores in Delhi-NCR are running short of masks. In some stores, the personal protective equipment is being sold at five to six times the original cost.The resident doctors of Safdarjung hospital, where many Covid-19 patients are being admitted, said they had to protest to get the N95 masks. “Till Tuesday, there were few N95 masks available for doctors.

468,['6/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare may make Holi off colour,"Nagpur: With less than a week to go for the festival of colours, the city’s markets and shops are flooded with Holi supplies, but citizens are in a dilemma whether to play Holi. While some want to celebrate it in an eco-friendly manner, others believe the Holi festivities with the usual public gatherings should be avoided due to the coronavirus fears.The coronavirus threat is a real fear for most citizens, and they are sceptical about going to public places and indulging the usual wet Holi. “My family and friends have decided to play dry Holi, using natural colours, since coming in contact with water increases the threat of contamination and infection through eyes, nose and mouth. There is no restriction on playing, but yes the excitement has dimmed because of coronavirus,” said Nirmal Kaur, a student.People are also avoiding buying Holi supplies and colours that are for sale with the ‘Made in China’ tag, “This festival, and even otherwise, I am going to avoid buying everything that is made in China, and so should others. We won’t be celebrating Holi in crowded places or parties, but may be just have a small celebration with family members,” said Amruta Bansod, a teacher.For Sajal Orke, who works in health care, says the festival of colours has an emotional significance and he doesn’t want to miss the fun because of the virus fears. “We must not hesitate to celebrate Holi amid all the fear, as it’s one of the most cherished festivals. Yet, taking a few precautions will harm no one. I will avoid going to Holi parties, as one never knows who is suffering from the flu, and it’s contagious. But yes, people won’t celebrate Holi with as much enthusiasm because the coronavirus situation is getting alarming,” he said.Nikhil Somkule, a lecturer, believes that parents are more worried about their children’s health and will restrict them from playing Holi. “Children add more fun and zeal to any festival, but I suppose this year parents will restrict them from going out in groups to play. One must play with dry colours. Playing Holi a day before in school and colleges with water must be avoided,” he said.Adding to this, Akshata Nakshine, a law student, wants people to step out of the house only to apply a little gulal or dry colours, rather than playing in groups. “I have ordered masks beforehand, and my family will wear those to celebrate. It will surely dim the excitement of the festival, as fear will overshadow the fun,” she said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74501883,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-96025,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coronavirus-scare-may-make-holi-off-colour/articleshow/74501884.cms

NEW DELHI: To ensure there is no repeat of violence during the Friday prayers and Holi next week, the legislators of riot-affected northeast Delhi held a peace meeting with religious heads and prominent people of the region on Thursday.

The meeting was organised by the Delhi legislative assembly’s peace and harmony committee at the auditorium of Ambedkar College near Gokalpuri.

Speaking at the meeting, Seelampur MLA Abdul Rehman urged Delhi Police to deploy its personnel across the region to ensure there is no untoward incident during the festival.

“We have to observe Holi with peace, love and brotherhood. I request Delhi Police to deploy at least four constables at each location where Holika Dahan takes place,” Rehman said, adding that both the Hindus and the Muslims should set an example.

The meeting was attended by the committee chairman Saurabh Bharadwaj, members Ajay Mahawar of BJP and Dilip Pandey, Kuldeep Kumar, BS Joon, Raghav Chadha and Rehman of AAP. Karawal Nagar MLA Mohan Singh Bisht, Mustafabad MLA Haji Yunus and Gokalpuri legislator Surender Kumar were present.

Special commissioner of police, Satish Golcha, and Northeast and Shahdara district magistrates, Shashi Kaushal and Sanjeev Kumar, also took part in the meeting.

Those who addressed the participants insisted that the miscreants should be dealt with sternly.

“Please do not associate them with any community. They are just anti-social elements,” social activist Faheem Beg said.

Bharadwaj said communal tension sometimes intensifies during the festivals and it is important that all prominent people from both the communities meet the locals and spread the message of harmony.

Bisht said it was the responsibility of the elected representatives to convince people that riots do not help any community.

Yunus said there were several people who left their houses fearing violence, and the government, along with social activists, NGOs, prominent people and police, shall try to convince them to come back.

Golcha said extra force was deployed to ensure peace in the riot-affected areas. “Local SHOs have been directed to organise peace meetings. Our officials are meeting people and ensuring their safety. We have also directed the local police to register FIRs on all complaints they receive. We will ensure that every needy person gets the documents from us to file compensation claims,” the special commissioner of police said.

“The Delhi assembly committee has launched a WhatsApp number and an email address which people should use to report online rumours and hate messages,” Mahawar added.

KOLKATA: Health officials at Kolkata airport have begun universal screening at the international wing, bringing more than 4,000 flyers a day under the ambit of thermal check to detect fever. On Thursday afternoon, the National Disaster Relief Force held a training and orientation programme for all ground-handling staff on Covid-19 virus and ways to prevent its spread at the airport.

So far, more than 45,000 passengers have been screened at the airport since January 17. The check, which initially began on flyers from China and Hong Kong, was extended to those arriving from other South-East Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia from February 2. Last week, the list was extended to Nepal and Singapore. But with the virus now spreading to 78 countries, the ministry of health and family welfare has asked airports to make thermal screening mandatory for all flyers from abroad. “Passengers arriving in Gulf carriers, flights from South-East Asia as well as South Asian countries Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka are being screened. Earlier, only flyers with recent travel history to China, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan had to undergo mandatory thermal screening. Later, Macau, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan were added to the list,” said a senior airport official.

Flyers of all international flights entering India from any airport are to submit a self-declaration forms with personal details, like numbers and addresses in India and travel history to health and immigration officials at the airport.

On Thursday, the central advisory removed Singapore from the travel restriction advisory. But flyers arriving from there will continue to be screened. Though Singapore Airlines officials are relieved that the city nation has been taken off the restricted-travel list, they aren’t sure when traffic loads would normalise

While Singapore Airlines has continued with its flight schedule despite the traffic decline, other airlines have reduced frequencies to Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, while those to Kunming, Guangzhou and Hong Kong have been suspended. The largest number of daily connections from Kolkata are to Bangladesh, followed by Thailand and Malaysia. Dubai is next with Bhutan, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Kathmandu, Yangon and Colombo to follow.

With the nCoV scare now real, following detection of multiple positive cases in India, airport authorities established fresh protocols for disinfecting surfaces, including counters, chairs and door handles. Also, hand sanitizes have been provided at immigration counters and health desks. Housekeeping staff in charge of washrooms have been asked to clean them with disinfectants more regularly.

The department has now pegged its revenue estimates at Rs206.19 crore.

NMC’s transport manager and deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite presented the revised transport department budget for 2019-20 and projection for 2020-21 to transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar on Thursday.

He reduced the current year’s budget of department by Rs71.65 crore. This year, NMC had to provide viability gap funding of Rs132.9 crore, the department has projected an income of Rs273.20.84 crore including opening balance of Rs26.97 lakh to run Aapli Bus service.

In the first 8 months of the current fiscal, NMC managed to generate only Rs43.44 crore revenue from sale of tickets. By end of March 31, it is expecting to mop up Rs29.48 crore more totalling Rs73.29 crore. The transport manager also announced the civic body had opened ‘city transport fund,’ ‘revenue reserve fund’ and ‘transport improvement fund’ to improve the bus service.

At present, NMC operates 384 buses in the city including 184 standard diesel buses, 150 midi buses, 45 mini and five Tejaswani buses. Around 1.71 lakh people use them daily in 5,164 trips.

In his budget, Mohite mentioned NMC’s plan of procuring more electric buses under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicle (Fame-II). Though sanctioned 100, NMC will procure 40 of these buses. Municipal commissioner has already sought permission from Central government for 40 e-buses. Mohite proposed to develop a special bus depot for them on 10.80 acres in Wathoda.

He also announced conversion of NMC’s scrapped buses into e-toilets. Mayor Sandip Joshi too has directed to convert two buses into toilets on pilot basis.

Borkar will modify the proposed budget and will submit it to Standing Committee for final approval.

479,['6/03/2020'],"Delhi: Thieves target three ATMs in a night, flee with Rs 24 lakh","Representative image

NEW DELHI: Thieves struck at three different ATMs in southeast Delhi on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. While the locals in Jamia Nagar spotted them and thwarted their bid, the thieves managed to uproot and take away ATMs in Jaitpur and Pul Prahladpur.

Just two days ago, thieves had unsuccessfully tried to steal an ATM in Lajpat Nagar. None of the ATMs targeted had a guard deployed there, and the same modus operandi— tying the ATM to a hook and driving the vehicle ahead with a jerk to uproot it— was used in all the cases.

It is suspected that the same gang of thieves is on the prowl and a manhunt has been initiated to nab them.

The incident at Jamia Nagar area was reported around 2.40am from Okhla Vihar colony when the locals dialled 100. The cops reached the spot and found the machine broken and kept outside the booth. A probe revealed that a passerby named Rizwan had raised an alarm after noticing four persons trying to load the broken ATM in a vehicle, forcing the accused to flee.

“The accused also damaged the CCTV of an adjacent ATM kiosk and sprayed a black substance on the targeted ATM kiosk to hide their identity,” said a police officer.

At Jaitpur, police received information around 5am about the theft. An ATM installed at F- Block, Harsh Vihar was broken and cash around Rs 7.91 lakh stolen. The cops are checking the CCTV footage from the kiosk to identify the thieves.

Around 8am, police were informed about another ATM theft in Pul Prahladpur area. The thieves were here in a pickup van, the CCTV footage has revealed. About Rs 17 lakh was stolen here.

DCP (south-east) RP Meena said that FIRs have been registered and teams formed to crack the cases.

NEW DELHI: Lawyers thronged every corner of Delhi high court on Thursday to bid adieu to Justice S Muralidhar , who also cleared the air on his controversial, near-midnight transfer from the capital to Punjab and Haryana high court, saying he had conveyed his “no objection” to the Chief Justice of India.

In his farewell speech, the judge narrated the sequence of events before his transfer order of February 26, hours after he passed stinging comments against Delhi Police’s failure to book BJP leaders Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Verma and Anurag Thakur for alleged hate speeches.

“In my case, the collegium’s decision was communicated to me by the CJI on February 17 by a letter that sought my response. I acknowledged receipt of the letter. I was then asked to clarify what I meant. As I saw it, if I was to be transferred from Delhi high court any way, I was fine with moving to the Punjab and Haryana high court. I therefore clarified to the CJI that I did not object to the proposal,” Justice Muralidhar revealed, clearing the confusion over what transpired.

Thursday saw two events in the court in connection with the judge’s farewell. The first was organised by the bar association where justice Muralidhar and other judges witnessed a packed audience. Bar leaders praised the judge with one declaring him “kohinoor” of Delhi high court.

Post lunch, the court’s official Full Court farewell reference began where apart from Chief Justice D N Patel, senior government lawyers also wished the transferred judge best wishes on his future assignment. In attendance were his mother, wife Usha Ramanathan, former Delhi high court chief justice A P Shah, senior advocate Shanti Bhushan and former Delhi University VC Upendra Baxi.

In his speech, the judge also touched upon what happened on February 26, hours before his transfer, calling it “perhaps the longest working day of my life as a judge of the Delhi high court.”

He said it all started when at 12.30am he conducted a special hearing at his residence with Justice A J Bhambhani, under the orders of Justice G S Sistani (the seniormost judge, who incidentally retires on March 6), to deal with a PIL filed by one Rahul Roy seeking safe passage of ambulances carrying the injured riot victims.

“When I received a call at my residence from the lawyer for the petitioner, I first called Justice Sistani to ask what should be done, knowing that the Chief Justice was on leave. Justice Sistani explained that he too was officially on leave the whole of February 26 and that I should take up the matter. This fact is stated in the order passed by the bench after the hearing. Later that day, upon urgent mentioning, as the de facto CJ’s bench, Justice Talwant Singh and I took up another fresh PIL on the CJ’s board seeking registration of FIRs for hate speeches. After the orders passed on that day, the above two PILs remained on the CJ’s board,” the judge disclosed.

Justice Muralidhar ended the speech saying the notification issued on February 26 did two things. “First, it transferred me to Punjab and Haryana high court. Second, it appointed me to a position from where I can never be transferred, or removed and in which I shall always be proud to remain. A ‘former judge’ of arguably the best high court in the country — the high court of Delhi,” he said, following a standing ovation by all the judges and the gathering.

Despite repeated representations, they say Tamil Nadu Electricity Board officials have been unmoved.

Around 25 poles erected several decades ago in Ayilapettai Kudi street, Colony Street, South and North Pulivalam and Suburayanpatti which come under Kodiyalam panchayat are almost worn out. This apart, high-tension power cables remain suspended along the road and across paddy fields, said the district secretary of the CPI-affiliated Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, Ayilai Sivasuriyan.

“These poles look like skeletons as almost the entire cement layer on them has come off and they may fall any moment. Several live wires passing across the fields and roads lie suspended a few feet from our head. Sometimes we find them lying on the road after snapping”, he said. Ayilapettai, Suburayanpatti and Pulivalam villages come under Somarasampetti subdivision while Kodiyalam alone falls under Thiruparaithurai substation. They have been representing about the danger to the authorities since January but to no avail.

K Murugan, a resident, said many a time their cattle have escaped from snapped live wires on the roadside only because of alert shepherds. He recalled the tragedy in December when three members of a family, including a woman, who were working on their paddy field at Chathirappatti on the outskirts of Trichy were electrocuted after a low-lying live wire fell on them. They appealed to the officials to replace all worn-out poles and realign the hanging high-tension cables before another untoward incident happened.

When contacted, TNEB superintending engineer S Krishnamoorthi told TOI that he had instructed the concerned executive engineer to replace all damaged electric poles and realign all suspending live cables soon on receiving the complaint.

MOHALI: In the absence of non-intrusive thermal imaging technology to screen passengers at Chandigarh International Airport, the ill-equipped health department is using primitive methods for coronavirus scan. They are using thermometers instead of advanced thermal scanners at the airport.

So far, 4,943 passengers have been screened in the past few days at the airport and 70,106 at the airports/border checkposts across the state. The health department is daily reporting to the central surveillance unit, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Delhi.

Officiating deputy commissioner Aashika Jain said, “The civil surgeon has been instructed to immediately buy a thermal scanner and install it at the airport. The passengers arriving from two international flights must undergo checks with scanners using non-intrusive thermal imaging technology. No chances can be taken.”

“The Mohali administration has made isolation wards at every private hospital in the district. There are two such wards in every government hospital. The administration is taking all necessary precautions and there is no need to panic as no positive case has been detected in the district. All schools in the district are also safe,” Jain added.

On the other hand, the Punjab government has sounded an alert at the Mohali as well as the Amritsar airports, with advisories prominently displayed for passengers. Information material is also on display at the airports, where screening of passengers has been initiated. Medical teams, along with paramedics from the health department, have also been deputed.

Announcements are being made for passengers to declare on their own if they had symptoms. The airport authorities have been directed to keep a close vigil on suspected passengers. The district health department has issued an advisory for the public as well as government and private health institutions.

Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh has asked the health institutions to keep isolation wards ready. He said there was no need to panic, but precautionary measures were needed. The civil surgeon, along with district epidemiologist Dr Harmandeep Kaur, held a special meeting with officials at the international airport in Mohali and asked them to notify the health department immediately upon receiving any suspected patient.

Through the advisory, private hospitals were asked to have isolation wards ready, keep suspected patients under constant surveillance and notify the health department immediately upon receipt of any such case.

483,['6/03/2020'],Online traffic challans: Delhi high court seeks governments’ response,"Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Thursday sought a response from the Centre and Delhi government on a plea highlighting problems by commuters since traffic cops can’t compound violations on the spot.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued notice to the Delhi government, the police commissioner and the ministry of road transport and highways on the petition that says since the 2019 September amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act, the public is facing difficulty in compounding challans issued to them for traffic violations as penalties cannot be paid on the spot and they have to approach the court or pay online through the virtual court (traffic) website.

Petitioner advocate and social activist Amit Sahni argued that this has not only overburdened courts, but prolonged the suffering of the public at large. Offenders have to revisit the circle offices to collect impounded documents even after disposal of challans in the virtual court (traffic).

During the hearing, the bench asked Delhi government to notify the officers for compounding traffic violation offences on the spot, seeing merit in Sahni’s plea. In response, the government standing counsel Ramesh Singh said it plans to empower the cops by issuing a notification soon.

Compounding offences are those for which a violator is allowed to pay a fine on the spot and does not need to visit a court. A violator can pay the fine to the designated officials after the states notify them.

The plea said with the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, the penalties for traffic violations have been raised multifold and the transport department has not yet notified the authorised officers and the compounding fee. It also raised the issue that the virtual court (traffic) portal — www.vcourts.gov.in — is not accepting payment of traffic challans above Rs 2,000 through debit cards and it has to be done through credit cards or online banking.

As per the PIL, Delhi Traffic Police and the State Transport Authority, at the time of issuing a challan , are impounding documents like driving licence, etc.

The Mohali administration, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada), and the civic body of Nayagaon village have gone to work. On Thursday, the Nayagaon authorities razed three under-construction structures at Kansal in the lake’s catchments. Executive officer Jagjit Singh said: “Before carrying out the high court orders, we beat drums for cautioning the residents.”

The Mohali administration, Nayagaon officers supervised by officiating deputy commissioner Aashika Jain, and a Gmada team monitored by vice-chairman Sarvjit Singh and chief administrator Kavita Singh sat for a marathon meeting with senior town planners to study the blueprints of Kansal and count structures that fall in the demolition zone. Later, the officers went to Punjab chief minister (CM) to brief him on the ground situation.

Gmada vice-chairman and Punjab principal secretary for housing and urban development Sarvjit Singh said “The CM has asked for detailed ground report.” For years, the Mohali administration has been blind to how building plans were approved in Kansal. Officiating DC Aashika Jain has told subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain to count the new structures and approved building plans. She said: “The Mohali Administration will comply with the high court orders. It has told the Nayagaon municipal council to generate public awareness to prevent further violation.

Sources in the district administration said revenue records show only 500 building plan approvals in the past decade, while the catchments house 2,500 structures. The administration will check how these unapproved landowners managed to get power, water, and sewerage connections. The high court’s giving the administration three months to raze all structures built around the Sukhna after September 2004 has set off a wave of panic in the area. Punjab and Haryana must pay a fine of Rs 100 crore each for being negligent.

Both were cautioned earlier and given a week to stop the polluting discharge. The municipal corporation’s engineering department has also warned New Police Line Colony and Sri Guru Goibind Singh (Khalsa) College, both in Sector 26, against discharging wastewater into the choe and given them a reformation deadline. The college has started the work.

MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said: “We don’t know since when the sewage is emptying into the storm-water line. The moment we detected it, we asked the club and the guest house to stop. When they failed, we cut their sewerage connections and told them again to cap their drains.”

A source in the MC said: “Since we can’t go in, we don’t know the reason for continuous default. Their wastewater discharge is joined to the storm line directly, which might be an internal fault.” Khalsa College has started work to stop the discharge, and New Police Line Colony will be next to lose sewerage connection if it doesn’t do the same before deadline.

Box:

The reluctance of the college and the club to stopping improper discharge of wastewater came to light when National Green Tribunal, which monitors the Sukhna and N choes constantly, found out the source of sewage inflow. Its sub-committee even inspected both water bodies to know if the cleaning efforts were effective

487,['6/03/2020'],"No expansion now, Rock Garden in catchment area","Chandigarh: Three days after the Punjab and Haryana high court directed UT, Punjab and Haryana to demolish illegal structures in Sukhna Lake catchment area and ban new constructions, the UT administration is clueless about the number of such buildings.

The administration has asked different departments to prepare a list of works in their wings that are likely to get affected after the court judgment.

With the world-famous Rock Garden also falling in the catchment area, its expansion plan now is in doldrums.

Rock Garden creator Nek Chand’s son Anuj Saini said work has already started on the expansion of Rock Garden. As per plan, rain shelter, art works, museum and an exit route will be created. While Nek Chand’s wish to construct a doll museum was fulfilled a few years ago, his other wish of an exit route is yet to be realised.

As per senior UT officials, the expansion plan and parking of the Punjab and Haryana high court, an aviary and an animal rescue centre at Nagar Van, and Rock Garden expansion plans fall in the lake’s catchment area.

The judgment clearly mentioned that “new construction is completely banned in the catchment area”.

The judgment stated, “All commercial/residential and/or other structures constructed in the catchment area of Sukhna Lake falling in the areas of Punjab, Haryana and UT as delineated in the map prepared by the Survey of India on September 21, 2004, are illegal/unauthorized.”

Declaring Sukhna Lake as a “living entity,” the court had ordered demolition of all kinds of construction in the catchment area within three months. The court had also imposed a fine of Rs 100 crore each on Punjab and Haryana for permitting construction.

A slice of history

The Rock Garden was officially inaugurated on January 24, 1976, by Nek Chand, who collected waste materials from demolition sites around the city. Rock Garden was developed in three phases with interlinked courtyards. Its sculptures of dancers, musicians, and animals are made of waste material. More than 2.5 lakh people visit the garden every year and the revenue generated from tickets is Rs 1.8 crore a year (Rs 5,000 per day). The garden is maintained by the Nek Chand Foundation formed in 1996.

The minister was in the state on Thursday for laying the foundation stone for the government medical college in Namakkal. He warned against believing various rumours spread through social media and urged the public to remain vigilant. “Our borders have been sealed and people coming from countries severely affected by coronavirus, are being monitored strictly,” he said.

As many as 30 positive cases have been reported in the country so far, and they have all been quarantined and kept under observation.

490,['6/03/2020'],"At Lal Bagh, eight-decade-old carpets get back royal splendour","Indore: Some eight decades ago, their colours and intricate Persian designs used to enhance grandeur of crown and seating halls of Lal Bagh Palace.

Over the years, grime and moths that had accumulated over them due to lack of maintenance had reduced the two heritage carpets virtually to rugs, till almost a month ago, when artisans from Uttar Pradesh infused a new lease of life into them and restored them to their original glory.

The artisans (rafoogars) from Najibabad in Uttar Pradesh---- Intekhab Ahmad and Tanveer Anwar and their assistants Matloob Ali and Imran worked over six hours a day for around 25 days to darn these two carpets. (Darning is refurbishing items into identical form).

“The carpets were badly damaged by grime and carpet moths due to lack of maintenance,” said Ahmad and Anwar. They belong to the sixth generation of artisans involved in darning work of carpets and Jamawar shawls.

The task at hand was not easy. Cleaning them was most difficult. Considering that the carpets were over eight decades old, the craftsmen avoided washing them. Instead, they exposed them to sunlight, brushed them with a special handmade brush and wiped them with cloth soaked in water mixed with neem and raw walnut.

“We also used a vacuum cleaner before starting darning work which is done from both sides (taana baana) with threads. The two carpets were ‘revived” with the help of threads of 10 different colours,” said Ahmad, who along with his first cousin Anwar learnt the intricate work from Ahmad’s father at the age of six.

The carpets also had tattered covers which were refurbished too.

“We have completed the work and carpets will remain in good shape for next 100 years if they are maintained. We will put dry neem leaves under them and above the covers. They just need to expose the carpets to sunlight once a year for maintenance,” said Ahmad.

The volume, named ‘Kodaapu’, has about 1,000 words along with citations and will be released by Tamil author Cho Dharman in a few days.

Every year, the first year post graduate students of Tamil department, as part their lexicography course practical work, creates a word bank of regional dialects which are either extinct or on the verge of extinction. The four volumes put together will have around 5,000 words.

“The objective of the practical work is to document all such words in the regional dialect before they disappear. Such documentation will also help in better understanding modern literary work,” said P Velmurugan, head of Tamil department, CUTN.

Modern Tamil literary works are mostly in regional dialects, said assistant professor P Kumar. “For instance, Perumal Murugan’s creations could be found in Kongu dialect. Similarly, Sahithya Academy winning authors like Ki Rajanarayanan, Cho Dharman and Poomani have their creations in Karisal dialect of Nagercoil and Tirunelveli.”

“Tamil writers like Kanmani Gunasekaran and Imayam have Nadunadu dialect which shows in their creations, popular in Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Virudhachalam and Arcot,” he added.

Giving example of how an object is known with different words in different regions in the state, Kumar said a key which is used to open a lock is known in different words like Thiravukol, Thirappukuchi and Thakol.

This is an attempt to document such words in the regional dialect that are disappearing for not finding space in contemporary Tamil language. “We are not just collecting words but also giving citation so that it becomes easy for a reader to know in which literature the word has been used and where,” he said.

“While there are dictionaries of regional dialects, Kodaapu gives details on where the word has been used and in which literature,” said S R Vinitha, one among the contributor and second year student of MA Tamil.

493,['6/03/2020'],Govt woke up from slumber in jail project after PIL: HC,"Indore: The state government woke up from its slumber in 2019, when a PIL was filed before this court alleging wastage of Rs17.91 crore of public money by abandoning construction of central prison complex at Sanwer, observed a two-judge bench of MP high court.

The project was abandoned in 2008 by the then BJP government, and the current Congress-led government approved its renewal in March last year.

The division bench, comprising Justice S C Sharma and Justice Shailendra Shukla, made the observation in a petition filed against government inaction over completion of the jail complex . Petitioner Kamal Bhagwat, a social worker, seeks a court direction for completion of the prison at Sanwer.

The home department should acquire approval from finance department within four weeks, the court ordered, directing the principal secretary, home, and principal secretary, finance, to file a reply on the steps taken in the matter.

The court, after going through a reply filed by the home department, has said that records reveal that the project, which started in 2002, is incomplete despite incurring expenditure of Rs 17.91 crore.

The petitioner’s counsel, Abhijeet Yadav, told the court that 50-acre land was allotted to the jail department for construction of jail on Sanwer Road in 2002 and an MoU was signed with Madhya Pradesh Housing Board Corporation. But, even after spending more than Rs 18 crore, the project was abandoned in 2008, with jail authorities ending the memorandum with housing board with immediate effect, Yadav said.

The court observed that the project was abandoned in 2008 ‘because of reasons best known to them (state government)’. On March 5, 2019, the council of ministers granted fresh approval for completion of project. “Let the matter be processed immediately,” the HC said, fixing the next hearing on April 7.

494,['6/03/2020'],IS sympathiser planned forest hideouts,"Chennai: Arrested Islamic State sympathiser C Khaja Moideen, inspired by slain brigand Veerappan , planned to set up forest hideouts across south India to use as launch pads for a jihad, Bengaluru resident Hussain Shariff has told NIA officials.

Cuddalore native Khaja Moideen, who was arrested in Delhi in January, a day before the murder of special sub-inspector Y Wilson, had got some of his aides to procure arms and material like blankets, insect repellants and dry fruits to stock his hideouts, an NIA official said, quoting Shariff.

Some of the material was seized from Shariff’s Bengaluru residence.

After Wilson was shot dead on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala inter-state border on January 8, the Tamil Nadu ‘Q’ branch registered a case under IPC Sections 465, 468, 471, and 120 (B) (conspiracy), Sections 13 and 18 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, apart from Section 25 of Arms Act. On February 1, the case was transferred to the NIA which busted the terror module. NIA sleuths had picked up Shariff and nine others for questioning on February 27 and a court sent them to jail on March 3.

Khaja Moideen, 52, who floated an outfit named ‘Al-Hind Trust’ to train martial arts to youngsters, used it as a cover to recruit youngsters to spread IS network across India. He engaged Thoufique and Shameem, who were arrested for the murder of SSI Wilson, to act as representatives of the outfit. He also sent them to radicalise youngsters in places like Melapalayam in Tirunelveli, Madurai, Bengaluru, Pune in Maharastra and other parts of the country.

Khaja Moideen was arrested in 2004 for organising training camps at Nellikuppam for conversion of people into Islam and trained them in handling martial arts. In 2014, he was arrested for murdering Hindu Munnani leader K P S Suresh Kumar at Ambattur and in September 2017, police arrested Moideen’s recruit Shakul Hameed alias Salavuddin, an MBA dropout from Otteri. Moideen was arrested by the NIA after they confirmed that he had arranged flight tickets for a man named Khaja Fakruddin, a Cuddalore native working in Singapore, to go to Syria to fight along with the IS.

He came out on bail in February and along with others continued to attend the court hearing in the Suresh Kumar murder case. As per the court’s direction, Moideen was supposed to appear personally before the Ambattur industrial Estate police station in the morning on prescribed dates without fail. Later, when he failed to turn up at the station, investigators obtained a warrant from a magistrate court and began a crackdown on all his illegal activities. Khaja Moideen was finally nabbed at Wazirpur bridge in Delhi in January.

CHENNAI: In a ruling which may have a bearing on the ongoing anti-citizenship law protest at Washermenpet, the Madras high court has directed the Tiruppur police to ensure that no more agitations, both for and against the Citizenship Amendment Act, takes place in that town without due permission.

“We are not concerned about the cause of the protests but only the effect of such agitations causing inconvenience to public,” a division bench of Justice MM sundresh and Justice Krishnan Ramaswamy said, adding: “There is a subtle difference between the right to protest and upsetting the public road causing hindrance to the scores of people. Nobody has the right to indulge in such agitations in a place choose by them.”

“The place in which agitation is going on is a public road wherein school children are commuting, apart from the existence of a hospital. This will be a hindrance to public. In such view of the matter, we are inclined to direct the police to see to it that no more agitations, both for and against CAA , take place in the aforesaid place without due permission.”

The issue pertains to a plea moved by K Gopinath, president of Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam, Tiruppur, seeking direction to Tamil Nadu DGP and the Tiruppur police not to entertain any proposal to organise any demonstration in Tiruppur or elsewhere and to promote peace and harmony among religions groups in national interest.

When the plea came up for hearing, government pleader submitted that action is being taken against those who are indulging in such activities and that, so far, 20 cases have been registered and charge sheets filed against those involved in protests both for and against CAA. However, answering a query raised by the bench, the pleader submitted that despite the actions the agitations are still going on.

The court then said, “We are of the view that the approach of the authorities cannot be countenanced. If an FIR is filed followed by final report nothing prevents the authorities from taking action to see to it that no such protest takes place without any permission or authorisation.”

The object of filing FIR and final report is to take action against and to prevent illegal activities. There is a subtle difference between the right to protest and upsetting the public road causing hindrance to scores of people. Nobody has the right to indulge in such agitations in a place chosen by them, the bench added. Noting that such protests might lead to a ‘dangerous consequence’, the court said, “We may note that already a detailed order has been passed in a similar plea by another division bench on February 18 wherein law has been laid down in these matters. We reiterate the same, once again.”

NEW DELHI: In view of the fresh warrant issued by a trial court to execute the death sentence of Nirbhaya case convicts on March 20, the Supreme Court on Thursday deferred hearing on the Centre’s plea to allow separate execution where there are more than one death row convict. The court posted the matter for March 23.

A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna said it would examine whether separate execution could be allowed in cases where more than one person was convicted and awarded death sentence. It rejected the plea of Nirbhaya case convicts to grant them a hearing before March 20.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Delhi government, said the Nirbhaya case convicts had taken the judicial system for a ride and separate execution of sentence should be allowed.

“There is no anxiety on our part to hang somebody. Nobody likes this. Our anxiety is that credibility of the system is at stake,” Mehta said. He added that there may be a case tomorrow in which 10 or 20 people are convicted and they may again delay execution by moving separate forums at different times.

Mehta said there was no statutory provision, which said convicts had to be executed simultaneously. He urged the court to direct the Nirbhaya case convicts to file whatsoever they wanted in court before March 20. The bench did not pass any order on the issue and adjourned the case.

This was informed by principal health secretary Pradeep Vyas here on Thursday.

Accompanied by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, health minister Rajesh Tope, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, the secretary said there was no need to wear the mask by public as situation is normal in state. “But, the health workers who are treating the patients and those working at the international airport should wear it as precautionary measures,” he said, adding that citizens should use handkerchiefs.

According to hospital sources, he was among 20 people who travelled from Dubai to Bengaluru and then to Nagpur. “Investigations are in progress,” they said.

While advising the people on not to press panic button, both the CM and Vyas cautioned them to take precautions against getting contracted from the virus by avoiding mass gatherings. Both also informed on preparations made by the government to fight the endemic if it hits the state. “Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai and IGMC in Nagpur,apart from Pune’s NIV were provided with facilities to test the suspected cases. We are also waiting for guidelines from the central government on tackling the virus threat,” they said.

Announcing the helpline number 1916 for the corona virus cases in Mumbai, Pardesi said the over 70,000 persons coming from abroad to India were screened. “Of them 90 suspects were identified, but reports of 83 are negative. There will be no screening on the domestic trains and bus terminals, as on date,” he said.

Tope added that the virus would affect only if the person went very near to patient, or he/she make handshake with him/her. “It’s not an airborne disease and therefore, three metres distance must be maintained with patients. Even handshakes should be avoided. Touching the body parts like face, ears, nose and mouth by hands should be avoided, as virus could enter into the body through them. Frequent handwash is a must, not necessarily with the sanitizer,” he said.
