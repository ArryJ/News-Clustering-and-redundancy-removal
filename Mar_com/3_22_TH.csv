0,2020/03/22,"Covid-19: With no public transport during ‘Janata Curfew’, citizens stranded","Additionally, on Sunday evening, the State government directed road transport corporations not to operate AC buses till March 31

The almost total shutdown in the city in response to the ‘Janata Curfew’ call made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw vehicles, including Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses, remaining off the roads on Sunday.

Even the Namma Metro services, operated by the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL), were unavailable. While the entry and exit points of all Namma Metro stations were closed, as announced previously, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) cancelled its operations from the city to various points; more than 2,500 bus schedules were cancelled.

With many citizens opting to stay indoors, there was poor patronage, claimed BMTC officials. BMTC operated only 50 services, out of which a majority were operated to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).

A senior BMTC official said, “Around 30 services were operated to the airport. The remaining non-AC services were operated in the city limits. We received very poor response. Hardly one or two people travelled in some buses.”

The BMTC decided to suspend bus service after 9 p.m. on Sunday.

Meanwhile, on Sunday evening, the State government directed the road transport corporations not to operate AC buses till March 31. In line with the directions, the BMTC said there would be no AC bus services to KIA after 9 p.m. on Sunday.

Non availability of public transport affected many citizens, who reached city by train or travelled by long-distance buses.

Akash, who was stranded at Majestic, said, “Usually on bandh days, metro services are available. I thought the BMRCL would operate services. Only after reaching the metro station at Majestic did I realise that metro stations too were closed.”

Passengers who reached Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna City Railway Station also felt the heat.

“I am working in an industry in Whitefield. I did not know that all services were stopped. There are eight of us. All of us are waiting for a bus to take us to Whitefield,” said Raghunath.

Though there was no public transport, a few autorickshaws and cabs operated by aggregators were seen plying on the roads. Many of those who were stranded complained that the autorickshaw drivers were overcharging, even for short distances.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-with-no-public-transport-during-janata-curfew-citizens-stranded/article31136838.ece
1,2020/03/22,"Covid-19: Persons with stamp cause panic at Majestic, railway station","One was prevented from boarding a train while the other could not get a hotel room

Two persons who went to Majestic bus stand and the KSR City Railway Station from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) caused panic when passers-by mistook them to be COVID 19 patients after seeing the seal on their hand.

Last week, the State government started putting a stamp on the hand of passengers arriving from abroad at the airport after screening. The stamp indicates that the person needs to be quarantined.

On Sunday, a person was the cause for panic at Majestic as people mistook him for a COVID-19 patient.

According to sources, the person landed at KIA at 2.30 a.m. from Dubai. He was taken for testing and a stamp was put on his hand, indicating that he has an international travel history and required to be home quarantined.

According to the Upparpet police, the person had gone to Majestic to board a bus to Chennai.

“As no buses were plying, he visited hotels enquiring for a room to stay. People noticed the seal on his hand and started panicking. They thought he was a COVID-19 patient who had defied quarantine,” the police said and added that he was refused rooms.

The police and health department officials were alerted. They took him to K.C. General Hospital.

Later in the afternoon, a woman, who had arrived from Dubai, was prevented from boarding a train at the KSR City Railway Station to Delhi. Upon enquiry by the Railway Police Force (RPF) personnel, the woman revealed that she had come from Dubai and wanted to travel to Delhi, and that she was not following quarantine norms. The RPF police called 108 and the woman was shifted to a government hospital.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-persons-with-stamp-cause-panic-at-majestic-railway-station/article31136823.ece
2,2020/03/22,City shuts down for ‘Janata Curfew’,"Only a few pharmacies and petrol stations were open

Shops and other commercial establishments voluntarily downed their shutters and, with citizens preferring to stay back at home, most thoroughfares across the city, including the ring road and National Highways, wore a deserted look on Sunday as Bengaluru observed the ‘Janata Curfew’.

The entire Central Business District, including Majestic, Gandhinagar, Chickpete, M.G. Road, Brigade Road and Commercial Street, was completely shut. Major tourist destinations, including Lalbagh and Cubbon Park, were closed for the general public.

Several hotels and restaurants were closed. Except for a few pharmacies and petrol stations, most commercial establishments were shut.

With many citizens voluntarily staying indoors, there were very few vehicles on the roads. Many two-wheeler riders and their pillion riders were seen without helmets.

With Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) not operating buses in the city and the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) suspending Namma Metro services temporarily, a few commuters were stranded in the Majestic area. A few autorickshaws and cabs were plying. However, there were complaints that they were overcharging.

Places of worship too had put up notices on the gates informing the devout about the closure. A notice on the gate of Our Lady of Fatima Church in Jalahalli stated that arrangements had been made by the Archdiocesan Communications Centre for live streaming daily and Sunday Mass online.

A notice at an Ayyappa temple stated that while the pujas and rituals would be conducted as usual, the temple would remain closed for devotees on Sunday, as directed by the government.

Through the day, police personnel were seen going around the city. At Majestic, police personnel were seen asking people not to roam in the streets.

Excise officials were going around the city, ensuring that all liquor outlets remained closed. An official told The Hindu that they had been instructed to seal any liquor shop found open, besides file cases against the owner.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/city-shuts-down-for-janata-curfew/article31136585.ece

As many as 43,000 people returned to the city between March 8 and 19, and 22,000 have been identified since Saturday based on information given by the airport authorities, the police said on Sunday.

Around 500 police teams from 108 police stations across the city have now been deployed at the police commissioner’s office, which has turned into a war room to sort out details of people who have returned to the city from abroad to ensure that they are quarantined.

The teams are handing over details to their counterparts, who are, along with personnel from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), visiting people’s houses to monitor them, said Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao.

The special teams will stamp the people who returned from abroad, and notices will be issued by the police to them saying that they have to be home quarantined.

The family members, neighbours and the community will also be instructed to monitor them to ensure they stay put. If they violate the norms, the police will detain them and send them to the government centre for quarantine, Mr. Rao added.

The beat police have been instructed to monitor people by visiting them frequently to ensure that they are at home and not socialising.

The health and family welfare department has said that all persons in quarantine, who are not residents of Bengaluru but are staying in hotels, lodges or hostels, will be taken to mass quarantine centres. The department said the decision has been taken keeping in view the unavailability of transport facilities.

Meanwhile, with the number of positive COVID-19 cases increasing in the country, the State government has decided to increase the number of tests conducted in line with guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research.

In a circular issued by the Department of Health and Family Welfare on Sunday, which lists a revised testing strategy, it has been said that all persons having symptoms such as fever, cough, difficulty in breathing within 14 days of international travel will be tested.

All the contacts of Covid-19 positive patients who have symptoms, all healthcare workers who have symptoms, all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and cough, and/or shortness of breath) will also be tested after the doctors have ruled out other causes.

All asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case will be tested once between Day 5 and Day 14 of coming in contact of the patient.

The department has also categorised direct and high risk contacts as those who live in the same household with a confirmed case, healthcare workers who examined a confirmed case without adequate protection as per WHO recommendations.

It also says that arrangements have to be made by district surveillance unit to collect samples from their home through a microbiologist by following all the necessary protocols.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fexcr5/article31140071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGCURFEW11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/coronavirus-those-in-self-isolation-in-hotels-hostels-to-be-taken-to-mass-quarantine-centres/article31135898.ece

The State government, which announced a slew of measures on Sunday to curtail the transmission of COVID-19, including closing all borders, screening all domestic passengers and postponing the SSLC examinations, has named two locations in Bengaluru to be the epicentres in the fight against the pandemic.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said on Sunday that the 1,700-bed Victoria hospital will be used specially to tackle COVID-19. The patients in the hospital will be shifted to other hospitals.

Besides international air passengers, even domestic passengers will be screened at the airport from now on.

Acknowledging a need for more testing, the Chief Minister stated that all patients with symptoms of COVID-19 would be tested. “For every 10 lakh people, at least 200 people will be tested for which arrangements will be made,” he said.

Steps will also be taken to obtain permission to conduct testing in more government and private hospitals with cooperation from the The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV), he added.

The Balabrooie Guest House will be turned into a ‘war room’ that will function round-the-clock and will headed by the Chief Minister. It will be the venue for all video conferences. Besides this, district-level task forces will be established.

6,2020/03/22,Janata Curfew: Good response in Bengaluru as citizens prefer to stay inside,"Most throughfares across the city appear deserted; rail commuters stranded

The Janata Curfew received good response in Bengaluru on March 22, with shops and other commercial establishments voluntarily downing their shutters. As citizens preferred to stay at home, most thoroughfares across the city, including the Ring Road and National Highways passing through Bengaluru, wore a deserted look.

With the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) announcing minimum services and stopping of services of the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL), several rail commuters who reached the Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna Railway Station were stranded. Since few autorickshaws were plying, many rail commuters were seen walking in the railway station area with their luggage.

The BMTC officials stated that the corporation operated only 30 buses, of which 25 were from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). An official of the BMTC said, “We had already announced that only minimum services will be operated on March 22. There are no people on the road, hardly one or two people travelled in the Vayu Vajra Services operated from the airport”.

KSRTC cancels services

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation has cancelled all its services from Bengaluru.

“We have to go to Banashankari. We assumed the Namma Metro will be functional. We are now stranded in Majestic,” said Akash who came here with eight others from Vijayapura district.

Gurunath reached the city early in the morning in a private bus from Tumakuru. He too was stranded in Majestic, unable to reach Whitefield. Most commuters complained about autorickshaw drivers overcharging.

Police patrol

Police personnel were seen patrolling the city, with some asking people to go indoors. Excise officials were also going around the city, ensuring all liquor outlets remained closed.

The entire Central Business District, which is the nerve centre of commercial activities, was completely shut. Several hotels and restaurants were also closed. Except for a few pharmacies and petrol stations, most commercial establishments were shut.

Another notice at an Ayyappa Temple stated that while the temple pujas and rituals would be conducted as usual, the temple would remain closed for the devotees on March 22, as directed by the government.

With several hotels and restaurants closed, people had stocked up on ready-to-eat and packaged food. “When the curfew was announced, I knew that the cook would not be able to come in. I decided to buy some noodles for Sunday,” said a 24-year-old employee of a private company, who has been working from home for the past week.

Meanwhile, several apartments had also closed their gates, preventing entry and exit. In a mailer sent out by an apartment association, the residents were asked to stay indoors. Security personnel had been instructed to not even let in housekeeping or help staff, besides allowing exit of residents only in cases of emergency.

Some hotels were open for delivery on the various food delivery apps. That apart, some e-commerce delivery personnel were seen making their deliveries. According to a delivery personnel from ekart, it was just another working day for them. “Many apartments have restrictions. We have been instructed to leave packages with the reception.

8,2020/03/22,"BBMP, Health officials and police team up to enforce home quarantine","Over 500 joint teams have been formed following reports of non-compliance

Girish Kumar, a resident of Chandra Layout, is worried about himself and his family. His neighbours are primary contacts of a COVID-19 patient who tested positive after returning from the U.S. Though the primary contacts have to be in home quarantine for 14 days, Mr. Kumar says they are not following it.

“Both the husband and wife are going about their business. This puts many of us in the neighbourhood at risk of exposure. I complained to civic authorities, who questioned them, but the primary contacts told them that they were following the advisory. A team of health officers came visiting the neighbourhood on Saturday, only to find the house locked, a clear indicator that the primary contacts are violating quarantine norms,” he said.

The authorities, who are trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, are having a tough time getting people who have been advised ‘home quarantine’ for their safety, and that of the community to follow the rules. Acknowledging the problem, BBMP has launched a door-to-door campaign to put more people under home quarantine and ensure that they remain there. The police have said they will book violators and detain them.

The city's civic body and health department have now begun a joint effort with the police to ensure enforcement of home quarantine.

“The practice of affixing stamps on the palms of people who returned to Bengaluru from other countries to identify them for home quarantine began only during the last three days. Now, we have decided to put a stamp on all those with travel history who came to the city from abroad even before this as well as primary contacts of Covid-19 patients. A list of people is being prepared,” said Dr. Vijendra Bilaguli, Chief Health Officer, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

“Police and BBMP staff will stamp their left palm and monitor their homes,” tweeted civic commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar. A war room, set up in the BBMP, will “keep track of contact tracing and community surveillance activities,” he tweeted.

The Health Department, Karnataka estimates that around 30,000 people, who returned from abroad over the last few weeks, are in the city, and a majority of them have not been stamped for home quarantine.

“Over 500 joint teams of civic and police officials have been formed for the purpose,” said a statement from the Health Department. The teams began their work on Saturday.

“At each police station level, joint teams of civic health officials and police beat constables are being formed. These teams are being given a list of people to be home quarantined in their respective areas. They will go door-to-door over the next three days, stamp people, create awareness and also warn them not to venture out till the prescribed home quarantine period is over,” a senior police official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gstdcu/article31133110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BBMP-health-deGB3799EIO3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-health-officials-and-police-team-up-to-enforce-home-quarantine/article31133607.ece
9,2020/03/22,"All efforts will go waste if Games are cancelled, says Mirabai Chanu","I just want to get an Olympic medal for myself, says Mirabai Chanu

Mirabai Chanu has only one prayer on her lips, that the Tokyo Olympics go on as per schedule despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Otherwise, all her efforts of trying to win an Olympic medal will go down the drain.

For the last four years, Mirabai has laboured for a successful Olympics outing but all she can think of right now is about the fate of the July 24-August 9 Games, which could be postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

“If the Olympics don’t happen all our efforts for the last four years will go to waste. I don’t want it to cancel, I am praying to God every day. I just want to get an Olympic medal for myself,” Mirabai said.

Mirabai’s maiden Olympic campaign had ended in disappointment as she failed to lift the weight in any of her three attempts in the clean and jerk section.

“The pressure (of winning a medal) has changed to the Olympics and it should not be cancelled. That’s all I’m thinking.

“The rest, training, etc. I am not worried about right now. Even if it’s postponed there will be a lot of problem because a lot can change in a short period of time for us,” she said.

Schedule gone haywire

Weightlifting’s Olympic qualifying schedule has also gone haywire.

The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) had to cancel five continental championships, including the Asia event.

The Asian Championships, which was relocated from Kazakhstan to Tashkent in Uzbekistan was the last tournament before the Olympics for Mirabai. She had missed out on a bronze by a whisker last year.

The Manipuri, had aimed to improve her total effort of 203kg (88kg+115kg).

“I was preparing for Asian very well. There was a lot of uncertainty whether it will happen or not. I have already qualified for the Olympics but in the Asian Championship we would have got a clear picture,” she said.

“I wanted to improve my effort here so that I could go to the Olympics high on confidence. That was the target. If the Asian Championship had taken place it would have been a good platform for me to better my performance.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rmvy2q/article31136396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23CHANU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/all-efforts-will-go-waste-if-games-are-cancelled-says-mirabai-chanu/article31136397.ece
10,2020/03/22,Bhaker looks at the bigger picture,"Says she is, however, prepared for the Tokyo Games

Postponement of tournaments, and cancellation of trials and camps hardly matter at this point to Manu Bhaker, one of India’s biggest young achievers in sport. The 18-year-old is hoping to see the world win the battle against COVID-19.

The pandemic has cast serious doubts over the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, but Manu, a medal prospect at the quadrennial extravaganza, is not thinking about things beyond her control.

“Trials and events should be postponed in the current situation as there are other very important things for the world to deal with,” said Manu.

She says the shooters are abiding by the protocols and guidelines issued by the concerned authorities. “We are strictly following the instructions of the health ministry and the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO).”

The pistol ace was one of the few shooters who participated in a trial organised not long ago by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI). The trial was arranged to allow the shooters to register their scores after the postponement of the New Delhi ISSF World Cup and the Indian team’s pull-out from the Cyprus World Cup owing to the coronavirus outbreak.

“The camp situation was fine as there were only a few shooters, there was no large gathering and it lasted only three days.”

Asked about the Olympic Games which has a cloud hanging over it, Manu said she will look to carry on with her routine that is part of her preparation.

“I am relaxed at home. The current situation doesn’t affect my preparation and mindset. I am continuing with my yoga sessions, meditation and things that help me stay calm and composed.

“The Olympics, whenever it happens, is huge, so we need to be prepared. I am preparing for the Olympics as planned,” she said. “Shooting is very competitive now, especially 2019 and after, and it is evident from the scores.”

Manu, who secured an Olympic quota for India in women’s 10m air pistol, enjoyed a successful season last year where she won five World Cup gold medals in individual and team events.

She burst on to the National scene at the start of 2018 with a victory at the ISSF World Cup in Mexico, and has not looked back since.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/4mjbzx/article31136357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23MANU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/bhaker-looks-at-the-bigger-picture/article31136358.ece
11,2020/03/22,BFI mum on Mary Kom breaking quarantine,"The boxer had returned from Amman

The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has chosen not to react on the issue of top boxer M.C. Mary Kom breaking self-isolation.

Mary Kom along with the Indian boxing squad returned home on March 12 after taking part in the Asia-Oceania Olympic qualifying event in Amman, Jordan. Mary Kom was among the nine Indian boxers who earned Olympic quota places at the event.

The Indian team — which was training in Assisi, Italy — left that country on February 27, prior to the scheduled departure owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The boxers competed in the Olympic qualifier in Amman before returning home.

“By the time the boxers returned home, they had been 14 days out of Italy, one of the worst-affected by the coronavirus. However, in the best interests of the athletes and support staff we decided that everyone would go on self-isolation on their return from Jordan,” said a BFI official.

Mary Kom, a Rajya Sabha member who was spending time with her family since her return, reportedly attended a breakfast get-together for MPs organised by President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on March 18. “It’s very difficult to ignore the President’s invite.

12,2020/03/22,Pressure mounts on IOC to postpone Olympics,"Organisers drafting possible alternatives to holding the Games: sources

The International Olympic Committee faced mounting opposition on Sunday to the current schedule for the Tokyo 2020 Games as athletes, teams and federations called for a delay because of the coronavirus pandemic.

IOC President Thomas Bach, who has insisted the Games will go ahead as planned, said any decision to change an Olympic Games was not a simple matter like rescheduling a soccer match and would need careful planning and information.

Also read: Will the Tokyo Olympics open? Here's what the odds say

He also ruled out cancelling the July 24-Aug. 9 Games.

Sources told Reuters on Sunday, however, that Tokyo Games organisers had started drafting possible alternatives to holding the Olympics this summer. “Finally, we have been asked to make a simulation in case of a postponement,” a source close to the organising committee who is involved in drafting the scenarios said.

Plan B, C, D

“We are making alternative plans — plan B, C, D — looking at different postponement time-frames,” said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays.

Other sources within the Olympic movement said the IOC was likely to hold an unscheduled executive board meeting as early as next week. One source told Reuters the meeting could be “very, very early next week.” The IOC did not comment.

Hartung to boycott

Serbia and Croatia joined the Olympic committees and sports bodies opposing the IOC’s plans to proceed, while German former world champion fencer Max Hartung, who has already qualified for Tokyo, said he would boycott the Games.

“Japan has invested a lot of resources into the Olympics and they are adamant that the Games should go ahead, but that defies common sense and we cannot support it because human lives come first,” Serbian Olympic Committee president Vanja Udovicic said.

His Croatian counterpart, Zlatko Matesa, said it was “impossible” to proceed with the Olympics under the current circumstances.

Germany’s Hartung, a four-times European champion who also heads the German Olympic Committee’s athletes’ commission, said he could no longer justify competing in Tokyo and said everyone had to play their part in stopping the spread of the virus. “I have taken my decision. This summer I will not be taking part at the Olympic Games at the scheduled dates,” he told German broadcaster ZDF.

13,2020/03/22,Pedalling on a dream,"A late entrant to the pleasures of cycling now rules the tracks like a master

Till my early 20s, I could barely ride a bicycle. I never really felt the need to ask my father to buy me a bicycle. My primary school was next to my home. My higher primary and secondary school was residential. Then I moved to a city for graduation, and I stayed in a hostel that was just behind the college. After getting a job, it started to occur to me that I had crossed the age to learn to ride a bicycle.

A few years later, I had a tear in my knee and when the pain became unmanageable, I had to undergo a meniscectomy. So to strengthen my knee after the surgery, I had to see a physiotherapist. When the suggested exercises felt so repetitive, I asked him if riding a bicycle could do the same job, and he said yes. So, that’s how I brought a bicycle for myself.

I was feeling awkward out there struggling to learn a bicycle in my 20s. So I restricted my learning to late evenings, once the darkness started setting on the horizon. It didn’t take much time to find the balance, and I was happily riding around boasting to my friend when I rode 10 or 20 km a day.

I later happened to acquaint myself with cycling groups. So the initial 20 km became 40, 80 and 100. We would ride to nearby towns, hills and tourist spots, but I always lagged behind. Sometimes, on the ride back, when I could push no further, I would pack up and put my bicycle into a rickshaw and go home. The other days, when I could complete a ride, I would come home burnt out and lie flat on the ground.

As rides passed, my muscles started building itself up against the challenges, and I could slowly feel the changes that enable me to push for more. And that is how I could try riding over 100 km a day and then hesitantly tried my first tough brevet event of 200 km. Though I didn’t finish it in time, I completed it. Though I couldn’t call myself a randonneur, I had gained enough confidence that I could be one by the next one such event.

The motivation would come from the youngsters who would go for multiple laps on hill routes when I would be struggling to complete one. It would also come from those 60-plus who would wish you as they cross you riding downhill when you are still sweating and panting to reach the top. There was no dearth of inspiration as there were people from the same city cycling clubs who had finished national and international events and events like seven days and 2,200 km.

What then started as a mode of exercise to strengthen my knee, turned into a hobby and then it became a routine. The freshness it would give, though with a trace of pain in your legs, ankles and thighs, was great. Moreover, the whole process built a confidence that I can endure lot more difficulties, and tough times in life.

So I learnt that age is no bar at all for a new adventure in life. There are lots of reasons you couldn’t do or try something at some age but that should not hinder you from trying it at a later stage in life. I have seen so many people who retire from a hard-earned life with no clue how to spend all the time they are going to get.

Go for that thing which makes you feel great. Let your age not be a barrier. Life always gives a chance to live it to the fullest. It’s just that we must give ourselves a chance to grab it with open hands.

14,2020/03/22,Jugaad the American way,"How the wife of a U.S. Ambassador and an envoy himself introduced simple techniques to help Indian workers

A friend had mailed a copy of a newspaper article by U.S. Ambassador Kenneth I. Juster narrating how similar is the dogged air pollution in the National Capital Region to that Los Angeles suffered in 1943. The U.S. city mitigated the menace, harnessing the simplest of a few technologies but with perseverance stretching to 40 long years. Maybe, India could benefit from the LA experience, perhaps in just one decade.

My mind flashed back to Mr. Juster’s two predecessors in India.

Ambassador Chester Bowles’ wife, Dorothy Bowles, a regular visitor to the Chandni Chowk bazaar in New Delhi, once noticed a sanitation worker in considerable pain as she plied the broom.

It struck her that the short length of the broom made the sweepers almost double down from the waist and retain that posture for hours on end all their working life, leading to chronic spinal pain.

Ms. Bowles turned to her staff-companion and asked her to go back and fetch the Ambassador’s walking stick. Meanwhile, she had the binders on the hand grip of the broom loosened a bit and went on to insert about a foot of the walking stick in the centre of the grip, tightened the binders and hey presto, there was a six-foot-long broom which could be plied with an upright stance.

Pleased with her innovation, she gathered many sweepers and asked them to try out the “Make in India” model. Each one passed the broom to the next with a big smile and then turned to touch the feet of Ms. Bowles.

She demonstrated her innovation to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and so after aeons, the sanitation workers in the country had a comfortable sweeping experience.

Reinventing the wheel

About a decade later, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith was visiting the site of the Bhakhra canal project near Suratgarh where camel carts were the primary means of transport for construction material. But no cart could carry more than 30% of its capacity in the Thar desert environment. And in that instant, Mr. Galbraith came up with the idea to replace the wooden wheels with discarded balloon-tyre wheels of aircraft, bolted on the ends of an axle with ball-bearings.

This innovation shed a centuries-old design and enabled each cart to transport to full capacity and made it possible for the camels to make double the daily trips, if need be.

To stabilise the compacted sand on both flanks of the canal, countless thousands of endemic tree saplings had been planted, but the manual irrigation was inefficient, inadequate and labour intensive.

Again, Mr. Galbraith had an instant innovation: mount a diesel water-suction pump with a flexible long hose upon a wooden platform, fix a camel’s harness to the platform and float it in the canal, start the pump, goad the camel to walk and use the hose to irrigate saplings at the leisurely, walking pace of the camel. A single contraption, one camel and one labourer would suffice for every five-km length of the plantation.

15,2020/03/22,The searing summer,"The season now is merciless because of the wanton destruction of the environment

Another summer arrives and the season is nowadays quite merciless. We have created simmering, scorching summers by relentlessly devastating the environment.

In my childhood, my village was filled with spacious compounds full of large clusters of bamboos and black palm trees, plenty of mango and cashew-nut trees, and other trees whose foliage absorbed the scorching heat of the summer sun and protected us, and provided water and food security for humans and other animals. Wild creepers were seen climbing up to the top of these trees.

These compounds were small forests that sheltered foxes, mongooses, civets, wild lizards and different kinds of birds. They yielded many delicious fruits to the birds and us. We used to spend the afternoon in these compounds, feeding on the mangoes and the berries the creepers and thickets provided.

I still remember vividly a particular mango tree which would give sweet fruits for us every day during the summer vacation. It stood at the centre of a vast compound. At every noon, my friends and I used to go to the tree through the dense thickets and the tree would welcome us with the ripe mangoes strewn all around it. After eating the fallen mangoes, we would climb on to the branches and shake them and fresh fruits would fall down.

In my family’s own compound, there were many jackfruit trees and indigenous mango trees. I was an expert in climbing them. One noon we were very hungry after playing in the large pond in the vast compound adjacent to ours. On top of one of the gigantic trees, we saw a ripe jackfruit. I climbed the tree and after comfortably sitting on a branch near the fruit, pushed my right palm into it and plucked out the sweet juicy petals and dropped them down to my friends who stood below looking up and spreading their palms and opening their mouths. Some petals would fall in their mouths, some on their palms and many on the ground which was blanketed by the fallen leaves of the trees. While they were eating, I too satiated myself like Tarzan.

I think a Tarzan lives in the mind of every human being, but the “development mania” that alienates humans from Nature smothers the Tarzans in us and we inculcate the dangerous idea that ‘development’ lies in overpowering Nature and hence we become nonchalant towards the elimination of the flora and fauna around us and destroy the habitats of birds and animals pushing them to extinction.

As Prerna Singh Bindra says in The Vanishing: India’s Wildlife Crisis, “We continue to clear no less than 135 hecatres of forests a day, diverting it for various projects such as highways, mines, and cement factories. And we pitch their protection, and that of a healthy environment, against development....The statistics are frightening. Global population of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles have declined by an astounding 58% in the four decades spanning 1970 to 2012. One in five species faces extinction. A tenth of the world’s wilderness has been destroyed since the 1990s, and we are in real danger of losing it all by 2050. ...If it all sounds remote and ‘out there’, I would suggest you look into your backyard. Try and remember when you last saw a bee, or a hive, in your surrounds.”

Yes, we live in an anthropocentric world that has no place for bees and butterflies and dragonflies and birds and animals and trees and plants. The so-called development has brought us into a world bereft of biodiversity that makes the earth beautiful and sustainable. By relentlessly destroying the forests and rivers and lakes and wetlands and indigenous flora in the name of development, the humans are pushing birds and animals into extinction without realising a world sans the flora and fauna will automatically be the mass grave of Homosapiens. By pushing all other living beings into extinction, the humans are pushing themselves to theirs. They don't know what they are doing.

Thirty five years ago, I spent my childhood in a sustainable agrarian village that cultivated everything we feed on, and the trees we protected gave us their seasonal fruits and assured us water security in return. Today we cultivate nothing; there are no mango trees or jackfruit trees or cashew-nut trees that give the children fresh and delicious fruits not contaminated with pesticides and chemical fertilizers. As there are no indigenous trees and fruits, there are no birds and squirrels either. Can the children, who grow up without seeing and playing with trees and plants and flowers and butterflies and birds and squirrels be humane human beings?

16,2020/03/22,Changing the story line,"We have stories that hail vengeance but not retribution, celebrate aggression but not humility, glorify nirvana in next birth as opposed to living well

Stories and tales are an integral part of every culture, sect and region. In fact, it is one of the many aspects that differentiate men from apes, the compelling story-telling ability that carries forward folklore as a cerebral signature.

Stories are everywhere. Right from the rainforests of Papua New Guinea to the skyscrapers of New York, these heirlooms are cherished, passed on and retold.

India, especially, is a rich cauldron of history brimming with stories. And we Indians are attached to them. Our love for narration is a matter of lore. India has the largest number of movies made each year, in 20 different languages.

It’s not just the fables and tales that I am talking about. It is about any content, any narrative, fact or fiction, creative or regular. There were the stories that we are told as children, stories we tell our children. We all grew up listening to them. At a macro level, there are the stories that governments tell, those that politicians tell us, stories employers tell us, stories handed over to us by history and culture, stories that brands or agents sell us and finally, the stories we tell ourselves. Just the sheer variety is rich and fascinating.

I am not writing about the greatness or importance of these stories. It is, in fact, quite the opposite. This is about the stories we choose to tell. And the ones we should actually be telling instead. This is about the missed nuances, the biased narrations and the distorted truths. Not all narrations are shared and received equally, not all voices heard and not all perspectives represented.

How many stories have you come across that tell about the mistakes that the hero makes? We sing odes to victories but avoid the stories of failure, We have stories that hail vengeance but not retribution, celebrate aggression but not humility, glorify nirvana in next birth as opposed to living well. We have a disproportionate coverage given to mythology as opposed to science, to education as opposed to resourcefulness, to stories of men born of a higher caste, to specific sports or music, to flamboyance as opposed to simplicity and so on.

The problem with incomplete or one-sided stories is that they contain a hint of bias which is heard, ruminated and passed on, many times over, establishing it as a way of life. It is time we gave the way to fresh narratives and fresh perspectives to replace outdated mindsets. It is important to acknowledge that heroes do make mistakes, richness is not just bank balance, and most important, everything the characters did, they did it of their own volition.

It is heartening to see to that we are taking baby steps for inclusiveness in our quest for good narratives. There are a good number of tabloids and newspapers that cover articles on local inspirational stories, updates on science and environment, accounts of struggling yet determined start-ups. It is up to the reader to shun sensational and overdramatic accounts of events and choose the worthy stories within the white noise. We aspire to the stories we are told. So it’s time we tell and listen to better stories.

17,2020/03/22,War and peace begin at home,"Most films and electronic games bubble with violence and show killing as a sport

“Why are you fighting with me? I am not fighting with you,” my five-year-old grandnephew told his much older cousin who was in a bad mood over infantile arguments that were going against him. I was keen on watching how they sorted out their differences, but they moved into another room, and when they emerged at lunchtime, they were friends again.

Long after that day, I thought about that little boy’s remark, “I am not fighting with you!” An only child — like so many of his generation — I hope he holds on to that idea as a talisman as he grows up. It made me look around at the models of behaviour children below 10 are watching as they move into their teens.

Advertisements show that only the fastest and shiniest are worthy of respect. Marketing is aimed at our basest instincts. The purchase of something is not just for you to enjoy using it; along with its ownership comes the suggestion that flaunting it will make others feel unhappy, restless and inferior, and ha-ha, that should make you even happier.

Direct to the drawing rooms

Though we now have a wonderful range of children’s books written, illustrated and designed most imaginatively by Indians, most films and electronic games lead off in the opposite direction. They bubble with extreme violence. Killing is sport. Long before they are emotionally mature, children absorb chilling accounts of physical violence on the weak or the elderly. How are they going to learn that matters should be settled with discussions and not blows? Every adult generation feels some inadequacy in dealing with the next generation, but when we read about a youngster stabbed for his mobile phone or a gang of minors abusing their classmate, it is time to stop and think. Are these the kind of people who will care for their parents and grandparents in their old age?

Many schools are sincerely concerned about the spirit and imagination of the children in their care. They know that leading students through the academic side alone is like giving them only half a loaf of bread. The other half is personality and character development; crucially, how to get along with fellow students and family members. In achieving that 100%, can they not gain some grace of spirit? Peace education in schools is misunderstood as something to do with seeking the silence of a cave. It is rather about learning how to manage the emotional side of the self in a cooperative environment. Are we doing enough to guide the next generation?

18,2020/03/22,When medicine loses the healing ‘touch’,"When physical examination becomes obsolete, the doctor-patient relationship sags

In September 2016, the American Medical Association held a funeral service to physical examination. Medical imaging is gradually replacing the age-old conventional practice of history-taking and clinical examination. Our legendary and eminent gurus made bedside diagnosis just with history and physical examination (which includes percussion and auscultation), which was confirmed by minimal investigations available those days. Sometimes, even without investigations, their diagnosis was accurate.

With the burial of physical examination, patients need not be touched or examined and can be straightaway subjected to a battery of investigations suggested by algorithms. The physician thus loses the thought process and judgment and can bid farewell to the stethoscope as auscultation will be redundant. It won’t be long before robots will replace the physician and take the history and feed it in the computer and print out the investigations required. The physician needs to give only the prescription.

Now, skin patches monitor real-time blood glucose levels, automatic blood pressure recorders display the readings on mobile phones and electronic loop recorders monitor heart rhythms round the clock through telemetry. Many scans are reported online from distant locations without examining the patient.

During practical examinations for trainees, it was customary for the examiners to ask for provisional diagnosis soon after the history. Again after physical examination, the examinee is assessed for his or her capability of arriving at a reasonable diagnosis. With the burial of physical examination, is it necessary for the trainees to be subjected to such a rigorous assessment? Training physicians to make diagnosis without physicals is like teaching algebra and calculus without teaching division and multiplication. Similarly, a musical exponent cannot achieve perfection without learning basic notes and ragas.

E-patient

When physical examination becomes obsolete, there won’t be any need to touch the patient. This will replace the age-old practice of doctor-patient relationship and it can be renamed a computer-patient relationship. Such a patient can be called an “e-patient”. This will defeat the concept of family physicians which still exists in our country. It is the touch of the physician which gives the healing effect to the patient, the so-called Hastavasi (the healing touch).

With the entombment of physical examination, is it necessary to increase the number of medical colleges and medical seats when the future is going to be dominated by computers and artificial intelligence? This aspect is debatable, and policy makers and health-care providers must give a serious thought to this.

I predict, however, that the buried “physical examination” will definitely have a resurrection.

19,2020/03/22,"Coronavirus | The worst of times, the best of times","COVID-19 has put the fear of death in many of us. But while some find the prospects frightening, it’s frightfully attractive for others.

Like all good citizens, let us behave responsibly. To begin with, it is the worst of times, it is the best of times, but it is the age of wisdom, to paraphrase Charles Dickens.

It is the best of times for couch potatoes; they can indulge in inactivity without any sense of guilt. Children should be happy about early closing of school. A nephew working in Singapore has come home to India as his office instructed him to “work from home”.

Prices of petrol and diesel have crashed along with the Sensex. Spouses are getting “isolated”; some may like it. Chicken is selling at a price lower than onion’s. Inflation is down. Travel and other restrictions will not only help narrow the current account deficit but also boost individual and family savings. Foreign exchange reserves are at a high, though the rupee has plummeted against the dollar.

India has become the fifth country to isolate the virus SARS-CoV-2, which would help develop drugs, vaccine and rapid-test kits. Indian steel and leather industries see a silver lining. Masks are becoming a fashion statement.

Collaborative tools such as MS Team, Zoom, Google Hangout, et al have surged. Universities and other institutions of higher education can start courses in “social distancing”, with online options, of course, and churn out innovative Ph.D. theses on esoteric topics, such as “Is one metre enough?’

Namaste (Trump, or ‘no trump’), the traditional Indian greeting, has become a global favourite. Roads are much less crowded, and the air is cleaner. Though it is a bit ironical that the ancient Indian civilisation is being educated on hand wash, it may come as a big boost to the Swachh Bharat campaign.

My wife and I have happily cancelled our 50th wedding anniversary celebrations, and nobody minds it.

22,2020/03/22,Guinea referendum to extend President Alpha Conde’s rule,"Residents vote despite COVID-19 scare

Despite the threat of COVID-19 and an Opposition boycott, a constitutional referendum was held in Guinea on Sunday that opponents of President Alpha Conde fear could allow him to govern for 12 more years.

Opposition supporters heeding a call to disrupt the referendum and simultaneous legislative election attacked several polling stations in the capital Conakry, delaying the start of voting in some districts.

Security forces were quick to contain the pockets of unrest and there was no immediate report of significant casualties. The Opposition boycott all but ensures the new basic law will be approved when results are announced in the coming days, despite the risk it could trigger wider unrest that would, along with COVID-19, threaten Guinea’s mining economy.

With the first two cases of the COVID-19 disease recorded in the country, some polling stations required voters to wash their hands before casting their ballot and radio stations reminded citizens to keep their distance from one another. “Even if people are aware (of the coronavirus risk), that won’t stop those who want to come out and vote. I’m trying not to stand too close to others because you never know,” said 26-year-old student Ndeye Toure after voting.

Packed polling stations

At some polling stations, a large turnout meant crowds were squeezed in line to vote, according to a Reuters witness. Few people wore masks. Mr. Conde, 81, has refused to rule out using a new Constitution as a reset button on his mandate, which expires in December, citing other African countries as examples of where leaders have extended their rule.

The referendum, originally scheduled for March 1, was postponed because international observers raised concerns about the electoral register. The confirmation of COVID-19 raised speculation last week the polls could be further delayed, but the authorities have stuck to the schedule despite banning other large gatherings to prevent the spread of the disease.

The new Constitution would impose a limit of two six-year terms, up from the current two five-year terms. It does not specify whether terms served under the previous constitution would count, but Mr. Conde has suggested they would not.

23,2020/03/22,COVID-19 | Can China’s model work for the West?,"Its top-down approach may be difficult to replicate

The head of the World Health Organization believes China’s battle with COVID-19 offers a beacon of hope, but others question whether Beijing’s strategy can be followed by other countries — particularly Western democracies.

China has reported only one new local infection over the past four days, a seemingly remarkable turnaround given the chaos that surrounded the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan. While some experts caution against accepting Beijing’s figures at face value, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted China’s success “provides hope for the rest of the world”.

But China is a particular case — a centrally-controlled, top-down, one-party authoritarian state that allows no dissent and can mobilise vast resources on a single issue. In January, China effectively shut down Wuhan and placed its 11 million residents in effective quarantine — a move it then replicated in the rest of Hubei province, putting 50 million people in mass isolation. Hundreds of millions of Chinese live in closed residential complexes where neighbourhood committees can police movement in and out — meaning compliance could be closely monitored.

“Containment works,” said Sharon Lewin, professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne. “Two weeks after the closure of Wuhan, which is exactly the incubation period, the number (of infections) started to drop.” Extreme social distancing and home quarantines have been used to differing degrees by a rising number of European countries, with some U.S. States following suit. But an Imperial College London study warned that while that strategy appeared to have succeeded to date in China, it carried “enormous social and economic costs” in the short and long term.

“The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package... will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more),” it said.

If the intervention is relaxed, transmission rates “will quickly rebound”, it added.

‘Collapse’ under the strain

At least 42,000 doctors and medical personnel were sent to Hubei province to shore up the province’s health services which had, according to public health professor Zheng Zijie from Peking University, essentially “collapsed” under the strain of the fast-spreading epidemic. Health experts from China’s Red Cross are currently helping overwhelmed hospitals in Italy, which has fast overtaken China as the worst hit country in terms of virus deaths.

China’s ability to mobilise small armies of medical workers did not come with protection from contagion. More than 3,300 medical staff were infected across the country and 13 have died from COVID-19, according to Health Ministry figures published early March. Government efforts in China were backed by an arsenal of propaganda, with messages repeated incessantly in the media and large street banners calling on citizens to be hygienic and stay home.

In an extraordinary effort -— trumpeted by state media — two new hospitals with a total capacity of 2,300 beds were built in Wuhan within 10 days. In cities, it quickly became necessary to wear a mask as apartment blocks, businesses and even parks barred entry without one. Widespread mask use may have helped slow the spread of the disease, “particularly when there are so many asymptomatic virus carriers”, Mr. Zheng said.

During the crisis, China produced up to 1.6 million N95 respirator masks per day, according to the official Xinhua news agency. These are considered the most effective protection, but need to fit correctly and be changed often. To boost detection rates, temperature checkpoints were installed outside buildings and shops, or in public places.“If it’s higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius (99.1 Fahrenheit), you are put in isolation,” said one guard at the entrance to a park in Beijing. And in the high-tech country where privacy is limited, many localities require citizens to show a QR code on their phone that rates them as “green”, “yellow” or “red”.

This assessment — based on tracking of whether they visited a high-risk zone — is now an entrance requirement for many businesses. Government announcements have made clear that the coding system will remain in use in some form even after the pandemic subsides.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6kfyrm/article31136787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23-CHINA-WUHAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-can-chinas-model-work-for-the-west/article31136788.ece

Speaking in a televised address, Ayatollah Khameini charged in a message directed at Washington: “No one trusts you. You are capable of bringing into our country a drug that will keep the virus alive and prevent its eradication.”

Iran has been one of the countries worst hit by the COVID-19 illness along with Italy, Spain and China, and the latest fatalities raised the official death toll to 1,685, the health ministry said.

More than 1,028 new cases in the past 24 hours meant a total of 21,638 people had now tested positive for the virus, said ministry spokesman Kianouche Jahanpour.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on February 29 that Washington was ready to help Iran fight the virus if its leaders requested it.

But Khamenei reiterated Iran's rejection, charging that Washington, which whom it has had no diplomatic relations for more than 40 years, was “capable” of wanting to intensify the epidemic in the Islamic republic.

‘Most vicious enemy’

“Today America is our most ferocious and vicious enemy,” Khamenei said in his address to the nation.

“The American leaders are liars, manipulators, impudent and greedy ... They are charlatans,” he said, also labelling them “absolutely ruthless” and “terrorists”.

The American proposals “to help us with medicines and treatments, provided we ask for them, are strange”, he said, noting that the United States itself suffers from “a horrible shortage not only of disease prevention equipment but also of medicines”.

Speaking to Washington, he added: “If you have something, use it for yourself.”

Khamenei advised Iranians that “everyone should follow the instructions” of the authorities to fight the epidemic “so that Almighty God will put an end to this calamity for the Iranian people, for all Muslim nations and for all mankind”.

The ministry's Jahanpour said Tehran province had reported 249 new cases and the central province of Yazd, where 84 new patients had been counted, “could become a new focus of the disease in the coming days”.

To limit the spread of the virus, the authorities have asked people to refrain from travelling during the current Persian New Year celebrations.

In Iran “about 68 percent of deaths from COVID-19 disease are people over 60 years of age”, Jahanpour said, stressing that family trips “are generally risk factors for this age group”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-iran-rejects-united-states-aid-offer/article31136730.ece

26,2020/03/22,Air quality is picking up in quarantined countries,"NO2 is mainly produced by vehicles, industrial sites and thermal power stations.

Air quality is improving in countries under COVID-19 quarantines, experts say, but it is far too early to speak of long-term change.

Images by the U.S. space agency NASA are clear, in February the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fell dramatically in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, passing from an indicator that was red/orange to blue.

NO2 is mainly produced by vehicles, industrial sites and thermal power stations.

As China moves past the peak of its crisis, however, recent images by the European Space Agency (ESA) show a resurgence in NO2 emissions.

A striking reduction has also been observed by the ESA in northern Italy, which has been locked down to fight a spread of the novel coronavirus.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) reports a similar change in Barcelona and Madrid, where Spanish authorities issued confinement orders in mid March.

‘Dramatic drop-off’

“NO2 is a short-lived pollutant, with a lifetime in the atmosphere of about one day,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, from the EU earth surveillance programme Copernicus.

“As a result, this pollutant stays near the emissions sources and can be used as a proxy of the intensity of activity in different sectors,” he told AFP.

Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, noted the change in China, saying: “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event.”

Even during the economic crisis more than a decade ago, the decrease in NO2 levels “was more continuous in time,” according to EEA air quality specialist Alberto Gonzalez Ortiz.

In northern Italy, “average NO2 concentration levels have been almost halved on average,”Mr. Peuch remarked.

The pollutant can provoke serious inflammation of the respiratory system.

Confinement measures thus protect in two ways, by reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection and by easing pollution from road traffic, according to a group of French doctors.

It is nonetheless hard to know how much benefit the world’s population will actually experience because, according to the health experts, “what will have more impact is the long term exposure,” Mr. Gonzalez Ortiz said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/55aa3i/article31136420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Madrid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/air-quality-is-picking-up-in-quarantined-countries/article31136424.ece

From Italy to India to the United States, governments rolled out tougher measures to halt the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic as global cases surged past 3,00,000 on March 22 and Asia braced for a possible second wave of infections.

Nearly one billion people are already confined to their homes around the world as countries race to contain the ballooning outbreak by imposing unprecedented lockdown measures, shutting shops and businesses and sealing borders.

Coronavirus | El Salvador govt. places country under 30-day quarantine

The pandemic has sparked fears of a global recession, prompting governments to unleash gigantic emergency measures to avoid an economic meltdown.

More than 12,000 people have died from the virus worldwide, with the situation increasingly grim in Italy, the new epicentre of the disease which first emerged in central China late last year before marching across the globe.

Countries in Asia now worry infections could once again mount on their shores as travellers return from badly-hit parts of Europe, a continent under siege by the pandemic, with more than 1,50,000 declared cases.

Italy has now reported more deaths than mainland China and third-placed Iran combined, and it has a death rate of 8.6 percent among confirmed COVID-19 infections -- significantly higher than in most other countries.

The death toll in the Mediterranean nation of 60 million spiked to more than 4,800 — over a third of the global total.

Lockdown measures have done little to stem new infections and deaths and the government announced the closure of all non-essential factories in a late-night TV address.

Police patrolled the deserted streets of Rome Sunday, while checks were also carried out on beaches after local officials complained people were defying orders to catch some time in the sun.

In his weekly prayer — now being streamed live to avoid crowds gathering — the Pope urged all Italians to follow isolation measures.

“Let us do the things that the government asks us to do for the good of us all,” Pope Francis said.

'Accelerating' U.K. cases

Similar shut-in measures have been rolled out in badly-hit Spain and France, where helicopters and drones were being deployed to ensure crowds do not gather in parks or along river banks.

Spain saw a sharp spike in deaths again on March 22 — a 30% rise bringing total fatalities to 1,720 — while France saw its death toll mount to 562 on March 21.

Britain is also ramping up its response in the wake of steadily rising cases and deaths after the government was criticised for failing to take stricter measures sooner.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday urged 1.5 million people most at risk from the virus to stay home, as he warned the numbers of infections and deaths “are very stark, and they are accelerating”.

Pubs, restaurants, theatres and leisure centres had already been closed across the country, and the government said it could give police, public health and immigration officers extra powers to contain the outbreak.

Delhi deserted

China reported its first local infection in four days on March 22. While the number of cases in the mainland has slumped dramatically since the crisis began, there are fears in Asia of “imported” cases from other hotspots like Europe.

Thailand reported its highest daily rise in cases, taking its total to nearly 600, while Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia have also reported a spike in cases after numbers had plateaued earlier.

Millions of people in India were confined to their homes on March 22 as the country went into lockdown with a one-day nationwide “self-imposed curfew”.

Normally bustling streets in the capital New Delhi and the financial hub of Mumbai were mostly deserted and most shops shuttered.

“If this helps stop the spread, then the government can think of extending it for two to three more days,” said Jaiveer Singh, a security guard at Delhi's Lodhi Gardens park, largely empty on March 22.

Tighter restrictions are now in place elsewhere in Asia, with Australia shutting its borders to foreigners and non-residents and Pakistan suspending international flights.

'Months, not weeks'

More than a third of Americans were meanwhile adjusting to life in various phases of lockdown, including in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Other parts of the United States are expected to ramp up restrictions as well.

“This is a time of shared national sacrifice, but also a time to treasure our loved ones,” U.S. President Donald Trump said. “We're going to have a great victory.”

New Jersey on March 21 followed several states in telling residents to stay indoors.

In neighbouring New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that the disruption is likely to last for months, not weeks.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved the first coronavirus test that can be conducted entirely at the point of care for a patient — and deliver results in 45 minutes.

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife tested negative for the coronavirus, his press secretary tweeted on March 21. The couple had taken the test after one of Mr. Pence's staffers contracted the illness.

Stimulus measures

The pandemic has bludgeoned global stock markets, and the United States — the world's biggest economy — is preparing a huge emergency stimulus package that could top $1 trillion.

Several European countries have already announced their own stimulus packages to stave off economic collapse.

The coronavirus has infected more than 1,100 across Africa too, where healthcare systems are limited and social distancing measures are difficult in crowded cities.

28,2020/03/22,"Cornavirus: Pakistan PM Imran Khan rules out complete lockdown, says it will create chaos","Pakistan PM Imran Khan said the coronavirus situation in Pakistan does not call for a lockdown yet

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on March 22 ruled out complete lockdown in the country, saying it will create chaos and urged people to self-quarantine to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has so far claimed four lives and infected 646 people in the country.

Addressing the nation as cases of the novel coronavirus surged across the country, Mr. Khan reiterated that lockdown will create chaos as more than 25% people were living below the poverty line and their lives will be shattered.

He said the situation in Pakistan does not call for a lockdown yet.

“Let me first tell you what a complete lockdown is. It means imposing a curfew and locking people in their homes,” said Mr. Khan.

We cannot afford complete lockdown as it will create massive unrest, he said, adding that the situation in the country is not as bad as in Italy or France.

If the condition was similar to that of Italy, I would have imposed a lockdown, he said.

He urged the people to follow the policy of self-isolation and stay inside their homes. He said the government was constantly watching the situation and all necessary measures will be taken accordingly.

The government on March 21 suspended all international flights for two weeks and curtailed train services to curb the spread of the virus, which has turned into a major global crisis.

Official data issued by National Disaster Management Authority showed at least 646 confirmed coronavirus cases.

On March 21, the public relations officer (PRO) to the Sindh Health Minister told the media that the number of COVID-19 patients in the Province has surged to 392. Throughout the day, the local media outlets quoted the new figures which took the nationwide tally of COVID-19 patients to 745.

The massive spike in numbers created alarm and sent the people panicking. However, late in the night the PRO revised the figures downwards to 292 citing a counting error.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on March 22 confirmed third death to the novel coronavirus in the Province, bringing the country’s tally of COVID-19 fatalities to four.

Addressing a news conference, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government Spokesperson Ajmal Wazir said a woman who tested positive for the virus had passed away on March 21. She had recently returned from Iran.

The Provincial governments in Balochistan, Punjab Sindh requested deployment of the armed forces in the wake of a surge in novel coronavirus cases across the country.

However, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced to lockdown the Province from midnight.

Sindh has witnessed more cases of coronavirus than any other part of the country with nearly 300 patients.

He said that all offices will be closed and gatherings banned. Additionally, those who are not required to, will not be allowed to go outside in public.

The Punjab government has written a letter to the Interior Ministry asking for the deployment of the Army to help deal with the coronavirus situation in the Province, where over 150 people have been infected with virus.

Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar said the army’s help was needed to ensure lockdown in the Province, where over 150 people have tested positive.

Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court on March 21, seeking directions to the federal and provincial governments for effectively dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

Petitioners requested the court to order the federal government to declare a national public health emergency across the country, establish an emergency relief fund, and order utilisation of the dam fund for combating the dreadful virus, the News reported.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cornavirus-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-rules-out-complete-lockdown-says-it-will-create-chaos/article31135394.ece

30,2020/03/22,"Strong quake shakes Croatia, damaging buildings in capital","Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years.

A strong earthquake shook Croatia and its capital on March 22, causing panic, the evacuation of hospitals and widespread damage — including to the city’s iconic cathedral — all amid a partial coronavirus lockdown.

A 15-year-old was reported in critical condition and several others were injured, news outlets reported.

The European seismological agency, EMSC, said the earthquake measured 5.3 and struck a wide area north of the capital, Zagreb, at 6-23 a.m. (0523 GMT) on March 22. The epicenter was 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Zagreb at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles).

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years.

Many buildings in the capital cracked and walls and rooftops were damaged. Downtown streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances.

Footage from the scene showed mothers dressed in nightgowns hugging their newborn babies in a parking lot as they evacuated a damaged maternity hospital amid freezing temperatures. The women, newborn babies and incubators were being moved to a new location with the help of the army.

Zagreb’s iconic cathedral was also damaged, with the top of one of its two spires collapsing. The cathedral was rebuilt after it toppled in the 1880 earthquake.

Power was cut as people ran out of their homes. Several fires were also reported. At least two other tremors were recorded later. Residents shared photos of belongings falling off shelves, broken bottles and glass inside homes.

Officials first said a 15-year-old was killed, but doctors later said that she is in critical condition and that they are fighting for her life. They gave no immediate details on the extent of other injuries.

The earthquake struck amid a partial lockdown of the capital because of the spread of the coronavirus. People were told to avoid public areas, such as parks and public squares, but had little choice as they fled their residences.

Up to five people are allowed to be together while keeping distance.

The Prime Minister urged the citizens to remain calm and stay outside their homes in the central parts of Zagreb, which sustained the most damage.

“We have two parallel crisis that contradict each other,” Mr. Plenkovic said after an emergency meeting of Croatia’s top officials.

Croatia’s army and all emergency services will start clearing the streets as soon as possible, while assessment will start of the damage at the same time.

“We will try to clear the streets as soon as possible,” he said. “Stay outside your homes and keep distance.”

Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said the situation was complicated by the restrictive virus-related measures in place.

“There are rules for when there is an earthquake, but when there is an earthquake at the same time when there is a global pandemic, then it’s a much more complex situation.” Mr. Bozinovic told the state HINA news agency.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uzn1lg/article31134792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CROATIAEARTHQUAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/strong-quake-shakes-croatia-damaging-buildings-in-capital/article31134793.ece

32,2020/03/22,"Coronavirus | Australia adds $38 billion in stimulus, States move to tighten lockdown steps","NSW, Victoria to shut down non-essential activities

Australia's government will spend additional A$66.4 billion ($38.50 billion) as part of a second stimulus package to shelter the economy from the financial impact of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday, as States moved to impose major lockdowns.

The new stimulus will go to individuals in need and small and medium-sized businesses. Those businesses produce about a third of the country's annual economic output and employ more than 40% of the workforce, according to government statistics.

“We will be focusing on those in the front line, those who will be feeling the first blows of the economic impact of the coronavirus,” Mr. Morrison said in Canberra on Sunday. “There will be more packages and more support.”

The package, which dwarfs the A$17.6 billion ($10.20 billion) in initial measures announced last week, came with a pledge by the government to enforce social distancing rules after many Australians appeared to disregard health warnings and flocked to pubs and beaches amid a warm autumn spell.

After an initial relatively slow spread, the number of coronavirus infections in Australia has been rising quickly in recent days, climbing to 1,098 confirmed cases as of Sunday morning with seven recorded deaths linked to COVID-19.

Mr. Morrison said that the government would help underwrite loans to small and medium-sized businesses and boost unemployment benefits as companies are forced to lay off staff.

Jobseekers will get extra money and people in financial stress will also be able access up to A$10,000 tax-free of their pension funds for this and next year, while some not-for-profits and small businesses will have access to cash grants to keep staff employed.

Together with more than A$100 billion announced earlier in emergency banking measures to prevent a credit freeze and the initial stimulus package, Australia has now announced financial measures equalling about 10% of the country's annual gross domestic product, the government said.

“The degree of stimulus released in such a short period of time highlights the scale of the looming demand shock (due to both containment measures, as well as business and consumer confidence),” economists at the National Australia Bank said in a note.

“Some industries have effectively suffered instant downturns, with some already in recession.”

While mineral-rich Australia has enjoyed a near 30-year stellar economic run and passed through the global financial crisis without falling into recession, economists are now forecasting a sharp pull-back in spending.

“It is impossible to stop a recession because people are staying at home and are not spending, but this minimises the collateral damage where lots of companies go bust and the recession ends up being a lot deeper,” AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver told Reuters.

One of Australia's largest employers, Qantas Airways , last week said it would put 20,000 employees on leave as the virus has devastated the airline industry with scores of countries closing their borders.

Draconian measures

Mr. Morrison said on Sunday States and territories would start considering “draconian” measures to enforce social distancing in a policy that will be discussed by the conservative government later on Sunday.

The governments of Australia's of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, where more than half of Australians live, said they will impose major lockdowns next week closing restaurants and many shops.

“Tonight I will be informing the national cabinet that NSW will proceed to a more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services,” NSW Prime Minister Gladys Berejiklian said. “This will take place over the next 48 hours.”

South Australia and Western Australia on Sunday followed similar action in the Northern Territory and Tasmania last week, saying they will close their borders to restrict movement of people.

The Australian Football League (AFL), which has been reluctant to suspend its games, said on Sunday the 2020 top flight Australian rules season will pause until the end of May.

The four-day Islamic gathering held at a mosque near the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is connected to 60% of all the 1,183 cases in the country - the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia, which has a total of more than 3,000 cases.

Malaysia has also recorded eight deaths.

The government said on Thursday that it had yet to trace 4,000 of the 14,500 Malaysian residents who attended. The health ministry said on Saturday it expected the number of cases to spike next week as it tried to track down unscreened participants of the Feb. 27-March 1 religious event.

“After hearing reports of thousands or participants yet to be screened, many had returned to their district health departments or hospitals repeatedly until their names and details were recorded,” Abdullah Cheong, a leader of the event's organising team, said in a statement on Saturday.

“We are prepared and have given our full commitment to help the authorities deal with the pandemic.”

He also said 12,500 people attended the gathering, including foreigners and 200 Rohingya refugees. Previous reports have put the number at 16,000.

37,2020/03/22,N. Korea says Trump’s letter offers anti-virus cooperation,"The latest correspondence came as Mr. Kim observed the firing of tactical guided weapons over the weekend, drawing criticism from South Korea, as the nuclear talks remain deadlocked.

President Donald Trump sent a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, seeking to maintain good relations and offering cooperation in fighting the viral pandemic, Kim’s sister said Sunday.

The latest correspondence came as Mr. Kim observed the firing of tactical guided weapons over the weekend, drawing criticism from South Korea, as the nuclear talks remain deadlocked.

In a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency, Mr. Kim’s sister and senior ruling party official, Ms. Kim Yo Jong, praised Mr. Trump for sending the letter at a time when “big difficulties and challenges lie ahead in the way of developing ties” between the countries.

In the letter, she said Mr. Trump explained his plan to “propel the relations between the two countries ... and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work” in an apparent reference to the global coronavirus outbreak. She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump’s letter.

North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn’t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil. Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure. Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea’s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North.

There was no immediate comment from the White House.

Ms. Kim Yo Jong said Trump’s letter is “a good example showing the special and firm personal relations” between the North Korean and U.S. leaders. But she said it’s not a good idea to “make hasty conclusion or be optimistic about” the prospect for bilateral relations.

""In my personal opinion, I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries,” she said. “Even at this moment we are working hard to develop and defend ourselves on our own under the cruel environment which the U.S. is keen to ‘provide.’”

Earlier, Mr. Trump sent birthday greetings to Mr. Kim Jong Un, who was believed to have turned 36 on Jan. 8. Senior North Korean official Kim Kye Gwan said at the time that the birthday messages won’t lead his country to return to talks unless the U.S. accepts its demands.

Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they launched talks on the fate of Mr. Kim’s advancing nuclear arsenal. The two leaders have avoided harsh language against each other and Mr. Trump once said he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.”

But their diplomacy has largely come to a standstill since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, when Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Kim’s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for a partial disarmament step.

Mr. Kim pressed Mr. Trump to come up with new proposals to salvage the negotiations by the end of last year. Kim later vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent, unveil “a new strategic weapon” and warned he would no longer be bound by a major weapons test moratorium.

In recent weeks, North Korea has fired a slew of artillery and other rockets into the sea in what experts say is an attempt to improve its military capabilities. The weapons were all short range and did not pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. A resumption of long-range missile or nuclear weapons tests by Kim would likely completely scuttle diplomacy with Trump, experts say.

KCNA said Kim watched the test firing of tactical guided weapons on Saturday with Kim Yo Jong and other top officials. South Korea’s military called the demonstration “very inappropriate” at a time when the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.

South Korea’s military said Saturday it detected two presumed short-range ballistic missiles that flew from a site in western North Korea across the country and landed in the waters off the east coast. The weapons flew 410 km, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9ggfzr/article30326341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREAUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n-korea-says-trumps-letter-offers-anti-virus-cooperation/article31133558.ece

Ecuador's health and labor ministers resigned on Saturday, just hours after officials announced the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus had shot up to over 500 in the country.

The government declared a state of emergency on Monday, prohibiting travelers from entering and imposing a night-time curfew along with other measures to restrict internal movement in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.

40,2020/03/22,"38 positive for coronavirus in NYC jails, including Rikers","More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States — more than anywhere in the world — and there are growing fears that an outbreak could spread rapidly through a vast network of federal and state prisons, county jails and detention centers.

At least 38 people have tested positive for coronavirus in New York City jails, including at the notorious Rikers Island jail complex, the board that oversees the city’s jail system said Saturday.

In a letter to criminal justice leaders, Board of Correction interim chairwoman Jacqueline Sherman wrote that at least 58 other people were currently being monitored in contagious disease and quarantine units.

""It is likely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over recent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody and staff,” Ms. Sherman warned, predicting a sharp rise in the number of infections.

""The best path forward to protecting the community of people housed and working in the jails is to rapidly decrease the number of people housed and working in them.”

In the past six days, she wrote, the board learned that at least 12 Department of Correction employees, five Correctional Health Services employees, and 21 inmates have tested positive for the virus.

The city’s jail agency and its city-run healthcare provider did not respond to messages seeking comment on the letter. On Friday, the city’s Department of Corrections said just one inmate had been diagnosed with coronavirus, along with seven jail staff members.

New York has consistently downplayed the number of infections, has found in conversations with current and former inmates.

More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States - more than anywhere in the world - and there are growing fears that an outbreak could spread rapidly through a vast network of federal and state prisons, county jails and detention centers.

It’s a tightly packed, fluid population that is already grappling with high rates of health problems and, when it comes to the elderly and the infirm, elevated risks of serious complications. With limited capacity nationally to test for COVID-19, men and women inside worry that they are last in line when showing flu-like symptoms, meaning that some may be infected without knowing it.

The first positive tests from inside prisons and jails started tricking out just over a week ago, with less than two dozen officers and staff infected in other facilities from California and Michigan to Pennsylvania.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and even death.

The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2iy42j/article31133495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKINMATES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/38-positive-for-coronavirus-in-nyc-jails-including-rikers/article31133496.ece
41,2020/03/22,"Confined by virus, Frenchman runs marathon on his balcony","Nochomovitz had been training for a marathon, and said “I needed to assure myself that I could still run 40 km whatever the condition.”

In the age of confinement, Elisha Nochomovitz figured out a way to run a marathon anyway back and forth on his balcony.

That’s right. He ran 42.2 kilometers (26.2 miles) straight, never leaving his 7-meter-long (23-foot) balcony.

Like athletes who ran around their Wuhan apartments or cyclists who found ways to train in their locked-down Abu Dhabi hotel rooms, Nochomovitz wanted to show others that it’s possible to stay fit as virus containment measures tighten around the world.

But he did it.

Technically the French authorities still allow people to go outside for “individual sports” like running, if they sign a special form explaining why.

But the number of joggers in French streets has multiplied in recent days, amid exceptionally balmy weather. And that has authorities worried that too many people are still out in the streets, threatening efforts to contain the virus.

""If everyone thinks the same way and does the same thing, we’ll all find ourselves outside and that won’t help anything, and the message that we need to stay confined at home will have had no impact,” he said.

Nochomovitz had been training for a marathon, and said “I needed to assure myself that I could still run 40 km whatever the condition.”

""I thought about many things, what’s going to happen, when I see that the world has stopped, sports, economy, finance,” he said. “We learned in history about wars between nations, men and weapons, but this is something that is beyond us.”

And he had a key helper. “I had my girlfriend here who was giving me drinks and M&Ms.”

42,2020/03/22,China sees continued rise in imported coronavirus cases,"While China has drastically reduced the number of reported domestically transmitted cases - the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days - it is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly from Chinese people returning from abroad.

China on Sunday reported 46 new cases of coronavirus, the fourth straight day with an increase, with all but one of those cases imported from overseas, according to the country's National Health Commission.

While China has drastically reduced the number of reported domestically transmitted cases - the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days - it is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly from Chinese people returning from abroad.

On Saturday, China reported 41 new coronavirus cases for the previous day, all of them imported.

Among the new cases from abroad, a record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai and 13 were in the capital Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day.

The latest figures bring China's total reported coronavirus cases to 81,054, with 3,261 deaths, including six on Saturday.

The central province of Hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital city of Wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases.

The new locally-transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to Guangdong province.

Globally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the number of deaths in Italy recently surpassing those in China.

China has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down Hubei province and more recently stepping up measures to screen and quarantine overseas arrivals.

The country is trying to restart an economy that is widely expected to contract deeply in the current quarter, with life slowly returning to normal in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, albeit with everyone wearing masks in public.

Still, numerous shops and restaurants remain shut - many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity.

“Now I think the epidemic has been controlled. But this definitely doesn't mean that it's over,” said a 25-year-old woman surnamed He who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast Summer Palace complex in Beijing on Saturday.

A statement from the communities department outlined the time frame the government wanted the most vulnerable to follow.

""People identified as belonging to one or more of the at-risk groups will be contacted by their GP practice, specialist or both strongly advising them to stay at home for a period of at least 12 weeks.""

A dedicated phone line and arrangements to deliver groceries or medicines will also be announced.

Paul Johnstone, director of Public Health England, said those contacted should ""not go out for shopping, for leisure or for travel"".

Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab asked the security forces on Saturday to enforce stricter measures to keep people at home and prevent gatherings to rein in the coronavirus outbreak.

He called on the Lebanese to go out only if absolutely necessary and warned that the rising number of infections ”foreshadows an imminent danger threatening society.”

47,2020/03/22,"Mir, the first modular space station","The first modular space station to be assembled in orbit, Mir served as a space laboratory for over 14 years. Before its planned re-entry and destruction on March 23, 2001, Mir had hosted over 100 astronauts from 12 countries. A.S.Ganesh takes a look at the space station that was a first of its kind...

The International Space Station (ISS) is a habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit. A joint effort by participating space agencies, ISS serves as a space environment research laboratory. In terms of design, the ISS belongs to the third generation that allows modules to be added or removed from the existing structure, thereby allowing for greater flexibility.

The three generations

The first generation of space stations such as Soviet Union’s Salyut 1 and the U.S. Skylab had monolithic designs that consisted of one module with no resupply capability. The second generation of space stations, such as Soviet Union’s Salyut 6 and Salyut 7, consisted of a monolithic station, but with ports to allow resupply cargo spacecraft. The third generation, which are called modular space stations and now includes the ISS, correspond to those with more than one primary spacecraft that are launched independently and docked in space.

Soviet Union’s Mir space station marked the beginning of the third generation of space station design. The name “Mir” can be translated from Russian to mean “peace”, “world” or “village” – an apt choice for a space station that hosted people of various nationalities.

Different modules

On February 20, 1986, the assembly process began with the launch of Mir’s core module into orbit. Kvant 1 (1987), an astrophysics laboratory; Kvant 2 (1989), an augmentation module containing supplementary life-support equipment; Kristall (1990), a technology module that served as a materials-sciences lab; Spektr (1995), a power module that also allowed for remote observation of Earth’s environment; a docking module (1995); and Priroda (1996), Earth sensing module for experimenting with remote sensing; were the different modules launched and added to Mir over a decade.

Mir, however, started hosting humans even as more and more modules were added to it. Starting from March 1986, when the first crew docked with Mir, up until June 2000, when the last occupants left the space station, Mir received crew members from a number of expeditions. During its 15-year space flight, Mir played host to over 100 people from 12 different countries.

Exceeds expectations

When the Mir space station was designed and launched, it was built for a five-year life span. The Soviet Union broke down and Mir was operated by the new Russian Federal Space Agency after 1991, but it endured for almost another decade.

A series of problems, both technical and structural, caught up with Mir as years went on. Despite these failures and some accidents, it remained in operation. It was only in November 2000 that the Russian government decided to decommission the space station.

Planned re-entry

On January 24, 2001, a Russian Progress cargo ship carrying double the normal amount of fuel rendezvoused with Mir. Once the docking took place, Progress fired its thrusters to push the station into a controlled descent, thereby utilising the extra fuel.

On March 23, 2001, Mir ceased to exist as it broke up in the Earth’s atmosphere upon re-entry. Airlines rerouted their Pacific flights and ships were warned ahead as a safety precaution. It proved to be unnecessary as the debris that did not burn up crashed into the south Pacific Ocean at the planned target zone, causing no harm to anyone.

On March 23, 1996, U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid transferred to Mir from the space shuttle Atlantis for a planned five-month stay.

The first American woman to live in a space station, Lucid was also the first U.S. astronaut on an extended stay on the Mir.

As a biochemist, Lucid carried out a number of scientific experiments aboard Mir during her stay.

Her return was delayed owing to a number of reasons. She eventually made her return flight, again on Atlantis, and was back on Earth on September 26, 1996.

49,2020/03/22,Janata Curfew total in Thiruvananthapuram during early hours,"Both the Thiruvananthapuram Central and the KSRTC Central bus station in Thampanoor have remained virtually closed.

Paying heed to the Prime Minister’s clarion call to remain indoors, the Kerala capital largely wore a deserted look during the initial hours of the nationwide Janata Curfew on March 22.

Despite being no stranger to hartals, Thiruvananthapuram witnessed scenes unlike any seen in recent times. Both the Thiruvananthapuram Central and the KSRTC Central bus station in Thampanoor, a major transit hub in the State, have remained virtually closed. Under normal circumstances, the area would be abuzz with activity even on hartal days, with private vehicles and auto-rickshaws passing by the area largely unobstructed. Besides, the police also conducted shuttle bus services to transport commuters to the Government Medical College Hospital, the Regional Cancer Centre and the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology.

However, none of these could be seen here thus far on March 22, with only a handful of commuters, who were far outnumbered by media persons and police personnel, roaming around. While a few passenger trains reached the railway station during the early hours, no more have plied ever since. The KSRTC has announced that no services would be operated until the conclusion of the curfew at 9 p.m.

In adherence to the existing restrictions, Christian denominations have also exhorted its devotees to refrain from attending the Holy Mass. Only the Bishops, vicars, deacons and others involved in the conduct of the prayers could be seen in attendance. Most denominations have been webcasting the Holy Mass to enable the faithful to witness the prayers from within the confines of their homes. It could perhaps be for the first time that churches, few being a century-old, in the district have conducted their prayer services without the laity.

“Like millions of people all over the world, I’ve been staying safer at home for over a week now. I know a lot of people are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, & uncertain. Because of that, I want to offer some hope & gather thought leaders & people going through it to add some perspective. Which is why I FaceTimed @idriselba and his wife Sabrina who are safely quarantined together after he tested positive for COVID-19. Idris fills me in on his journey and Sabrina reveals the result of her test after they decided to quarantine together,” Winfrey posted.

In the episode, Elba, 47, said he has been dodging interviews with the press but wanted to talk to Winfrey as a “friend” because “journalistic approach to doing things like this is probably one of the best“.

About his decision to go public with his diagnosis, Elba said, “COVID-19 has come to a sort of pressure point right now but for the last two weeks, it’s been a talking point and I really felt that a lot of people didn’t know what was gonna come ... It didn’t really feel relatable. There were a bunch of theories going around: it’s a conspiracy! Is it even real?""

“And when I got tested and it came back positive, it became very real. It was always real for me but it became very real. And I just felt compelled to tell people this is very real. Someone like myself, in the public eye, can press a button and 30 million people will get a message the next day, I think is a really important component in the messaging around COVID-19 right now,” the actor said.

Sabrina, who sat besides Elba, said she has also been tested positive for COVID-19.

Throughout the series, Winfrey will continue to have remote conversations with experts and people facing challenges caused by the pandemic, which first originated in China and has so far claimed the lives of over 13,000 people.

Oprah Talks COVID-19 is now streaming and can be viewed on Apple TV Plus by its subscribers. People who don’t have a subscription can also watch the show on the streaming service’s application.

The show is part of Winfrey’s multi-million dollars deal with Apple for creating content for the company’s newly-launched streaming service.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/acohna/article31134146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OPRAHS2020VISIONTOUR-LA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/oprah-winfrey-launches-series-about-covid-19-talks-to-idris-elba-in-first-episode/article31134147.ece

52,2020/03/22,"Tribute to Banerjee | PK was like a walking encyclopedia, says Pius","Banerjee was a great motivator, says former SBT coach Najeeb

Former international striker Xavier Pius is among the few footballers from Kerala who were fortunate to be coached by the late P.K. Banerjee.

Pius, who was part of the hugely successful Premier Tyres football team, played a few seasons in Kolkata with Mohun Bagan in the late 70s and came under the tutelage of PK.

Culture change

Pius, who was one of the best strikers in the India during his playing days, recalls PK more as a friend than as a coach. “I was nervous when I landed in Kolkata in the ’70s. It was a big culture change for me.

“Those days players from outside Bengal didn’t mingle too much with the local players. Shyam Thapa, Ulaganathan and I were the outstation players and we were together most of the time. But before every match PK used to come to our room and would talk a lot to make us comfortable.

“He was like a walking encyclopedia, followed all sports and would tell us incidents from other games to motivate us.

Didn’t change our styles

“One day he would talk to us about boxing and the next day it would be tennis. He was very friendly. As we were all established players he never bothered to change our styles but he was good in getting the best out of us.

“I had a good rapport with Ulaganathan and our combination was deadly and we scored a lot of goals. The last time I met PK was in 2009 in Kolkata when he was recovering from a mild heart attack. The warmth was still there,” said Pius.

Former SBT coach N.M. Najeeb was another player who played under PK when he was with East Bengal during the 1979-80 season.

“The first thing which struck me was his simplicity. When I first addressed him as coach he insisted that I should call him as ‘PK da’. He was a great motivator and his man-management skills was superb and that was one reason why he was very successful as a coach,” said Najeeb.

“He took us out for dinner and sometimes used to invite the whole team to his place for food.

“He had great regard for my uncle Olympian Abdul Rahman who was his teammate at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.

“He would constantly remind me how good my uncle was and wanted me to be even better than him,” said Najeeb.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/tl42df/article31130529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22PIUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/tribute-to-banerjee-pk-was-like-a-walking-encyclopedia-says-pius/article31130530.ece
53,2020/03/22,College teachers clueless about scope for exercising ‘work from home’ option,"College managements have no clue whether or not the State Government would extend the ‘work from home’ concept for teachers as advocated by the University Grants Commission, to combat spread of novel coronavirus.

In a appeal to Vice-chancellors, D.P. Singh, Chairman, University Grants Commission, called for observance of necessary precautions in the hour of crisis.

Citing the loss of several lives worldwide and the increase in incidences of infection in India, Prof. D. P. Singh urged the institutions to take all possible measures to save lives.

In the wake of the instruction from the State Government to close down institutions, the universities and colleges had sent all the students from the hostels to their homes. However, the teachers were instructed to attend work.

Though the UGC Chairman's appeal for ‘work from home’ was addressed to all the Vice-Chancellors and principals of universities and colleges across the country, the State universities, according to a senior official of higher education department, will have to necessarily wait for a government order to that effect.

“We have so far received no communication from the State Government about letting teachers to work from home,” Vice-Chancellor of Bharathidasan University P. Manisankar said.

At the National Institute of Technology - Tiruchi, the teachers have understandably been told that they could work from home from March 23 until this month-end.

Students in the institute belonging to various States in the country were given an option to choose between going home or remaining in the hostels. Half the number of students have chosen to remain in the hostels, it is learnt.

Teachers, in general, are hoping against hope that the students who have been sent home would be complying with the social distancing requirement to prevent the spread of the viral infection.

There is also an opinion gaining ground that the institutions must be kept closed for a longer duration, at least by another fortnight.

“It is a question of total compliance. If the initiative is directed at breaking the cycle of the spread of the virus, a month of distancing is required. Else, even if a small section of students had not been careful enough, it would mean spread of the infection to a larger group,” a teacher pointed out.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/college-teachers-clueless-about-scope-for-exercising-work-from-home-option/article31136634.ece
54,2020/03/22,COVID 19 fear: Amma Canteens in Tiruchi too shut shop,"Attenders of patients at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital suffered

Heeding the call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a lock down from 7 am on 9 pm on Sunday, several canteens, food services shut shop, inconveniencing people, bachelors in particular.

Amma Canteens that serve the working class were locked up. Several visitors and attenders of patients at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital who used to depend on the Amma Canteen on Alithurai Road , next to the K. Abhishekapuram zonal office were left high and dry.

""We were told that the canteen would not be shut. We depend on it for food on a daily basis. We will have to look for other options now,"" said M. Durga, an attender who resides in Lalgudi. “I will have to rely on my relatives for lunch and dinner as well,” she added.

S. Sivasubramanian, City Corporation Commissioner said that no special order on the provision of food was given. “The night shelters in the city provide food for all. Those will remain open,” he said.

NGOs working with the homeless in the city will also be providing food over the next few weeks, he said.

Bachelors in the city had to resort to preparing their own meals or making ready-to-eat food for the day. S. Lokesh from Theni who works for a pharmaceutical company in the city said that popular brands make readymade mixes of tamarind, lemon and other varieties that can be combined with rice.

“All one has to do is boil rice and mix it with the powder. The situation is manageable,” he said.

With availability of free time, some even tried their hand at cooking. L. Aishwarya, a teacher said that with her busy daily schedule, she was unable to cook a proper meal.

“I depended on food delivery services or the canteen in the school I work at. Today, I made myself a nice meal with a variety of vegetables,” she said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/nzjpen/article31136535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY23AMMATRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-fear-amma-canteens-in-tiruchi-too-shut-shop/article31136536.ece

58,2020/03/22,22 air passengers quarantined at Kallikudi,"Eight under observation at Tiruchi Government Hospital

Twenty two air passengers arriving from different foreign destinations late on Saturday night were taken to the quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Kallikudi

The travellers, arriving from Singapore, Sharjah and Dubai at 11.15 p.m., 11.23 p.m. and 12:10 p.m. respectively had a total of 385 passengers. Of them, the 22 persons taken to the quarantine centre had travel history to countries affected by COVID-19. The facility is fully equipped with basic facilities required by the patients.

The district administration had arranged for meals for the inmates, authorities said.

District Collector S. Sivarasu said that the travellers would be rushed to the isolation ward at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital if they showed any symptoms of the novel coronavirus. One among the persons under observation at the Kallikudi facility was taken to the GH early on Sunday morning.

Local authorities must consider operating mobile stores for supplying groceries, vegetables and fruits to residents at their doorsteps until the COVID 19 scare subsides. As self-isolation cannot be sustained, the authorities must ensure availability of essentials on a daily basis at reasonable costs. Such a step would effectively safeguard the residents from contracting the viral infection. Steps must also be taken to house the alms seekers at homes run by voluntary agencies.

A fear psychosis has gripped citizens of all walks of life as the economy has been crippled and transport has come to a standstill due to COVID 19. The Centre and State must together ensure cooperation of foreign tourists for controlling the spread of corona virus.

Hygiene and the choice of food have a bearing on the immunity level of the people. The Prime Minister's call for self-discipline and social distancing, and developing a mentality to ignore rumours will help in diluting impact of the novel coronavirus scare.

Conditions at the bus stand at Thuraiyur, a bustling town in Tiruchi district, leave much to be desired.

Wrong choice

The Tiruchi Corporation would do well to hold consultations before embarking on any project under the Smart City.

Sites for the project must be identified with care.

The choice of establishing a smart toilet close to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Medical College Hospital (MGMGH) does not augur well.

The toilet is located adjacent to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial where the holy ash of Gandhiji had been kept for public worship before immersion.

Similarly, the Palm grove developed near the Ayyappan Temple appears out of place.

The place would have ideally served as a parking area for the numerous pilgrims visiting the temple.

60,2020/03/22,People brace for ‘self-curfew’ in Vijayawada,"All sections are determined to fight the dreaded coronavirus

Rythu bazars witnessed milling crowds and grocery stores and other retail outlets had an unusual rush of buyers on the eve of ‘Janata Curfew’, a 14-hour pan India lockdown call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight coronavirus, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday.

It is a curfew of the people, by the people and for the people, that will see most people staying off the roads and public places on Sunday. “I pick my vegetables from this rythu bazar every Sunday. But I will not stir out of the house tomorrow to adhere to the ‘Janata Curfew’ call given by the government and so I am here today,” says Damayanthi Alaparthi, a home-maker from Patamata Lanka.

“A large number of people here are misinformed that rythu bazars will be closed on Sunday. We have no such instruction so far,” said Balichakravarthy, Estate Officer of the vegetable market at Swaraj Maidan. But people do not want to leave anything to chance and are stocking up food, groceries and other stuff for the weekend.

There is a unanimity that the breathtaking rapidity of the virus-spread calls for concerted and honest measures. Self-isolation is the byword and most people seem to have realised it. Besides individuals, organisations, government agencies, associations of different groups are encouraging people to contribute their mite in containing the virus by becoming part of the self-imposed curfew for the good of the mankind.

Most of the wholesale kirana shops are closed on Sundays. “We have made it very clear to our people to strictly follow the 7 a.m to 9 p.m. lockdown,” said A. Ramanath, member of the Kirana Merchants’ Association.

‘Social responsibility’

Stationary and fancy shops, available at all times on any day, will be shuttered on Sunday. Potti Madhava Rao, president of the Stationary and Fancy Goods Merchants’ Association, said every dealer was asked to keep a bucket of water and a hand wash available outside the shop to enable people to wash their hands. “We have also displayed posters outside shops to spread awareness on the harms of the virus,” he said.

Former general secretary of the Krishna District Chemists and Druggists’ Association P.S. Patnaik felt: “It is our social responsibility to contribute towards success of this ‘curfew’. Barring a few drug stores at certain points to cater to the emergency needs of people, all other outlets will be closed. We even plan to join the ‘clapping’ bandwagon at 5 p.m.,” he said.

Mr. Modi has asked people to stand at their doorways, balconies, windows or on the terrace and clap hands and ring bells for five minutes at 5 p.m. on Sunday in appreciation of the relentless services of the medical doctors, staff and others who have been working day and night in hospitals and airports without caring about themselves.

“The magnitude of the problem is such that we can’t ignore it anymore. We have sent Whatsapp messages to all our members to stay off roads and support the curfew,” said K.V. Rajesh, president of Vijayawada Taxi Owners’ Welfare Association. “The social distancing is giving time to people to pause and think of their health and creating scope for family bondings,” said women entrepreneur Jogulamba.

Parties’ appeal

Meanwhile, leaders of various political parties distributed pamphlets urging the people to voluntarily observe self-curfew.

The ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday brought to the fore family bonding, mutual cooperation and the need to stay united in the face of the threat of COVID-19.

Though many trains, which were scheduled to start between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. from the originating station, have been cancelled, other long distance trains, which were already on the run, were allowed to continue. Those who came by these through trains had a tough time in reaching their homes from Visakhapatnam railway station on Sunday.

A photo journalist was touched when he saw a professor and his daughter, who came by Prasanthi Express from Puttaparthi, walking with their luggage towards the Asilametta flyover with their luggage in the hot sun. “We waited for an hour but there were no autorickshaws, buses or cabs. There was no one at home to pick us up,” Prof. Krishna Vamsi of GITAM told the photo journalist, who dropped them in his car at MVP Colony.

Passengers walked over long distances with their luggage to reach their homes and every one was not lucky enough. A policewoman was seen dropping a man going towards Gopalapatnam at NAD Kotha Road Junction on Sunday morning. A youth from Uttar Pradesh walked down from the Railway Station to Maddilapalem, about 4 km away.

A man coming from Rajamahendravaram to go to Maddilapalem, was helped by a few persons, including a journalist, to reach his destination. Migrant labourers from Odisha, who came by train from Kerala, were seen waiting outside the RTC Complex, waiting for transport on their onward journey to Odisha. A tea stall was kept open near the RTC Complex and it served the needs of the stranded passengers.

Many of the temples, including the smaller ones, were closed by 7 a.m. Appeals were made by the priests over the public address systems asking the people of surrounding areas not to come out of their homes between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., and thereby check the spread of COVID-19 virus that was threatening mankind.

The messages were heard on the mike from the Sampath Shirdi Sai temple, located on a hillock, beside the Marripalem Highway after 6 a.m. and they stopped by 6.45 p.m. Messages in Hindi and Telugu, were also heard on the mike from a mosque at Hussain Nagar in the same area asking people not to come out of their homes till 5 p.m.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/7n2ylp/article31135992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-VZ-TRAVELLERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/citizens-unite-in-the-face-of-adversity/article31135994.ece

The jam-packed market, which used to sell all types of fish, wore a deserted look on Sunday, as the country observed ‘Janata Curfew’ to express solidarity with the fight against COVID-19.

“We have observed several bandhs in the past. I have not seen such a spontaneous response in my long career,” said AP Mechanised Boat Operators’ Welfare Association president P.C. Appa Rao.

He said that all the associations and societies working for the welfare of fishermen extended their wholehearted support to the call for observing ‘Janata Curfew.’

63,2020/03/22,Spontaneous response from people to ‘Janata Curfew’ call,"All city roads wear a deserted look; pilgrims stranded

It was a voluntary lockdown in the city as almost all the roads, including the bylanes, wore a deserted look right from the early hours on Sunday. The residents remained confined to their homes till the evening.

The spontaneous response of the citizens to the ‘Janata curfew’, the call for which was given by the Prime Minister to break the link of COVID-19 and to arrest spread of the virus, indicates that the people have understood the gravity of the impending danger.

Later in the evening, thousands of people expressed their solidarity with doctors, police personnel, health workers, sanitary workers and others, by coming out onto the balconies of flats in apartment complexes, rooftops and front yards, as the clock struck 5, on Sunday and clapped in unison. The family members, including senior citizens and children, came out and clapped, and some even took plates and other utensils to ring the bell.

Barring a few private two-wheelers and cars, some trucks and private travel buses, which were seen plying, the main roads were practically empty. Many of the Visakhapatnam-bound, private travel buses, which left Hyderabad, Chennai and other places, on Saturday evening, were delayed and reached the city after 7 a.m.

Roadside eateries, mechanic shops and pan shops remained closed and the ubiquitous fruit vendors, were also missing beside the highway road.

With the cancellation of most trains and RTC buses, the Visakhapatnam Railway Station and the Dwaraka Bus Station (RTC Complex) and the Maddilapalem Bus Station in the city wore a deserted look. The police, officials, journalists and volunteers were the only ones moving on the roads.

‘International flights cancelled’

“International flights have been cancelled. Domestic operators have reduced their services in view of the drop in patronage due to cancellations in view of the virus threat. SpiceJet has cancelled its flights to Chennai, Vijayawada and Delhi today, AirAsia has cancelled its flight to Bengaluru and Air India cancelled its flight to Port Blair, so far, today,” Airport Director M. Raja Kishore told The Hindu on Sunday morning.

Y. Nithin, a techie from the city, employed in Chennai, arrived by a private travel bus at NAD Kotha Road Junction around 8 a.m. “Our company gave us the dongle (Internet facility) and laptops yesterday (Saturday) and asked us to Work From Home (WFH) till March 31. About half-a-dozen Vizag-bound buses left from Chennai last evening,” Mr. Nithin said.

64,2020/03/22,Ask Us March 21,"Q. My spouse, a homemaker, plans to trade in the stock market with an investment of less than ₹1 lakh. Kindly advise on the tax implications of trading in equities (intraday trade and others). Brokers informed us they collect various statutory charges apart from their brokerage. I also want to know whether one should pay tax on the profit earned per annum or on the basis of turnover. If so, what is the rate and how should she file I-T returns? Kindly advise.

V. Sarath

A. Stock market trading is a risky activity with a high possibility of capital losses.

We hope your spouse has studied companies and markets carefully and has a risk-management strategy in place before undertaking this.

The profit you make on stock trading can be subject to income tax as long and short-term capital gains or taxed as business income, which can be speculative or non- speculative.

Capital gains taxation usually applies to investors in stocks — those who take delivery of their positions and hold their stocks for one day or more. Whether your profits from trading get treated as long-term or short-term capital gains depends on how long you held the stock before selling them.

If you hold a stock for 12 months or more, the profit you make on selling (over and above your purchase price) get treated as long-term capital gains. All long-term capital gains you make during a year will be taxed at a flat 10% (without indexation benefits) after exempting ₹1 lakh of such gains each year.

If you hold a stock that you bought for between 1 day and 12 months, the profit you make on the sale will be treated as short-term capital gains and taxed at a flat 15%.

Business income

The profit you make through intraday trading in the cash markets (where you don’t take delivery but close out the position within a session) is usually treated as business income.

Business income is clubbed with your other sources of income (say salary, interest, rent etc) and taxed at the income tax slab rate applicable to you. When your trading profit is classified as business income, you are allowed to deduct all the costs you incurred towards this activity (securities transaction tax, brokerage, Internet and phone bills) from your total income before calculating the tax on it.

For traders with no other source of income apart from trading, the income tax rate could work out to be quite low in this route, because they would get taxed at the lower slab rates (zero tax on up to ₹2.5 lakh a year and 5% on the excess up to ₹5 lakh). Losses on speculative business income can be carried forward but only set off against profit from similar income in future years.

Apart from income tax, all transactions through the stock exchanges in listed securities in India attract the securities transaction tax (STT) which will be automatically charged by your broker on the trade.

STT is levied at 0.1% of the transaction value on delivery-based purchases or sales of shares and at 0.025% on the sale transaction on intraday trades or non-delivery trades.

Besides the brokerage payable to the broker on your turnover, States levy stamp duty at different rates on the total turnover, exchanges levy transaction charges, SEBI levies a flat turnover fee and you need to pay GST at 18% on the brokerage and transaction costs. The depository you are with may levy charges too.

As the classification of your profit from stock market trades as capital gains or business income can be subject to interpretation, it would be best to use a qualified accountant to file your returns if you engage in stock trading.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ahd401/article31131059.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21BUSHARETRADING,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ask-us-march-21/article31131060.ece
65,2020/03/22,"Janata Curfew | Narendra Modi thanks people for staying indoors, says battle not over","Prime Minister urges citizens to adhere to restrictions.

An eerie silence descended on the country as millions of Indians stayed indoors on Sunday following a call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a “people’s curfew” to break the transmission chain of the novel coronavirus.

Traffic was negligible as people struggled in some places to find transport from airports. Trains and public buses also did not ply.

Janata Curfew | Updates

Just before 5 p.m., sirens sounded in several cities and people came out onto the roads and balconies clapping their hands and banging steel plates to express gratitude to those providing essential services during this crisis. In many places, conch shells sounded as people milled around.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Modi thanked the people for adhering to his call, but warned against any celebration when it came to an end at 9 p.m. on Sunday night. “Don’t treat this as a success. This is the beginning of a long battle,” Mr. Modi said.

Appealing to the people to adhere to the new restrictions being imposed by the Centre and the State governments, Mr. Modi said people should not move out of their houses in the 80 districts where a “lockdown” had been declared. “Even in other parts of the country [where there was no lockdown] people should stir out of their houses only when necessary,” he added.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan warned that anti-social elements were “spreading misinformation that after #JanataCurfew ends, the deadly virus will be wished away”. “This is false & an attempt to mislead the public.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rkjnig/article31136911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THRDCLAP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/janata-curfew-narendra-modi-thanks-people-for-staying-indoors-says-battle-not-over/article31136912.ece
66,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Congress seeks incentives for health staff,"Government should offer protection kits on priority, says Randeep Surjewala

The Congress on Sunday thanked the citizens for showing gratitude to the country’s health workers and demanded that the Centre should offer financial incentives to all doctors, nurses and supporting staff for dealing with the pandemic on war footing.

In a series of tweets, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala said the government should offer protection kits on priority basis, and increase testing facilities.

“For the protection of all health workers, give them Personal Protection Equipments — N95 Masks, Gloves, Face Shields, Goggles, Hand Covers, Rubber Boots, Disposable Gowns so that they can avoid infection themselves,” Mr. Surjewala said.

“We are proud of our doctors, nurses and supporting staff and they should be given special financial benefits in this difficult time who are risking their lives while fighting Corona Virus. The government should announce it immediately,” he tweeted.

He also said the government should arrange ventilators as at present there are only 30,000 ventilators for a population of 130 crore. “About 95% of ventilators are already in use by patients with more diseases,” Mr. Surjewala tweeted.

Similarly, the Congress leader argued that, till now, only one isolation bed was available for every 84,000 Indians, which is insufficient.

“Increase testing Corona virus by several times because in a country of 130 crore citizens, samples of 16,109 people till date have been investigated,” he tweeted.

The Congress, while advocating financial help for businesses in terms of tax breaks, has asked for strict action against the black-marketing of hand sanitisers, face masks and liquid soaps across the country.

“Action should be taken against those who increase the daily rate of vegetables, pulses, potatoes, onions among others during the time of disaster,” Mr. Surjewala said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7udci/article31136834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THRANDEEPSURJEWALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-congress-seeks-incentives-for-health-staff/article31136835.ece
67,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Automakers to shut down manufacturing plants,"Amid national efforts to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus, nearly all automakers in the country, including market leaders Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp, have announced temporary shutdown of their manufacturing plants.

“With the safety and well-being of employees as top priority in view of the escalating COVID-19 situation, Hero MotoCorp has decided to halt operations at all its global manufacturing facilities — including in India, Colombia and Bangladesh — and the Global Parts Centre (GPC) at Neemrana with immediate effect until March 31, 2020,” the country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer said in a statement.

It added that employees at all the other functions and locations, including the Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) in Jaipur, will continue to work from home, except for those whose physical presence is necessary to run the day-to-day essential services of the company.

Likewise, Maruti Suzuki said it would shut down production and office operations at its facilities in Gurugram and Manesar, Haryana, till further notice. The R&D Centre at Rohtak will also remain closed. ""The duration of this shutdown will depend upon government policy,"" the company said.

In light of heightened concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in Maharashtra, Mahindra and Mahindra has decided to suspend manufacturing operations at its Nagpur plant with immediate effect, and in Chakan (Pune) and Kandivali (Mumbai), from Monday night onwards. “Employee well-being and safety are matters of utmost priority. We are carefully monitoring the rapidly evolving Covid-19 pandemic and will continue to take swift and appropriate action on other plants in the State of Maharashtra and across the nation should the situation change,” the company said in a statement.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI) also announced a temporary shutdown of operations. HMSI, which has four manufacturing plants in the country, said the duration of this shut down will depend upon government policy.

Honda Cars India too informed its associates and suppliers that production operations at both its manufacturing plants in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh and Tapukara, Rajasthan will be temporarily suspended from March 23 till March 31, 2020. While the company said it intends to restart production on April 1, this will be dependent upon advice from the government and health authorities, and market and supply conditions, the company said.

68,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | South Asian coordination on pandemic crisis intensifies,"Bangladesh pledges $1.5 million to SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund

Members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation intensified anti-COVID-19 steps to secure people from the pandemic. Sri Lanka evacuated a large number of Buddhist pilgrims from India in the early hours of Sunday before India stopped all flights as Kathmandu boosted health inspection on the Indo-Nepal border.

“All Sri Lankan Buddhist pilgrims, who were stranded in India, have now returned to Sri Lanka,” a press release from the High Commission of Sri Lanka informed and said 1,500 Buddhist pilgrims from Sri Lanka were stuck in India but were evacuated over the last few days successfully.

Earlier India had streamlined the movement of goods and people across the border with Nepal in view of the threat of the virus. Kathmandu has boosted health screening on the border and in some places local administrations have placed restrictions. “As of now cross-border movement continues,” said an official.

Bangladesh on Sunday became the latest country to support the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina pledged $1.5 million to the initiative proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Earlier Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan and the Maldives came forward to support the emergency fund to fight the pandemic.

Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar said on Thursday the crisis fund would be used to fight the emergency needs of the member countries as the cases of COVID-19 increase. “On the emergency fund, it is already up and running. We have already received many requests from other SAARC countries for assistance in the form of masks, shoe covers, gloves, disinfectants and other items,” said Mr. Kumar during the official weekly briefing.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-south-asian-coordination-on-pandemic-crisis-intensifies/article31136722.ece

The advisory said the COVID-19 outbreak has become a global concern with the World Health Organization declaring it a global health emergency.

It said that as per media reports there is a trend of circulation of misinformation/false news and sharing anonymous data related to coronavirus in social media platforms creating panic among the public.

70,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Isolation is India’s best weapon: ICMR,"Lockdown is the most important step in breaking virus transmission, says its Director-General

Isolation, and not indiscriminate testing, is the only way India can limit the spread of COVID-19, Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Sunday.

A lockdown is the most important step in breaking transmission of the infection, he said, adding that the State governments have now been directed to earmark hospitals specifically to accommodate COVID-19 patients.

India on Sunday reported a total of 376 cases and seven deaths, show Union Health Ministry data, with 14,90,303 persons screened at airports so far. The ICMR noted that it had tested over 16,109 individuals, and over 7,000 were currently under surveillance.

Professor Bhargava told presspersons that testing had been scaled up with 111 labs offering COVID-19 tests. Also, four of 60 online applications received from the private sector to test for the virus had been approved.

“There has been no delay in allowing private labs to test. The idea was to put in place enough safety nets to prevent any accidents to medical personnel handling this highly infectious virus,’’ he said.

Highlighting testing facilities available and the spread of the virus, Professor Bhargava said that very few drug trials across the world were working currently.

“India in the past one week has tested 5,000 samples and has the capacity to scale up to 50,000-70,000 tests a week. Compared to this, France tested 10,000 a week, the U.K. 16,000 a week and the U.S. 26,000 a week. The virus test can be positive between two and 14 days and 80% people experience only mild symptoms and 55% need hospitalisation. But we are dealing with a highly infectious and unknown virus, so isolation is our biggest weapon,” he said.

R. Gangakhedkar, scientist at ICMR, said India was in no way working against World Health Organization (WHO) norms, and the focus now was on breaking transmission. “We are right now not in a position to say that community transmission is happening; maybe, by Tuesday, we will have a clearer picture,” he said.

Ventilators ordered

Responding to the issue of national hospital infrastructure, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, did not give specific numbers of beds and ventilators available. He said that India had placed orders for 1,200 ventilators. “We have enough stock of personal protection equipment and have asked the States to use all their resources to ensure that the poor and disadvantaged groups don’t suffer. Our approach is preventive while being prepared,” he said.

Meanwhile, Thyrocare, Mumbai, Suburban Diagnostics, Mumbai, Metropolis Healthcare, Mumbai, Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai are the first four private labs to get clearance to test for the novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, which causes COVID-19.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rkwi9s/article31136668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THGUJARAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-isolation-is-indias-best-weapon-icmr/article31136669.ece
71,2020/03/22,M.P. Governor directs Speaker to take up no-trust motion pending against him,"BJP accuses Speaker of acting in a motivated way, demands appointment of pro-tem Speaker

The day the BJP leaders had met him, Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon directed Speaker N.P. Prajapati to convene the session so that legislators could act on the no-confidence motion pending against him.

In another instance of a stern exchange of letters between Mr. Tandon on one hand and Mr. Prajapati and caretaker Chief Minister Kamal Nath on the other, the Governor wrote: “As the action on no-confidence motion against you is the job of the legislature, therefore after convening the session necessary action should be taken on this proposal on priority. Until then the Principal Secretary, Vidhan Sabha, will perform daily work on your direction.”

Mr. Tandon told the Speaker he was expected to work only after studying the legality of every subject “based on the Constitution, the Vidhan Sabha rules and morality,” until his fate was decided by the Assembly.

On Saturday, a BJP delegation led by former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan met the Governor and later told reporters that MLA Sharad Kol was forced to resign by the Congress. “Since he took back his resignation before it was accepted, the Speaker shouldn’t go ahead with the process of accepting it,” he said.

In the Congress tenure, Mr. Kol had often embarrassed the BJP by praising the “pro-poor” policies of the Kamal Nath government, and during the previous Budget session had voted in favour of a Congress Bill rattling his party. Most recently, he claimed the BJP gave precedence in its leadership only to a certain community leaving out the backwards.

In a letter submitted to the Governor on Saturday, the BJP leaders had contended that the Speaker had been acting in a politically motivated manner. A day before, when Mr. Nath resigned as the Chief Minister, they had implored the Governor to use the powers vested in him under the Constitution to appoint a pro-tem Speaker instead to “abide by the constitutional values and democratic traditions”.

Mr. Prajapati was a visible irritant for the BJP throughout the recent turmoil. He accepted the resignation of the 16 Congress rebels, supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia who had defected to the BJP, almost 10 days after their letters were submitted to him by the BJP leaders. He had asked them to testify before him that they had resigned of their own accord and not under duress. He had accepted the resignations of six legislators earlier.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bk0nxh/article31071752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LALJITANDON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mp-governor-directs-speaker-to-take-up-no-trust-motion-pending-against-him/article31136654.ece
72,2020/03/22,"Amid lockdown, demand for cash transfers grows","Unorganised Workers’ Congress urges PM Modi to create a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore for the informal sector

With multiple cities and States announcing lockdown on Sunday in the wake of COVID-19, demand for economic relief package for the vulnerable sectors is growing from different quarters.

The head of the All India Unorganised Workers’ Congress, Arbind Singh, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking to create a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore for the informal sector and offer direct cash transfers to the poor.

In a letter to Mr. Modi, Mr. Singh, who also heads the National Association of Street Vendors of India, urged the government to provide three months’ rations to 44 crore workers who work as domestic help, street vendors, brick making workers, Ola and Uber drivers, food delivery boys and those who are working with the hospitality industry.

The Congress’s wing for the informal sector workers also suggested ₹10,000 cash transfer for a month to deal with the disruption in their income sources.

‘93% of workforce’

“The informal sector workers constitute 93% of the workforce and the backbone of the economy. With the government emphasising social distancing and closure of markets, it is important for the policy initiatives to ensure that COVID-19 measures do not drive them to destitution,” Mr. Singh said.

CII proposal

In fact, a study conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has also mooted direct cash transfer of ₹10,000 to rural and urban poor to help increase consumer demand.

The industry body has urged the government to focus on key sectors such as tourism, hospitality, retail, civil aviation and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) that are likely to be hit hard by the lockdown.

The government may consider a strong fiscal stimulus to the extent of 1% of GDP amounting to ₹2 lakh crore to be given in the hand of the needy citizens through Aadhaar-based Direct Benefit Transfer, the CII said.

“India has already been facing growth deceleration, with GDP growth having fallen to 4.7% in Q3 FY2020. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to pull it down further in the fourth quarter. GDP growth could slide to below 5% in FY2021 if policy action is not taken urgently,” the CII study noted.

“Fiscal and monetary stimulus measures need to be announced urgently,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, CII Director-General, in a statement while welcoming the Economic Response Task Force created by the Prime Minister.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amid-lockdown-demand-for-cash-transfers-grows/article31136639.ece

74,2020/03/22,Seizure of Afghan meth on high seas triggers concern,"It indicates trend of the contraband being smuggled out through well-established heroin trafficking route, says official

Tipped off by national drug-enforcement counterparts, the Sri Lankan Navy set out for the high seas in the last week of February and intercepted two trawlers in international waters, more than 1,000 km off the country’s coast. While the operation resulted in the country’s biggest ever drug bust at sea, with the seizure of 400 kg of heroin, what was far more worrying for the region’s drug fighters was that the seized contraband included 100 kg of crystal methamphetamine.

The drug haul was valued at $33.50 million and 16 crewmen, including eight Pakistani nationals, were detained. Initial investigations suggested that the boats came from Pakistan’s Makran coast, with the drugs presumed to have originated in Afghanistan.

Several seizures

Several seizures of Afghan-origin heroin in the high seas of the region have been made in the recent past. Since April 2015, more than 3,700 kg of heroin have been intercepted in India, Sri Lanka and Maldives. Also, 430 kg was intercepted in Mozambique on December 29, 2019, with the detention of 13 Pakistani nationals.

“Heroin seizures are common,” said a senior Indian Customs official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “However, it is the seizure of 100 kg of the methamphetamine that has alarmed the drug enforcement agencies in India and other countries. It is the indication of an emerging trend of meth produced in Afghanistan being smuggled out through an already well-established route for heroin trafficking to different parts of the world,” the official added.

Party drug

Also known as meth, crystal, glass, ice, speed and shards, methamphetamine is a psychostimulant “party” drug. It is much cheaper and highly addictive compared to cocaine. Its effect may last for over 12 hours. In contrast, heroin is a depressant.

In Afghanistan, meth is known to locals as “shisha (glass).” About a decade ago, there were barely any indicators of it being in widespread use in the war-torn country. In May 2009, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)-Kabul and the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan had confirmed a minuscule four-gram seizure in the Helmand province on January 31 that year.

“Nevertheless, with this first seizure, Afghanistan has crossed a worrying threshold,” the UNODC observed in a report. “The manifold challenges of the opium economy have placed a heavy burden on Afghanistan and the rise of methamphetamine consumption/production would be an unwelcome addition,” it added.

Late reaction

Noting that the history of the Golden Triangle (the opium-producing area where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos meet) demonstrated that meth production could have significant impacts on an opium economy, rapidly transforming a plant-based narcotics challenge into a challenge of tracking large synthetic laboratories, the UNODC said many countries had reacted too late to the development of meth markets.

About eight years later, the UNODC’s first Afghanistan Synthetic Drugs Assessment Report (2017) said meth was available in the country in “small quantities and at relatively high prices.” The usual wholesale price for 1 kg of meth was said to be between $10,000 and $15,000, against the $5,000-$7,000 range for heroin. Prices of “shisha” in Herat, Kabul, Mazar, Nangarhar and other areas were also recorded.

The local user base of meth was on the rise, but there was no data-driven indication of the substance being smuggled overseas. For long it was suspected that synthetic meth was coming from neighbouring Iran, where the drug was introduced from southeast Asia and later produced domestically.

Things changed dramatically after air raids by the United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) and the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces on May 6, 2019, when they claimed to have targeted 68 drug laboratories in south-western Afghanistan. Subsequent ground studies unearthed meth labs.

Bulk production

A startling revelation was that the meth in the country was being produced in bulk using ephedrine extracted from a shrub locally known as Oman (Ephedra) growing in the wild in the Afghan mountains, including in Helmand, Ghazni and Wardak.

The shift from use of chemical to plant-based ephedrine for making meth was very recent, in 2018. Proof of the shrub being harvested and transported in huge quantities started emerging. In the third quarter of 2019, more than 900 kg of meth was seized in Afghanistan. However, still there was no clarity on where all the meth being produced in the country was going.

“The huge seizure in Sri Lanka has perhaps cleared the air,” the Customs official observed. “This shift is suspected to have been triggered by the 2018 drought in Afghanistan, in which large tracts of opium [used in heroin production] crops were destroyed.

75,2020/03/22,COVID-19: Poor protective gear forces Valley doctors away from homes,"It’s exposing the first defence against virus to grave dangers, says Association

Scores of doctors operating at the outpatient departments (OPDs) in the Valley tertiary hospitals have stopped visiting their homes “after dealing with patients without wearing protective gear, including must N95 masks”.

“The first two weeks of March went by without major precautions. The resident doctors functioning at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital’s OPDs were working without protective gears. The N95 masks were very few. Recently, a doctor was quarantined after he developed COVID-19 like symptoms. Since then we have stopped visiting home.

“I have a newborn baby and elderly parents at home. We cannot take risk,” a resident doctor working in the SMHS hospital told The Hindu.

At least eight tertiary care hospitals are associated with the Government Medical College, Srinagar, including the SMHS. Sources said there is dearth of protective gear and N95 masks for the healthcare staff in these hospitals, exposing the first defence against COVID-19 to grave dangers.

The issue was raised by the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) formally with the principal of the GMC, Srinagar. It also demanded accommodation for doctors near the hospitals.

“Instead of carrying the infection back home and into our communities, we should be given some sort of accommodation at hostels preferably nearer to our workplace. This will prevent the spread of the virus,” the Association wrote in the letter addressed to the principal.

“If even one resident doctor is infected due to inadequate protection, the entire health care system will collapse and the general public will have nowhere to go to,” it warned.

Under pressure, Principal, GMC, Srinagar, Dr. Samia Rashid said it has received one lakh triple-layer masks. However, the doctors are wary that they cannot replace the N95 and require Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), a head-to-toe protective gear.

“Triple layer masks are safe enough for regular OPDs. However, N95 is essentially required for dealing with COVID-19 positive cases and during procedures where aerosol is generated like throat and nose examination, intubation, sample taking of suspected and confirmed cases,” said Dr. Salim Khan, professor and head of department, Community Medicine, Government Medical College.

Dr. Khan said there’s some PPE supply that “may not suffice beyond a few weeks if not adequately replenished in time”.

“We need to protect our health teams working as frontline workers and the supplies should be stocked for two to three months. We would need masks in lakhs to meet any eventuality.”

Dr. Rashid highlighted the issue in her meeting with Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh. “We have been promised 40 high-end ventilators by the end of this month,” she said.

There are only 60 to 70 ventilators in the associated hospitals of the GMC, Srinagar. These hospitals cater to the entire 70 lakh population of the Valley.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-poor-protective-gear-forces-valley-doctors-away-from-homes/article31136347.ece
76,2020/03/22,COVID-19 | Banks to provide only essential services,"LIC extends premium dates; private banks reduce branch timings

With several States announcing complete lockdown to fight the spread of COVID-19, the financial sector is also responding with reduced timings in branches and providing only essential services.

The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has said banks will only provide essential services from Monday.

“With the impact of coronavirus being felt across the country, the aim of IBA and its member banks is to ensure that you are still provided with uninterrupted banking services. So be rest assured that we are doing our best and extending all the support you need,” IBA said in a statement.

Banks will provide only services such as cash deposit and withdrawal, clearing of cheques, remittances and government transactions. IBA said that since most of the services were available online, customers could avail them though mobile and Internet banking channels. Customers can call branches or customer care for any assistance. Certain services like updating of passbook may not be provided but a customer can use digital platforms for services like balance enquiry.

Some of the large private banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have decided to reduce branch timings. Branches of these banks will open only from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. from Monday.

LIC’s decision

The Life Insurance Corporation of India has said that in view of the prevailing situation due to COVID-19, it will give relaxation to policyholders to pay premium due up to April 15 wherever they are unable to deposit online or otherwise.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/banks-to-provide-only-essential-services/article31136316.ece
77,2020/03/22,Paramilitary forces halt movement of troops,"The direction is issued till April 5

The country’s paramilitary forces, comprising about 10 lakh personnel, have ordered immediate suspension of movement of troops for any kind of travel, including leave or routine work, and directed them to “be where they are” till April 5 to check COVID-19 outbreak in their ranks, officials said on Sunday.

The forces have also asked all personnel to fill up a declaration form stating that none of their family members have travelled to a foreign destination in the recent past.

Officials said the direction was issued by the headquarters of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Border Security Force (BSF), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the National Security Guard (NSG) in order to ensure prevention of a mass outbreak of the pandemic in these forces that are the “backbone” of the country’s internal security and deployed for vital duties, including border guarding and counter-terrorist operations.

The troops live very closely in demarcated camp areas and even one COVID-19 positive case among them can lead to infecting hundreds of colleagues in a short time. Hence, all the forces have been asked by the Union Home Ministry to ensure that no one travels for routine duties, goes on leave or comes back from leave to join duty till April 5, they said.

The order will be reviewed after April 5, the officials added. The CISF, the national civil aviation security force, issued a directive on Saturday stating: “In order to cut down travel risk to prevent the possibility of spread of the disease during travel, the competent authority has directed that all personnel who are already on leave and likely to join duty before April 5 may be asked to extend leave till April 5.

“This may be ensured by intimating affected personnel over phone by respective leave sanctioning authorities.”

BSF’s stance

Two days ago, the BSF had similarly cancelled the movement of all its troops and officers. The over 2.5 lakh personnel-strong border guarding force, primarily tasked to guard the Indian borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, has said that violation of these directives will invite action against those who undertake the journey and their commanders who approve such movements.

The BSF order stated: “It is categorically clarified that there should not be any movement of manpower with regard to leave, training, courses, temporary duties etc, upto April 5.” The order said these directives are meant for “strict compliance”.

The force also asked all its commanders to extend the leave of off-duty jawans and officers till April 5 “with immediate effect, to avoid unnecessary movement from their home town to place of duty”. The order said such personnel should be informed about the extension of their leave on their personal telephones so that there is “no communication gap” and such personnel do not begin their journeys.

It has also been ordered that officers and sub-officers who are undergoing a training course “should be kept at the respective centres” till April 5 and if required their courses should be extended in order to stop them from travelling to their homes or offices.

Similar worded orders have been issued by all the forces, two officials privy to the development said. They said movement of these paramilitary forces or Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) personnel, till April 5, will only be allowed in case of a “strict emergency” and that will be cleared after approval by senior commanders who will review and decide each case on its individual merit.

The Union Home ministry recently directed that all non-emergency leave of paramilitary personnel should be “cancelled” in order to minimise the risk of contracting coronavirus during travel and they should get into “battle mode” to combat the pandemic by ensuring personal and public safety. There have been no positive cases for COVID-19 in these forces till now.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/paramilitary-forces-halt-movement-of-troops/article31136283.ece
78,2020/03/22,Air Force plans to work with 50% manpower,"Proposes weekly rotations of staff

Taking note of the high probability of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) affecting the community, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has drawn up a contingency plan to work with 50% manpower at workplace and bring in weekly rotations in the event of spread of COVID-19 within the Service.

“In the eventuality of infection assuming alarming proportion, there will be a need to restrict the manpower to workplaces to 50% for better management of the emergency. All the branches and offices, therefore, need to work out a contingency plan to work with 50% manpower,” an IAF circular dated March 19 said.

“The remaining 50% of manpower should be instructed to work from home. Accordingly, a weekly roster to attend office on alternate week needs to be formulated,” it stated.

The order also stated that while deciding the roster for the first week, addressees are advised to include personnel who are involved in core activities, residing in close proximity of their office and who may use their own transport to travel to workplaces. “The plan should be ready and will only be executed on specific instruction in this regard,” it added.

Disinfection plan

The order also directed the Director General Medical Services (Air) to work out a disinfection plan for all office complexes of Air headquarters and common areas.

The IAF along with other Services has already issued safety and medical guidelines to manage the spread of COVID-19. Last week, the Army announced a plan to cut down the number of personnel functioning at the Army headquarters effective from March 23 to 31 and announced weekly rotation and staggered work schedule for those attending work.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/air-force-plans-to-work-with-50-manpower/article31136202.ece
79,2020/03/22,Telecom operators ask Over-the-top media services to reduce video quality,"‘Surge in digital use due to lockdown and quarantine measures straining networks’

With social distancing measures like work from home putting pressure on the country’s telecom networks, the operators have reached out to 12 video streaming platforms, including Hotstar and Netflix, to implement measures such as reducing video quality to Standard Definition (SD) to ease the stress on the networks.

The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has also separately written to the Department of Telecom, requesting that a communique be sent to video streaming players as it “will be more effective if a similar communication is sent from the DoT to these companies.”

In its letter to video streaming platforms, the COAI noted that in the past few days advisories had been issued by various government agencies for social distancing, restrictions in terms of workplace, encouraging work from home, online/digital education, digital payments/ transactions and online healthcare, wherever possible.

“This sudden surge in digital use is already putting pressure on the network infrastructure of the telecom service providers. The TSPs are taking requisite steps to manage this load and facilitate the smooth functioning of the networks during this critical time,” it said.

However, due to lockdown and quarantine measures, a sudden surge in demand for online video streaming is also expected. “We believe that during this critical time, it is absolutely essential for the streaming platforms to cooperate with TSPs so as to manage the traffic distribution patterns which are likely to strain the network infrastructure at a time when it is needed for various critical requirements.”

‘Remove ads’

The industry body added that there were various measures that the streaming platform companies could undertake in this present situation, including temporarily moving to SD (Standard Definition) from HD (High Definition) streaming.

“We understand that there may be other such technical measures that may be taken to ease the pressure on infrastructure. Also, during this period, advertisements and pop-ups, which usually consume high bandwidth should be removed and if required, replaced with public announcements on awareness regarding the virus.”

The letter has been sent to 12 streaming services, namely Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar, Zee5, Alt Balaji, Voot, Sony Liv, Viuclip, Hoichoi, SunNXT and Voot.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qwe9ve/article31136170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NATION-STREAMING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telecom-operators-ask-over-the-top-media-services-to-reduce-video-quality/article31136171.ece
80,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | COVID-19 is a new animal in the zoo; we are still understanding the virus: NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul,"India so far has not seen any deaths which are unexplained, says NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul.

Co-chair of the Empowered Committee for COVID-19 Response, India, Dr. V.K. Paul said the changed circumstances of the spread of the disease called for a revised testing strategy and marshalling all resources to contain the pandemic. He also indicated that India is close to rolling out a simpler, indigenous testing kit for the virus.

Why has India revised its testing strategy making it more inclusive and allowing private laboratories to test? Is this an indication of the trends that you may be seeing in terms of wider spread of COVID-19?

Currently we are in a state of panic versus not enough panic — the COVID-19 situation is unpredictable so it’s best to align our thoughts with what the Prime Minister articulated... that captures the situation in which we are in currently: We have a problem. We have been containing it to a large extent but the way these things pan out, emerging scenarios are unpredictable and can be very serious, so let us put our act together.

Why have we changed criteria? Because we think it is time to get the first indications to know if it is spreading in India. If it spreads, serious patients will come in and we cannot miss this indication. Till now all our cases were travel and close contact to positive case related. If that phase has passed, next would be serious and we need to know to curtail it...We may enter the next stage, but as of now there is no such indication.

However, we are also cautioning that this has the potential to become an outbreak and become bigger. Nobody can rule that out. India so far has been in a reasonably good shape and we have not seen any deaths which are unexplained. COVID-19 is a new animal in the zoo, we are still understanding the virus that hasn’t seen a full cycle of season, so cannot say conclusively how it will behave.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

What we know is that we have a pandemic, we are seeing behaviour of various kinds — somewhere it is explosive, somewhere delayed, somewhere protected... so you should be aware that are scenarios. We currently may be in better-off but be prepared for the worst. That's my request you.

I think the time span is also not chartable, but the general thing is next two months are very critical for us. If the world doesn't change, you change. Social distancing is a community phenomenon and even if things start looking up for us in the near future we should be sensible for the next two months. Even when the virus curve is flattening, it will be a risky period for the spread and social protection is a must.

NITI Aayog had advised the government to rectify the lack of health infrastructure, skewed patient-bed and medical staff ratio…keeping this in mind how prepared is India if we do slip into community transmission? The trends currently indicate massive spikes.

It is no secret that that India’s health infrastructure needs to be augmented and that we need to double of patients-bed and patient-medical staff ratio. We are evolving as country and we have been emphasising the need to increase of healthcare foot print from Tier 2 to Tier 3 cities. So, are we saying, yes, we should have a much stronger and much bigger and much more competent health system and that journey has many more milestones to be achieved.

Coronavirus | Helpline numbers

Currently States across India have been instructed to marshal all their resources to ensure that we are able to contain the virus. They have been asked to use all legal and emergency powers and funds to cater to any medical situation that may come about. You know, it is a situation for which you have to pull out all stops and get makeshift arrangements if need be. You cut down on the routine work, you cut down on your patient load, and then you carve out space for additional work.

We don't know the size of the problem. It may be small, aptly manageable, but then look at how potentially explosive it can be. So far India has remained relatively safe, but we need to be aware and prepared.

How will the 14-hour ‘Janata Curfew’ help?

This one-day bandh is the only way we can cut down or dent transmission. That’s the good, old way things work, when we don’t have a medicine, we don’t have the vaccine... you have to make sure that it doesn’t pass on to the next person. Our reading so far has been that it is spreading in a localised way. But what if we move to the next stage where much larger transmission takes place? Here you need a situation where the virus is not passed from one to another. While we cannot create a perfect situation so social distancing is key and this drill is essential.

Janata Curfew | Updates

Perfect social distancing cannot happen under normal situation, we work… we have to do things…. What the Prime Minister has done is to say “Ok guys, we have been making an effort to break this chain and now let us demonstrate that we can do it in a perfect way over a certain period of time.” And technically even this one day of ‘Janata Curfew’ will achieve denting the transmission.

On Monday, many of us will back to work and things will restart. So what we are doing is demonstrating our resolve and restraint as a nation.

Where are we in terms of making available testing kits and vaccine?

We are looking at two types of technologies/products — one is diagnostic kits and the other, of course, is vaccine which is a long term solution. Currently everything related to COVID-19 is new but I am very happy to tell you that we are very close to making available a simpler and indigenous diagnostic test. There are 4 to 6 very promising options being carried out and we are very close to an early validation and early scale up. I am hoping this could be in matter of weeks.

Meanwhile, obviously the vaccines story is a bit longer but we are having 2-3 leads on which the work has been started. Vaccine pipeline will be about eight months to a year or more. Globally, you hear a year. If others can do it, we can do it too.

Also, remember if vaccine comes out somewhere else, they may find it very sensible to manufacture here in India. So that’s the silver lining, we have a huge vaccine production capability. I would also like to assure everyone that all efforts are being done by the government to accelerate this whole effort and to involve all the agencies and regulatory bodies.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m0g72t/article31135760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-VKPAULNITI-SHANKERCHAKRAVARY-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-covid-19-is-a-new-animal-in-the-zoo-we-are-still-understanding-the-virus-niti-aayog-member-vk-paul/article31135761.ece

Excerpts from an interview.

Has India moved relatively early with containment measures?

When compared to Italy and the US in how the early response to the epidemic has been, yes, India has moved early on a country wide measure like Sunday's 14-hour lockdown. Such a step early on in an epidemic with high rates of transmissions, and consequent impacts on unprepared or inadequate health system, definitely helps in reducing the speed at which the population gets infected, and reduces the size of the avalanche of very sick people coming to hospitals.

That said, we need to understand that India is 3 times the size of the US in population terms, and we are way below in terms of our health infrastructure in terms of beds, equipment and, most importantly, trained personnel. We also need to check whether a nationwide lockdown of a day so early on makes as much sense as complete lockdowns of a few states where there have been more numbers of people tested positive.

Also read: Coronavirus: Railways cancels all train services till March 31

Along with it, we need to be cognisant that our similarity with both the US and Italy is the relatively slow and lower use of diagnostic tests. Italy’s current situation may be an indicator for both US and India in not having ramped up testing more aggressively.

What does today's lockdown achieve?

In terms of managing this epidemic, or for that matter, any epidemic, we have a few tools to look for – 1. a vaccine, that will take a year or more to materialise, 2. a medicine that effectively treats the viral infection, which may be a matter of weeks, maybe months, and 3. in the more immediate timeframe, an intervention to reduce the speed at which the disease transmission occurs. Lockdowns are of the third kind, a kind of behavioural medicine.

Also read: China sees continued rise in imported coronavirus cases

In order to be effective, medicines have to be administered at a certain dosage – too much, and you kill the patient, and too little, it does no good, can cause more harm. To my mind, a 14 hour lockdown is a suboptimal dose of lockdown. If we take this 14 hour shutdown as a test dose, then it’s alright; but if we think this is going to do the trick of retarding the spread of disease, then we may be expecting too much from too little. As a signal for future actions, it does serve a purpose. Most medicines have side effects, and it is true for lockdowns too, but in this case, the kind of lockdown that Rajasthan has put in place is the way to go. It is across the state, for a definite period of time, and open to review for effects.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

India is less globalised than Europe or the U.S. Does this help?

It may be true that the proportion of Indians who travel outside the country are way lesser than in Italy or the US – but even a small proportion of Indians constitute a very large number. And, we need to be mindful that within the country, mobility between states, and between cities and the rural areas is pretty high. It will not take too long for something that was localised to an urban centre like Mumbai or Delhi to be showing up in rural Bihar or small town Tamil Nadu.

Given that a lot of the tourism season was still underway in early February, like in Kerala where major efforts were made to track visitors, it would not be inconceivable that there could be more people infected in the Golden Triangle of Delhi – Jaipur – Agra, as well as on the Mumbai – Goa Corridor by tourists who have already left the country. Early availability and more testing could probably have informed us of this. It is true that a lesser number of people with the disease, and aggressive lockdown measures, could put India on a different epidemic trajectory from Italy or the US, but that remains an assumption at this point.

How to prevent geometrical explosion of cases?

Children play the statue game – on someone saying statue, the intended person is to become rooted to their place and remain there so long as not released. Lockdowns to limit the rate of disease spread is akin to playing Statue. It is tough medicine, and people need to be explained the benefits and side effects of it.

For many, many Indians, it immediately means loss of income, with no reductions in expenses. Good clinicians take care of explaining and mitigating side effects with complementary therapies. Ensuring an adequate set of mitigation measures to offset daily expenditures in times of zero income are necessary to get the most benefit of the prescription of lockdowns. Otherwise, what will happen is that Work from home and lockdown measures become reasons and excuses for people to pack bags and leave for somewhere else that they may be more comfortable at. We still have the opportunity of reducing the total numbers of people with infection and the rates at which they get infected, but to do so, we will need a set of measures that enable people to remain in place without going hungry and becoming poorer.

How do we ensure the optimal use of our existing health infrastructure?

India has lesser hospital beds and qualified personnel for its population than the WHO norms. Most of these beds and clinical capacity are taken up by people already sick. What we don’t want is the pressure on these limited facilities from the oncoming avalanche of people very sick because of the COVID-19 disease. I would think of retaining existing beds and gearing up personnel and facilities in these establishments to take care of those that need very intensive support.

Also read: A step closer to developing a potent drug against novel coronavirus

For the vast majority of Covid-19 patients, who need to be in a healthcare setting but not requiring advanced interventions, large field hospitals will be the way to go. The Armed Forces Medical Services knows how to get them operational quickly. This would be the time to take 3rd MBBS students, and 3rd & 4th year Nursing students, and put them into clinical work in such settings, preparing them for a lifetime with clinical experience and exposure. The numbers of patients needing medical care but not advanced support would be large, and they should not overwhelm existing infrastructure.

Can those showing symptoms home quarantine, and how? How can housing societies etc help ?

Home quarantine and isolation would be very effective in 2 ways – reducing the spread of infection, as well as reducing the pressure on limited healthcare facilities. For most healthy young people, Covid19 could be similar to a self-limiting bout of flu. With adequate telemedicine support, a significant number of ill people could be taken care of at home, if their family or support circle members are adequately informed of the precautions. However, this idea of self-quarantine will be impractical in most peri-urban slums of India – which is why I would go back to my earlier proposition of large field hospitals to provide isolation as well as medical supervision.

Also read: Coronavirus | Why are only a fraction of cases tested?

In urban India, within condominium complexes, stigmatisation of those that are self-isolating or in quarantine is becoming more visible. Prejudicial behaviour in such gated complexes must be addressed, and police and local health authorities should not become accessories to stigmatisation of sick individuals. This crisis should bring out our best in neighbourliness. There needs to be more social solidarity, a caring for those that may be vulnerable, especially the elderly in our communities, all the while ensuring physical distance. I have personal difficulty with the terminology of social distancing in these fraught times, and would implore on greater social solidarity while maintaining physical distance.

Is community transmission now impossible to stop? How could that be managed?

Self-isolation, quarantine, physical distance, universal access to cheap or free tests are all essential components of prevention of transmission and slowing down its rate of spread. In short time I would hope that there would be specific antivirals available that make treatment and clearance of viral load possible. And in the not so far off future, I would hope that an effective vaccine will be in place, supplementing whatever herd immunity we will have created through this major epidemic.

How quickly could we hope for some breakthrough in treatment?

Linus Torvalds, the open source computing Guru is supposed to have said: “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” I think that is the case with SARS Cov2. Coordinated by the World Health Organisation, and with national efforts like the one led by the Indian Council for Medical Research, supported by regulators like the USFDA, the EMEA and the DCGI in India, I think a therapeutic breakthrough is on the horizon. Pharmaceutical companies are playing their part, and I think it is only a matter of months to have specific treatment recommendations.

Where the effort is lagging is in the area of diagnostics – I personally believe that now, and in the future, the lack of diagnostic infrastructure will be the single biggest gap area. Sometimes I think we are looking under a lamppost for something that we lost elsewhere.

The airline put out an appeal to law enforcement agencies to ensure that the crew members are treated fairly, as some associations had even gone to the police.

‘Protocols followed’

The statement said that Air India had made sure that its crew members followed all safety protocols and quarantine regulations, but when crew members went home, they faced ostracim. “It is alarming to note that in many localities, vigilante RWAs and neighbours have started ostracising the crew and even obstructing them from performing their duty or even calling the police just because the crew travelled abroad in the course of their duty,” the statement said.

“These vigilantes have conveniently forgotten that many a spouse, parent, sibling, child and many a near and dear one have been brought home safe and secure from affected countries because of the heroic efforts of the crew.”

While it did not specify any particular neighbourhood or individual, the national carrier used strong words.

84,2020/03/22,17 policemen killed in Chhattisgarh encounter,"An encounter broke out between Chhattisgarh police and Maoists in Sukma district late on March 21

Seventeen members of a police patrol were killed in an ambush by Maoists in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma on March 21.

Around 350 Maoists including women cadres opened fire on a police patrol team comprising a hundred personnel on March 21 afternoon. The operation lasted five hours and the bodies of the 17 policemen could be retrieved after 12-14 hours on March 22.

Chhattisgarh Director General of Police D.M. Awasthi told The Hindu that most policemen who were presumed to be missing after the encounter, were either killed at the spot or died due to “loss of blood” due to gunshot injuries. He said 15 others were injured, out of which two are critical. At least 14 sophisticated weapons used by the police were taken away by the Maoists.

Mr. Awasthi said the area where the attack took place is dominated by the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) Battalion No. 1, one of the most lethally armed and trained unit of the Maoists active in southern Chhattisgarh. It is the same group led by Hidma that killed 25 CRPR personnel in April 2017.

Hidma has managed to give a slip to the security agencies for over a decade now and they don’t even have his recent photograph, except grainy images dating back to 2007.

Mr. Awasthi said a team of around 500 policemen comprising the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and the Special Task Force (STF) had gone to Elmagunda in the deep forests of Sukma on March 20 on receipt of information that a large group of Maoists had assembled there. Police received information that the top Maoists leaders had congregated to plan attacks at two police camps in one of the worst Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas.

Mr. Awasthi said when the police teams could not find anything at the particular location, they decided to return. “One police party was sent from Chintagufa camp and the other half from Burkapal. While returning, the two teams dispersed towards their respective locations. While one of the teams was 5-6 km away from their camp, the Maoists opened fire. DRG and STF fought fierce battle with Maoists for five hours. There were more than 350 Maoists including women,” Mr. Awasthi said.

He said while chasing them, the police reached an open area where Maoists had taken position at a height and an exchange of fire ensued. “Many Maoists had been killed too but no bodies could be recovered as they drag the bodies along. Many jawans were injured and they tried to crawl to safety, but they either died at the spot or died due to loss of blood,” he said.

The DGP said before the main encounter started, there were two more instances of exchange of fire with the Maoists with the other team. “It could have been diversionary act to stop the other police personnel from reaching main encounter site,” he said. The two police teams were 3-4 km apart.

“The police team was barely two hours away from their camp when they came under attack….there was heavy firing, the police fought valiantly,” he said.

He said the operation ended at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday and while the teams were retreating they carried out a headcount. “We found in the night that 17 people were missing...one team remained in the jungle to trace them. Sunday morning a massive search operation was launched…the Maoists were still there and we managed to retrieve the bodies,” he said.

“Many Maoist leaders have been killed and many are injured, we will get the specific information in few days. This is an area dominated by PLGA unit led by Hidma. Generally they are around 150 cadres, but during the attack around 350 armed men and women were there, which means many come from other areas” he said.

He said since 2017, the Maoists have suffered huge losses as police started moving in the core areas. “In the past three years, we have opened 68 camps for the police,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e75rcv/article31135332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUKMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/17-policemen-killed-in-chhattisgarh-encounter/article31135089.ece
85,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Indian students seek refuge within U.K. mission premises,"India’s ban on travellers from the U.K. and Europe remains in place until the end of this month

A group of 19 Indian students has sought refuge within the premises of the Indian High Commission in London overnight on March 21, demanding that they be put on a flight to India despite the travel restrictions in place following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The group of students, mostly from Telangana, have refused offers of alternate accommodation arranged with the help of Indian diaspora groups as India’s ban on travellers from the U.K. and Europe remains in place until the end of this month.

The Indian community has tried to help them and initially it was a group of 59 students, 40 of whom have been allocated alternative accommodation but the remaining 19 are being completely unreasonable and refuse to move, said a community leader, who has been working with the High Commission on arrangements for the stranded students.

Many of them had flights booked back to India for later this month, in time for what is usually an Easter break period at universities in the U.K. However, India issued an updated travel advisory earlier this week to say that no travellers would be allowed entry into India after 1200 GMT on March 18 until March 31.

There simply are no flights and we cannot be putting lives in danger at this stage. They were allowed entry into the High Commission building and provided food, water and temporary shelter, but they are now just camping out with their bags and baggage, he said.

The students have been placed within a quarantined space, which houses the visa and consular section within the Indian High Commission building in Aldwych, central London.

It had triggered a last-minute dash for flights as many students took to social media to seek assistance from the Indian High Commission as their travel plans went awry in the wake of the rapid spread of the pandemic.

The Indian mission has introduced an online registry system and has also shared contact information for a number of Indian diaspora groups trying to assist with board and lodging for panic-stricken students and Indian nationals.

“I am an Indian Citizen, currently in Newcastle, United Kingdom on student visa. My visa expires on March 24, 2020. I was to travel back to India on March 23, 2020 and all the flights are being cancelled due to the COVID-19 as per Indian rule. What should I do,” wrote one student in an appeal to the High Commission.

Such students are being advised to seek assistance from the U,K, Home Office’s Coronavirus Immigration Helpline. Meanwhile, the Home Office has said it recognises the current situation is exceptional and will not take any compliance action against students or employees who are unable to attend their studies or work due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The National Indian Students and Alumni Union U.K. (NISAU-UK), a representative body for Indian students in the U.K., has been fielding calls and urging students not to panic, support each other and take necessary precautions to be safe.

As the U.K. went into complete shutdown from Saturday, universities across the U.K. have said they are mindful of the plight of international students, many of whom have nowhere to go as campuses close down.

Universities Minister, Michelle Donelan said, “I am pleased Universities U.K. has confirmed institutions will be flexible and do all they can to support students to progress to higher education.”

According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, the death toll from the virus globally has risen to 13,044 with 307,104 cases reported 171 countries and territories.

As of March 21, there are 5,018 confirmed cases in the U.K. and 233 people have died due to the deadly coronavirus that first emerged in China’s Wuhan city last year.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/657i5y/article31127693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LONDONKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-indian-students-seek-refuge-within-uk-mission-premises/article31134858.ece
86,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | 80 districts in lockdown to contain virus spread,"With first deaths reported in Bihar and Gujarat, toll rises to 7; inter-State transport, suburban trains, bus services suspended.

All train, metro and inter-State transport services across the country were suspended on Sunday till March 31 as the death toll from COVID-19 rose to seven nationwide, and the number of confirmed cases stood at 396. Unprecedented restrictions were imposed in 80 districts across 17 States and five Union Territories affected by the pandemic.

The Union Health Ministry said Bihar and Gujarat had reported their first casualties from COVID-19. A 38-year-old man with a kidney ailment and recent travel history to Qatar died at AIIMS-Patna and a 67-year-old man died at a hospital in Surat. Another death of a 63-year-old man was reported from Mumbai.

Only essential services

“State governments will issue orders allowing only essential services to operate in districts with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The focus should be on closure of all activities except essential services such as hospitals, telecom, medicine shops and provision stores,” an official release said.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba described the new measures as further “pre-emptive” actions, given the “sharp increase” in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country after curbs on international travel, contact tracing and efforts at social distancing.

Indicating that the ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday was a precursor of more stringent measures, Mr. Gauba, in a letter to the Chief Secretaries, said the States need to “build on the momentum” of the 14-hour lockdown.

Calling on the States to operate transport within their boundaries at a “skeletal level”, the Centre said all these measures were temporary in nature but “vital to break” the chain of transmission of the pandemic.

Earlier in the day, the Railways announced suspension of all passenger services until March 31, including all suburban train services. Only goods trains will run during the period, the Railways said, adding that trains that had commenced their journey prior to 4 a.m. on March 22 would complete their journeys.

Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said the nature of “essential services” would be decided by the individual States. “We want to control the movement of people,” he said at a press briefing.

In response to questions, Mr. Agarwal was clear that more districts could be brought under curbs if they were affected by COVID-19. According to him, the lockdown was temporary in nature.

Barring essential services like hospitals, fire, prisons, banks and newspapers, States were conscious to ensure that the production and provisioning of medical supplies continued uninterrupted, he said.

According to the Health Ministry, Maharashtra continues with the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases at 67, followed by Kerala with 52 and Delhi, 29. Uttar Pradesh had 27 cases, Karnataka has 26, Rajasthan 24, Telangana 22 and Haryana 21.

The Delhi Government closed its borders to Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and announced it would run a skeletal bus service.

However its announcement that all domestic flights had been suspended from Monday morning was contested by the Director-General of Civil Aviation, which said: “Domestic flights to and from IGIA Delhi shall continue to operate and the airport shall remain functional.”

In his letter, Mr. Gauba also suggested that State governments could request industries / establishments allow their staff to work from home and “provide renumeration to them during this period”.

The Cabinet Secretary said States could also take appropriate measures to help poor and vulnerable sections, including casual workers, in order to mitigate any hardships that might be caused.

87,2020/03/22,Analysis | Oil price drop spotlights India’s strategic petroleum reserves,"The country currently holds its Strategic Petroleum Reserves in Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru and Padur, storing 5.33 million tonnes of crude, which could last for nine days.

The steep drop in oil prices following the COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened India’s focus on its strategic petroleum reserves, which have been built up as a bulwark against energy disruptions and geopolitical typhoons.

India currently holds its Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) in Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru and Padur, storing 5.33 million tonnes of crude, which could last for nine days.

Oil prices have dropped to less than $30 a barrel following the post-COVID-19 fall in energy demand across the globe, enforced by lockdowns, travel bans and interlocking geopolitical feuds.

Saudi-Russia feud

Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s big oil producing heavyweights, have quarrelled after they were unable to agree on slashing production in order to shore up falling prices. Instead, they decided to flood oil into a market, where energy demand was already in free fall.

But lurking behind the Saudi-Russia feud was also the cut-throat tit-for-tat between Moscow and Washington. By driving prices below $30 a barrel, Russia was targeting the U.S. shale oil producers — mostly supporters of President Donald Trump — who require a $50 per barrel price line in order to stay in business. The Russians had fired their riposte against the U.S., which had earlier hit the Nord Stream-2 undersea pipeline project to ferry Russian gas directly to Germany, by sanctioning any foreign company engaged in the undertaking.

Away from the geopolitical firestorm, India is focused on topping up its SPR. According to an agency report, India will spend about $ 670 million to buy oil at around $30 a barrel, for its strategic reserves, drawn from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Deliveries will start around April-May. The Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd. (ISPRL), a subsidiary of the Oil Industry Development Board, run by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas manages these reserves.

Unlike India, it is estimated that China will achieve its strategic petroleum reserve target of 90 days this year.

In government circles, there is an acute realisation that the existing SPR are hardly sufficient, in view of the ongoing global economic uncertainly, which is unlikely to abate any time soon. “ In order to manage contingencies, we need at least one month of strategic petroleum reserves, which was the original plan when the exercise began in 2003,” says R.S. Sharma, former head of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), during a conversation with The Hindu.

Unsurprisingly, the government is considering building 30 day reserves in the first phase which will be eventually extended to 60 and, finally 90 days. In June 2018, the Cabinet had cleared an additional 6.5 million tonne SPR facilities at Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka, to augment India’s energy security by 11.5 days. Two more facilities — one in Bikaner and another in Rajkot — are also expected to be initiated soon to enable storage for 30 days. The ISPRL has also been asked to pin down new sites so that a 90-100 days of oil reserve stocks are eventually available at all times.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3906z9/article31134538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GLOBAL-OILDEMAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oil-price-drop-spotlights-indias-strategic-petroleum-reserves/article31134539.ece

“We need to stand by the government,” he added.

National Conference president Farooq Abdullah is unlikely to attend the ongoing session of Parliament because of the COVID-19 outbreak, according to his family.

Released on March 13 after over seven months of detention following the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year, the five-time Chief Minister maintained silence on the political issues and chose to spend time with his family and visiting his incarcerated son Omar Abdullah as per the jail manual.

He released ₹1 crore from funds allocated to him under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme to combat the threat of COVID-19. “I hope the amount I have released from my MPLAD fund will give the required flip to the efforts of the agencies concerned to deal with the situation in an effective way.

“This laid the foundation of Ramana Maharshi’s teachings that primarily stressed Vichara or Self-enquiry such as ‘Who am I’, expressed in Tamil as ‘Naan Yaar’ which was an appealing route in that it transcended all denominations of religion, caste, gender or region, allowing the individual to access his or her true freedom of Self. Sri Ramana, by universalising his teachings and opening the doors of his ashram to all, represented the true inclusivist essence of Hinduism which does not discriminate amongst those longing for spiritual transformation or does not privilege specific religious or caste traditions to exclude people from its ambit.”

Interviews with relatives

The 168-page book includes the life story of Sri Ramana Maharshi in five parts, milestones in his life, reproduction of his teaching “Who am I” in the form of his answers to 28 questions, his Forty Verses on Reality, the activities of the ashram, interviews with the grand-nephews of the Maharshi who had known him, the in-coming president of the ashram and with composer Ilaiyaraaja, who is also a devotee.

The book has articles on the multi-faceted Maharshi, his deep affection for the Arunachala hill, his love for the animals, Girivalam, and Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Swamigal of the Kanchipuram Math directing journalist Paul Brunton to meet the Maharshi, and on the famed Arunachaleswara temple complex at Tiruvannamalai, its inscriptions, murals.

The Hindu has reported on the Maharshi and published scores of commentaries in its columns during and after his lifetime.

Mr Modi also held a video conference with representatives of pharmaceutical companies and asked them to boost production. The companies reportedly assured the Prime Minister that India had enough supplies for all essential pharma commodities and there was no reason to worry.

Kothakota mandal, near Madanapalle, on Sunday afternoon when a group of about 30 youth reportedly took to playing cricket defying the appeal of the local revenue officials to cooperate with the Janata Curfew mooted to fight against COVID-19, besides allegedly misbehaving with an official.

Following information that a huge crowd had gathered at Moravapalle village to attend a funeral ceremony, the official left for the village to prompt the gathering to maintain social distance. When the official reached the village accompanied by a couple of revenue staff, he found a group of youth playing cricket at a nearby vacant place.

When Mr. Kumar asked the youth to disperse, the latter allegedly used abusive language at him, and reportedly intimidated him to leave the place. The upset official reported the matter to the local police at B. Kothakota. By the time, a police rushed to the village, the youth dispersed. As the village was under ‘Janata Curfew’, the police had to return without making any further inquiry.

Mr. Kumar told the media that the youth using abusive language pained him a lot, when he made a request with them to cooperate with the Janata Curfew. “Several of them are engineering students. I have reported the matter to the police,” he said.

The sub-inspector of B. Kothakota confirming the episode said that as and when information had reached him from the Tehsildar, the police personnel rushed there, but seeing the police the youth fled.

107,2020/03/22,Janata Curfew: An unusually desolate temple town Tirupati,"The only sounds in the otherwise cacophonous city are the sounds of silence

The temple city of Tirupati appeared unusually desolate with no sign of the tens of thousands of devotees visiting the abode of Lord Venkateswara everyday. Though the inflow started dwindling since a couple of days after the TTD cancelled darshan, local residents also stayed indoors, taking a cue from the call given by the central government to observe self imposed exile in the name of Janata curfew.

The APSRTC central bus station, railway station and Sri Govindaraja Swamy temple located in the core city area looked deserted from dawn. People voluntarily stayed home to keep the Covid-19 at bay.

Empty roads and pilgrim complexes

Srinivasam and Vishnu Nivasam, the two massive pilgrims accommodation complexes located in the heart of the city having around a 1,000 rooms, sported a never-before sight of emptiness.

The Tamil Nadu government announcing to shut down its borders with the neighbouring states also impacted the inflow of passengers by road.

Vegan by fear

Leela Mahal Centre, known for the clutter of poultry, mutton and fish markets, and abuzz on Sundays. But it was an altogether different sight this Sunday thanks to the Janata curfew. The scare over the spread of the virus through non-vegetarian food, though rubbished by the industry as unfounded, had already taken a toll on the poultry and meat business, and the Janata Curfew apparently only exacerbated it.

Missing the morning cuppa

Denizens had the first bitter experience of the day when many missed their first sip of coffee due to non-supply of milk by retail vendors, which was reportedly hoarded out of panic.

The lockdown in Mysuru as a precautionary measure to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 was total with people complying with the government advisory to remain indoors on Sunday.

An eerie silence prevailed across the city unlike the bandhs sponsored by political parties and even the streets and public places in the residential areas were bereft of people.

The city bus stand, the suburban bus stand, and the railway station, which are a beehive of activity, were completely deserted while all commercial establishments across the city and in the main commercial hub comprising D. Devaraja Urs Road, JLB Road, Dhanavantri Road, Ashoka Road, and Santhepete too remained shut. The KSRTC had withdrawn bulk of its services and even private transportation, including taxis and autorickshaws, remained off the road.

Even the hospitals were bereft of crowd as the Out Patient Department was closed for the day, while hotels and restaurants remained shut.

The wholesale market at the APMC Yard and the retail selling at Devaraja Market were shut and a few daily wagers were seen snatching some sleep at the bus stand or in the open lawns.

Except for the hooting siren of an ambulance racing along the road, there was hardly any activity and traffic police used loudspeaker to admonish anyone venturing out and directed them back to their homes.

Most organisations, including the Mysore Industries Association, had expressed support to the lockdown and hence there was no industrial activity with workers asked to take a holiday. Only pharmaceutical shops were exempted from the lockdown.

The lockdown was not confined to the city alone. People in H.D. Kote town remained confined to their houses for greater part of the day.

118,2020/03/22,‘Vulture safe zone’ proposed in south Karnataka,"A ‘vulture safe zone’ that include parts of south Karnataka has been mooted to revive the population of the avian scavenger that is tottering on the brink of extinction.

The population of vultures, which were ubiquitous till their decline began in the 1990s, is yet to be assessed, but there is a general consensus that almost 96% has already been wiped out. This decline is attributed to the widespread prescription of diclofenac, a drug used extensively in the treatment of domestic cattle but extremely lethal to vultures when they feed on the cattle carcass.

Hence, a group of wildlife activists has mooted the idea of creating safe zone in and around the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve as the first step towards reclaiming and stabilising the vulture population. A vulture safe zone has been described as an area where the availability of the drug and its prescription by veterinarians will be banned.

Members of the Vulture Conservation Working Group of South India came together to formulate and implement strong actions on the ground to protect vulture populations. The meeting was held in Coimbatore some time ago and it was decided to conduct a synchronised population estimation of vultures to help understand their distribution and population estimate.

D. Rajkumar of Wildlife Conservation Foundation in Mysuru told The Hindu that the Nilgiri reserve has been mooted as a safe zone as it is one of the traditional breeding sites of vultures and human disturbance is relatively low, but for competition from other birds. These are some of the traditional breeding and foraging habitats of vultures and a ban on the use of dicoflenac around these places could ensure the safety of the birds in the long run, he said.

At present, dicoflenac is widely available in Gundlupet, Chamarajanagar, H.D. Kote, and Hunsur areas abutting Bandipur, which is part of the Nilgiri reserve. “Cattle are treated with dicoflenac and when they die, the vultures feed on their carcass and tend to develop fatal diseases,” said Mr. Rajkumar.

Though it was common to see these birds around Bandipur till 20 years ago, their numbers have declined in the past 20 years. “There was a breeding site at Beladakuppe in Bandipur till 1996, but over the years the site disappeared along with the birds owing to human disturbance, apart from the effects of dicoflenac,” said Mr. Rajkumar.

There were other members who suggested that vulture safe zones should be identified and declared in each State in south India. In Karnataka, the area comprising Bandipur and surrounding regions that are part of Nilgiri reserve was reckoned to be ideal.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ccwa8a/article31135518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGMYSVULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vulture-safe-zone-proposed-in-south-karnataka/article31135519.ece

GoK Direct is the app that would be on the Keralites’ phone now, giving info on everything from the Chief Minister’s announcements to the latest figures.

Developed by Qkopy, a Kozhikode-based start-up, this app disseminates information in Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi.

“We are now in talks with WhatsApp officials to launch a National Health Mission account that has an auto-reply mechanism,” says Arun Perooli, founder and CEO of Qkopy.

Travel history

Another major digital venture is to track patient travel history.

The flow charts put together by the technical workforce of the Information Technology (IT), Health and Police Department had become popular as a one-of-a-kind exercise in a pandemic scenario.

Kerala State IT Mission is now turning its focus on specific interventions. For example, platforms are being planned for those in isolation wards to directly interact with the authorities and for the public to report on suspected cases.

“We are in talks with some start-ups,” says Chithra S., IT Mission Director.

One such platform already in place is the COVID Tracker. The web application does contact list tracking, and health and test status of the suspects, and provides reports that form part of the State’s database. This is purely for internal use.

“We are updating the platform based on the developments,” says Vivek J. Babu, chief operating officer of ThoughtRipples Technologies Pvt Ltd., that developed the tracker.

More web platforms are being put together as the government plans to scale up its combat against the COVID threat.

Care centres

“The immediate need is for two kinds of corona care centres, one at the primary care level and the other with quarantine facilities. The module has already been approved,” says Usha Titus, Secretary, Higher Education.

The IT Mission plans to aid the local bodies and voluntary caregivers who would be part of this module with data.

“To put together a database, we will take the help of ration card data, the Akshaya centres and Kudumbashree workers,” Ms. Chithra says.

For several such projects, the authorities await support from software engineers. Their aim is to streamline all platforms so that access becomes easier.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-the-virtual-warriors-on-the-frontline/article31137015.ece
133,2020/03/22,Kerala shuts down for janata curfew,"Most people stay indoors, roads deserted as State responds to Prime Minister’s call

Across Kerala, people remained mostly indoors on Sunday in response to a call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe a janata curfew from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. as part of a countrywide attempt to rein in the COVID-19 outbreak.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had backed the proposal and requested citizens to use the interim to disinfect their homes.

‘No miracle cure’

Mr. Vijayan tweeted: “There is no miracle cure yet. Wait for science to do its job. The virus does not discriminate based on religion, nationality, or dietary habits. We have to fight this battle. Not enough evidence to claim it will go away in summer.”

Urban centres were quiet, with the roads devoid of traffic and pedestrians. Public squares and parks seemed devoid of life.

So did malls, sporting venues, and cinema halls. The sound of vehicle horns and people, the omnipresent notes of urban life, seemed supplanted by an ominous silence.

Television news channels carried the images of deserted cityscapes to lakhs of living rooms throughout the day. The panorama seemed bleak and almost the same everywhere. The metro cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kozhikode appeared desolate.

Sunday Mass

The gates of the St. Joseph’s Metropolitan Cathedral in the capital remained shut.

The clergy celebrated Sunday Mass without the usual crowd of parishioners thronging the aisle. The nearby Palayam Juma Masjid and Ganapathy Temple remained sealed.

The triad of shrines adjacent to each other is celebrated as a symbol of Kerala’s secular spirit.

The signature tea stalls on sidewalks in the capital were missing. The situation was no different in other parts of the State. The shutdown was perhaps most evident in Kasaragod, the northern district that reported a slew of COVID-19 cases.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dcjsts/article31136997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TVTVJANATACURFEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-shuts-down-for-janata-curfew/article31136998.ece
134,2020/03/22,KSRTC plunges into unprecedented crisis,"COVID-19 stops all inter-State services

With the inter-State services of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) being suspended to check the spread of COVID-19, the cash-strapped State transport undertaking has plunged into deep crisis.

The services were suspended on Saturday following the restrictions imposed in Tamil Nadu. The KSRTC had already withdrawn its services to Bengalaru. Poor patronage is another reason facing the KSRTC in the inter-State routes, according to Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran.

But, the KSRTC management cannot withdraw all the services at one stroke as the Railways had suspended all the train operations till March 31. The private stage carriers has also scaled down their services and Kassargod district is now out of bounds.

A top KSRTC official said the move was to discourage long distance journey of citizens to contain the spread of the virus. “All the buses lying in bus stations and depots that had reached from other units on Sunday morning will return back after the ‘janata curfew’ ends at 9 p.m. The buses will pick up commuters,’’ he said.

To discourage the travel, the KSRTC will limit the services in the inter-district sector and operate buses on demand. But, the officials of the operating wing said this was not feasible.

The KSRTC was able to generate only ₹3.23 crore from the 3,520 buses it operated on March 19 and only ₹3.04 crore from the 3,396 buses it plied on March 20. The revenue from the fleet will further drop with the ban on inter-State services and poor patronage and will force the management to seek government assistance to pay salary. The fall in the revenue has come at a time when the KSRTC faced ₹43.49 crore revenue deficit gap in February.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksrtc-plunges-into-unprecedented-crisis/article31136974.ece
135,2020/03/22,"Wayanad imposes curbs on Karnataka, T.N. traffic","Applicable mostly to short-distance govt., private buses

The Wayanad district administration has imposed restrictions on all vehicle movements, except trucks carrying essential commodities and emergency vehicles, from Kerala through various check-posts, on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu and Kerala-Karnataka borders.

The restrictions were imposed on Sunday as part of stepping up preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19, District Collector Adeela Abdulla said in a release here.

According to the directive, government and private buses (short distance) would be blocked round-the-clock on the Mananthavady-Kodagu highway at Tholpetty check-post on the Kerala-Karnataka border. Vehicle movements would be restricted on the Muthanga-Chamarajanagar National Highway 766 from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. However, all long-distance vehicles, including buses, essential commodity services, ambulances, and vehicles of government officials on duty would be exempted.

Vehicular traffic to Nilgiri district in Tamil Nadu from the State would be closed at Pattavayal, Choladi, Thaloor, and Cheeral check-posts on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. Essential commodity services and ambulances would be exempted.

136,2020/03/22,Huge impact in Kerala over suspension of trains,"Long-distance passengers and migrant workers will be the worst hit

Inter-city and inter-State travel of Keralites in mail and express trains has come to a standstill by the railway’s decision to suspend all operations in the country till March 31 to contain the spread of SARS-CoV 2 virus.

The long distance commuters and the migrant workers will be the worst hit by the decision of the railways.

Cancellations up

The cancellation of train tickets has gone up by 80% on the railways network in the last few days.

The train operations, that were suspended to drum up support for the Sunday’s janata curfew, will resume only on April 1. Only goods trains will run from March 22 midnight till March 31 midnight.

However, trains that had already commenced their journey, prior to 4 a.m. on March 22, will continue their trip.

Uncertainty prevails over the outstation railway personnel such as coach attendants on these trains. They will have to be taken care of in the stations where the trains terminate till operations are resumed, a senior railway official said.

Hundreds stranded

Migrant labourers who had not been able to leave for their native places by Saturday and Keralites who had booked tickets to proceed to the cities and towns in the west, north and north-eastern had been stranded.

Hundreds who depend on inter-city trains to go to their workplaces had also been hit. “Taking leave is the only option before me as there is no alternate mode of transport. I had depended on the Jan Shatabdi to commute daily from the capital to Alappuzha,” says Preethy M. Kumar, District Programme Officer, Sarva Siksha Kerala, Alappuzha.

Vendors, catering staff, cleaning staff, those running stalls on railway premises, porters, taxi and autorickshaw drivers and staff working in the parking lot will be affected badly.

With the suspension of train operations, the booking and reservation offices will remain closed and entry to the railway stations will be out of bounds for citizens.

The railways will reduce the personnel in other offices from Monday in tune with the directive of the Centre to reduce the staff by 50%, sources said.

Station Masters and two Group D staff will have to be present in the stations round the clock due to goods train movement.

“The railways should ensure the movement of the goods trains as it is essential for a consumer State like Kerala,” says P. Krishnakumar, member, Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee.

Since Saturday midnight, 10 goods trains carrying crude oil, fertiliser, cement and foods grain had moved through Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram railway division.

The railways are looking into the possibility of exempting the Station Masters above 55 years from duty by introducing 12 hour shift, a railway official in the operations wing said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4c4y96/article31136965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TVTV-JANTACURFEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/huge-impact-in-state-over-suspension-of-trains/article31136966.ece
137,2020/03/22,Three held in Wayanad,"26-year-old held for skipping home quarantine

The police arrested three persons in the district on the day of the nationwide Janta Curfew on Sunday in connection with violation of norms.

The police arrested Sudheesh, 26, at Maniyangode in the district for skipping the 14-day home quarantine made mandatory for those returning from foreign countries as part of the precautions against the COVID-19 scare.

The Padinharethara police arrested two youths for creating a mass gathering by selling meat on the day. Those arrested were identified as Sajith,37, and Abdul Rasheed,37, of Puthenveettil at Thengumunda near Padinharethara.

The police also registered a case against a mosque committee in Wayanad district for allowing mass prayer attended by more than 70 people.

138,2020/03/22,Kasaragod patient’s conduct baffling,"He slipped out of airport without passport, re-entered and talked to other passengers

The antecedents of the Kasaragod resident who tested positive for COVID-19 and roamed around infecting a large number of people is getting murkier with the Customs confirming that he was in their watch list after getting caught in the past for smuggling.

He was booked for smuggling in 6,000 cigarettes worth around ₹36,000 through the Karipur airport on September 17 last year. The contraband was confiscated and penalty imposed.

Two accomplices

Further deepening the mystery, it has now emerged that he had two accomplices with him on the same Air India Express flight from Dubai to Karipur on March 11.

Since they were all on the customs watch list, their passports were collected and they were sent to fetch their baggage before presenting themselves for the secondary-level customs examination. However, all three sneaked out of the airport with their baggage unchecked leaving the passport with the customs officials.

The officials, preoccupied with clearing other passengers, noticed it only at the end of their shift. “Those engaged in smuggling rarely do such things as it would be an easy giveaway,” said Customs Commissioner Sumit Kumar.

Frequent fliers

It is now known that all three were frequent fliers without the means to justify such a status and had between them returned from abroad through the Karipur airport 28 times in just over three months between December 2019 and March 12 this year. Customs believe that they have strong links with the gold smuggling racket which has deep roots in north Kerala.

“While the key suspect, an autorickshaw driver, has passed through the airport 13 times during the period, the other two have moved nine and six times respectively. This is just the data from the Karipur airport and they could have used other airports as well,” Mr. Kumar said.

The Customs Air Intelligence Unit at Karipur had since then issued summons to all three of them, two of whom are now in home quarantine while the key suspect is in isolation ward after testing positive for COVID-19. Customs will issue fresh summons as the previous one is set to expire on Monday. Customs plan to issue non-bailable warrants against them if they fail to appear and cooperate with the investigation after they get cured. “By disappearing and not following the directive to present himself for examination with his luggage, the key suspect appears to have prima facie committed obstruction which is an offence under Customs Act subject to both civil penalty of up to ₹4 lakh and criminal prosecution with punishment up to 2 years and fine,” said Mr. Kumar.

Mystery

CCTV footage shows the key suspect sneaking out of the airport only to return later and then exiting again. “How he managed to slip out without the passport is a mystery. He was found re-entering and roaming for a few hours talking to other passengers before exiting again. It should also be inquired how he managed to re-enter without enough credentials,” Mr. Kumar said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kasaragod-patients-conduct-baffling/article31136957.ece

140,2020/03/22,People come together to revive Wadakkanchery Puzha,"The river has turned a sewage canal in many areas

The Wadakkanchery Puzha, which was on the verge of death, is getting a fresh lease of life, thanks to rejuvenation efforts with the involvement of people.

The river, also known as the Vazhani river as it originates from the Vazhani forest, used to irrigate more than 2,500 hectares of agricultural land. As many as 368 streams were flowing into the 51.3-km river. Once the lifeline of an area of 760 sq km, the river was reduced to a sewage canal in many places due to encroachments and dumping of waste. Many of the streams, which used to feed the river, dried up. As the river dried up, wells and ponds, which used to get replenished by its water also went dry.

The silt deposited during the two floods aggravated the situation. The rejuvenation mission by a people’s movement aims at removing the garbage and silt deposited during the floods and clearing the encroachments.

Streams too

Along with people, voluntary organisations, political parties, workers’ unions, traders and cultural leaders joined hands in the efforts to rejuvenate the river. The trees blocking the flow of water will also be removed. The project will also strengthen the water flow in the streams and protect the riverbed. Efforts are on to evict around 10 acres of encroachments on the river. A survey for it has already been done.

Minister A.C. Modieen, Anil Akkara, MLA, Wadakkanchery Municipal chairperson Sivapriya Santhosh and other leaders are supporting the move. The government has allocated ₹10 crore to rejuvenate streams reaching the river to ensure flow of water through it.

Hundreds of loads of silt deposited in the river has been removed. People participate in the mission in different ways. Some provide food to the workers and some others are filling diesel to the JCB and vehicles removing sand.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/people-come-together-to-revive-wadakkanchery-puzha/article31136937.ece

142,2020/03/22,People remain home heeding PM’s janata curfew call,"Total shutdown in Thrissur, Palakkad, and Malappuram on Sunday; residents engage in house cleaning activities

Keeping aside their political differences, people in the Palakkad and Malappuram districts responded positively to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a janata curfew on Sunday. Both the districts witnessed a total shutdown never seen even during hartals called by major political parties. Roads and streets remained deserted as people chose to spend their time home.

There was none to impose the curfew. Almost all business establishments and shops, except some canteens and restaurants near hospitals, remained closed.

Railway stations and bus stands in these districts too were deserted as no public vehicle was in service. The shutdown by Railways gave a fillip to the curfew. Many people chose to clean up their home premises as exhorted by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. However, there were not many takers for the clapping and clanking at 5 p.m. as suggested by Mr. Modi. Most organisations lent support to the janata curfew call as the COVID-19 situation in the country threatened to turn worse.

Special Correspondent writes from Thrissur: People in the district wholeheartedly cooperated with the janata curfew on Sunday.

In Thrissur

Roads remained empty and shops remained closed. Religious institutions too were closed for the public. Churches asked the faithful to attend the Sunday Mass online. Private and public vehicles kept off the road.

As Railways have cancelled many trains, only a few people were seen at railway stations. At the Kodungalloor town, where Section 144 was declared as the Bharani festival was round the corner, remained deserted. The Section 144 was declared as a large number of people reached the town for the Kozhikkalu Moodal ritual held two days ago despite the restrictions announced by the Health Department and district administration.

There are 8,792 people under observation for COVID-19 in the district. Of them, 40 are in hospitals.

147,2020/03/22,Wild elephants create panic,"Straying on to the Konni-Thannithode-Chittar Road

The straying of wild elephants on to the Konni-Thannithode-Chittar Road in the hilly tracts of the district bordering the forests even in day time has left the villagers as well as the passengers panicky.

There were instances of two-wheeler riders making a narrow escape from these pachyderms on the road during the past one week.

According to reports received here on Sunday, wild elephants were spotted near Mundommoozhy Model Forest Station building under construction near Elavumkal, and at Peruvalley.

The Forest Department has erected caution boards at Elimullumplackal and Mundommozhy warning the passerby on the wild elephant threat in the area.

The lean vehicular traffic on this road in the wake of the ongoing anti-COVID-19 campaign in the district too might have contributed to the recent straying of wild elephants into this reach of human habitation, a villager said.

Experts say the water scarcity in the forest interiors has been leading to frequent straying of wild animals into human habitations along the forest fringes.

With the drying up of water sources in the scorching summer, instances of wild animals straying into villages is on the rise in many parts of the district.

The changes taking place in the forest eco system owing to climate change and excessive human intervention, were also identified as factors leading to straying of wild animals into human habitation where they could get cattle and dog as easy prey.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/492tly/article31136864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv23ptelephs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wild-elephants-create-panic/article31136852.ece

Chinnakkada, the busy city centre of Kollam, wore a totally deserted look on Sunday along with all other junctions that usually remain abuzz during morning hours.

The janata curfew has been nearly complete in the district, even in rural parts, except for police vehicles and stray cyclists. Unlike other days Asramam maidan had no morning walkers and the string of small shops surrounding it including tea stalls remained closed. Since KSRTC buses, taxi services and autorickshaws totally kept off the road there was almost zero traffic on all major roads in the city including National Highways.

While the public stayed indoors, all shops, restaurants and other business outlets kept their shutters closed from 7 a.m. Kollam KSRTC stand and railway station reported minimal activity while reports of complete shutdown were received from places like Chathannur, Kottiyam, Punalur, Kottarakara and Pathanapuram. Fire and Rescue teams were seen cleaning and disinfecting public spaces including bus stands.

Though temples were opened for morning pooja, entry was restricted and several temple authorities had already informed the devotees that they will not be allowed darshan.

Infant Jesus Cathedral, Thangasseri, suspended the regular Sunday mass for the laity following the instructions of Kollam Bishop Antony Mullassery.

Since dairy farmers and distributors participated in the curfew, milk distribution was partially affected in the district.

Usually milk reaches the Milma agencies across the district from 4.30 a.m, but on Sunday the distribution line was not functional. In the evening families from many apartment complexes and residential areas came out clapping hands and clanking metal plates (thalis) expressing their appreciation and gratitude towards those working in the Health sector.

Hospitals and medical stores functioned as usual.

In Pathanamthitta

Special Correspondent writes from Pathanamthitta: A virtual lockdown was observed in Pathanamthitta district to mark the janata curfew, initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight COVID-19 on Sunday.

The entire population observed a self-imposed quarantine. People remained at their homes through out the janata curfew period. Vehicles kept off the roads, giving all towns, villages and towns a deserted look. There were also reports of people clapping their hands beating drums from their homes, later, in the afternoon, extending full support to the janata curfew and various other initiatives of the government to fight the COVID-19 threat.

Meanwhile, the Kerala Vyapari Vyavsayi Ekopana Samiti has decided to restrict the functioning of shops in Thiruvalla town from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday in view of the COVID-19 threat.

In Kottayam

Staff Reporter writes from Kottayam: The self-imposed janata curfew called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was complete in Kottayam with people confining themselves to their homes throughout the day.

The roads wore a deserted look right from the morning as public transport came to a standstill.

Barring a few two-wheelers, there were no vehicle movements along the major and internal roads.

All shops and other business establishments including the fuel stations remained closed.

The churches in the district, which generally witness huge gatherings on Sundays, too wore a deserted look as the mass was celebrated without the gathering of the faithful.

Earlier in the day, the police offered assistance to a 28-member group of inter-State migrant workers and their family members, who had been asked to leave the Kottayam railway station. The group, mostly comprising estate workers from Nedumkandam in Idukki, had reached Kottayam the other day for boarding a train to Kolkota on Sunday evening.

With the train service coming to a halt, they were asked to leave the station premises immediately. Soon, the local police intervened in the issue, offered the group members food and water and shifted them to the Kottayam General Hospital, where they have been accommodated currently.

In Alappuzha

Staff Reporter writes from Alappuzha:

The people of Alappuzha joined others in the country in observing ‘Janata curfew’ on Sunday, in a bid to tackle the spread of COVID-19.

The Alappuzha town and other places in the district wore a deserted look with the majority of the people deciding to remain indoors. All shops and commercial establishments remained shut. Roads were empty as the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private buses kept off road. The State Water Transport Department too joined the curfew by not operating services.

In the evening, people clapped, clanged utensils in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for thanking those at the forefront of the fight against the COVID-19. As of Sunday evening, 4,428 people were under home quarantine in the district. Besides, 11 people were admitted to isolation wards in Government Medical College, Alappuzha, General Hospital, Alappuzha, Taluk Hospital, Kayamkulam and Taluk Hospital, Haripad with symptoms of the disease.

Of the samples collected from 142 people so far, 138 have been tested negative for COVID-19.

149,2020/03/22,Health dept. unveils contingency plans,"Possible public health emergency in State anticipated

As the number of new COVID-19 cases shows a spike and the State is exploring the option of a total lockdown to prevent the movement of people, the Health Department unveiled its contingency plans, Plan B and C, which have been drawn up in anticipation of a possible public health emergency in the State.

The department had devised Plan A, B and C, with the help of its core committees managing infrastructure and private hospital coordination, anticipating that the number of people who would have to be put in isolation could go up drastically, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said in a statement here on Sunday.

Recruitment

The department conducted temporary recruitment of doctors to be deployed in Kasaragod if required.

The department was engaged in a massive exercise of arranging and putting on stand-by health care personnel, drugs, personal protection equipment, ventilators and other facilities, she said.

Plan A included 50 government hospitals and two private hospitals, which envisaged the availability of 974 isolation beds with provision of 242 additional beds if required.

Plan B, which was prepared as a complement to Plan A, included another 71 government hospitals and 55 private hospitals and envisaged the availability of 1,408 isolation beds.

However, the State’s containment efforts had been working well and as the patient numbers were still in two digits, Plan B had been put on stand by, she said.

Plan C was prepared to manage a situation when the community spread of COVID-19 became a reality and the government would need to find as many hospital beds as possible in the system as well as the private sector. It envisaged the provision of 3,028 isolation beds and 218 ICU beds.

Care centres

The State had also identified 147 buildings across the State as corona care centres, as part of Plan B.

These were being readied if huge number of people have to be quarantined, especially if these persons did not have the facility to go on strict self-isolation in their own homes. These centres together could accommodate 21,866 persons.

Government and private institutions as well as institutions with hostel facilities had been identified for the purpose, the Minister said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/health-dept-unveils-contingency-plans/article31136685.ece
150,2020/03/22,Government rules out Statewide lockdown,"Kasaragod to remain fully isolated

The government on Sunday indicated that the current COVID-19 epidemic scenario did not warrant a State-wide lockdown.

Kasaragod district, which reported five new cases, is on lockdown since Saturday. The administration has suspended all non-essential services and clamped down on gatherings and free movement of people.

The government also brought Kozhikode under prohibitory orders to restrict the assemblage of people. However, the administration has not suspended commerce or travel but merely narrowed working hours between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.

The Union government has advised State governments to issue appropriate orders to allow only essential services to operate in 75 districts across the country, 10 of which are in Kerala — Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Idukki, Kannur, Kasaragod, Kottayam, Malappuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram.

The advisory has triggered a measure of uncertainty in Kerala with several news channels interpreting it as an inviolable lockdown order from the Centre. The office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan attempted to clear the air by refuting the news reports that State was on the cusp of a crippling lockdown.

It said the government had not planned to impose any new restrictions than those already in force. Chief Secretary Tom Jose, later, clarified that the Centre had given Kerala considerable latitude to decide its course of action in the matter.

As of now, the government did not perceive a situation that warranted suspension of ordinary life to ward off the pandemic in the districts listed as COVID-19 affected by the Centre.

The government had already banned assemblies, imposed social distancing norms stringently and restricted inter-State travel. The measures are enough for now. However, the situation remained fluid.

Late Saturday, Mr. Jose empowered Collectors of other districts to invoke the provisions of the Act and issue prohibitory orders to bring life to a standstill in their respective jurisdictions if the pandemic situation worsened.

However, the Collectors would require the prior concurrence of the Additional Chief Secretary, Home.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/government-rules-out-statewide-lockdown/article31136665.ece
151,2020/03/22,KSEB seeks rationalisation of KSERC fees,"This will ease its fiscal strain and avert chances of shifting the burden to public

The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has sought government intervention to rationalise the fees being levied by the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) under various heads to ease its fiscal strain and avert the chances of shifting the burden to the public.

The board being the only largest public utility or licencee in the State, is now being forced to cough up substantial sums for licence renewal, truing up petition filing fees, approval of tariff revision petition and such others regularly.

The resource-starved board is scraping the bottom of the barrel for footing its committed expenditure, including salary, payments due to contractors and others. It is heavily dependent on the borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. The present revenue gap has been pegged at ₹500 crore and has loans for ₹6,000 crore.

Despite the mounting commitments, the board is drawing power from all available sources and distributing it. The soaring demand that has resulted in an increase in business volume and revenue is costing it dearly.

The fees rates levied by the commission are not proportionate to its expenses, but are directly linked to the revenue of the licencee. Given the volume of the purchase and distribution, the board is the worst-hit by the alleged disparity in fee rates.

Board chairman N.S. Pillai, in a letter to the government, pointed out that the commission had a huge corpus and the accumulation of the surplus over the years could be attributed to the high fees collected for all petitions filed by the board from time to time.

He cited the commission’s annual report for 2018-19 as a case in point. The commission has a corpus of ₹40.75 crore and 96% of the funds have been parked as fixed and other deposits. The revenue expenditure of the commission is well below 50% of its income. Against an expenditure of ₹3.06 crore for 2018-19, it has fixed deposits for ₹39.38 crore. It has adequate funds at its disposal to meet its expenses for the next 10 years, while the board is operating on a shoe-string budget.

Hence, the board said that there was ample leeway for rationalising the fee structure keeping in mind the fund requirements of the commission and urged the government to sort out the issue in consultation with the commission.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kseb-seeks-rationalisation-of-kserc-fees/article31135802.ece
152,2020/03/22,COVID-19 | Local body elections in Kerala unlikely to be affected by pandemic,"Those at the State Election Commission (SEC), who are overseeing the conduct of the elections, hope that the spread of the disease will be contained in two months and the election process will be held in October, as per schedule.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to impact the elections to the 1,200-odd local bodies in the State and the polls are likely to be held in October itself.

Those at the State Election Commission (SEC), who are overseeing the conduct of the elections, hope that the spread of the disease will be contained in two months and the election process will be initiated on time.

V. Bhaskaran, the State Election Commissioner, exuded confidence that the elections could be held in October as decided earlier.

Any change in the schedule could lead to Constitutional crisis, as the newly elected local bodies will have to assume office in November this year. The term of local bodies has been fixed as five years through a Constitutional amendment by which the Panchayat Raj Act was introduced in the country.

“As of now, there is no change in the elections schedule. Even if the containment of the disease may take some more time, the elections could be held on time,” Mr. Bhaskaran told The Hindu.

The State Delimitation Commission, which has four senior government secretaries and the SEC as its chairman, is likely to meet shortly to reschedule the two-day training programme for officials who were to carry out the delimitation of wards in the local bodies. The proposal of delimitation of wards will be made by the secretaries of local bodies. The officials of the local bodies are currently focusing on COVID-19 control measures. The training programme was to be held on April 7 and 8.

The number of wards in local bodies will be revised through delimitation process after considering the increase in population in each local body during the last 10 years. The draft list of wards thus prepared will be published and objections invited. The final list will be published after holding a public hearing.

Political parties keenly follow the delimitation process, as redrawing of the contours of the divisions could influence the poll outcome.

The draft electoral list for all the districts except Kasaragod will be published on March 27. In Kasaragod, it would be released on April 6 as the district has gone for a compete shutdown following the detection of a few COVID-19 cases. The voters will get two opportunities more before the polls to enrol themselves in the list. The final voters’ list, which will be published after providing the general public opportunities to enrol themselves in the list, will be used for the 2020 elections, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/local-body-elections-as-scheduled/article31135579.ece
153,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Kerala to observe stringent lockdown only in Kasargode district,"The Chief Minister’s office dismissed reports that the government planned to bring more districts in the State under total lockdown

The office of the Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, on Sunday dismissed news reports that the government planned to bring more districts in the State under total lockdown.

In a statement here, the office stated that the government had stringently regulated public life only in Kasargode for now.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose said of the seven new fresh COVID-19 cases that were detected in the State on Sunday, five were from Kasargode. Those infected had recently returned from the Gulf.

Given the gravity of the epidemic situation in Kasargode, the government was constrained to impose a total shutdown without disrupting essential services and procurement of food, milk, medicine and other commodities, he said.

The number of infections reported in Kerala has risen from 49 to 54 in the past 24 hours.

The Centre had advised the Kerala government to lockdown at least seven districts which had reported COVID-19 infections. However, it had given the State considerable latitude in making its own decisions.

The Union government on Sunday advised State governments to issue appropriate orders to allow only essential services to operate in the 75 districts across the country, ten of which are in Kerala - Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Idukki, Kannur, Kasargode, Kottayam, Malappuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram.

As of now, an official said the government felt the situation did not warrant measures to bring life to a total standstill in other districts. It has merely advised the district collectors to enforce the restrictions the government had already put in place last week.

They included the closure of cinema halls, public parks, stadiums, malls and supermarkets that attract huge crowds.

The government had also banned inter-State travel and advised people to restrict their journey to neighbouring districts. It has asked places of worship not to entertain crowds and to stick to religious rites alone.

Epidemic Diseases Act

The State government had late on Friday invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to regulate public life in the northern district given the COVID-19 threat.

It had on Saturday night authorised Collectors of other districts to invoke the provisions of the Act if the outbreak situation in their respective jurisdictions worsened.

The government had invoked the provisions to order the closure of temples, mosques, churches and other centres of worship for the next two weeks in Kasargode. Other communal spaces such as clubs, cinema theatres, parks and public places in the district also remained shut.

Government offices would also remain closed for one week. However, the district collector has placed State employees on standby for immediate deployment. He has ordered them to stay in the district.

The government has allowed commercial establishments to open for business only between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.

Only establishments that provided essential services, such as medical and provision stores, could remain open during usual business hours in Kasargode.

Any violation of the Act entails a punishment of up to six months of imprisonment and a fine of not less than ₹1000.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2nedpv/article31135299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thiru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-kerala-to-observe-stringent-lockdown-only-in-kasargode-district/article31135300.ece
154,2020/03/22,"Poultry sector totters, on the verge of closure in Kerala","Fall in chicken price in the wake of avian flu and COVID-19

Sharp decline in chicken price in the wake of avian flu and COVID-19 has heavily affected the domestic poultry market in the State.

At a time when the break even price for producing a kg of chicken is ₹77.85 in the State, the average selling price now is only ₹20. Market price in Thrissur is currently around ₹18.

“One load of chicken, weighing around 4,500 kg, was sold at ₹8 a kg from a farm in the State two days ago. Big farms are incurring a loss ₹30-60 lakh a day. If this situation continues, the poultry industry in the State will be closed,” said Binny Emmatty, State president, Poultry Farmers and Traders Samithi. According to unofficial statistics, Kerala used to consume around one-crore kg of chicken a week.

“But the consumption of poultry meat and eggs has come down substantially now. Outbreak of COVID-19 and bird flu in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts has further reduced consumption and farmers are compelled to sell chicken at throw away prices,” said T.P. Sethumadhavan, former director, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU).

Travel ban and measures to reduce transmission chain for controlling COVID-19 have reduced the number of consumers in the urban and rural poultry farms. This trend is prevalent across the country and more in south India. On an average, it causes a monthly loss of around ₹300 crore.

Restrictions on get-togethers, weddings and meetings further aggravated the situation. Now farmers are trying to dispose of live birds and evade the sector. Price of poultry meat and eggs from Tamil Nadu had also been reduced, Dr. Sethumadhavan said.

Farmers and entrepreneurs are unable to repay the loan. Without adequate support, this sector cannot be revived in the near future. Nearly five-lakh families in the State are involved in poultry farming. Kerala Chicken through Kudumbashree is also facing the same fate.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/y9p6qg/article31140751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvtrchokKKN3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/poultry-sector-on-the-verge-of-closure/article31135239.ece
155,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Centre advices Kerala to lock down seven districts,"The districts likely to be brought under lockdown are Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta, Kasargode, Malappuram, Kannur and Kottayam.

The Centre on Sunday advised the Kerala government to lockdown seven districts.

The decision came soon after the Union Cabinet Secretary held a video conference with Chief Secretaries of respective State governments.

The districts likely to be brought under lockdown are Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta, Kasargode, Malappuram, Kannur and Kottayam.

The move attempts to regulate pubic life by encouraging people to work from home and limit their access to communal spaces.

The lockdown targets localities where health officials had detected COVID-19 infections and flagged the threat of community spread.

Kerala Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, interacting with journalists, said that there was no cause for panic. Essential services would continue un-impeded. Medical shops and grocery stores will remain open. The government has gone into a huddle to decide how the lockdown would pan out.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is likely to make a public announcement on the development.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/eqbbw9/article31134817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/malla,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-centre-advices-kerala-to-lock-down-seven-districts/article31134818.ece
156,2020/03/22,Janata Curfew: Kerala aligns itself with the rest of the country to combat COVID-19,"There is no miracle cure yet. Wait for science to do its job, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan says in a tweet

Kerala on Sunday appeared to align itself with the rest of the country with a sizeable majority of people choosing to remain mostly indoors in a public bid to limit the community spread of the COVID-19 infection.

A large section of the public seemed to have heeded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to observe a Janata Curfew from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had backed the move and additionally requested citizens to set aside time to disinfect their homes.

Mr. Vijayan tweeted: “There is no miracle cure yet. Wait for science to do its job. The virus does not discriminate based on religion, nationality or dietary habits. We have to fight this battle. Not enough evidence to claim it will go away in summer.”

The Chief Minister’s message suggested that the fight to defeat the pestilence is likely to be a long haul. Mr. Vijayan is monitoring the epidemic situation from his official residence at the Cliff House here. He is expected to make a public announcement in the evening.

Capital at a standstill

Meanwhile, the State capital, Thiruvananthapuram, appeared eerily still with no pedestrians or traffic on the roads. Public squares and parks appeared abandoned. All avenues for entertainment, including malls, sporting enclaves, floodlit outdoor turfs and cinema halls, remained sealed.

The ubiquitous sound of vehicle horns and people was strangely absent. Few citizens ventured out of their homes.

Television channels continuously aired the images of the deserted cityscape. The panorama seemed the same everywhere, including the cities of Kochi and Kozhikode.

The Thampanoor Central station appeared desolate, with Railways whittling down services. Railway staff in personal protective gear disinfected the platforms and coaches. The airport activities almost came to a standstill, with very few airlines operating flights.

Places of worship shut

The gates of the iconic St. Joseph’s Metropolitan Cathedral in the capital remained shut. The clergy celebrated Sunday Mass, but without the usual crowd of parishioners thronging the aisles and spilling on to the grounds outside.

Nearby, the Palayam Juma Masjid and Ganapathy Temple also remained sealed. The triad of shrines of different faiths sited adjacent to each other at Palayam in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram is often celebrated in images and literature as a symbol of the State’s secular spirit.

The signature tea stalls on sidewalks were missing. The capital had shut down its stadiums, beaches, public parks and weekend tourist destinations since last week, disrupting the schedule of hundreds of urbanites habituated to morning walks.

The historic Chalai market was like a ghost town. Most of the shops remained shuttered. Only a few flower stalls selling funeral wreaths were open. The landmark Connemara Market, established by the British colonial rulers in 1857, in Palayam also remained closed.

Appeal by politicians and actors

An assemblage of politicians, bureaucrats and celebrity actors came on air to make the public aware of the need to maintain social distance to break the spread of the virus.

Television channels and FM radio stations broadcasted the messages of a range of film stars and social media celebrities. Actors Mohan Lal and Mammooty, who have a sizeable fan following in Kerala, led the campaigning.

Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala met reporters at his official residence at Cantonment House here. He said the government should shutter bars and liquor outlets to prevent overcrowding and follow the example set by Rajasthan by introducing a four-hour workday.

Most Cabinet Ministers remained at their homes to set an example for other citizens. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran claimed to journalists that he had swept the grounds of his official residence himself. He said he had earlier asked his concierge staff to go on leave and remain at their homes.

Finance Minister Thomas Isaac held forth on the State’s economy to reporters he met at his official residence, the sprawling Manmohan Bungalow near the Kerala Raj Bhavan.

Health Minister K. K. Shylaja saw journalists at her residence. She warned of strict action against those who disregarded health safeguards and caused the spread of the pestilence due to personal negligence and unwillingness to quarantine themselves. “The time of requests and pleas are over”, she told a television channel.

Appeal to Tamil Nadu

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty told reporters in Kollam that the government had asked Tamil Nadu not to deter vegetables coming into Kerala through the Aryankavu check-post.

Some overzealous Tamil Nadu officials had detained few loads of perishables bound to Kerala on their side of the border. Ms. Mercykutty foresaw no shortage for food grains, edible oil, pulses, sugar or fuel.

The government is coordinating with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to ensure that supplies freighted to Kerala from other regions reached local markets and replenished store shelves.

Police Chief works from home

State Police Chief Loknath Behera, dressed in paramilitary camouflage fatigues, worked from his home. His officers had set up a small space as a control room with video conferencing facility. Mr. Behera is scheduled to join other bureaucrats on a video conference with the Union Cabinet Secretary. He also used the police net to coordinate with intelligence officials and district police chiefs.

162,2020/03/22,Panic buying marks ‘Janata Curfew’ eve,"People throng supermarkets triggered by fears of lockdown

Triggered by the COVID-19 scare and the Prime Minister’s call for a ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday, people thronged supermarkets in most towns in Palakkad and Malappuram districts for procuring groceries and other essential commodities.

Fear of an impending lockdown struck people as they scurried through supermarkets, carrying large baskets and trolleys, unmindful of the threat and warning about COVID-19 precautions.

A supermarket in Malappuram town had to down its shutters and restrict people by Saturday afternoon as customers crowded the shop. People caught in the rush found solace in hand sanitisers offered by the supermarket.

“This is not just a day’s rush. We have been witnessing an unprecedented rush over the last four days. People are anticipating a lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 spread. That is why they engage in such panicky large-scale shopping,” said Abdul Rahman, a salesman at a Palakkad supermarket.

A day after Twitter pulled down two of his tweets including a video on the ‘Janata Curfew’ for misrepresenting facts, actor Rajinikanth on Sunday claimed that his statement in the video was not understood properly.

“I had said that if we respect the curfew and stay at home for 14 hours, we can prevent India from entering the Stage 3 (of this pandemic).

The actor said that the government’s instructions should be followed until the spread of COVID-19 is brought under control. “We must follow self-isolation as long as recommended by the government and concentrate on defeating the disease.

169,2020/03/22,Muslim outfits vow to come back stronger against citizenship law,"‘There will not be any issue in restarting the agitation as feared by protesters’

Islamic organisations in Tamil Nadu were in a spot of bother last week as they had to temporarily suspend and postpone their protests against the Centre and State government demanding a repeal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens owing to COVID-19 threat.

As the number of cases continued to increase, the Shaheen-Bagh like protests became untenable and were eventually suspended.

While the Old Washermenpet protests went on for two more days and shut down eventually on Tuesday midnight following calls from community leaders and DMK president M. K. Stalin, Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamat’s protests on March 18 were also scaled down and cut short as a precautionary measure against COVID-19.

With protests already withdrawn, there is a concern in the community over the future of anti-CAA protests in the country and whether it can be restarted with the same fervour and when.

Fathima Muzaffer, member, All India Muslim Personal Law Board, and IUML leader, said that the break will allow the protesters to regroup and look into the various issues.

“The protests in the last three months have been deeply engraved in the minds of people, they know that these black laws threaten their ‘Indianness’. This break will help us regroup. It cannot bring down the spirit or our commitment. It has gone to a stage where the Hindus also realise how they will be affected by this exercise,” she said.

She said that the anti-CAA protesters will organise a ‘balcony’ protest at around 5 p.m. on March 22. “We will acknowledge the service of doctors and nurses and others in their fight against COVID-19 spread and we will also shout slogans against CAA, NRC and NPR,” she said.

K.M. Kader Mohideen, National President, Indian Union Muslim League, said that the party has been communicating to the cadre and the community that it has been opposing the CAA, NPR and NRC in all appropriate forums – including in the Parliament and in the State Assemblies of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, but it is important to consider COVID-19 as a natural disaster.

“We are in the midst of corona virus pandemic — since it is spreading like anything, we should treat it like a natural disaster. IUML will continue to fight for the rights, but in the light of the threat posed by corona virus, it is not right to protests in large numbers on the road as it can be misconstrued by the larger population that Islamic community isn’t co-operating to stop the spread of COVID-19,” he said.

We need to act responsibly, he added.

M.H. Jawahirullah, president, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, said that there will not be any issue in restarting the protests as feared by protesters. “It is only a temporary break. It is not that we cannot mobilise the people again. The reasons for the protests (CAA, NPR and NRC) continue to exist. This is just a postponement for the nation. There are different styles of agitation – Gandhiji did not stick with just one mode of agitation. There are other ways to put pressure on the Government,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/77x469/article31133270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PONDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/muslim-outfits-vow-to-come-back-stronger-against-citizenship-law/article31133272.ece
170,2020/03/22,Chhavi Thakur: Making the difference for Prabhu Deva,"The costume stylist, who switched over from a career as an air hostess, discusses 'Bagheera', actor-filmmaker Prabhu Deva’s upcoming movie directed by Adhik Ravichandran

Artistes sporting flashy costumes for dance sequences was a thing in the ’90s. Prabhudheva was no different. His choice of costumes stood out like his choreography — which had him bend his body and, with it, your mind.

In recent times, however, the actor-filmmaker’s apparel choice has reflected a generational change, although his penchant for being a part of foot-tapping numbers filmed with an elaborately designed and constructed set as backdrop remains. Whether it is Devi, Gulaebaghavali or the recently-released Street Dancer 3D, Prabhudheva’s outfits set the actor apart but does it subtly.

Making a difference

Credit for his changeover, the actor attests, to his stylist Chhavi Thakur, whom we recently caught up with when the shoot for Bagheera, the Adhik Ravichandran film that has Prabhudheva essay multiple characters, was halted due to the Coronavirus scare. A Delhiite based in Mumbai, Chhavi switched over from a career as cabin crew with the now-defunct Jet Airways to be a stylist in films.

“I knew in my mind that [being an air hostess] wasn’t going to be a long term career. When I wanted to change [career], I wanted to pursue something where I knew I could give my 100% and flourish. That is how it happened,” she says.

For someone without much on-the-job experience in fashion, Chhavi adds that she relied on YouTube videos and Google to brush up her knowledge. And when she landed her first opportunity, as an assistant in the costume department, it was for the Sanjay Gupta film Shootout at Wadala (2013).

“It is not everyday you get to work on a period film (Shootout at Wadala was set in the ’80s) as your first project. I learnt a lot on how to age clothes, and the kind of research I did with the film’s stylist to understand the kind of clothes that were used then...it gave me a lot of insight into the industry,” she says.

After Shootout at Wadala came the offer to work for National Award-winning costume designer Neeta Lulla. “I jumped at the opportunity. She is very hands-on with her work. Most of the designers let their assistants handle things on set. But she was out there doing her work to perfection, keeping actors at ease and providing the director with what he/she wants,” she adds.

Creative dose

That work ethic she absorbed from Neeta could well be why Adhik Ravichandran speaks in hyperbole when asked of her contribution in Bagheera. “She is the mastermind [for Bagheera’s costumes]. The film has a lot of characters, and each one has its own way of dressing, colours and styles. To handle these many characters is difficult for a costume stylist, but the outfits she has picked makes the characters stand out. When the first look was released, many were asking what Prabhu master was wearing,” says Adhik.

While both Adhik and Chhavi hold the mystery of Bagheera’s “different characters” close to their chest, the latter hints that there weren’t many references she could rely on for drawing up her outfit choices — unlike the previous Prabhudheva films she worked on like Devi or the unreleased film Yung Mung Sung.

“Yung Mung Sung is a period film, and we wanted to depict the characters as kung fu students of a bygone era. I had to watch a lot of kung fu films as homework. In Devi, the director (AL Vijay) wanted a South Indian rural look for characters; we discussed about the jewellery that elderly women wear. I watched a lot of Tamil films because I wanted to make myself aware of the culture before delivering,” she says.

“In Bagheera, we have crafted the looks based on the character’s personality trait and age. There is a lot of out-of-the-box thinking involved,” she adds.

Like in any profession, costume designing and styling is also a cut throat business. “You have to make your mark, especially since there are a lot of stylists and designers who cater to the same person,” says Chhavi. She says she owes it to Prabhudheva for choosing her from the crowd, “He is the person responsible for what I am today. In that sense, he is my godfather [in cinema]. I never thought I’d be an air hostess or a stylist. I keep evolving with the moment,” she concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ammigf/article31136484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPYung-Mung-Sung-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/making-the-difference-for-prabhu-deva/article31136485.ece

174,2020/03/22,COVID-19 dents Singareni’s coal production plans to meet target,"Production in all its 45 mines is shut for 24 hours as part of Janata Curfew

With the coal production in all its 18 opencast and 27 underground mines coming to a halt for 24 hours, from 6 a.m. on Sunday to 6 a.m. on Monday, in response to the ‘Janata Curfew’ call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) plans to achieve the target appear to have become increasingly difficult.

The public sector coal company has produced 64.4 million tonnes of coal during 2018-19 and the company management had fixed a pragmatic target of 66 million tonnes for 2019-20. However, production of coal has been less than that was achieved during the August-February period of the current fiscal, compared to the same period last year, mostly due to heavy rains in August and September.

Although the production has been halted for a good cause, as an attempt to break the chain of coronavirus spread, the chances of achieving the target for this fiscal appear bleak. According to officials, the company has achieved 58.1 million tonnes of coal production till February-end. With less than nine days time left in the current financial year, achieving 7.9 million tonnes production for the month of March appears a huge task now with the average daily production coming to 2.55 lakh tonnes during the month.

“A daily average production of 2.03 lakh tonnes is required even if we have to reach the production achieved last year. Achieving little over 2 lakh tonnes of coal production is very much possible during the dry weather conditions but stretching it to beyond 2.5 lakh tonnes day is a difficult task,” a senior official unwilling to be quoted said. Although the company was taking all safety measures even in the backdrop of coronavirus spread, the chances of absenteeism with scare of virus spread were increased now, the official admitted.

Except for the first four months of the current fiscal, the monthly coal production by Singareni has been lesser in the range of 3.93% to 17.1% during the August-February period of 2019-20 compared to the same period a year before. The daily average production fell to as low as 1.29 lakh tonnes in July last and the maximum of 1.9 lakh tonnes was achieved in May last.

A production 6.3 million tonnes is needed this month to reach the last year’s total production of 64.4 million tonnes, while it would be about 8 million tonnes to achieve the target of 66 million tonnes. The highest monthly production achieved this fiscal has been 5.87 million tonnes in May.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/87ol8n/article31136261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23SCCL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-dents-singarenis-coal-production-plans-to-meet-target/article31136262.ece
175,2020/03/22,Online reservoirs planned to make Kalwakurthy LI project more effective,"Ministers asks engineers to speed up pending works, complete land acquisition

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranajan Reddy has stated that Mahatma Gandhi Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project would serve its intended purposes completely only if the construction of online reservoirs is completed as they take water to the tail-end ayacut without any problem.

In a review meeting held here on Saturday with the officials of the Irrigation Department, in which the legislators of the command area of the project too participated, the Minister directed the officials to complete the pending land acquisition to complete the online reservoirs as intended by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

Legislators G.Balaraju, G. Jaipal Yadav, M. Janardhan Reddy and A. Venkateshwar Reddy and irrigation officials, including Engineer-in-Chief C. Muralidhar, Chief Engineer L. Ananth Reddy, Superintending Engineer K. Anjaiah and other field engineers, participated in the meeting.

The Minister asked the field engineers to identify all pending works of the project and complete land acquisition with the help of revenue officials at the earliest. He would also hold a meeting soon with the district officials of Nagarkurnool and Wanaparthy to speed up land acquisition and other cooperation needed from them.

Noting that bringing Yedula Reservoir into use would reduce burden on the Kalwakurthy project, the Minister asked the engineers to identify and complete works and other shortcomings. Yedula Reservoir would also give the first benefit of the Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Project, the Minister noted.

Asking the irrigation engineers to finalise the new online reservoirs pertaining to Kalwakurthy project, the Minister reminded them that the Chief Minister had wished their completion in a phased manner so that the project water could be taken to tail-end farmers. He also wanted them to speed up construction of feeder channels and take stringent action, including registering criminal cases, against those indulging in breaching the canals as the tail-end farmers were suffering badly due to such acts in the upper reaches of the project canals.

Assuring that the government was committed to provide water till the crops under the ayacut were harvested, the Minister urged the engineers to prepare plans to increase the water carrying capacity of the main canal to 4,000 cusecs from the existing 3,000 cusecs. Further, he stated that complete justice to the notified ayacut would be done only if the water is supplemented from Vattem Reservoir being constructed as part of the Palamuru-Rangareddy project.

The government was releasing ₹ 2,417 crore with immediate effect to meet the contingencies and ensure that there was no break in the emergency services and supply of essentials to the poor and marginal.

The State was holding consultations with the Central government on regular basis and steps were being taken to ensure that common people were not inconvenienced.

The State, he said, had invoked the provisions under The Indian Epidemics Act, 1897, for imposing the lockdown and the government would have special powers to tackle emergencies caused by calamities like outbreak of epidemics.

179,2020/03/22,Mahua laddu — a livelihood success story for Adivasi women,"A women’s group has its order-book filled for the year

Amid the gloomy atmosphere accompanying the COVID-19 crisis, it is the tribal heartland of Adilabad that has given some reason to be happy. The 10-month-old project involving a group of poor Adivasi women in making eatables and savouries from the sacred mahua or ippa flowers (Madhuca indica) has bagged a ₹ 16 lakh order for supply of laddus to anganwadi centres in Jainad, Gudihatnoor, Ichoda, Neredigonda and Boath mandals in the district.

“We have an order for making over one tonne of mahua laddus to be supplied as nutritional supplement for one year to 160 anganwadi centres. This order is part of the ₹ 1 crore corporate social responsibility (CSR) project by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited,” disclosed T. Rakesh Reddy, Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellow (PMRDF), who is looking after the project on behalf of Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Utnoor.

Encouraged by the then district Collector D. Divya, some 21 aboriginal tribe women members of the Bhimbai Adivasi Mahila Sahakara Sangham (BAMSS), Utnoor, had started making savouries like mahua laddu, mahua salt and pepper fry and sweet fried mahua in the traditional manner in June last year.

Dedicated customers

During the months that have passed by, the Sangham got dedicated customers from different places, including Hyderabad, for its products especially the laddu and recorded a turnover of ₹ 3.7 lakh selling savouries made of 5 quintals of dried ippa flowers and two quintals of other ingredients.

“The CSR order is a big boost to our activity,” observed Kumra Vittal Rao, manager of Centre for Collective Development – Prajamitra, an NGO, which is chipping in with hand-holding support. “In order to ensure quality, we have selected ippa trees located mostly in the forest close Shambu Mathadiguda and Sungu Mathadiguda habitations in Utnoor mandal,” he revealed while participating in numbering of the selected trees along with the sangham members.

Tribal suppliers

As many as 256 trees belonging to 71 tribal families of the two Mathadiguda habitations have been selected for collection of the 100 quintal of mahua flowers needed for the CSR project. The women’s group will purchase the flowers from the tribal families at a cost of ₹ 20 per kg, which is almost double the price offered by organisations like the Girijan Cooperative Society.

“We will supply quality laddus to the anganwadis at any cost,” vowed the president of the BAMSS Kumra Bhagubai, a picture of determination. “We will also try to make and sell other items like mahua chikki which have a good retail demand,” she added, evidently excited over the business prospect for her group.

“The laddu has got excellent nutritional value as per a report from the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad. We are also maintaining the standards as required by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India,” Mr. Reddy pointed out to highlight the food safety aspect.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fecdza/article31135162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23IPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mahua-laddu-a-livelihood-success-story-for-adivasi-women/article31135163.ece
180,2020/03/22,Overwhelming response to Janata Curfew also sees sealing of Telangana-Maharashtra border,"There was a near three-kilometre long queue of trucks on either side of the NH 44 between Penganga river bridge and Mandagada village crossing; villagers turn samaritans to stranded truckers serving food and water

Response to the Janata Curfew from people in former composite Adilabad district was overwhelming as they stayed indoors to make the event a grand success. The only aberration, according to opposition party leaders, was the functioning of Sirpur Paper Mills (SPM) in Kagaznagar town of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district which put the lives of workers who attended duties at risk.

In-charge of Congress party affairs in Sirpur constituency, Palvai Harish Babu pointed out that the SPM management had ignored the call to participate in the Janata Curfew given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Management representatives, however, maintained that only workers on emergency work were on duty.

Ferry points sealed

The old united Adilabad district which shares a very long border with Maharashtra on its north, east and west was completely cut off with the neighbouring State as the borders were sealed to deny entry to all types of vehicles coming from Maharashtra. The sealing of ferry points on Penganga and Pranahita rivers in KB Asifabad and Mancherial distircts effectively cut off the water route for people from the neighbouring Gadchiroli district to gain entry into those districts.

There was a near three-kilometre long queue of trucks on either side of the NH 44 between Penganga river bridge and Mandagada village crossing as authorities allowed only goods vehicles with perishables to enter the district. The rest of the lorries and other vehicles will be allowed to go their way only after 6 am on Monday.

Meanwhile, villagers of Pipparwada in Jainad mandal, which is located on the NH 44 served meals and water sachets to the stranded lorry drivers and cleaners.

Pilgrims stranded

Authorities denied entry into the district to a bus load of devotees who were returning to their native places after visiting Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The group of 46 consisted of devotees belonging to Vijayawada, Khammam and Hyderabad who could not return in a train owing to cancellations.

Elsewhere, people showed willingness to participate in the self-imposed curfew. Roads looked deserted almost everywhere including the far flung interior areas of Nirmal and Mancherial districts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/overhwelming-response-to-janata-curfew-telangana-maharashtra-border-sealed/article31135091.ece

Jameel Ahmed (39), an activist belonging to the Popular Front of India (PFI), a controversial Islamist organisation, was quarantined in the Isolation Ward of the Government Headquarters Hospital in Karimnagar town on Sunday.

The Karimnagar Two Town police had arrested Mr. Ahmed, who was running a coaching institute in the name of Institute of Mathematics (IoM) in spite of government orders to close down the institute to check the spread of COVID-19, on Tuesday in Karimnagar town. He, however, secured station bail and was absconding since then.

On the loose

Following information that Mr. Ahmed had motivated and brought 10 Indonesian preachers to Karimnagar town on March 15 and took them to various mosques and madarsas in the town, police have nabbed the Indonesians on March 18 and shifted them to Gandhi Hospital, where all of them were tested for COVID-19.

Since then, the police were on the lookout for Mr. Ahmed as he moved very closely with the Indonesians, reportedly contracted the virus and spread it to several others, including his students in the coaching institute.

182,2020/03/22,"People stay put in their homes, Karimnagar wears a deserted look","Voluntary participation of people has made Janata Curfew a success, says Police Commissioner; curfew on till 6 am Monday

Fearing the spread of COVID-19, people have confined themselves to their homes in various parts of Karimnagar district on Sunday, and made the ‘Janata Curfew’ call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and supported by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao a success.

All shops, business establishments, hotels, kirana shops in the town remained closed. Milk vendors downed their shutters, and vegetable markets too did not open. Small-time tea shops, tiffin centres remained shut, and pushcart vendors stayed off the roads.

Prepared people

As the government had announced that TSRTC would also participate in the curfew, buses were confined to their respective depots. The bus stations wore a deserted look. Incidentally, people purchased all essential commodities on Saturday itself to avoid confusion and problems on Sunday.

Police forces have been deployed at various locations in the town to dissuade people from coming on to the roads. Even in residential areas police teams were moving around and instructing people to observe the curfew to check the spread of COVID-19 virus. Only emergency cases such as people going to hospitals or for purchase of medicines were allowed to travel.

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy went around the town to inspect. Talking to newspersons, he congratulated all sections of the society for participating in the Janata Curfew and making it a grand success.

Politicians at home

Stating that people and traders have participated in the curfew voluntarily to fight COVID-19, he said the State government had announced a 24-hour curfew from 6 am on Sunday to 6 am on Monday. “Police forces would continue their duties at their designated locations throughout the 24 hours,” Mr. Reddy said.

The otherwise bustling city appeared like a ghost town with people voluntarily staying off the roads on Sunday following the Janata Curfew call given by the State and central governments.

Life virtually came to a standstill as no one ventured out following the appeal, and to keep the dreaded coronavirus at bay. Unusually, even petty vendors closed their activities for the day. Except for an occasional bike rider, roads were all empty with only the police manning junctions all across the tri-cities of Warangal, Hanamkonda and Kazipet. There was near total silence, which was unheard of, and unseen in the recent past.

Deserted bus and train stations

Moreover, bus stands and railways stations were totally deserted and not a bus or train was seen moving. Vendors at these stations also closed their business of selling water bottles and newspapers.

Though the State government had assured small vendors that they could carry on with their vocations, they too observed the Janata Curfew.

Policemen who were on duty though, equipped with water bottles and struggling for some more as the temperature kept soaring by afternoon.

184,2020/03/22,‘Home quarantine’ stamped person stopped at Telangana-Andhra border checkpoint,"A 40-year-old person with a ‘home quarantine’ stamp on his forearm heading towards Khammam in a cab was stopped by personnel manning a checkpoint in Yerrupalem mandal along the inter-State border with Andhra Pradesh on Sunday morning.

Sources said the man, a native of Khammam town, was returning home from Bengaluru Airport where he arrived from Qatar on Saturday, sources said.

Advised self isolation

On his return from abroad, he got a ‘home quarantine’ stamped on his forearm as per the guidelines. Further, he was advised by the authorities to remain in self-isolation at his home for the mandatory two-week period as a safety precaution, sources added.

He reportedly travelled from Bengaluru to Vijayawada in a car and from where he hired a cab to reach his home in Khammam. Staff at the checkpoint near Yerrupalem noticed the stamp on his forearm during a vehicle checking drive on Sunday morning and referred the matter to the authorities of the District Headquarters Hospital in Khammam.

No COVID-19 symptoms

While he did not show any symptoms of COVID-19, the medical staff concerned, however, advised him to strictly comply with home quarantine norms.

Meanwhile, joint teams comprising officials of the Police, Transport, and Health departments stepped up vigil at all the five inter-State border checkpoints - two in Khammam district and three in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district - as part of intensified surveillance measures against COVID-19.

Vehicular traffic from neighbouring States has been curtailed by police as an additional safety precaution to check the spread of coronavirus. Only vehicles carrying perishable goods and other essentials are exempted from the traffic curbs.

The ‘Janata Curfew’ has brought normal life to a standstill across the erstwhile composite Khammam district with TSRTC bus services and other modes of public transport services remaining suspended.

Coal production hit

Coal production came to a grinding halt in all the 10 coalmines of the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) in the Kothagudem region as the entire workforce - barring emergency staff - of the State-owned mining giant remained indoors in response to the call to make ‘Janata Curfew’ a success to give a fillip to the collective fight against the global scourge.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/home-quarantine-stamped-returnee-stopped/article31134168.ece

Normal life has come to a standstill with people staying indoors in response to the Janata Curfew call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar as part of a strategy to combat Coronavirus on Sunday.

Empty roads

All streets in the town wore a total deserted look reminiscent of a normal curfew, and vehicles, including two wheelers, are hardly seen on the roads. Autorikshaws were off the roads as there were no takers. RTC buses too remained in depots with the management suspending all services. Even small eateries were closed. Unlike everyday’s din with moving vehicles blaring horns and construction activities an eerie silence prevailed everywhere.

With the government’s forewarning supermarkets were crowded with customers on Saturday evening. Milk vendors who used to come a bit late in the morning came earlier today.

Tens of thousands of people flocked to a cauldron with the Olympic flame in northeastern Japan over the weekend despite concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.

The flame arrived in Japan to a scaled-down welcoming ceremony on Friday as doubts grew over whether the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will go ahead on schedule as the deadly virus causes chaos around the world.

The pandemic has already shredded the global sports calendar, with top sports leagues suspended and major tournaments postponed.

More than 50,000 people on Saturday queued to watch the flame displayed at Sendai station in Miyagi, chosen as part of the “Recovery Olympics” to showcase the region’s revival after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.

Some had to stay in a 500-metre (1,650-foot) queue for several hours, local media said.

Many of them wore masks as they took pictures with the cherry blossom-shaped cauldron.

“I queued for three hours but watching the Olympic flame was greatly encouraging,” a 70-year-old woman told public broadcaster NHK.

But organisers, concerned about the bigger-than-expected gathering, have warned the viewing event could be suspended if a crowd becomes “extremely dense”, local media reported.

The nationwide torch relay begins on March 26, starting from the J-Village sports complex in Fukushima that was used as a base for workers during the 2011 nuclear disaster.

187,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | WADA issues new dope-testing guidelines,"The World Anti-Doping Agency as issued new guidelines to facilitate continued testing amid the constraints of the coronavirus pandemic.

Noting that the spread of COVID-19 had evolved into “an even greater health and societal emergency” since its March 6 communique, WADA urged Anti-Doping Organisations to act in accordance with restrictions placed by local health authorities “to ensure proper protection of athletes and doping control personnel, while protecting the integrity of doping control programs, particularly in the lead-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic.” WADA’s latest guidelines advise anti-doping organisations (ADOs) to make sure that sample collectors are free from any symptoms of illness.

Collectors should also ask athletes if they have any symptoms or if they or anyone at the collection site are in the groups thought to be at heightened risk from COVID-19.

If test collection personnel are found to have contracted the virus, athletes they tested should be informed and vice versa, WADA said on Friday.

Protective wear such as masks should be used and work surfaces disinfected, and if local conditions limit what testing can occur then ADOs should “consider focusing their testing program on targeted athletes from high risk sports and disciplines,” WADA said.

In locations where testing programmes can’t continue, WADA said, it and other ADOs and sports federations will work together “once the situation begins to return to normal” to identify gaps in testing “particularly as it relates to the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.”

WADA said ADOs should continue to obtain information on whereabouts of athletes normally gathered to facilitate out-of-competition testing.

Athletes are still responsible for obtaining therapeutic use exemptions and “should be reminded that they can still be tested at any place, any time,” WADA said.

With some WADA-accredited laboratories already closed and others likely to follow suit, WADA said testing organisations should contact the Montreal-based organisation for information on what labs might be able to receive samples.

“While there are no plans to change existing requirements under the World Anti-Doping Program, WADA fully acknowledges the complexities of this unprecedented situation and will ensure its compliance monitoring program provides a level of flexibility and understanding based on the circumstances,” WADA said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/coronavirus-wada-issues-new-dope-testing-guidelines/article31132358.ece

The entire Rajasthan remained completely closed on Sunday under the twin impact of the Janata Curfew, for which a call was given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the lockdown ordered by the State government to contain the spread of coronavirus. Markets and commercial establishments were shut, vehicles were off the roads and the people stayed indoors.

The roads in Jaipur and all big towns, including Jodhpur, Ajmer, Kota and Udaipur, wore a deserted look as the public transport and even the private taxis did not run. Policemen deployed on the main roads asked the people who ventured out to go back to their homes.

The North-Western Railway, headquartered in Jaipur, cancelled as many as 236 trains since Saturday night, while the Rajasthan Roadways discontinued its bus operations. The Jaipur Metro also suspended its services for a day, though it will run from Monday as an essential service exempted from the lockdown.

The forts, monuments, historic temples and wildlife reserves visited by tourists were also closed.

The laboratory report of a minor girl suspected to be suffering from COVID-19 has come out negative, officials said on March 22.

The Jorhat Medical College and Hospital (JMCH) on the evening of March 21 said a four-and-a-half-year-old girl tested positive in a preliminary test. The Jorhat district authorities, however, said more tests would be required according to the protocol before confirmation.

Her samples were sent to the Regional Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Dibrugarh, about 140 km east of Jorhat.

The girl, a resident of Jorhat town, had returned from Bihar by train on March 20 along with her mother and sister. They were quarantined after she showed symptoms of cough and fever.

“The samples of the child suspected of COVID-19 and tested in Dibrugarh centre has been found negative,” Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, confirming the report.

“There is no positive case in Assam so far,” he added.

More than 600 people suspected to have come in contact with those with the infection have been screened and tested across four ICMR laboratories in Assam. The test lab at the JMCH was established after the ones in the medical colleges of Guwahati and Dibrugarh. The one at the Silchar medical college was set up later.

The Trinamool Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Shiv Sena on Sunday said their MPs will not attend Parliament when it reconvenes on Monday. Sources said the House will convene on Monday, and the priority would be to clear the Finance Bill. “With Delhi going into lockdown, there is every chance that Parliament would be adjourned after that,” said a source.

While the Trinamool wrote a strongly-worded letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, informing them of the party’s decision, NCP chief Sharad Pawar tweeted that he has asked MPs to help their constituents.

The Trinamool’s letter has been signed by the party’s legislative leaders in both Houses — Sudip Bandopadhyaya and Derek O’Brien.

“The Prime Minister himself has spoken about the urgent need for social distancing and the need to not assemble in large groups and those above the age of 65 should take abundant care,” said the letter, adding that in the face of all this, keeping Parliament open “was not the example to set.”

Instead, the letter said, MPs should be sent back to their constituencies to co-ordinate efforts for relief work. “The All India Trinamool Congress has advised all of its parliamentarians to go back to their respective constituencies. As required in a couple of cases, our MPs are following self-isolation protocols,” the letter said. Rajya Sabha MPs Sukhendu Shekhar Roy and Derek O’Brien are in self-isolation at the moment.

The Srinagar administration is tracking down local travellers hiding their overseas travel history, especially to COVID-19-hit countries such as Italy and the United States, to escape any screening and the required quarantine.

“Four passengers on Sunday reached from Mauritius, Dubai and Kazakhstan but declined to declare travel history. A girl coming from the U.S. posed as a student returning from Bangladesh. Insisting on the passport while allotting room, it was found she has travel history of the U..S, where the third highest COVID-19 cases in the world is found,” said Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, Shahid Choudhary, who is spearheading the government’s efforts to contain any spread of COVID-19 in the Valley.

He said a man coming from the most COVID-19 affected country, Italy, reached New Delhi and made an attempt to escape screening before entering J&K. “He took a train to Jammu and a cab to home in Srinagar just to hide the travel history. He has been traced,” he said.

The Srinagar administration has launched a crackdown in the past 24 hours against travellers who are hiding symptoms and avoiding the necessary quarantine. “It needs a collective focus to handle it. Things are not that simple as they appear from homes and office rooms. It’s like World War III,” Dr. Choudhary said.

“Two brothers studied in a medical college in Bangladesh. One travelled by air and declared travel history and was quarantined. Another took the road and reached home. It was a smart neighbour who informed the control room. He is, in fact, symptomatic,” said Dr. Choudhary.

He has warned that those hiding travel history may face jail as per the National Disaster Act. The J&K administration has approached the Immigration Bureaus of all international airports to secure details of travel history of the locals who are travelling back to J&K from different countries.

At least seven police personnel, including an Assistant Sub-Inspector, were injured and several vehicles damaged after a mob pelted stones at a police station in a failed attempt to release an accused from custody in neighbouring Baran district.

The incident took place late on Friday night as the 200-strong mob vandalised police jeeps among other vehicles in the premises.

Fourteen policemen were injured in a fierce gun-battle with naxals in forests of Chhattisgarh’s insurgency-hit Sukma district on Saturday, the police said.

Further, at least 13 security personnel were untraceable in the forests following the encounter, a senior official said.

The encounter took place around 2.30 pm near Korajguda hills in Chintagufa area when a joint team of security forces was out on an anti-naxal operation, he said.

Personnel of the police’s District Reserve Guard (DRG), Special Task Force and CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action) had launched the operation from Chintagufa, Burkapal and Timelwada camps based on information about presence of ultras near Elmagunda, he said.

When the team was advancing through Korajguda hills near Elmagunda, located around 450 km from the state capital Raipur, firing broke out between the two sides, he said.

“Based on ground inputs, it is believed at least four to five naxals might have been killed and an equal numberinjured as security forces retaliated strongly,” the official said.

“Fourteen personnel sustained injuries. They have been airlifted to Raipur and admitted at a private hospital where the condition of two of them was said to be critical,” an official statement said later at night.

203,2020/03/22,My fallout with Taylor a stain on NZ cricket: McCullum,"The issue of who will wear the captain’s armband led to the dispute

Former skipper Brendon McCullum, describing his fallout with Ross Taylor a “bad stain for New Zealand cricket”, attributed it to a race for captaincy between the two in 2011, and admitted that they still aren’t the best of friends despite mutual respect.

Taylor, who is still active in international cricket, took over the captaincy after Daniel Vettori stepped down following the 2011 World Cup.

“It put some pressure on my friendship and relationship with Ross. I have played a lot of development and age cricket with Ross. I was the captain of the under-19 team and Taylor was my vice-captain. We’ve always got on really well,” said McCullum.

However, after a 1-1 draw in a Test series in Sri Lanka in 2012, it emerged that Taylor had issues with the then coach Mike Hesson. That followed series defeats in South Africa, the West Indies and India.

Unnecessary

“We had to go for an interview for the job. It was about presenting the map for the future of New Zealand cricket to a panel. I don’t really know what we were doing. If I had my time, I would’ve said: ‘no, I’m not going to come and go through the process, you appoint Ross as captain and then we’ll see what unfolds from there.’

“It’s a bad stain for New Zealand cricket and put pressure on Ross and me. Then it led me to eventually take over from Ross,” said McCullum.

McCullum said he and Taylor are still not the best of friends, but he has a lot of respect for New Zealand’s all-time highest ODI run-scorer. “We are not the best of friends, but I have an immense amount of respect for him,” said McCullum.

Taylor was given the option of remaining the Test captain, with McCullum leading the limited-overs sides, but he declined.

“I was asked if I wanted to take over the role of New Zealand captain in all three formats. So initially, I told them I would get back to them. I needed to think long and hard about it. I knew it would be a major controversial decision. I knew it could have major ramifications on NZ cricket, and also on my time as a player,” he said.

McCullum eventually took over in all formats in December 2012 and remained in the role until his retirement in 2016.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pf9unq/article31136383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23MCCULLUM-TAYLOR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/my-fallout-with-taylor-a-stain-on-nz-cricket-mccullum/article31136384.ece

205,2020/03/22,Mithali keeping herself fit for future engagements,"Trips down memory lane liven up ‘forced break’

The coronavirus pandemic has led to a ‘forced break’ for athletes across the world and it is no different for one of India's best-ever woman cricketer, Mithali Raj.

“I have been following the developments on social media. These are dangerous times, but I do feel a sense of pride that India is much better off than most countries hit by it,” Mithali said in a chat with The Hindu here on Sunday.

And, the 37-year-old Mithali, at home for more than a week for the first time in her illustrious career spanning 21 years, is digging into her treasure house of mementos, trophies and India jerseys to rekindle memories of memorable feats in a brilliant career.

“Other than the trips down memory lane, I am also doing some basic exercises to keep fit as all gyms are closed. I am doing everything to be mentally and physically fit once this virus is eradicated and we are back on the field,” says the leading ODI run-getter in women’s cricket.

“But for the pandemic there would have been some serious moves towards organising a women’s IPL ,” she said.

Mithali also has some suggestions for the women’s IPL. Six foreign players should be permitted per team, she said. Unlike in men’s cricket women’s teams might find it difficult to find capable domestic players to form the team if only four foreigners were allowed, she said.

“I strongly believe you need to start somewhere and it is high time we came up with a women’s IPL,” she said.

The massive response to the T20 World Cup final in Melbourne showed that there was great interest in women’s cricket, she said.

“It was an unforgettable experience. The atmosphere was unbelievable and the crowd response matched men’s cricket in terms of not just attendance but the passion with which they supported the finalists — India and Australia,” said Mithali, who was there as ICC ambassador.

“Like all other sports bodies, the ICC has been forced to reschedule many events. We were supposed to play the World Cup (50-over) qualifiers in Sri Lanka this June, then tour England this July-August. But, given the grim battle against the virus, everything will go for a toss,” she concluded.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2f5xv2/article31136309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23MITHALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mithali-keeping-herself-fit-for-future-engagements/article31135314.ece
206,2020/03/22,CA to moot reserve days for men’s T20 World Cup,"Cricket Australia (CA) may propose introduction of reserve days for the semifinals of the men’s T20 World Cup at the ICC Cricket Committee meeting later this year.

Earlier this month, the ICC had faced a lot of flak for not having a reserve day for the knockout stages of the women’s T20 World Cup in Australia.

As the ICC’s current playing conditions stand, the men’s T20 World Cup, slated to begin here on October 18, will have no reserve days before the final at the MCG on November 15. But, an ICC spokesperson said, according to a report in cricket.au.com, that conditions for the men’s World Cup would be discussed at a Cricket Committee meeting before they are formally signed by the Chief Executives Committee.

Should any of ICC’s member boards wish to suggest changes to playing conditions, they will have the opportunity to do so at the CEC gathering, although it’s rare for standard playing conditions to be revised at that stage.

CA chief executive Kevin Roberts, who will be part of that CEC meeting, said a case existed for the inclusion of reserve days in the upcoming men’s T20 World Cup.

“There’s always cause for reflection at the end of any tournament or any season, in terms of how you approach future tournaments,” Roberts said.

He, however, conceded that there was a valid argument to maintain the playing conditions that governed the women’s tournament.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ca-to-moot-reserve-days-for-mens-t20-world-cup/article31133412.ece
207,2020/03/22,Dhoni has to show he deserves India spot: Raju,"Difficult task for anyone returning from a long break, says former selection panel member

Doubts linger around the Indian Premier League’s prospects of having a truncated version and simultaneously there is talk about how originally it was also seen as a platform to evaluate M.S. Dhoni. Venkatapathy Raju, who was a member of the selection panel that appointed Dhoni as India skipper back in 2007, admitted that the former India captain’s national comeback could be a difficult endeavour.

Also read: Sportstar's all-time sports classics: Lord's to Wankhede, the Dhoni way!

On being specific about Dhoni’s chances of wearing the blue shade again, the former India left-arm spinner said that with the current selectors investing in two wicketkeepers, the legend would have to understand his role.

“He has been a match-winner for 15 years and has a huge fan following. But, for any international sportsperson to come back after such a long break is difficult. And, importantly, Dhoni should be in the scheme of things to be picked based on performances in the IPL, if it at all it is held,” Raju said.

Still remarkably fit, Dhoni’s 38 summers, could still be a factor and Raju said: “Any player has to keep playing and performing to be in contention. Be it domestic, India-A series or any other competitive cricket. For, you are not out to prove yourself to others, but to prove to yourself that you belong there. Age also is a big factor. Playing international cricket is never easy. It demands a different level of fitness and skills.”

Remembering Dhoni’s halcyon days when he emerged as India’s captain, Raju said: “Dhoni was the only cricketer performing under pressure at the time, so we unanimously decided to go with him.

“The guiding principle for our panel was simple — only consistent performers and match-winners would be considered. Dhoni’s calmness and the way he handled things impressed all of us. It was a unanimous decision.

“The other reason for Dhoni being preferred was that several India players were returning from injuries or long breaks. Hence, we thought he was the best option, and we never had any regrets.”

Raju also highlighted that he and his fellow selectors backed Anil Kumble as the Test captain. “It is important to note that we made Kumble the Test captain for the 2007 Australia tour. That proved to be a wise move given the infamous ‘Monkeygate’ and the way Kumble and the late Dr. M.V. Sridhar (then administrative manager of the Indian team) handled the issue.”

While Raju leant into nostalgia, in a lighter vein he quipped: “Firstly, I never wanted to be a selector having cursed them for not getting my due as a player!”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/f251lo/article31130380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22MSD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dhoni-has-to-show-he-deserves-india-spot-raju/article31130382.ece

Since all the government buses were parked at the bus depot on Chennimalai Road and private buses and mini buses at their respective sheds, Corporation workers cleaned the municipal bus stand premises with water and sprayed disinfectants.

Earlier in the day, a few tea shops, mutton stalls and provisional stores that remained open were asked to close by policemen and officials as they ensured that all shops remained closed from 7 a.m.

Power supply disconnected

Collector C. Kathiravan along with officials inspected a yarn retail unit at Mylambadi village in Bhavani block and found two workers from North India suffering from fever. Since the owner failed to alert the district administration about the workers, power supply was immediately disconnected to the unit and was sealed by officials. A fine of ₹ 50,000 was imposed on the owner. The officials were asked to lodge a police complaint against the owner.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan inspected the Aavin outlet functioning on municipal bus stand premises and found workers selling milk, tea and coffee in cups. As the outlet was only allowed to sell milk packets, he ordered officials to service notice on the persons running the outlet.

209,2020/03/22,Students develop mobile apps to beat COVID-19,"Students from the Sona College of Technology joined hands with a Bengaluru-based software firm Vee Technologies to develop two mobile applications to help officials and public ‘break the COVID-19 chain’ and to control spread of the disease.

The applications, ‘Corona-Scan’ and ‘Corona-Support’ are aimed at identifying the spread of the disease, a release said.

‘Corona-scan’ allows public health officials to map individuals who were in close proximity to COVID-19 positive patient and ‘Corona-Support’ is an voluntary app in which affected persons can register their details to help officials get accurate information, a release said.

According to the college authorities, the applications were developed by third year engineering students Bernotsha, Aravind Kumar and Naveen Kumar under the guidance of their professor J. Akilandeswari and the support of Vee Technologies.

The Corona-scan application records people who stayed within 3 to 5 meters of COVID-19 positive patients every two minutes and generates live data. By mapping people who may have been infected and risk infecting others, Public Health officials can identify and take appropriate action to connect with them over the phone and recommend necessary treatment.

Chocko Valliappa, CEO, Vee Technologies, said that the applications would go a long way in checking the spread of the disease and invited like-minded organisations to adopt this applications.

College authorities said that while corona-scan application would be made available for Health officials, Corona-support application could be downloaded from Google Playstore soon.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/students-develop-mobile-apps-to-beat-covid-19/article31137047.ece

The wedding of Revathi from Maniyandahalli village in Krishnagiri and Sharath from Bengaluru was arranged months ago, before the grand plans got derailed by the virus. Not to be deterred, the couple wed in the presence of their parents and siblings, with a total gathering of eight family members, and of course with the presence of media that trickled in to record the spectacle.

In Dharmapuri, a Muslim couple wed in the presence of a modest gathering in a pre-booked hall. The guests were offered sanitisers at the entrance to wash hands before entry. In a village in Dharmapuri, a couple wed in their home, under the auspices of a priest.

However, reports of minivans ferrying wedding guests from Bagalur to a reception in Hosur trigged concerns of compliance by wedding halls and families organising the weddings.

211,2020/03/22,Troughs filled with water at STR,"To prevent animals from venturing out of forest and entering human habitations

To prevent wild animals from venturing out of forest and entering human habitations, the Forest Department has started filing water troughs in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) here.

STR is spread across 1,411.60 sq.km. where elephants, tiger, leopard, deer and other animals are present in large numbers. During summer, lack of water in the forest area is a major concern, forcing the animals to step out of forest in search of water every year.

Hence, the department constructed many troughs inside the forest area and has been filling it regularly with water during summer season.

At present, as intense heat prevails inside the forest area, availability of water has started to drop. So, the toughs are being filled with water in the forest ranges of Hasanur, Talavadi and Germalam that come under Hasanur Forest Division.

Officials said that water was taken in tankers, jeeps and other vehicles to fill the troughs and the troughs could hold 300 litre to 5,000 litre.

They said that the troughs would be filled continuously till the end of summer or until water was available inside the forest area.

This would prevent the animals from venturing out and also prevent human-animal conflict, the officials said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/kccjvg/article31137038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA23TROUGHS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/troughs-filled-with-water-at-str/article31137039.ece
212,2020/03/22,"Women self-help groups work overtime to meet the demand for masks, hand sanitisers","To meet the increase in demand for hand sanitisers and masks, many women self-help groups (SHGs) are working overtime to manufacture the products in bulk here.

Ever since COVID-19 positive cases were reported in the country, public in general were cautious and started using face masks and hand sanitisers to protect themselves from the virus. However, considering the surge in demand, some outlets started selling the products at higher prices and there is shortage in supply of masks and sanitisers.

Many women SHGs have started manufacturing masks and sanitisers and they are not eyeing huge profits despite the demand. The cloth masks manufactured by them are sold at a reasonable price of ₹10 a piece.

S. Sharmila from Sri Sai Mahalir Kuzhu said that there were 10 persons in the group and they have been making the masks for over a month. “We used to manufacture the surgical masks using the non-woven material but due to shortage of raw materials, we have increased production of cloth masks now”, she said.

She added that while two units were initially into this, she has pulled in more units to meet the orders. “We have supplied about 5,000 masks in a month and currently we are working day and night to meet the order of 10,000 pieces. Considering the demand, we are not interested in increasing the prices. We sterilise the masks using proper equipment and have not compromised on quality,” Ms.Sharmila said.

She added that though they used to manufacture masks earlier, the requirement then was only 2000 pieces a month and the increase in orders in this period has helped them meet some of the financial requirements like school fees of their children and payment of other maintenance bills. Ms.Sharmila earns up to ₹ 500 a day.

S. Selvakumar, Project Director, Mahalir Thittam, said, “Four units are into manufacturing of face masks and two units are into hand sanitisers. Currently, they are working on meeting orders of about 10,000 masks mainly for distribution among sanitary workers at local bodies here. These groups can even manufacture three-ply masks based on orders.” He added, “the units have also manufactured about 50 litres of hand sanitisers.”

Mr. Selvakumar added that the units were trained by Health department officials and government doctors on safe production techniques. He added they were also arranging loans for these groups to meet the cost of raw materials.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2e0hly/article31137035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA23SHGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/women-self-help-groups-work-overtime-to-meet-the-demand-for-masks-hand-sanitisers/article31137036.ece

217,2020/03/22,Intuitive awareness,"In spiritual parlance, the term ‘Ikshana’ meaning to see gains deeper significance when it implies the way one regards, considers or looks upon, etc, to evaluate and discriminate between the real and the unreal. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is used to describe the perception of the world through the vision of a realised soul. Scriptures reiterate that realisation of the eternal truth is something beyond visual perception since Brahman transcends the grasp of human sense organs. But still sages and rishis have realised Brahman through intuitive perception when the mind and the heart are trained to meditate and think deeply about Him. It is possible that by such continuous mental effort directed towards inward search, true insight arises, pointed out Swami Nirviseshananda in a discourse.

The Katopanishad explains the peculiar human condition wherein the creator has made the senses outward bound. There is thus a natural flow of the human mind and heart towards the glitter and attractions of the external world. The Upanishad warns that pursuing outward pleasures is immature and childish for it ensnares one to the cycle of birth. The wise, however, aware of immortality, do not seek permanence in things which are impermanent. So, it is important to realise that getting entangled in worldly pursuits is no different from the plight of the unsuspecting donkey that is enticed by the carrot and made to carry the load. The sincere seeker has to make the effort to understand the reality of the nature of the senses and exercise judicial restraint over them. This creates an atmosphere that is conducive for the recognition of the divine presence within oneself. In fact, to one with a pure heart and mind, God is more manifest in the Self than in the external world of experience.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/intuitive-awareness/article31136017.ece

219,2020/03/22,Motorists who ventured out were made to spread awareness,"It was not curfew, but Care for You, says Sajjanar

Deserted roads in Hyderabad marked the success of Janata Curfew on Sunday, as residents chose to stay home to do their bit in dulling the impact of the coronavirus.

Heavy police presence ensured that the few who did venture out also returned home, as cops were seen questioning those about the urgency and the purpose of not observing the social curfew, and requesting them to stay indoors except in cases of emergency.

Vigilant police

At most of the junctions in the city, the traffic, and law and order police personnel, were seen holding placards of Janata Curfew, asking people to stay at home for their safety.

Those who were found moving on the roads were made to hold placards and spread awareness on coronavirus, after issuing tickets for various traffic violations.

“Where are you going? What is the urgency? Where do you stay? Why did you come out?”, were a few questions asked by the police to the motorists who were seen moving on the road. At several junctions, police were appealing to bikers with folded hands to return home.

Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar, along with DCP Traffic S.M. Vijay Kumar, camped near Cyber Towers to monitor Janata Curfew.

Mr. Sajjanar said it was not curfew but ‘Care for You’.

“People have voluntarily participated in the curfew and made it successful. Thank you all for voluntary participation,” he said.

Food packets

Meanwhile, Madhapur inspector S. Venkat Reddy distributed food packets to homeless people who live under the flyover near Cyber Towers.

220,2020/03/22,Janata Curfew total in Telangana,"Worst sufferers were the poor in Hyderabad who depended on Annapurna canteens of GHMC

Telangana observed a total curfew-like situation, the likes of which were never witnessed in the past, on the call for Janata Curfew given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi which was supported by the State government in the fight against coronavirus on Sunday.

People confined themselves to homes right from daybreak to night as public and private transport, shops and establishments, hotels, bus and railway stations remained closed. There was not a soul for long stretches of roads throughout the State. The only scenes visible on roads was parked vehicles outside houses. Even morning walkers did not come out.

Unlike in the past, when police enforced curfew to deal with law and order situations, the uniformed men now relaxed sitting at junctions and staring at empty roads. They did not take any notice of a stray passerby in the morning but stopped vehicles to enquire from drivers the motive of their coming out. The police also set up barricades at important locations to prevent movement of vehicles. On the other hand, petrol bunks were open but sales boys were glued to their smart phones as there was hardly any vehicle visiting the outlets for refuel.

As announced by the government, RTC buses and metro trains did not commute. The closure of shops left customers make without some of their day-to-day purchases. The worst sufferers were travellers and the poor in Hyderabad who depended on the Annapurna canteens of GHMC and Akshayapatra foundation for ready-to-eat food at subsidised rates.

The closure of inter-State borders resulted in vehicles stranded on roads for long hours. A private bus bound for destinations in Andhra Pradesh was stopped at Chiragpalli near Zaheerabad as it had 37 people on board who landed at Mumbai from Qatar. All of them were shifted to an isolation centre at Gachibowli in Hyderabad. Another person who had a stamp of home quarantine on his hand was detained at the Nampally railway station and shifted to isolation. He had travelled by a train from Mumbai.

For the first time, churches across the State were closed and Sunday prayers cancelled.

The day-long curfew was topped by clapping sessions by residents at the stroke of 5 p.m. to express solidarity with doctors and sanitation workers who were crucial to check the virus.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who, along with family members did it at their official residence, told media persons that the government would now focus on checking the spread of virus from local transmission after the last flight to Hyderabad from Chicago landed on Sunday. Except one case, all the 27 persons who tested positive for the virus were foreign returnees.

222,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | IIT-Delhi team develops cheap COVID-19 test,"‘Probe-free detection assay’ sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology here have developed a method to detect COVID-19 which can significantly reduce the test cost, making it affordable for large sections.

The National Institute of Virology, Pune, is in the process of validating this test on clinical samples.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The “probe-free detection assay” has been optimised and tested for sensitivity at the research laboratories of IIT. According to the team, considering the scale of the ongoing pandemic, development of indigenous kits is the need of the hour.

The central government on Saturday recommended that the maximum charge for a COVID-19 test by private laboratories should not exceed ₹4,500.

All private laboratories which have NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accreditation for real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for RNA virus will be allowed to conduct COVID-19 tests, according to the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for COVID-19 testing in private laboratories, which were notified by the Health Ministry on Saturday night.

Coronavirus | Vaccine was rapidly synthesised as novel coronavirus sequence was available, says virologist Gagandeep Kang

However, the team at IIT claimed that their test can be performed at a much cheaper cost. “Using comparative sequence analysis, we have identified unique regions in COVID-19. These unique regions are not present in other human coronaviruses providing an opportunity to specifically detect COVID-19,” said Professor Vivekanandan Perumal, lead member of the team. “Once the NIV validates the assay, it can be quickly scaled up to meet the increasing need in our country,” he added.

‘Accurate results’

According to Professor Manoj Menon, the current testing methods available are “probe-based”, while the one developed by his team is “probe-free”, which reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy. “Primer sets targeting unique regions in the spike protein of COVID-19 were designed and tested using real time polymerase chain reaction. The primers designed by the group specifically bind to regions conserved in over 200 fully sequenced COVID-19 genomes. The sensitivity of this in-house assay is comparable to that of commercially available kits,” said Parul Gupta and Prashant Pradhan, members of the team.

Coronavirus | A step closer to developing a potent drug

“This assay can be used as a qualitative (yes or no) assay without the need for extensive instrumentation. In addition, it can also quantitatively assess virus loads. We propose the use of this assay for specific and affordable high throughput screening of COVID 19,” they added.

223,2020/03/22,What the Covid-19 pandemic means for the doctors at the frontline,"Fighting disease and death, here’s what medical professionals go through personally, and how their families feel about what they do

A tweet from a doctor in Australia, @seemathewombat says: “I’m a Dr. I’m about to separate from my family within my home for ?? months. So that I can keeping treating you, whilst trying to keep my family safe. It hurts. No hugs from my girls, no cuddles from my partner. PLS socially distance NOW, to make my sacrifice worth it.”

While such precautions for doctors are still in the planning stages in India, we asked medical professionals what goes through their minds when a pandemic is declared and they are at the forefront of testing and caring. How do their partners react?

Dr Adarsh Pratap, president of the Resident Doctors Association at AIIMS, Delhi, positioned at Emergency, says it is the reason they signed up for the profession. His mother, who is over 60 and lives in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, is worried, but “I tell her it’s like being in the Army in times of war. Ye to karna hi hai (This has to be done).”

Dr R Sajith Kumar, Professor and Head of Department of Infectious Diseases, Government Medical College, Kottayam, is a part of the Corona Clinical Management team for Kerala. He now treats four people in the isolation ward of the hospital. He says that his time at work is unpredictable. “It depends on the condition of my patients. After the Corona pandemic, there are days I have gone home at midnight. But that does not mean that I am not working when I am not in the hospital. I get calls from my juniors asking doubts or to update me on the condition of my patients.”

He is not worried that his interactions with the patients can put him or his family at risk. “I work with infectious patients everyday and I always make sure that I take enough precautions. My wife is also a doctor and so she understands,” he says.

Doctor Do-a-lot

In Madurai, Praveena Manimuthu, who has been married to Dr Prabhakaran Rathinam for 15 years, is worried though. Her husband is Professor and Head of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Madurai Medical College and Government Rajaji Hospital, and while there are no cases yet in the city (at the time of going to press), it’s the tension of waiting that takes its toll. “I am not anxious that he will bring infection home, but I certainly worry about his health,” she says.

She has made him a small kit containing dry and wet tissues, a bottle of sanitiser, and a small bar of soap, to keep in his car. Even on regular working days, he is away from 7.30 am to 11 pm. “I keep reminding him his health is most important to all of us and get our kids (12 and seven) to speak to him at least once during the day over the phone,” says Praveena, who runs the household single-handedly.

She says she stopped complaining after one particular night emergency. “I heard him take a post-midnight call and say that he’d be at the hospital immediately. I lost my cool and asked why somebody else couldn’t be on call. He told me my father was admitted in the ICU. That moment I realised the importance of all patients in a doctor’s life.”

Another partner, Dr Sujatha Sangumani, says it is easier for doctors to relate to the fear during an epidemic, given that they understand the spread better. As the wife of Dr J Sangumani, Dean of Madurai Medical College & Government Rajaji Hospital, the gynaecologist is matter-of-fact about work. “We habitually wear masks and are constantly washing our hands after examining every patient. Unless we ourselves are convinced that these precautions work, how will we convince patients?”

Ethical considerations

Doctors on their part are conscious of health and hygiene at home, and also of keeping their own immunity up with supplements at times like this. “I share the common area with my family, so I make sure that I am not passing any potential infection on by touch. Hand hygiene is the most important. My clothes are washed separately and put into the washer immediately as soon as I’m home,” says Dr Om Shrivatsav, Unit Head, Kasturba Hospital for Communicable Diseases. He says at times like these he does put some physical distance between himself and family members, until such time that he is sure he is not carrying any infection. “This will require effort, but has to be done. If you say everything is fine, I am just going to be getting on with my life as if nothing will happen, then you are setting yourself up for an infection.”

An article in the European Respiratory Journal talks of high-risk emergency situations, where “the doctor is subject to a number of competing duties: 1) a duty to patients; 2) a duty to protect oneself from undue risk of harm; 3) a duty to one’s family; 4) a duty to colleagues whose workloads and risk of harm will increase in one’s absence; and 5) a duty to society.”

That’s a great deal of pressure, but Dr Pratap says doctors keep conversations professional, talking about how to contain the virus if it turns from contact to community transmission.

“We keep thinking of innovations,” he says, adding that AIIMS is now producing their own masks and sanitisers. A few days ago though, the doctors did ask the AIIMS management for better personal protection equipment (PPE).

Despite the concerns, Dr Shrivastav says, “The satisfying part of our professional duty is that we are in a position to make a difference. We must embrace that.”

224,2020/03/22,"There is no doubt that more testing should be done, says virologist Naga Suresh Veerapu","‘It’s bizarre to limit sample testing to 100 or 1,000 per week’

Dr. Naga Suresh Veerapu, Virologist at the Department of Life Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, said in an interview that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in spite of its relatively simple structure, had managed to evolve the ability to jump species, and good science requires that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) test many more samples.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

What’s so unique about the SARS-CoV-2 virus? Given that it shares similarities with other coronaviruses, four of which are responsible for the common cold in India, is it reasonable to expect some protection?

There are large similarities between this virus and the SARS virus [SARS-CoV identified in 2003] in genetic make-up and antigenic regions. There is a strong possibility for cross immunity [when recovery after infection from one virus protects against another strain]. However, these viruses continuously mutate their genomes and can mask their proteins to evade detection [by the immune system] and jump species.

Is there any evidence for cross immunity so far?

There is no evidence so far — unless epidemiologists (those who study disease patterns) contact everyone who has been infected and know if they have previously been infected with SARS-CoV [it won’t be known]. However, there is a lot of difference between common cold, or seasonal flu viruses, and the coronavirus. Seasonal flu viruses are segmented viruses and adept at changing their genetic make-up, and combine the properties of human and animal flu virus. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast, is simpler. It’s a single segment [virus] and despite that, it has managed to adapt and jump species and spread in humans. Genome-wise, there is a 10%-15% difference between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The virus in Italy is of a lineage different from the one in China. Viruses are very flexible.

If there are such differences — and Indians from different countries are bringing in slightly different strains — how effective can a potential vaccine be?

Consider the Hepatitis C virus, that I research on. It has several genotypes. An antiviral that works on one genotype may not be effective on another. Similarly, if it is a live-attenuated (or inactivated strain) vaccine, it may not be effective across all strains of COVID-19. So, vaccines that produce very powerful neutralising antibodies should be more helpful. More than vaccines, it’s best if we can identify some good anti-viral though they, too, sometimes have strain specification. On the whole, however, making antivirals is relatively easier than [making] vaccines.

Do you see any promising antivirals in the making for COVID-19?

I am sure there are some in the making. For the HCV (Hepatitis C virus), it took 20 years to make a direct-acting antiviral because the systems weren’t in place to see if a chemical compound could inhibit viral replication. Now, we have effective antivirals against HCV.

A debate now emerging in India is regarding testing. Is our case load low because we are testing too little, or are there genuinely too few cases? Firstly, How reliable are these diagnostic kits, the most popular being real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?

To identify the virus, the kits are designed to look at highly conserved regions of the genome (portions that undergo little change as they are essential to the virus’ constitution) and these must be as concise as possible. It is only on this basis that primers are designed, and real time PCRs are the gold standard for assessing viral infections. But they have their challenges. They are prone to carry-over contamination (that is, if mishandled the particles can jump from one biological sample to another and lead to wrongly attributing the presence of virus when there isn’t any.) This means that the technicians who handle the test have to be very careful, experienced and skilled. You also have to exert proper positive and negative controls.

Are you implying that if we dramatically scaled up tests, and involve labs with varying expertise and experience, there could be a risk of many cases falsely being termed ‘positive’?

That possibility is there. Even very good labs under the best of conditions can make errors. But many of these diagnostics are very safe and robust and are designed to minimise handling errors.

Do you agree with the ICMR’s approach of testing 20 samples a week from 50 labs, or about 1,000 samples, to find evidence of community transmission?

It’s bizarre to limit sample testing to 100 or 1,000 per week. If the number of cases is growing, there should be a step up in the number of samples tested. It is fundamental and [there should be] no second thought about it. There are asymptomatic samples —any case with the hint of a cold/cough ought to be tested and you shouldn’t be waiting for evidence of community transmission. I don’t know [the] government’s thinking but everyone should be tested for infection.

The government’s argument seems to be that testing widely could falsely convince some that they are not carriers and that this could contribute to fear and panic?

That is up to the government on how they want to approach it. But as a strategy, there is no doubt that more testing should be done.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qqam24/article31131032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22th-veerapu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/covid-19-there-is-no-doubt-that-more-testing-should-be-done/article31131033.ece
225,2020/03/22,When will a COVID-19 vaccine be ready?,"What are scientists working on to tackle the pandemic? How long will it take after clinical trials?

The story so far: A Phase-1 clinical trial on 45 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 years has begun in Seattle, U.S., about 100 days after the whole genome sequence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was shared by Chinese researchers. Different vaccine approaches are being undertaken against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) even as 11,402 people have succumbed to the pandemic worldwide so far (March 21, 3.40 p.m.). The vaccine that is being tested in the U.S. is called mRNA (or messenger ribonucleic acid)-1273 and developed in partnership with the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.

Coronavirus | ‘Vaccine was rapidly synthesised as novel coronavirus sequence was available’

What are vaccines? How are these made?

Vaccines are one of the most effective tools to prevent diseases. A vaccine is a substance that resembles the disease-causing agent (also called pathogen) but does not cause the disease. It trains the body’s immune system to recognise and kill the pathogen, and creates a memory for the future. Vaccines are available to protect us against many life-threatening diseases such as polio, influenza, meningitis, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria, and certain types of cancers. Vaccines have also been responsible for eradication (or near eradication) of deadly diseases such as smallpox and polio.

There are multiple ways to make vaccines. For a killed vaccine, the pathogen can be grown outside the body, purified and inactivated with chemicals. An example of this is the injectable polio vaccine. Alternatively, the pathogen can be weakened by repeated culture or by genetic means. An example of this would be the oral polio vaccine — the kind used in the ‘Pulse Polio Programme’. One of the proteins on the pathogen surface can also be produced artificially and used to raise immunity. An example of this would be the Hepatitis B vaccine.

What vaccines are being developed against COVID-19?

According to the World Health Organization, over 40 different candidate vaccines for COVID-19 are in development. These include an inactivated vaccine being developed in China (Sinovac) using purified COVID-19 virus killed with formaldehyde (a chemical). A live attenuated vaccine being developed by Codagenix, a U.S.-based company in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (Pune), uses a genetically engineered COVID-19 virus that replicates very poorly. There are multiple other vaccine candidates under development that use DNA, RNA, viral vector and subunit protein platforms.

Coronavirus | The Hindu brings out e-book on essential COVID-19 information

One vaccine against COVID-19 is already in trials. What is it about?

An experimental COVID-19 vaccine called mRNA-1273 was developed by Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the U.S. in partnership with the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. A Phase 1 study to evaluate its safety and immunogenicity (i.e. ability to raise immune responses) in humans is being conducted by the NIH.

The novel coronavirus causing pneumonia in Wuhan, China was identified on January 7; China shared its genetic sequence on January 12. On February 24, the mRNA-1273 vaccine was sent to NIH for human testing and on March 16, it was given to the first set of human volunteers. Never before has a candidate vaccine been developed so quickly — from sequence to product in 42 days and start of testing in 63 days.

What is the mRNA vaccine?

The genetic blueprint (or code) in living organisms is stored in a double-stranded molecule called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which makes proteins that are responsible for nearly every function in the human body. The conversion of DNA code into proteins requires a single-stranded molecule called the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid). In an analogy with computers, one may think of the DNA as the hardware, the mRNA as the software and proteins as the applications.

The mRNA-1273 is a piece of RNA that carries the code to make the COVID-19 virus Spike protein when introduced into cells. This protein present on the virus surface is critical for its entry into cells. Immunity (antibodies) to the Spike protein can block virus entry and its multiplication, and thus ameliorate the disease.

While simple to engineer, mRNA can degrade easily. Therefore, it has to be protected with a coating that can also target it to the cells of choice when injected into the body.

Coronavirus | Testing is the easiest thing to do, says community health expert Gagandeep Kang

How long does it take to develop a vaccine?

It can take years to develop vaccines — first in laboratories to show proof-of-concept, then developing a manufacturing process to make stable and a highly pure product to be tested in animals and humans, and finally for the market.

The COVID-19 vaccine has been fast-tracked into humans without prior testing in animals. Still, it may take one to two years for the clinical trials to be over. Since there is no guarantee that the mRNA-1273 (or another) vaccine would work, a rich pipeline of over 40 candidates is important.

How much does it cost to develop it? Who funds it?

It takes millions of dollars to develop and test a vaccine. Either for-profit companies or philanthropic foundations and countries cover the costs.

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a not-for-profit grouping of foundations and countries. India is a member of CEPI. Besides mRNA-1273, CEPI has funded the development of at least five other COVID-19 vaccines, with an overall commitment of $23.7 million.

Is a virus needed to develop a vaccine against it?

With modern molecular tools and technologies, isolating a virus is not required to make a vaccine against it. The genetic sequence can be obtained directly from infected patients and this can be converted into proteins using various platform technologies.

This makes it possible to have vaccines ready for hundreds of pathogens that have not yet infected humans, but have the potential to do so in future.

226,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Why are only a fraction of cases tested?,"What is the Indian Council of Medical Research doing to expand the search for infected persons?

The story so far: With the number of COVID-19 cases accelerating in India, health authorities are now broadening the pool for testing. On Friday night, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued guidelines for a new testing strategy to effectively track COVID-19 cases. The focus remains on finding imported infections and testing their contacts who show symptoms, the new guidelines say all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness, shortness of breath and having fever and cough will be tested for COVID-19. And asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of an infected person should be tested between the fifth day and 14th day of coming into contact with the patient.

How is testing for COVID-19 done?

To rapidly determine whether someone with symptoms of cough, fever and breathlessness is infected, hospital authorities are doing an RT-PCR (real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) test. This process involves collecting a nasal or throat swab from a patient suspected of having the disease. These are two sites (the nose and back of the throat) where the virus can be collected, and the swab picks up the cells where the virus might be. Replication happens in the upper respiratory tract. These are frozen and sent to one of the designated government centres for a result.

Coronavirus | Testing is the easiest thing to do, says community health expert Gagandeep Kang

A sample is also sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) to recheck the diagnosis.

To check for the SARS CoV-2 virus, the sample is passed through a machine, which is part of the diagnostic kit. The RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which is the genetic material of a virus, is isolated from the sample and it is on this that further tests are done.

Based on what is known about the structure of coronaviruses in general and what emerging research about SARS CoV-2 suggests, research organisations around the world have marked out locations on the SARS COV-2 genome that differentiate it from other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV that was identified in China in 2003. On the basis of this, protocols or steps are prescribed for testing agencies to follow to determine the presence of SARS CoV-2. Enter primers and probes. Primers are small pieces of DNA and research laboratories, both private and public, have designed customised primers that bind only to a specific combination of DNA bases. It is the uniqueness of a sequence of DNA bases that differentiates species as well as strains within it.

Also read | Health and Family Welfare Ministry’s notification on ‘hydroxychloroquine’

With an enzyme, the virus’s RNA is converted into DNA and the appropriate primer — like a key that can only open the right lock — zooms into the virus’s genome and amplifies it.

This amplification is necessary as there is an extremely limited amount of the viral genome and detecting it requires that a sufficient amount of the material is synthesised. A fluorescent dye, or the probe, is added during the testing process. The probe only lights up when DNA is detected. When many samples are tested simultaneously, only those with the SARS CoV-2 in them will light up, thus confirming its presence. These tests can yield results within hours and are extremely accurate provided they are appropriately conducted by trained, qualified personnel.

Data | India's coronavirus testing rates are among the lowest in the world

What is the Indian Council of Medical Research’s approach to testing?

Currently, testing for SARS-CoV-2 can only be done by 79 laboratories. The ICMR’s approach so far was to focus on those who showed symptoms of the disease and had a travel history from countries with SARS CoV-2 cases; their contacts who show symptoms and symptomatic health-care workers managing patients with ‘severe acute respiratory distress’.

This excluded, as several doctors and critics pointed out, those who may show symptoms but do not have a travel history. On Friday, a committee of experts, mostly from government institutions that advises on testing strategy, led the ICMR to expand these criteria to include all symptomatic health workers, hospitalised patients with severe respiratory illness and a five and 14-day follow-up with close contacts of confirmed cases, even if they do not show symptoms.

Coronavirus | WHO’s ‘test, test, test’ prescription not for India, says ICMR

What is the cost of the test?

Testing is free but it costs the government ₹4,500 per test. The probes are imported and the ICMR has ordered a million of them. Spending money optimally, is important in the ICMR’s scheme of things. Testing anyone and everybody with symptoms, ICMR officials reckon, would lead to reagents (chemicals used in the process) and probes being ‘wasted’, as according to them, large numbers could test negative. This would, going ahead, make resources scarce if instances of community transmission (when it is no longer possible to trace the contact history of someone who tests positive) are confirmed and infections are widespread. So far, only 10% of the ICMR’s available capacity has been utilised and random sampling (that is testing 20 samples of severe respiratory illness) at 60-odd locations has yielded no positive cases.

Coronavirus | India does not have the numbers to participate in WHO clinical trial, says ICMR

Therefore, they surmise, there has been no instance of community transmission as yet. With the blanket ban on international commercial flights from March 22 to March 29, screening of borders and quarantine measures imposed by States and commercial establishments and screening, and then following up with the contacts of positive cases, ICMR officials feel the spread of the infection can be controlled. Testing high-risk groups and broadening the criteria gradually also allow the government to track better, isolate and care for individuals who test positive.

Are there enough supplies of kits?

The ICMR has opened a window for private sector health-care laboratories which have a supply chain of primers, probes and reagents to apply for permission to conduct tests. There are 16 Indian companies which have made their own diagnostic kits but await validation by the NIV, the only designated authority. Most of the kits will be imported and involve licensing deals with multinational companies.

Coronavirus | Two indigenous tests for detection being tested

The ICMR has requested the private laboratories, if and when they are allowed, to offer “tests for free”. As of March 21, 15,701 samples from 14,811 individuals have been tested and 271 have been confirmed positive. Nearly 850 samples that were randomly tested for community transmission have tested negative.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/bnjloj/article31131490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Coronavirus-testing,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-why-are-only-a-fraction-of-cases-tested/article31131360.ece

228,2020/03/22,Panic buying amid fears of dip in supplies,"Restrictions on inter-State borders may hit availability of stocks, fear traders

Panic buying was visible in several shops in the city on Saturday amid reports of restrictions on vehicular movement on the inter-State borders with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and ahead of the Janata Curfew on Sunday.

Long queues of customers were seen outside a few retail shops and Maveli stores from Saturday morning. Traders said people had started buying in panic over the past one week even though it was not visible owing to the availability of adequate stocks.

“Many were purchasing rice in 10 kg and 20 kg packets, anticipating a long shutdown in case of the COVID-19 situation turning worse. The demand for oil, pulses, and wheat flour had also peaked after reports of rise in COVID-19 cases over the past few days,” said a margin-free shop owner.

With stocks getting dry, traders fear it will be hard to replenish the shelves quickly as there has been a dip in supply thanks to restrictions. “I received only half the order from the main market in Aluva today. There is no guarantee that I will be able to open shutters on Monday, if the situation persists,” said a shop owner.

Meanwhile, assuaging fears of people, Kerala Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce president G. Karthikeyan said the partial closure of inter-State borders was not yet applicable to vehicles carrying essential items. “However, supplies from Maharahstra have been hit by restrictions on the border. It is hoped that the situation may improve from Monday,” he added.

On reports of panic buying, Mr. Karthikeyan said it was a natural reaction from the public, especially after news on closure of inter-State borders was flashed across the media. “We have requested our members not to close down shops after several shop owners complained of a dip in sales. A complete shutdown will add fuel to the existing situation and hence it was not practical.

229,2020/03/22,Stranded couple on their way back home,"Held up in Frankfurt, they are now scheduled to arrive in Bengaluru today before proceeding to Kochi

After the torrid 72 hours spent in four airports spread across as many countries, two elderly persons from Kochi are finally making their way back home here. However, there is still uncertainty over how and when they will make their way back home from the Bengaluru airport, the fifth in their treacherous journey, where they are set to land in the early hours of Sunday.

The couple, who are in-laws, are in their 60s. They were supposed to unite with their children, John Jofin and Simmy Jofin, now settled in Vegreville in Canada, on March 19. But they had to call off their journey at the Frankfurt airport in Germany owing to a new regulation brought about by the Canadian government in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

Accompanied by a friend of John and his young family comprising two little children, the couple got stranded in Frankfurt for nearly 48 hours before they were booked on a flight to Mumbai, which was later changed to Bengaluru, via Abu Dhabi late on Friday. After spending over 10 hours in transit at the Abu Dhabi airport, the couple are now scheduled to touch down in Bengaluru on Sunday at 3 a.m. “It is not yet clear whether they will have to go on the 14-day quarantine there or will be allowed to proceed to Kochi in which case they will be doing so at their houses. I am just happy that they are making their way back to our country at least,” said John over phone from Vegreville.

What was of greater relief to John was that his parents and those of his wife eventually managed to activate WiFi on their mobile phones with the help of some kind-hearted people. With John’s friend having left them to leave for Canada where he is settled, the couple were on their own at Abu Dhabi.

“We cannot exactly say how happy we were when we so unexpectedly got a WhatsApp call from them. Since then, I have been in touch with them through audio clips though they still have to get outside help to access them. They sounded exhausted and were in no mood to buy food though I have urged them to have something with what little money they have,” said John.

The cell will offer diverse services to foreign nationals, ranging from no-COVID-19 health certificates and medical assistance to accommodation, transport and ticketing assistance.

Mr. Sakhare said foreign nationals who had completed quarantine and were healthy would be helped to reach the airport or extended some other assistance as required by them. Since many countries now insist on medical certificates, the outreach cell will help foreign nationals secure them as well.

He added that the cell had already extended assistance to a few foreigners even before the formal launch of the platform.

As many as 3,450 persons are under home quarantine in Ernakulam as on Saturday as part of precautionary measures being taken to check the spread of COVID-19.

According to official records, 3,474 persons are under surveillance at homes and hospitals. Over 1,900 persons were removed from quarantine on Saturday, while 1,162 were put in home isolation. Twenty-six samples collected from those under observation in Ernakulam for suspected COVID-19 infection returned negative on Saturday.

The samples were tested at the National Institute of Virology in Alappuzha.

An official release issued here said Health officials had examined 514 passengers and 198 crew members, who had reached the Kochi port in four ships on Friday. No signs of infection were found in them.

415 calls

The number of calls to the district-level control room went up on Saturday after more restrictions were imposed across the State. The control room received as many as 415 calls from Friday night to 9 a.m. on Saturday.

Meanwhile, C-tracker, a web portal developed by the COVID-19 surveillance unit functioning at the district collectorate at Kakkanad, was launched on Saturday. The control room will receive reports from health workers at the field level on real-time basis using the facility. Quoting the revised guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the district administration said all those who had travelled abroad in the last 14 days should self-quarantine for 14 days. They need to seek medical help only if they develop symptoms. The person’s family members should also be kept under observation.

234,2020/03/22,Protest against functioning of bars,"‘Jam-packed outlets a cause for concern’

The Better Kochi Response Group (BKRG) has strongly objected to bars functioning as usual despite curbs imposed by the government on other activities.

No one knows what happens inside bars. They are jam-packed.

There are double the number of patrons on weekends and holidays.

A person with COVID-19 infection walking into a bar can cause havoc to public health. The outcome will be disastrous. All precautions that the general public are taking will be futile. The State government must close down all bars, said BKRG president S. Gopakumar.

No bar must be permitted to function if the objective is to contain the contagion, said Jose Dominic, a hotelier. “We are sitting on a deadly explosive powder keg, if the present laxness is allowed to continue, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/jdpm2n/article31132259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22KIBEVCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/protest-against-functioning-of-bars/article31132261.ece
235,2020/03/22,Coronavirus | Curbs at Kolkata prison trigger violent clash,"Visits put on hold after virus outbreak.

Widepsread violence erupted at the Dum Dum Central Correctional Home in the northern fringes of Kolkata on Saturday after prison authorities announced that family members of inmates cannot meet them till March 31 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As clashes erupted between inmates and police personnel, some buildings inside the complex were set on fire and prisoners indulged in stone-throwing. The violence that started in the afternoon continued for several hours, leaving many inmates and police personnel injured. Gun shots were heard and the police fired teargas shells to control the situation. At least three fire tenders were called in to tackle the fires.

A senior official of the West Bengal Correctional Services Department said on Friday that allowing families to wait outside the prison was against the concept of social distancing, essential to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

“Keeping this in mind, a decision was taken not to allow the meetings till March 31,” he said.

“The inmates were upset at being denied meetings with family members. Some people have sustained injuries,” Prison’s Minister Ujjwal Biswas told The Hindu. However, he denied reports of fatalities in the clashes. Videos aired by local television channels showed an inmate lying on the ground surrounded by others. Ambulances carrying the injured were seen making several trips from the Correctional Home.

According to sources, inmates were also upset over the suspension of bail hearings for undertrial prisoners. Sources also said the prisoners tried to overpower the police and come outside the prison.

Two other senior Ministers — Fire Minister Sujit Bose and Minister for Food and Supplies Jyotipriyo Mullick — also rushed to the correctional facility to control the situation. “At 12.20 p.m. we got the information that there was a fire at the correctional homes. There was a huge stone pelting. We tried to calm them but nobody is listening. I was also hit by a stone,” Mr. Bose said.

Following the incident, the State government appointed Peeyush Pandey as ADG Correctional Services with immediate effect.

The Civil Supplies Department has formed a district-level squad to check hoarding amid COVID-19 scare. Daily inspection will be carried out covering all the major wholesale markets in the district apart from monitoring the already purchased stock.

The vigil is being intensified after noticing a fall in the number of inter-State trucks bringing essential commodities. According to traders, truck drivers in other States seemed to be afraid of the pandemic condition in Kerala. Though the stock is now sufficient to meet the requirements for two months, the stoppage of inter-State services is likely to create problem, they said.

They fear that the closure of inter-State boarders will interrupt the movement of goods, leading to shortage of vegetables and other essential goods in the State.

District Supply Officer M. Sivakami Ammal said the district-level squad had noticed the unhealthy trend of purchasing essential commodities in large quantities by some customers. “Such unwanted scare will only worsen the situation and put traders in trouble,” she said.

Madurai Corporation intensified the cleaning and spraying of disinfectants at bus stands and railway stations in Madurai on Sunday, when the whole city stayed indoors in compliance with the Janata Curfew announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Separate teams of conservancy and malaria workers undertook cleaning at MGR Bus Stand, Arapalayam Bus Stand and outside Madurai railway junction as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of COVID-19.

243,2020/03/22,Self-curfew total in southern districts,"Roads, bus stands, railway stations, markets, cinema houses, petrol bunks and public parks were deserted

Madurai

The 14-hour long janata curfew observed in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari districts and surrounding hamlets was total that normal life came to a standstill on Sunday.

Roads, bus stands, railway stations, markets, cinema houses, petrol bunks and public parks were deserted as people stayed indoors throughout the day, officials and police said.

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a janata curfew in a bid to distance and dislocate the Covid-19 virus which had rattled several countries across the globe. In a bid to save the lives of people in the country, the PM had urged the people to stay indoors for a day.

The State government had announced holiday for all the educational institutions and postponed public exams so that the children can stay home and prevent the virus from getting spread. The objective of the janata curfew was to ensure that the Covid-19 virus chain was delinked and the spread was contained.

All the officials at the government hospitals said that there were no Covid-19 cases in the region and those with travel history alone were being monitored as they were advised ‘home quarantine.’

In a bid to ensure that people were safe, the State government had directed the police to close down the borders in Kanniyakumari-Kaliyakavilai as a preventive measure to stop and screen people entering from Kerala.

On Sunday, when people from neighbouring Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala came in private vehicles to go to their homes in Kanniyakumari district, the police stopped them. After the occupants were scanned at the medical centre, they were allowed to go home in two-wheelers and the vehicles from Kerala were not permitted. The occupants had arrived from overseas by flights to Thiruvananthapuram.

Similarly, in Puliyarai-Kerala border in Tenkasi district, the check post was manned by a large posse of police personnel from Saturday afternoon. No vehicle was allowed to enter into the town, a senior police officer said.

Tirunelveli

Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish had directed the officials to ensure that there was 100 per cent participation from the citizens in fighting the Covid-19. As a result, the usually busy locations including Melapalayam, Palayamkottai, Thatchanallur, Tirunelveli Town and among others wore a deserted look. As Sunday happened to be an auspicious day, many people had organised weddings. However, due to the janata curfew, the shrines performed only pujas and allowed minimum persons to accompany the couple inside the shrine. Similarly, churches were open, but people were told that there would not be any mass. The Muslims offered prayers at the mosque well before the curfew started and stayed indoors since 7 a.m.

The uzhavar sandais at Maharaj Nagar, Melapalayam and Kandigaiperi were shut. Similarly, all other markets/shandies remained closed. Except for the Amma Unavagams, some petrol bunks and tea stalls, all other commercial establishments remained closed.

Usually, about 800 buses were operated from the Veithankulam MGR bus stand with about 300 buses operating within the city and district and another 500 operating to neighbouring districts like Thoothukudi, Tenkasi, Kanniyakumari, Virudhunagar and Madurai. However, all the operations were suspended due to the janata curfew.

The Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan, City Health Officer Satish and team supervised the cleaning works in bus stands and other zones in the Corporation. Hand sanitizers were kept ready for public use in bus stands. The railway stations remained empty as all scheduled trains were cancelled.

Tenkasi

Utilising the janata curfew, the health department officials sprinkled disinfectants along the Kasi Viswanathar Temple on Sunday. As many as 130 conservancy workers also sprayed bleaching powder along the main thoroughfares. Collector Arun Sundar Dayalan, RDO Palanikumar, Municipal Commissioner Mohideen Abdul Khader and team supervised the cleaning works which were carried out at different locations.

All the markets in Tenkasi, Kadayanallur, Puliangudi, Sankarankoil, Shencottah Town remained closed including the vegetable market in Pavoorchatram. The janata curfew was 100 per cent, officials said and added that vehicle movement was totally curtailed on the borders of TN and Kerala as a precautionary measure. Except for essential commodities, all other goods vehicles were stopped.

But for a few motorcyclists, who were seen moving in the morning, there was no movement since 10 a.m.on the roads.

Thoothukudi

The self-curfew was total in the Port City that all the residents stayed indoors on Sunday. The Collector Sandeep Nanduri, who reviewed the arrangements,visited the government hospital at 5 p.m. and joined the public in thanking the selfless service of the doctors and para-medical teams in fighting the Covid-19 by clapping hands and ringing bells.

Many police, health and volunteers joined him in thanking the medical fraternity who have been rendering yeomen services at this hour of crisis.

Thoothukudi wore a deserted look as the port and airport were shut. All the daily scheduled flights to Chennai and Bangalore were suspended. The railway junctions were also empty. Bus stands, cinema houses, parks, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants were closed.

The Superintendent of Police Arun Balagopalan and team reviewed the security arrangements since Saturday afternoon. As the State government had extended the janata curfew till 5 a.m. on Monday, the officials had appealed to the people to remain indoors until then. The Collector in a press release thanked the people for their cooperation.

The famous Tiruchendur temple was closed, though pujas and aradhana were performed as per the rituals by the Bhattars. The VOC Port, which had also shut its operations, wore a deserted look as the workers did not turn up for the day shift and noon shifts, officials said.

Call taxi operators too had announced a holiday as a part of the janata curfew and hence, a very limited autos plied. Hospitals, including a few private ones and pharmacies, were open. Temples, churches and mosques were closed.

Kanniyakumari

The Collector Prashant Wadnare said that the janata curfew was total in the district that people remained at homes. Police were deployed across the town and hotels, restaurants and other outlets remained shut.

244,2020/03/22,Janata Curfew: Family imposes self-restriction for marriage in Madurai,"Only the core members of the groom’s family came to Madurai from Chennai and the ceremony was advance to 4 a.m. on Sunday

After a long and meticulous planning for a marriage by two families from Chennai and Madurai, the ceremony took place on Sunday with a handful of people, thanks to the Janata Curfew announced by the Prime Minister.

Seven months back the bridegroom’s family near Chennai and the brides family in Madurai booked a marriage hall in the heart of Madurai.

Over 900 invitations were distributed and everything was set for a grand reception on Saturday followed by ‘muhurtham’ on Sunday morning.

But when the families and friends of the groom were planning to leave Chennai for Madurai, the news about the Janata Curfew announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached them.

By then it was too late for them to do anything. Only the core members of the groom’s family came to Madurai.

With the curfew beginning at 7 a.m. and with the movement of public transport vehicles being cancelled, the families decided to advance the ‘muhurtham’ for the convenience of the guests.

The ‘muhurtham’ that was scheduled between 7.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. was advanced to 4 a.m.

“We informed about the change in the ‘muhurtham’ timing to those who were in Madurai City. For the rest, we requested them to not take pains to make it to the marriage function. We told them that we will not feel bad about their absence,” said J. Sampath, 58, uncle of the groom.

Masks and sanitisers

Initially, the family members had planned to provide masks to all the guests and place sanitisers outside the hall as a precautionary measure.

However, they could not manage to get both masks and the sanitisers.

All that the family could do was consciously avoiding handshake. “Instead we welcomed people with the traditional folded hands,” he explained.

With only few scores of guests turning up, the marriage was solemnised early in the morning.

By 7.00 a.m. most of the guests had left for the hall after breakfast.

“Only a very few close relatives of the bride and groom stayed back in the marriage hall. It was absolutely no disappointment for any of us. It is only a small contribution from our side to stop spreading COVID-19 by having a limited guests at the marriage,” said Mr. Sampath.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ndhjby/article31133718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/madurai-wedding,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/janata-curfew-family-imposes-self-restriction-for-marriage-in-madurai/article31133709.ece
245,2020/03/22,Cover for a pandemic,"In case you get infected by COVID-19, you must have a comprehensive health insurance plan to coverhospitalisation expenses.

While pandemics such as COVID-19 are not new to the world, it is important to stay protected in every manner possible. While you may take all required precautionary measures such as maintaining social distancing to stay protected, what is more important here is to understand how you can secure your health.

In case you get infected by COVID-19, you must have a comprehensive health insurance plan to coverhospitalisation expenses.

If you are still confused as to whether your health insurance policy will cover hospitalisation expenses incurred due to COVID-19, it is important for you to know that any claim for COVID-19 will be payable by your insurer if you are hospitalised for at least 24 hours.

As per a circular from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to all health insurers regarding the guidelines on handling of claims reported under COVID-19, the regulator has made it clear that all such claims shall be handled as per the usual norms i.e. just like any other ailment requiring hospitalisation.

As per the guidelines, all claims will be processed as per regular norms and will be covered as any other illness.

24-hour hospitalisation

However, it is mandatory for the policyholder to stay hospitalised for a minimum of 24 hours.

IRDAI has even made it clear that the entire cost of admissible medical expenses during the course of treatment, including the treatment during quarantine period, shall be settled in accordance with the regular health insurance policy.

Also, the infection caused due to COVID-19 does not fall under the pre-existing disease category and hence, the claims will be covered for the illness from day one. Every basic health insurance plan will compensate the policyholder for expenses incurred on pre-hospitalisation, post-hospitalisation, in-patient treatment, OPD and ambulance expenses, should one seek treatment for COVID-19.

Fixed benefit plan

While the above features are for an indemnity-based health plan, those looking for a fixed benefit health plan that compensates them for loss of income due to hospitalisation following COVID-19 can invest in the fixed benefit health plan offered by Digit Insurance.

Offered under the IRDAI’s regulatory sandbox framework, Health Care Plus plan is available for a sum insured of between ₹25,000 and ₹2 lakh.

The premiums start at ₹299 at the lower end, while the maximum sum insured entails a premium of ₹2,027 plus GST.

As to the payout process, in case a policyholder tests positive for COVID-19, the insurer will pay out the entire sum insured. If a quarantine is advised in a government or a military hospital, the insurer will pay 50% of the sum insured.

Retired people may consider it for additional benefits even if they have a standalone plan since they are more vulnerable to the virus. Those suffering from symptoms of cold or respiratory diseases will not be able to purchase this plan.

246,2020/03/22,Why has the rupee fallen against the dollar?,"What lies ahead for the Indian currency?

The story so far: The rupee slumped on Friday to a record closing low of 75.20 against the U.S. dollar as deepening concerns about the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic sent global investors scurrying to dump most assets, especially emerging market holdings, and opt for cash and the relative safety of the greenback. The rupee has now depreciated by more than 5.3% in 2020, with the bulk of its losses, a 4.1% slide, having occurred in March.

Why is the Indian currency weakening?

Just as it happened in 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the widespread economic uncertainty triggered by the latest COVID-19 outbreak has forced most investors and businesses across the world to seek to conserve that most crucial asset during times of crisis: cash and more specifically the U.S. dollar. In 2008, the dollar strengthened about 22% against the Euro as enterprises, especially in the world’s largest economy, hoarded the U.S. currency.

Since the start of the month, overseas investors have dumped Indian equities and debt on a scale not seen since the taper tantrum of 2013, when news that the U.S. was going to gradually wind down its GFC-triggered quantitative easing spurred an exodus out of emerging market assets. As on March 20, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had sold a net ₹95,485 crore, or more than $12 billion, of shares and bonds. This outflow has coincided with the sharp fall in the equity market’s key gauge, the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex, which has slumped 22% so far in March.

What else is contributing to the fall?

The rupee’s decline in March has been part of a broad trend as most currencies across the globe have weakened against their U.S. counterpart. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, has gained almost 4% so far this month. The risk aversion as a result of the pandemic triggered by the global outbreak of COVID-19 has been so intense that it has not spared most perceived safe havens including U.S. Treasuries (government bonds) and significantly even gold. The yellow metal too has been sold by investors looking to hold the most liquid and most fungible of all assets — the U.S. dollar.

Where does the rupee go from here?

Given that the increasing possibility of the global economy heading into a recession has been a key driver of the dollar’s appreciation against other currencies, including the rupee, there is clearly more pain ahead for the Indian currency. Add to it the fact that India’s own domestic economy has been struggling to reverse an extended slowdown — with both private consumption and investment by businesses substantially becalmed — and it is hard to see sentiment on the rupee improving appreciably in the short-term.

However, a few offsetting factors offer just a little comfort. For one, India’s foreign exchange reserves are still at a fairly robust level and as on March 13 amounted to a total of almost $482 billion. Armed with this war chest, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stepped in every now and then, both to smooth volatility in the foreign exchange market and to ensure that a sudden shortage of dollar supply does not exacerbate the weakening trend in the rupee. The central bank, in fact, last week provided $2-billion of dollar liquidity through a forex swap on Monday, and is set to provide a similar line on March 23 as well.

Also, the price of oil, which is one the largest contributors to India’s import bill, has dramatically declined this month with Brent crude oil futures having slumped more than 46% to $26.98 as on March 20. With neither Saudi Arabia nor Russia appearing to be in any hurry to de-escalate their price war, and energy demand likely to remain depressed in the foreseeable future on account of the global economic downturn, oil may remain one source of respite for the rupee.

And were the U.S. economy itself to go beyond a recession and possibly head for a massive unemployment featuring depression — if more States join California in enforcing severe movement curbs such as the large coastal State’s statewide “stay-in-place” order to contain the spread of the viral pandemic —the dollar too could become a risky holding.

Still, to complicate matters on the outlook, the RBI is most likely to cut interest rates in the very near future to support the sagging economy at this juncture, a move that could potentially again add to the downward pressure on the rupee.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/r5nzdh/article31131566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/why-has-the-rupee-fallen-against-the-dollar/article31131349.ece

248,2020/03/22,Diversification of investment is not in numbers,"Adopt a mix of bonds, and assets whose returns could be higher than expected

We all like to diversify our investments. We spread our fixed deposits among three or four banks as we believe that the likelihood of all these banks failing to repay our deposits at maturity is low. Using the same logic, we also invest in several equity funds. However, investing in multiple investment products may not, necessarily, reduce investment risk.

Portfolio diversification

Suppose you invest in five different equity funds to diversify your investment risk. What if all of them have large holdings in the same stocks, say, Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank? If these stocks decline sharply, so will the net asset value (NAV) of all these funds. So, investing across multiple funds may not necessarily prevent your investments from declining in value.

Correlation is vital

Diversification is not about spreading your investment across multiple products. It is about how each of these investment products correlate with (or relate to) each other. Ideally, you want your equity investment products to increase in value when the market moves up.

On the flip side, you want some of these investment products to move up when other products in your portfolio move down in line with the market.

But, gathering such products to form a portfolio requires application of rigorous statistical and mathematical tools. This is because you have to determine how these products relate to each other when markets move up as well as when they drop. Now, most investors cannot engage in such exercise for want of time and effort. So, what should you do? Stop buying multiple investment products.

It will save you from the ordeal of managing a bulky portfolio. Also, you will not draw false comfort that you have reduced your investment risk. That said, you should draw comfort from the fact that you are already reducing risk through your asset allocation process. This involves allocating your investments across assets such as equity and commodities. You should preferably use two assets in your goal-based portfolios — one that offers higher-than-expected return and the other that provides stable cash flows.

Buying a home

Assume you want to buy a house ten years hence and decide to invest in equity and bonds. By bonds, we mean any interest-bearing instrument offering you stable cash flows, and a pre-defined value at maturity. It is easier to map cash flows from bonds to the cash flows needed to achieve your goals. For goal-based portfolios, bond investments should typically be in bank deposits, public provident fund and tax-free bonds. They must preferably pay interest at maturity, not annually. So, if you are investing to accumulate money to finance your vacation three years hence, you should invest in a three-year recurring bank deposit (RD). Your equity investments will be in mutual funds, preferably a Nifty Index fund.

Now, your bond investments will provide stability to your portfolio because of the known cash flows at maturity. But bonds offer low post-tax returns because of higher tax rate and lower-than-expected return, and do not beat inflation.

Hence, you need equity investments. While equity offers higher-than- expected return, the cash flow you will receive when you sell your equity investments is uncertain. Diversification is, therefore, all about how judiciously you mix a higher-than-expected-return asset (equity) with a stable-return asset (bonds). We believe it is best you pay greater attention to your asset allocation — the proportion of equity and bonds in each of your goal-based portfolios. Often, investing in one RD and in one index fund will suffice to achieving a goal.

249,2020/03/22,Driving tips can light up an investor’s path,"Starting out before peak hour is one way to beat traffic. In investing, too, being the early bird is key. Now is, probably, the time to pick winners

Both driving and investing / savings are integral parts of our lives. Both take an individual from point X to point Y either physically or financially.

In driving, you use the road to travel and reach your physical destination. In investing, you use various investment assets such as equity, gold, debt, real estate, fixed deposit or insurance, use the platform (an analogy to the road) to achieve your financial goals in a timely and safe manner.

The time taken to reach the destination or financial goal, the speed (read return on investment) and safety (permanent loss of capital) and volatility (read risk involved in investing in various types of assets) and the intermediate experience are all based on four important factors: the number of vehicles on the road; other drivers’ behaviour; your own behaviour while driving; and, the ability of the vehicle.

Vehicles on the road

The number of vehicles on the road is likely to be high during peak hours. In the early hours, driving will be peaceful because of fewer vehicles on road.

Driving in the early hours is like investing in years such as 2008 (post-correction) or 2012 or when no one wanted to invest in equity markets.

There is less competition and you can pick and choose funds or stocks at a reasonable valuation that could yield desired returns over a long period.

Driving in peak hour traffic is like investing during a crazy market run such as in 2007 or 2017, when there is heavy competition. This could lead to higher valuations and hence give lower returns — due to either prices being stagnant or due to a significant fall in prices, as was the case with the correction in mid- and small-caps in the 2018-2019 period.

Others’ behaviour

Equity investing in the short term is largely affected by the behaviour of market participants. Over the last 1-2 years, price correction in a lot of mid- and small-cap companies have been severe due to valuation de-rating (this stems from a lower expectation of future growth from market participants).

Being cautious during market highs and being aggressive when the market falls is essential to realising better returns.

During a peak market, you need to manage risk by investing in tier-1 (ie, the best companies) and by not investing in tier-2 and -3 companies though the latter’s valuation may seem lower and could see higher speculative activity.

During market lows, build a portfolio for future returns by investing in firms that have the balance sheet to fund growth using internal cashflows and which have large reinvestment opportunity; avoid investing in ‘cigar butt’ ideas where only valuation re-rating is possible and no growth in intrinsic value may be expected.

Your own behaviour

Change your behaviour if you want to change what happens to you or around you. By wearing a seat belt, coupled with cautious driving, you choose to drive safe and avoid major accidents, or at least protect yourself in a mishap should one take place.

The probability of an accident is low but its impact could be high. In investing, the amount to be invested in various assets such as equities and fixed deposits needs to be considered based on the risk tolerance of the investor and the time factor.

A poor decision could mean a portfolio that belies expectation. For example, investing in equities with a short time horizon could lead to loss and increase the risk level of the portfolio. Similarly, investors need to step up purchase of equity assets at lower multiples (valuations) to improve returns.

A fall in the markets can been seen either as a risk or as an opportunity. A temporary fall in the market is considered risky by investors who panic and exit the market; the same temporary fall is seen as a call to action by those who wish to deploy capital for the long term.

Any net saver should welcome a fall in markets as the net incremental money is deployed at lower levels and not at higher levels. A market fall gives investors enough time and opportunity to research on companies or funds and invest at attractive valuations. (ie, good stocks bought post a crisis such as in 2008, 2013 and early 2016 have, in general, yielded better returns).

Being defensive in a declining market is the equivalent of driving too slow in a highway where you need to be in top gear instead of in third gear.

Not taking risk by accepting short-term volatility in the portfolio could lead to long-term risk of not reaching the desired corpus target.

Ability of the vehicle

Some vehicles are designed for high speeds and some, for reasonable speeds. You choose a vehicle or an investment instrument based on your comfort and need. If your style fits an aggressive form of driving, then you need a vehicle with a high-power engine.

Similarly, in investing too, choose instruments such as stocks, mutual funds or fixed deposits depending on what suits your temperament and what your needs are, to reach your financial goals in a safe and timely manner.

Happy Investing!
