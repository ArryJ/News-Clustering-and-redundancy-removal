4,2020/03/07,Tech giants shut offices as coronavirus hits employees,"Facebook has shut its three London offices till Monday after an employee was diagnosed with COVID-19, while Twitter Twitter shut its Seattle office for a ‘deep clean’

Panic gripped big tech firms like Facebook and Twitter which decided to close their offices from Seattle to London as more employees tested positive for the new coronavirus.

Facebook shut its three London offices till Monday after an employee was diagnosed with COVID-19.

The social networking giant told nearly 3,000 employees in London to work from home after an employee, who is based in Singapore but visited the London offices between February 24-26, was diagnosed with the new coronavirus, Sky News reported on Friday.

“An employee based in our Singapore office who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 visited our London offices on February 24-26. We are therefore closing our London offices until Monday for deep cleaning and employees are working from home until then,” the company said in a statement.

There have been 163 cases of coronavirus so far in the U.K.

Earlier, Facebook recommended all its Bay Area employees in the U.S. to work from home. The latest precautions come after San Francisco announced its first two coronavirus cases on Thursday.

Facebook has also shut its Seattle office until Monday after one of its contractors was confirmed to be infected with the virus. The infected contractor last visited the Facebook office on February 21. King County health officials said all Facebook sites should work from home until March 31.

Twitter shut its Seattle office for a ‘deep clean’ after an employee developed COVID-19 like symptoms though final result was still awaited.

“A Seattle-based employee has been advised by doctor about likely COVID-19, though still awaiting the final testing,” Twitter said in a tweet on Friday.

“While the employee has not been at a Twitter office for several weeks and hasn’t been in contact w/others, we’re closing our Seattle office to deep clean,” the company added.

According to The Seattle Times, at least 14 people have died due to COVID-19 in Washington State till date.

Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook have advised their employees in Washington State to work from home.

Apple has reportedly suggested its employees at California campuses to work from home as an “extra precaution” while new coronavirus cases spread on the west coast in the U.S., especially Seattle area.

The death toll from COVID-19 in Iran continued to rise on Saturday with 21 more people killed, including a politician who became the eighth official to succumb to the disease. Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour announced 1,076 additional cases had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall tolls to 145 dead and 5,823 infected.

“More than 16,000 people are currently hospitalised as suspect cases,” Mr. Jahanpour said during a news conference. He added that 1,669 people who were sick with the COVID-19 illness have recovered.

Iran is battling one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks of the disease outside China, where it originated. The capital Tehran remains the worst-hit province, with 1,539 confirmed cases.

On Saturday, a newly elected conservative MP for the city was the second Iranian lawmaker killed by the virus, state news agency IRNA reported. Fatemeh Rahbar, 55, served as MP from 2004 to 2016 and was among the top candidates in Tehran for the conservatives, who overwhelmingly won February’s general election marked by the lowest turnout in the Islamic republic’s history.

Seven other politicians and government officials have died in the outbreak since the country reported its first cases in mid-February. Iran has closed schools and universities until early April, as well as suspended major cultural and sporting events and reduced working hours across the country to slow the contagion, which has spread to all of its 31 provinces.

The number of infections is climbing in northern provinces in particular, Mr. Jahanpour said.

More than 300 of the new cases reported on Saturday were in Mazandaran province, a popular tourist destination north of Tehran on the Caspian sea.

“Mazandaran is at the top of the list because the necessary limitations (on domestic travelling) were not imposed,” Mr. Jahanpour added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z3w0ar/article30956508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-COVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-outbreak-iranian-lawmaker-dead-countrys-toll-rises-to-145/article31011349.ece
11,2020/03/07,Lebanon set for debt default,"PM Hassan Diab was to announce the decision not to pay and call for negotiations with creditors to restructure the debt, senior politician involved in the Eurobond discussions said.

Lebanon’s top leadership opposes repaying the country’s debt, the presidency said on Saturday, setting the heavily indebted state on course for a sovereign default as it grapples with a financial crisis.

Prime Minister Hassan Diab was to announce the decision not to pay and call for negotiations with creditors to restructure the debt, a senior politician involved in the Eurobond discussions said.

A default on Lebanon’s foreign currency debt will mark a new phase in a crisis that has hammered the economy since October, slicing around 40% off the value of the local currency.

The crisis is seen as the biggest risk to Lebanon's stability since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.

Lebanon has a $1.2 billion Eurobond due on March 9, part of a portfolio of some $31 billion in dollar bonds that sources told Reuters on Friday the government would seek to restructure in negotiations with its creditors.

The announcement from the Presidency followed a meeting attended by the President, Prime Minister, Parliament speaker, central bank governor and head of the country's banking association.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanon-set-for-debt-default/article31011225.ece
12,2020/03/07,Kabul victims describe carnage,"The attack at a crowded gathering in the capital has raised questions about Afghanistan’s abysmal security situation and uncertain future.

Kabul was reeling Saturday after Islamic State jihadists killed 32 people and wounded dozens more, with injured survivors describing scenes of terror as gunmen opened fire in the deadliest attack to hit Afghanistan since a U.S.-Taliban deal.

The attack at a crowded gathering in the capital has raised questions about Afghanistan’s abysmal security situation and uncertain future following the February 29 agreement to pull foreign forces from the country within 14 months.

Lying in a hospital bed in a run-down Kabul neighbourhood, Basira, 15, said she had attended Friday’s annual commemoration ceremony for Abdul Ali Mazari — a politician from the Hazara ethnic group — for the first time, accompanied by her father and younger sister.

Zamin Ali, who suffered a bullet wound, said hundreds of people had assembled to watch the ceremony, when the attackers began raining down gunfire.

he Sunni-extremist IS had claimed an attack on the same ceremony last year, which killed 11, and have in the past targeted Hazaras who are predominantly Shia Muslim.

Survivors expressed anger against the government for failing to improve security, with injured teenager Basira saying: “The political elites fled with their convoys and poor and innocent people were martyred and wounded”.

Several top political officials were at the ceremony, including Afghanistan's chief executive Abdullah Abdullah. All were safely evacuated.

The devastating attack, which came days after the Taliban decided to halt a partial truce, ended a brief reprieve for Afghans weary of violence.

Organisers of an annual gathering to commemorate the death of former vice president Mohammad Qasim Fahim said they had cancelled the event scheduled for Sunday “because of the sensitive security situation”.

The attack has cast doubt on whether the Taliban can stop groups such as IS from overrunning Afghanistan after foreign troops withdraw from the country in exchange for security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with the Kabul government.

The Taliban have also ramped up attacks in the country, including one on Friday night in the contested western province of Herat, where they killed seven villagers including two children, government officials said.

“They opened fire on civilians killing seven and wounding 10,” Jailani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor, told AFP.

Lal Mohammad Omarzai, chief of Robat Sangi district, where the shootings took place, said the insurgents were angry over the villagers' refusal to pay them money.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kabul-victims-describe-carnage/article31011181.ece
13,2020/03/07,U.K. police to review probe into abduction,"In a verdict, a British family court judge said that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, who is Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, had ordered the abduction of two of his adult daughters and their forcible return home.

British police said on Saturday that they were reviewing an investigation into the disappearance of the ruler of Dubai’s daughter after a court found that she had been abducted by her father.

In a verdict, a British family court judge said that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, who is Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, had ordered the abduction of two of his adult daughters and their forcible return home. One of the women, Sheikha Shamsa, was taken from the English city of Cambridge when she was 19 in August 2000, the court found.

In light of the ruling, Cambridgeshire police said it was reviewing aspects of an investigation it carried out at the time.

“An investigation into the alleged abduction of Shamsa Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum in 2000 was carried out by Cambridgeshire Constabulary in 2001,” a spokeswoman said.

She said there was “insufficient” evidence to take any further action back then. A review in 2017 also found insufficient evidence, and the case is no longer active.

She noted that the standard of proof in criminal cases is significantly different to in family court hearings.

“However, in light of the recent release of the judgement, aspects of the case will now be subject to review,” she said.

14,2020/03/07,Virus scare keeps visitors away from ‘paradise’ island,"Sri Lanka’s tourism sector, hit by terror attacks last year, sees another crisis amid virus outbreak

In December 2019, Sri Lanka recorded as many as 2,41,663 tourist arrivals. It was 4.5% lesser than the number in December 2018, but still significant. In crossing the 2,00,000-mark, the figure showed that Sri Lanka’s resilient tourism industry had bounced back, following one of its most testing phases in the aftermath of the Easter terror bombings in April 2019.

The serial blasts, which claimed over 250 lives — including about 45 foreigners — repulsed visitors from the paradise island so much that even the best deals at luxury hotels didn’t cut it for most. The arrivals last year fell by 18% from the 2.3 million arrivals in 2018, but it still meant some improvement from the devastating month of May that saw a 70% fall in arrivals.

Things had just begun looking up at the end of last year when there was bad news again, called the ‘coronavirus’. Sri Lanka itself reported only one case — of a Chinese tourist — who fully recovered in quarantine and left on February 19. All the 33 Sri Lankan students who returned from Wuhan Province in China, the epicentre of COVID-19, tested negative, bringing some relief to the country that was dreading another disaster.

Further, the Hambantota International Port Group, which manages the China-built port and employs many Chinese workers, said all employees and their family members who returned from China just before the epidemic broke out were quarantined. The port also placed an embargo on staff members who went home for the Chinese New Year, asking them to stay back until the green light is given for safe travel by the Sri Lankan and Chinese authorities.

However, the virus will hit the island in other ways. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority’s (SLTDA) data show a 17.7% slump in tourist arrivals in February. The fall is widely attributed to COVID-19, and its global impact on tourism and international travel.

While screening mechanisms have been added to airports and ports, last week, Sri Lanka halted cruise tourism amid reports of COVID-19 spreading to Europe and the U.S., among its key source markets. Sri Lanka draws nearly 60 cruise calls a year that tour operators say translates to roughly 1,00,000 visitors. “Cruise passengers usually spend a day in Colombo, and would do curated walking tours for them for about $50. Now that is nothing for tourists on a cruise, but for us it was still some money, especially after a devastating year,” said Ajit De Soyza, managing director, Ceymondu Travel. The big companies “still manage”, he said, but smaller companies like his that spent millions early last year on promotions are in a tough spot, as they hardly made any return on investment last year. Sri Lanka has almost entirely lost Chinese tourists this year and that has hurt, especially since China had emerged one of the top source markets for the tourism industry in the last few years.

Following COVID-19, however, China is off the list of top 10 tourist generating markets so far this year. According to the SLTDA, tourist arrivals from China fell by 92.5% in February compared to the corresponding month last year.

Impact on economy

Representatives from Sri Lanka’s $4.4 billion tourism industry recently met to review the situation and brainstorm ways to tackle the situation, Daily FT reported. Weighing in, the Central Bank has said the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to affect Sri Lanka’s economic performance.

Observing that the “exact” impact on the Sri Lankan economy would depend on the extent of the global spread of COVID-19, its persistence and policy responses of major economies and trading partners, the apex bank has noted that Sri Lanka’s economic links with China could be directly affected as significant volumes of consumer goods, intermediate goods and investment goods are imported from that country.

“The likely slowdown of the global economy and disruptions to the supply chain could affect Sri Lanka’s merchandise and service exports as well as related logistics. The slowdown in global tourist movements will affect Sri Lanka’s tourism sector, in addition to the direct impact of lower arrivals from China. The spread of the virus to countries with a significant number of Sri Lankan migrant workers could affect remittance inflows as well,” the Central Bank said in a recent statement.

The smaller the tour operating company is the greater the impact, according to Mr. De Soyza. “And it’s not just us, a crisis means cab operators, auto-rickshaw drivers, souvenir sellers — so many small players like them are hit badly.”

15,2020/03/07,A deal for an uncertain future,"The U.S.-Taliban deal fails to take the Afghan govt. into confidence on ending the 19-year-long war

On February 29, a date that comes only once in four years, the U.S. administration signed a deal with the Taliban, whom they have been fighting for almost 19 years in Afghanistan.

The historic deal signed in Qatar was a result of nearly 18 months of negotiations between the U.S. Special Representative, Zalmay Khalilzad, and the Taliban leadership. Among other things, the deal promises the Taliban the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, which has been a key demand of the group. However, except for a few consultations, the talks did not involve the Afghan government, although the deal has set the stage for an intra-Afghan dialogue, scheduled to begin on March 10.

“Given the entire structure of the process, the U.S.-Taliban deal was intentionally very narrow in its goals and objectives because it is still a very early step in the process,” explained Andrew Watkins, a senior analyst on Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group. “An official in Kabul put it really well: ‘In this deal, the Taliban received specific points of assurances, while the U.S. received flexibility’. This is important in the long term because it allows the U.S., knowing that there will be many challenges, to be a judge of whether or not the Taliban met their obligations,” he said.

However, even as the deal holds hope for an end to the steadily increasing violence, Afghans remain deeply concerned over the complex nature of the negotiations, in which they have not found a voice yet. “On social media, I saw that Taliban leaders were celebrating this deal as a victory for the Taliban. The way Abbas Stanekzai, the Taliban’s representative, has been talking about it is scary,” said one Afghan student living in Kabul, who did not want to be identified.

“He compared it to Afghanistan’s victory against the British colonialism over 100 years ago, and talked about kicking out American invaders,” he added.

It is not surprising that the Taliban would use this opportunity to boost the morale of its fighters, said Mr. Watkins. “This is not surprising because if you look at the Taliban’s messaging directed towards its own members, one thing that you see is their insistence on victory. This is a huge part in the Taliban’s organisational unity, the ability for them to keep such a large group of people as a coherent movement, fighting against the government. If they drop this narrative, the members, many of whom fight for different reasons, may question their leadership what they are fighting for,” he added.

Life in fear

However, it has left Afghans fearful of what it may mean for their future. “As someone who has lived under the Taliban regime, I am terrified of seeing a future where Kabul is once again under the Taliban’s control,” said the student from Kabul, recalling the horrors of growing up in Kandahar in the 1990s when the Taliban regime took control of the country after a bloody civil war. “They had their own benchmark for the length of beard and hair and even hairstyles. I remember them destroying video cassettes and televisions. I remember how they were beheading people in stadium, I remember how we lived in fear.”

The deal does not provide specific safeguards for the progress made in the last two decades since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, leaving many Afghans, especially the women and minorities, feeling betrayed. However, Mr. Watkins is hopeful that this deal will evolve in the coming months to include more definitive demands of the Afghan people.

“As of now, this is intended to initiate the negotiations that will deal with the substantive issues: the future of Afghanistan’s state and society. And of course, that includes women’s rights, minority rights, and press freedom, among other things,” he said.

Afghans latch their hopes on the Afghan government to ensure the protection of their freedoms and rights, while also negotiating with the Taliban for reduction of violence.

Meanwhile, the promised intra-Afghan peace process has hit a snag, as the Afghan government refused to support the U.S.’s promise to release nearly 5,000 Taliban prisoners.

“The release of prisoners is not the U.S.’s authority, it is the authority of the government of Afghanistan,” President Ashraf Ghani told local media a day after the deal was signed. The same was reiterated by Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesperson to the President: “It is not reasonable or logical to release 5,000 prisoners before the Taliban agrees to the Afghan people’s demand for a ceasefire.”

16,2020/03/07,Testing the power of personal touch,"Putin and Erdogan used personal diplomacy to avoid a direct confrontation in Syria’s Idlib

As crisis soared in Syria’s Idlib and the possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and Turkey was rising, most policy wonks in Moscow were looking forward to the March 5 meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Both nations had held several meetings at the Foreign Ministry level in the recent past, but failed to reach a consensus on Syria.

At the summit, Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan agreed to implement a ceasefire in Syria’s rebel-held Idlib, which had seen major attacks by Moscow-backed Syrian government recently. Even as Russia and Turkey back rival factions in Syria’s conflict, the countries have maintained deep trade and defence ties.

For a common Russian citizen, Turkey is a preferred vacation destination (with seven million tourists travelling there last year) and a source of some edibles.

Experts point out that it is the personal meeting between the Russian and Turkish leaders that made the ceasefire possible. Both sides also agreed to establish a secure corridor along the strategically important M4 highway in Syria and kick-start joint patrols from March 15.

“The situation in the Idlib zone has deteriorated so much that we need to have a direct and personal discussion,” Mr. Putin noted in his opening speech before the talks kicked off in a restricted room in the Kremlin.

Emerging before the cameras after a six-hour-long meeting, the Presidents, both looking pale and tired, said the discussion had been “intensive and difficult but constructive”. The agreement reached is a positive development for both countries as well as for Syria, say analysts .

“It is clear that a single meeting, even at the highest level, will not be able to resolve the crisis, but it is certainly giving confidence that the talks will continue, and we might see Putin travelling to Turkey for the next round,” said Farhad Ibragimov, an expert at Moscow-based think tank, the Valdai International Discussion Club.

Preventing further escalation

The very fact that Mr. Erdogan came to Moscow for talks suggested there were hopes for some kind of agreement at the very highest level, Andrey Kortunov, Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), said in an interview to Radio Rossii. He, too, pointed out the two Presidents would not be able to completely solve the issues between Moscow and Ankara regarding their engagement in Syria. However, it was important to prevent further escalation in Idlib and divert any possibility of a direct clash between Russian and Turkish forces, which was achieved.

Russia-Turkey relations have been far from rosy, especially in the last decade. In 2015, a Russian jet was shot down by Turkey over the Syrian skies and in the following year, the Russian Ambassador in Ankara was shot dead. Despite these challenges, both countries deepened their ties in recent years through a lot of deals. These include the supply of S-400 air defence systems, the construction of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant and the TurkStream gas pipeline launched by the two Presidents in February.

While the two leaders were meeting in the Kremlin, Russian bloggers were highlighting the symbolism of the summit. Mr. Putin held the initial meeting with Mr. Erdogan underneath a bronze sculpture ‘Crossing the Balkans’ by Evgeny Lanceray, depicting troops of the Russian Empire during Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, one of many wars that the two empires fought in the past.

On the other side of the room where Russian and Turkish leaders met was a large sculpture of Russian empress Catherine the Great who was responsible for annexation of the Crimea in 1783 from the Ottomans.

Symbolism aside, economic cooperation also featured in the talks, said officials. People close to negotiations note that Mr. Erdogan had included Turkey’s Economic Minister in the delegation for this Moscow visit, which indicated that Syria was not the only point of discussion.

One of the first statements made by Mr. Erdogan upon his return to Istanbul from Moscow was that Turkey would activate its S-400 advanced missile systems delivered by Russia last year in coming April. This means Turkey is ready for another round of bickering with its NATO partners, who oppose the deal. This could be a message from Mr. Erdogan that Russo-Turkish ties are on track despite the Syria troubles.

The tensions between the two countries look eased for now, but Syria remains on the brink.

17,2020/03/07,The women who kicked the hornet’s nest,"Women’s groups in Pakistan are set to take out ‘Aurat March’ defying threats from extremists

Thousands of women across Pakistani cities will join the Aurat March (Women’s March) on Sunday to mark the International Women’s Day, defying threats and warnings issued by conservative and right-wing groups. Since 2018, Aurat March has been held in many cities including Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, demanding equality and an end to gender discrimination.

This year’s charter of demands include a just economic system, freedom from exploitation and discrimination, reproductive rights, transgender rights and child rights. However, certain groups have come out against the march, threatening to use violence against the activists.

Last year, right-wing groups had targeted the organisers of the Aurat March, mainly on social networks. This time, posters and murals prepared for the march were vandalised in Lahore. In Islamabad, a mural that was being painted ahead of the march was defaced by students of a seminary associated with the Lal Masjid. Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who led a march against Prime Minister Imran Khan in November, threatened the Aurat March by saying that his party would not allow “vulgarity” and “obscenity”.

‘Mera Jism, Meri Marzi’ (My Body, My Choice) is one slogan that has become a huge bone of contention once again. Last week, on a live television show on Neo News, rights activist and journalist Marvi Sirmed was called “a b****” by writer Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar, when she repeated the slogan ‘Mera Jism, Meri Marzi’. The show’s anchor didn’t stop Mr. Qamar. Instead, she kept asking Ms. Sirmed to talk when her turn comes. The organisers of the march have not backed down in the face of threats.

Right to say ‘No’

Talking to The Hindu, Ms. Sirmed said she would march because she wanted to exercise her right to say ‘NO’. “No to stereotypes and the social construct that makes women perpetually suffer while men keep abusing them with impunity. Because I want to say no to male privilege. Because I want to say no to sexual harassment, honour crimes, domestic violence, structural exclusion of women from economic, social and political spheres. No to the glass ceiling.”

Ms. Sirmed added that most of all, she would march because “I want to smash patriarchy to little pieces. As little as the minds of men who enjoy and abuse their privilege.”

Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), told The Hindu that his party has and would always support women’s rights movements and causes of the marginalised. “We strongly believe and wish for an inclusive, progressive and tolerant Pakistan. We should not allow right-wing elements in our society to disrupt the Aurat March. Freedom of expression and right to a peaceful assembly is enshrined in our Constitution. The government must provide security to the Aurat March processions after open threats by extremist groups.”

Mr. Bhutto-Zardari’s late mother, Benazir Bhutto, was the first woman Prime Minister of Pakistan. “My mother broke the glass ceiling decades ago.” Mr. Bhutto-Zardari said that those who used to say that women cannot successfully rule a country were proved wrong. “She [Benazir Bhutto] successfully led the democratic struggle against two dictatorships and in both her tenures brought about much-needed social reforms. It was during her tenure that Pakistan signed and ratified the UN convention on elimination of discrimination against women.”

The controversy over the march has even reached the High Court in Lahore. A petitioner wanted the court to stop the march from going ahead as it would “spread anarchy, vulgarity, blasphemy and hatred” of Islam. The court ruled it should proceed. Earlier this month, the Islamabad High Court also dismissed a petition to stop Aurat March. On March 6, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority asked TV channels to refrain from broadcasting ""vulgar/inappropriate content"" with regard to the march.

Feminist scholar and educationist Rubina Saigol said the march was important at so many levels for the feminist movement in Pakistan. “The way that some provocative slogans and placards are being discussed in mainstream media and social media shows how fragile male ego can be and how these slogans have hit patriarchy.” Ms. Saigol believes that Aurat March has started a new phase in feminism.

“This is the age of social media. It helps get out the word far more quickly and far more forcefully than in the past.”

He said the mosque’s Friday sermons throw light on women’s issues and their rights in Islam.

“I am really happy, and this is a really good decision. We are hopeful that the mosque administration will allow women regularly also,” Kousar Shah, 45, one of the women who offered prayers on Friday, told the Dawn.

21,2020/03/07,Coronavirus | Egypt says cruise ship quarantined over new virus cluster,"A Taiwanese-American tourist who had previously been on the same ship tested positive when she returned to Taiwan

A cruise ship on Egypt’s Nile River with over 150 tourists, including Indians, and local crew was in quarantine Saturday in the southern city of Luxor, after 12 people tested positive for the new coronavirus (COVID-19).

A Taiwanese-American tourist who had previously been on the same ship tested positive when she returned to Taiwan. The World Health Organization (WHO) informed Egyptian authorities, who tested everyone currently on the ship.

Health authorities in Egypt released a statement on Friday saying they’d found a dozen Egyptian crew members on the ship had contracted the fast-spreading virus, but did not show symptoms.

The statement said the 12 will be transferred to isolation in a hospital on Egypt’s north coast. The passengers — who include Americans, French and other nationalities — and crew will remain quarantined on the ship awaiting further test results.

This brought the total number of cases in Egypt to 15. It came just days after three people were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. state of Texas. Officials in the city of Houston said on Thursday that they believe the three were exposed to the virus while on a trip to Egypt in late February.

It was not immediately clear if the Texan tourists were on the same boat where the cluster occurred, how long the passengers on the ship had been quarantined, nor where exactly the initial Taiwanese tourist had contracted the virus.

Egyptian authorities have been tight-lipped about the virus outbreak, previously reporting only three confirmed cases. That’s even as the wider Mideast now has over 5,000 confirmed cases, the vast majority in Iran.

The previous two cases in Egypt were a Chinese and a Canadian national, then an Egyptian who was in Serbia and had stayed for 12 hours in France before arriving in Cairo. Egyptian authorities said Friday that they have tested over 2,500 people who were found not to have the virus, including foreign nationals.

The new and fast-spreading COVID-19 could deliver a major below to Egypt’s tourism industry. The government has been struggling for years to revive the vital sector following the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising.

Other countries around the world have closed schools and universities, while also cancelling major art, sporting and business events.

Egypt does not appear to have taken any of these types of measures, and Friday’s discovery of the 12 cases coincided with the opening day of the Luxor African Film Festival.

The country’s national air carrier, Egypt Air, has suspended direct flights to China since late January.

22,2020/03/07,Saudi detains three royal princes over 'coup plot': reports,"Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason

Saudi authorities have detained three princes including King Salman's brother and nephew on charges of plotting a coup, the US. media reported Friday, signalling a further consolidation of power by the kingdom's de facto ruler.

The detentions cast aside the last vestiges of potential opposition to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and come as the kingdom limits access to Islam's holiest sites in a highly sensitive move to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus.

Tap here for the latest updates on Coronavirus

Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason and taken from their homes early Friday by black-clad royal guards, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources.

The Saudi royal court has accused the two men, once potential contenders for the throne, of “plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince” and could face lifetime imprisonment or execution, the newspaper said.

The New York Times also reported the detentions, adding that Prince Nayef's younger brother, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef, had also been detained.

Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The detentions mark the latest crackdown by Prince Mohammed, who has consolidated his grip on power with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites.

Prince Mohammed has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October 2018.

Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 84-year-old father King Salman.

“Prince Mohammed is emboldened -- he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation, said of the latest crackdown.

“This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone including royals — not to cross him.”-

Rivals ousted

Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy.

Just before his return in October 2018, the Prince had courted controversy over remarks he made to protesters in London chanting against Saudi royals over the kingdom's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Yemen.

“What does the family have to do with it? Certain individuals are responsible... the king and the crown prince,” he said, according to a widely-circulated online video of the incident.

The comment was seen by many as rare criticism of the kingdom's leadership and its role in Yemen, but Prince Ahmed dismissed that interpretation as “inaccurate”.

Prince Mohammed had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, in 2017 to become heir to the Arab world's most powerful throne.

At the time, Saudi television channels showed Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence.

Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.

The detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam's holiest sites to contain the novel coronavirus.

The kingdom has suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj — a key pillar of Islam.

23,2020/03/07,EU extends Pakistan’s GSP-Plus status for two years,"The GSP allows vulnerable developing countries to pay fewer or no duties on exports to the EU, giving them vital access to the EU market and contributing to their growth.

The European Union has extended the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) Plus status for cash-strapped Pakistan for two years, allowing the country access to preferential duties on exports to the EU, according to a media report.

The GSP allows vulnerable developing countries to pay fewer or no duties on exports to the EU, giving them vital access to the EU market and contributing to their growth.

The move comes at a time when Pakistan is facing serious economic crisis with short supplies of foreign currency reserves and stagnating growth in recent years.

Since assuming power in August 2018, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has been appealing to close allies like China and Saudi Arabia to provide loans at lower rates to overcome the financial woes.

According to a report in the Dawn newspaper, the International Trade (INTA) Committee of the EU Parliament extended the GSP-Plus status of the country for the next two years.

The GSP-Plus facility was available to Pakistan since January 2014, the report said.

Pakistan’s first biennial assessment of GSP-Plus was conducted in 2016, followed by another assessment in February 2018, while the third biennial assessment report was published by the European Commission on February 10 this year, it said.

The third biennial assessment report was discussed by the INTA on February 19 and by the GSP Working Party of the European Council a week later.

The European Commission and External Action Service recommended at both the forums to continue the country’s GSP-Plus scheme.

Reacting to the development, Pakistan’s Ministry of Commerce in a statement hoped that the country’s “business community will capitalise further on this trade enhancement opportunity”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/axq2yi/article30727022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-IMRANKHAN-GETTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-extends-pakistans-gsp-plus-status-for-two-years/article31007588.ece
24,2020/03/07,Where Latin America women are fighting the world’s highest murder rates,"Femicide claims the lives of 12 women a day in Latin America which is home to 14 of the 25 countries with the highest rates of femicide globally but 98% of these killings go unprosecuted.

Women took to the streets over the past year across Latin America - from Mexico and Chile to Argentina and Brazil - demanding governments take action in a region where machismo reigns and gender-based violence is widespread.

In Latin America and the Caribbean at least one out of every three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence at some point in her life, according to the United Nations.

Femicide claims the lives of 12 women a day in Latin America which is home to 14 of the 25 countries with the highest rates of femicide globally but 98% of these killings go unprosecuted.

Here are some of the countries which have witnessed the largest mobilizations of women across Latin America over the past year, with street protests scheduled in many on International Women's Day on March 8:

Chile

In Chile protests broke out in October and raged until mid-December over social inequality, sparking a feminist song and dance routine that went viral.

The Chilean Network Against Violence Against Women said 42 cases of sexual abuse were reported on average daily in Chile in 2018 and last year 46 women were killed because of their gender, a crime known as femicide.

To protest feminist theatre collective Las Tesis organized a public performance of “Un Violador en Tu Camino2 (A Rapist in Your Path), a group song and dance drawing attention to the complicity of governments in sexual violence.

A video of the routine last November went viral, with similar performances then taking place in Mexico, Colombia, France and Spain. In December, thousands of women performed the song outside the National Stadium in Chile's capital, Santiago.

The viral protest struck a chord. Earlier this week, a law expanding punishment for femicide from 15 years to life in prison was signed by President Sebastian Pinera.

In another historic move, Chile's members of congress voted this week to ensure equal numbers of female and male lawmakers decide on the country's new constitution.

Argentina

South America's answer to the #MeToo movement was born in Argentina - known as #NiUnaMenos (Not One Less) - prompting hundreds of thousands of women to protest against the high rates of sexual and domestic violence.

Femicides have risen in Argentina in recent years where one women is killed on average every 32 hours, according to La Casa del Encuentro, a local NGO.

Often clad in trademark green bandanas symbolising the surging #NiUnaMenos feminist movement, protests have also focused on abortion rights in Argentina where abortions are only allowed in cases of rape or if the mother's health is at risk.

While lawmakers rejected a bill to legalise abortion in 2018, Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez said earlier this month he will send a bill to decriminalize abortion to Congress.

Brazil

Brazil's latest feminist wave can be traced back to the presidential elections of 2018, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets in major cities in women-led protests against then front-runner Jair Bolsonaro.

Angered by Bolsonaro's history of making demeaning comments, which include belittling rape, women protesters used the hash tag #EleNao, or #NotHim, to drum up support for a series of protests against the former army captain.

Brazil is among the deadliest countries in the world for women, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a non-governmental organization. Hundreds of women are hurt each hour, mostly by their current or former male partners.

Last year, the women-led protests erupted again after Bolsonaro took office, with thousands marching through the streets in nine Brazilian cities on International Womens Day.

In August, a group of hundreds of indigenous women occupied a health ministry building in Brasilia to protest Bolsonaro's policies towards indigenous groups.

Days later, thousands of women took over the Brazilian capital as part of a protest held every four years known as the 'March of the Margaridas', named after murdered Brazilian union leader Margarida Maria Alves.

Mexico

In Mexico, the femicide rate rose almost 10% in 2019 and more than 75% of women say they feel unsafe in their city, according to a survey by statistics body INEGI, sparking women-led protests in cities across the country.

Large groups took to the streets last August after local news reported the rape of two women by police officers, and the abduction and murder of 7-year-old Fatima Cecilia Aldrighett in February this year sparked a new round of protests.

Protesters sprayed graffiti on the Mexico City Angel of Independence monument and doused the capital's security chief in bright pink glitter.

On March 9, women across the country are planning to not turn up for work in a protest supported by many large companies and the government.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ivym40/article31007332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOMAN-ANTIVIOLENCEMEXICO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/where-latin-america-women-are-fighting-the-worlds-highest-murder-rates/article31007293.ece

26,2020/03/07,China refutes report its ship fired laser at U.S. navy plane,"The report last month was the latest accusation that Chinese forces have used lasers to harass and potentially damage U.S. and other nations’ military aircraft and personnel.

China’s Defense Ministry says a report one of its navy ships fired a laser last month at a U.S. Navy surveillance plane circling overhead does not “accord with reality.”

The report last month was the latest accusation that Chinese forces have used lasers to harass and potentially damage U.S. and other nations’ military aircraft and personnel.

In China’s first pubic comments on the alleged incident, Ren accused an American P-8A Poseidon of carrying out “long-period circling reconnaissance at low-altitude despite repeated warnings from the Chinese side.”

""The American aircraft’s behavior was unfriendly in intention and unprofessional by operation, which severely threatened the safety of the vessels, aircraft and crew of both sides,” he said.

The U.S. Navy waited more than a week before accusing the Chinese ship of firing a laser at a U.S. surveillance aircraft flying over the Philippine Sea west of Guam, an act the U.S. deemed unsafe and a violation of international codes and agreements. The statement from U.S. Pacific Fleet said the laser was detected by sensors on the aircraft, but was not visible to the naked eye.

The Philippine Sea lies far to the north and west of the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety despite countering claims by others.

The U.S. has sought to avoid such incidents with the signing of agreements with China on handling unexpected incidents at sea and in the air, but Beijing has apparently not followed those protocols consistently.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/x7hza3/article31007136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-USASOUTHCHINASEA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-refutes-report-its-ship-fired-laser-at-us-navy-plane/article31007137.ece
27,2020/03/07,Trump names Rep. Mark Meadows his new chief of staff,"Mr. Trump announced the surprise staff reshuffle in a series of Friday night tweets, saying Mr. Mulvaney would become the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.

Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump has announced a major staff overhaul, naming Rep. Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff and replacing Mick Mulvaney, who has been acting in the role for more than a year.

Mr. Trump announced the surprise staff reshuffle in a series of Friday night tweets, saying Mr. Mulvaney would become the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.

I have long known and worked with Mr. Mark, and the relationship is a very good one, he wrote, thanking Mr. Mulvaney — who never shook his acting title — for having served the Administration so well.

The long-rumoured move makes Mr. Meadows, who announced he was not seeking reelection for his House seat from North Carolina, effectively Mr. Trump’s fourth chief of staff since taking office in 2017.

The decision comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism for its handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Mr. Mulvaney had been leading the interagency response to the virus until Mr. Trump designated Vice President Mike Pence to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago.

Mr. Mulvaney has been marginalised inside the White House for months, taking on a more and more narrow role.

And Mr. Trump has been eyeing the change for months, but wanted to wait until after impeachment, according to a person familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorised to discuss it publicly.

Mulvaney’s allies, however, had long brushed off rumblings off his imminent departure and had said as recently as last month that he planned to stay at least through the election in November.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/856ozt/article31007127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPCHIEFOFSTAFF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-names-rep-mark-meadows-his-new-chief-of-staff/article31007128.ece

Referring to the cases and deaths reported in other countries like China, Mr. Trump asserted that COVID-19 is under control in the U.S.

At a White House news conference later in the day, Vice President Mike Pence said that 21 people aboard a cruise ship held off the coast of California have tested positive for the COVID-19.

There were 3,500 people on board the Grand Princess ship anchored near San Francisco.

“All passengers and crew will be tested for the COVID-19. Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require an additional medical attention will receive it,” Mr. Pence said.

“Let me assure the American public as we did so with Americans returning from China and those returning from the other cruise ship we are taking all measures necessary to see to the health of the Americans and those involved on the grand Princess and just as importantly to protect the health of the American public and prevent the spread of the disease through communities in this country,” he said.

The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has risen by 49 to 197, the Civil Protection Agency said on Friday, the largest daily increase in fatalities since the contagion was uncovered two weeks ago.

Italy is currently reporting more deaths per day from the virus than any other country in the world and the government this week ordered the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres around the country to try to stem the infections.

The cumulative number of cases in the country, which has been the hardest hit in Europe by the epidemic, totalled 4,636 compared with 3,858 on Thursday.

China, where the outbreak began, had 80,711 confirmed cases and 3,045 cumulative cases, 30 of them reported on Friday by the World Health Organisation.

The Vatican, an independent state that sits in the heart of Rome, registered its first case on Friday.

The national health institute said the average age of those who had died so far was 81, with the vast majority suffering underlying health problems. Just 28% were women.

The fatality rate from the illness in Italy, which has one of the oldest populations in the world, is running at 4.25%, higher than in most other countries.

In a worrying sign for hard-pressed hospitals, the number of patients in intensive care rose more than 30% on Friday to 462. On a more positive note, some 523 people have fully recovered, authorities said, an increase of 26% on the previous tally.

Analysts say the crisis will push Italy's fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years. Credit ratings agency Moody's on Friday cut its growth forecast for the country to -0.5% in 2020, from a previous +0.5% estimate.

Underscoring the economic concerns, the Milan stock exchange fell 3.5% on Friday and is now down 17.4% since news of the first case was announced on Feb. 21.

The tourism sector, which accounts for 13% of national output, has suffered the hardest immediate hit, with visitors shunning the country out of fear of infection.

The Czech Republic said on Friday that anyone returning from trips to Italy would have to go into quarantine for two weeks or face fines, while neighbouring Slovakia said it was banning all flights to and from Italy.

Rome has previously denounced such moves to isolate the country. There is also widespread annoyance with France, Germany and other EU allies who have imposed curbs on the export of protective medical gear to avoid shortages at home.

“So much for the European Union,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the opposition, far-right League party.

“When Italy needs help, doors are closed and wallets shut. Once the health emergency is over, it will be necessary to rethink and rebuild everything, starting from Brussels.”

Italy's sporting world is also facing unprecedented turmoil.

The Alpine skiing World Cup finals in Italy's Cortina d'Ampezzo were cancelled on Friday, while a Formula E race scheduled for Rome on April 4 will not now take place, the all-electric series announced on Friday.

The Milan-Sanremo one-day cycle race set for later this month has also been cancelled as well as two other cycling events in Italy.

31,2020/03/07,COVID-19 | Twenty-one people test positive for virus aboard cruise ship off San Francisco,"President Mike Pence said the cruise ship Grand Princess will be brought to an unspecified non-commercial port where all passengers and crew, about 3,500 people, will be tested

Twenty-one people have tested positive for COVID-19 aboard a cruise ship denied entry to San Francisco Bay this week after a number of passengers and crew developed flu-like symptoms on the vessel, which was linked to previously confirmed COVID-19 infections.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, announcing results of the tests during a White House briefing, also said the cruise ship Grand Princess will be brought to an unspecified non-commercial port where all passengers and crew, about 3,500 people, will be tested for COVID-19.

Diagnostic test kits were flown by an Air National Guard helicopter on Thursday to the cruise ship, where medical staff took samples from 46 passengers and crew to determine if they have contracted the respiratory virus.

The samples were carried back to a state laboratory in the Bay area. Pence said 21 of the tests came back positive, 24 were negative and one was inconclusive.

In the meantime, passengers aboard the ship said they had been largely confined to their staterooms since Thursday afternoon, as the cruise line requested. One passenger who spoke on Thursday with Reuters, Kathy Reid, 67, a retiree from Granbury, Texas, said she and others felt like they were in ”limbo.”

California Governor Gavin Newsom has insisted that the ship, which had been due to return from Hawaii to its home port in San Francisco on Wednesday, remain at sea until everyone aboard who is sick or at risk of exposure to COVID-19 can be tested.

Health officials had said on Thursday they planned to initially test 35 passengers and crew who have reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as well as dozens of “holdover” passengers from an earlier voyage to Mexico.

State and local officials acted to halt the cruise liner after learning people aboard had fallen ill and two passengers who travelled on the same vessel last month to Mexico later tested positive for COVID-19.

One, an elderly man from Placer County near Sacramento with underlying health conditions, died this week, marking the first documented COVID-19 fatality in California. The other, from the Bay area, was described by Newsom as gravely sick.

Health officials say both individuals likely contracted the virus aboard the ship.

A third passenger from the Mexico trip, a Canadian woman from the province of Alberta, has since been reported by health officials there to have tested positive.

Health officials were also seeking to contact some 2,500 passengers who disembarked in San Francisco on Feb. 21 after the earlier cruise to Mexico.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n9il8d/article31007046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORRECTIONAPTOPIXVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-twenty-one-people-test-positive-for-virus-aboard-cruise-ship-off-san-francisco/article31007047.ece

Two former presidential rivals endorsed Joe Biden on Friday in the latest sign that the Democratic establishment is coalescing around the former vice president to stop the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, who ratcheted up attacks on his rival ahead of crucial contests next week.

Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman - both onetime 2020 candidates - backed Biden, as did a slew of other Democratic officials in states soon to hold primary elections.

Sanders, who is desperate to regain some momentum after Biden's strong Super Tuesday showing this week, launched a full-throated attack on his rival, assailing Biden over his record on trade, abortion, gay rights and Social Security.

The pair contest six Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday, including the big prize of Michigan, with 125 of the 1,991 delegates needed to win the nomination at stake.

Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who until recently the front-runner in the party's race to face Republican President Donald Trump in November, now trails in delegates. A big win for Biden in Michigan would deliver another major blow to Sanders' hopes of becoming the nominee.

Ahead of Michigan's primary, the state's lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, backed Biden, as did part of the state's United Food and Commercial Workers Union, and former U.S. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan.

Four other states will hold primary elections on Tuesday: Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri and Washington state. North Dakota will hold caucuses.

At a news conference in Phoenix on Friday, Sanders dug deep into Bidens 40-year record. He criticized Biden for having opposed the rights of gay people to serve in the U.S. military and for voting against federal funding for abortions, stances the former vice president has since rejected.

“I was there on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not,” Sanders said.

Sanders lambasted Biden for supporting trade deals he said had been “a disaster for Michigan” and accused Biden of trying in the past to cut Social Security, the government-run pension and disability program.

Biden, who denies ever advocating cuts to Social Security, snapped back in a tweet on Friday: “Get real, Bernie. The only person who's going to cut Social Security if he's elected is Donald Trump. Maybe you should spend your time attacking him.”

The exchange reflects mounting tension between the two White House hopefuls. The race became a tight two-way contest after U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ended their White House bids after disappointing showings in the Super Tuesday primaries.

Sanders, 78, said he would support Biden, 77, if he becomes the Democratic nominee but insisted that only he, not Biden, could “energize the American people” enough to beat Trump.

Warren's exit meant that what had been hailed as the most diverse field of candidates in U.S. history narrowed to a race for the nomination between two white, septuagenarian men. Tulsi Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii with virtually no chance of winning, is the only other remaining Democratic candidate.

On Friday, the Democratic National Committee, which oversees the party's presidential debates, released new qualifying thresholds for the next debate in Arizona on Mar. 15. Candidates will need at least 20% of delegates awarded so far, essentially excluding Gabbard, who has won less than 1 percent.

Biden's Super Tuesday turnaround benefited as the Democratic Party establishment began mobilizing this week to try and stop Sanders, a democratic socialist, with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota dropping out of the race and endorsing Biden.

Biden also received endorsements on Friday in other states with upcoming primary contests, including from Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan in Washington state, and Ruben Gallego, an Arizona congressman.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois are expected to soon announce endorsements of Biden, according to a source familiar with the matter.

33,2020/03/07,"COVID-19 | More than 100,000 infected worldwide, wreaking financial havoc","The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with seven countries reporting their first cases on Friday

The number of people infected with the new COVID-19 surpassed 100,000 across the world on Friday, as the outbreak reached more countries and economic damage intensified, with business districts beginning to empty and stock markets tumbling.

In many affected countries, people were being asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sports and music events were cancelled, stores were cleared of staples like toiletries and water, and face masks became a common sight.

The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with seven countries reporting their first cases on Friday.

More than 100,300 people have been infected globally, according to a Reuters tally based on statements from health ministries and government officials. Mainland China has seen more than 3,000 deaths, but the epidemic is now spreading faster elsewhere.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said every country should make containing the epidemic its top priority, pointing to Iran's national action plan to combat one of the worst outbreaks after a slow start.

Iran's death toll from the virus jumped to 124, as more than 1,000 new cases were diagnosed over 24 hours.

About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, the WHO said this week.

A bill signed by U.S. President Donald Trump will provide $8.3 billion to bolster the country's capacity to test for coronavirus and fund other measures to stem the outbreak that has spread to 22 states, with Pennsylvania, Indiana and Minnesota reporting their first cases. The death toll in the world's economic powerhouse was 15, with more than 230 cases.

A cruise ship has been barred from docking in San Francisco after at least 35 people developed flu-like symptoms while on board. The ship has been linked to two confirmed cases COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.

The Vatican reported its first case, a patient in its health services. The discovery worsened the prospects of the virus having already spread further in the Italian capital, since most employees in the walled city-state live in Rome, and those who live in the Vatican frequently go in and out into the city that surrounds it.

Italy is the worst-hit European country, with a death toll as of Friday of 197.

Supply chains broken

Moves by some major economies, including the United States, to cut interest rates and pledge funds to fight the epidemic have done little to allay fears about the spread of the disease and the economic fallout. Supply chains have been crippled around the world, especially in China, the world's second largest economy, where the outbreak began.

“There's concern that while there has been a response from the Fed, given the nature of the problem, is this something the central bank can really help with?” said John Davies, G10 rates strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in London.

In New York, JPMorgan divided its team between central locations and a secondary site in New Jersey, while Goldman Sachs sent some traders to nearby secondary offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Jersey City.

Bank of America Corp is splitting its trading force from Monday and sending 100 New York-based staff to nearby Stamford, Connecticut, sources familiar with the matter said.

In London, Europe's financial capital, the Canary Wharf district was unusually quiet. S&P Global's large office stood empty after the company sent its 1,200 staff home, while HSBC asked around 100 people to work from home after a worker tested positive for the illness.

Starbucks Corp said it had stopped accepting reusable cups and thermos flasks from customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, though it will still honour the promised discount for anyone carrying one.

France's prime minister said nurseries and schools will close for 15 days from Monday in the two areas most hit by coronavirus infections, one north of Paris and the other in the northeastern part of the country.

In Florida, Miami officials cancelled two music festivals on Friday because of potential risk that coronavirus could spread at events that bring large crowds into close proximity, while the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament will go ahead at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore this weekend without spectators.

Saudi Arabia will suspend public attendance at all sports events starting Saturday, the ministry of sports said.

Markets hit

Yields on U.S. Treasuries plunged to historic lows on fears the outbreak will slam the global economy, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 3.10%. U.S. stocks fell but ended well above their session lows.

Airline and travel stocks have been among the worst affected as people cancelled non-essential travel. Norwegian Air Shuttle , the hardest-hit stock among European carriers, lost more than quarter of its market value on Friday and has fallen almost 70% since the start of February.

“If this really ramps up, we could see a lot more kitchen-sinking updates from the travel industry and airlines,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2suuhk/article31006727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HONDURAS-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS-CORONAVIRUS-COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-more-than-100000-infected-worldwide-wreaking-financial-havoc/article31006728.ece
34,2020/03/07,"Weinstein’s prison sentence should reflect ‘lifetime of abuse’, say prosecutors","Throughout his adult life, Weinstein has shown a “staggering lack of empathy, treating others with disdain and inhumanity, says Manhattan District Attorney

Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein should get a prison sentence that reflects not only his conviction for sexually assaulting two women, but a ”lifetime of abuse towards others,” New York prosecutors said in a court filing on Friday.

Throughout his adult life, Weinstein has shown a “staggering lack of empathy, treating others with disdain and inhumanity,” Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance’s office said in a letter to Justice James Burke, who is scheduled to sentence Weinstein on Wednesday.

“He has consistently advanced his own sordid desires and fixations over the well-being of others,” prosecutors wrote. “He has destroyed people’s lives and livelihoods or threatened to do so on whim.”

Prosecutors did not recommend a specific sentence in the filing for Weinstein, who faces a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison.

Donna Rotunno, a lawyer for Weinstein, had no immediate comment.

On Feb. 24, a jury found the former movie mogul guilty of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and of raping onetime aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.

The jury of seven men and five women acquitted Weinstein on the most serious charges, which carried a potential life sentence. Those charges relied on testimony by actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s.

In addition to Haleyi, Mann and Sciorra, prosecutors called three more women to testify against Weinstein, portraying him as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises to open doors in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments, and then overpowering and violently attacking them.

Throughout Weinstein’s trial, the defense said regret drove his accusers to reframe consensual encounters as crimes. Weinstein’s lawyers zeroed in on friendly messages and ongoing contact between the women and Weinstein.

More than 80 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment. He denied the accusations and said any sexual encounters were consensual.

In Friday’s filing, prosecutors listed more than a dozen accusations going back to 1978, when they said he sexually assaulted an employee of his Buffalo, New York-based music company in a hotel room. The prosecutors argued Justice Burke should consider the alleged incidents even though they were never criminally charged.

They also accused Weinstein of verbally and physically abusive behavior in the workplace dating back to the 1990s.

Weinstein is awaiting sentencing in New York’s Rikers Island jail, where he was moved Thursday after a 10-day hospital stay following his conviction.

He still faces sexual assault charges in Los Angeles, which were announced just hours after his New York trial began on Jan. 6. Dozens of women have also filed civil lawsuits against him.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rx4gz8/article31006463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PEOPLE-HARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/weinsteins-prison-sentence-should-reflect-lifetime-of-abuse-say-prosecutors/article31006464.ece

37,2020/03/07,"For years, we’ve enjoyed the flavour that other cultures have added to our lives","And we must continue to do so to enrich our present and the heritage of generations to come

Imagine a table laden with dishes… or a thali laden with mounds of fresh, lightly tempered vegetables and little katoris of runny jhols, thick kormas, pachadis and raitas… all the same uniform colour. Even if that colour is the brightest turmeric yellow, saffron orange, or chilli red… or the most intense spinach emerald or fresh coriander green.

The image doesn’t make the heart sing. Everything on the table the same red: tomatoes, carrots, beetroot. Or everything beige: potatoes, chicken curry, dal, paratha. Or a medley of most people’s ‘favourite’ things: brown korma, chana, and brown crisply fried potato wedges. I’d much rather it was a heap of unadorned white rice, a yellow dal sunny with turmeric, a curry ruby-red with fried tomatoes, a golden-brown gravy of mutton chops, a heap of fresh tender beans as green as grass with maybe a roasted papad on the side, crisped almost black at the edges.

Or imagine a lifetime of three meals a day, each the same: aloo matar, phulka. Or mutton korma, tandoori roti. At breakfast, lunch and dinner, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday… Or dal and rice. Or a cheese omelette with toasted white bread. Every day, day in, day out and meal in, meal out. They’re all quite delicious, but the more if occasional. I love yellow dhokla speckled with black mustard seeds, but then should I abjure plain fluffy white idlis? There are serious economic issues related to food and nutrition, but for those of us privileged enough to have access to all the food we need, variety is truly what makes the world go round. It’s also a happy coincidence that, according to food experts, eating all food types is better for balanced health.

New foods come into our reach as the world gets smaller. Much has been written about the origin of potatoes and chillies, about how we were introduced to them only when the Portuguese came to India not so long ago — and about the real provenance of recipes that we had considered ours — as if we ate biryani and samosa since time immemorial. We’ve enjoyed the flavour that other cultures have added to our lives, and are still discovering new foods. I may baulk at tandoori momos and dosas filled with chow mein, but do I have any right to lay down what’s legit and what ain’t?

In our land, a continent more than a country, we’ve been blessed with diverse ingredients and spices; regional and cultural diversity fills our larders, spiking it with flavours from basil to asafoetida. Imagine spurning the rainbow and limiting ourselves to same old bread-and-butter. What were considered foreign, ‘English’ vegetables, like cauliflower and carrots, are now ‘normal’. Potatoes are staple. If we can absorb all of these in our daily cooking, it’s not a big stretch to acquaint ourselves with and appreciate more of the diversity that’s on our doorsteps.

A kilo of ‘jugni’

Remember a time, not so long ago, when broccoli was ‘exotic’? Now Bhagwan Singh, my father’s major-domo, asks “Aaj broccoline (sic) ki aloo gobhi bana doon? (Shall I cook the broccoli like aloo-gobhi, potato-cauliflower?)” Because Daddy grows vegetables, and after he’s distributed a hundred kilos and is still left with another hundred, the chef tries to innovate. And it works — cooked aloo-gobhi style, with turmeric and a tempering of slivered ginger, broccoli is quite delicious. It doesn’t have to be used only in a Chinese stir-fry or baked in white sauce. Back in the day, zucchini was bought from fancy gourmet stores for special menus. Now, pushcart vendors sell it door-to-door practically around the year; only, they call it ‘jugni’.

We have an abundance of ingredients and if we look beyond our noses, an abundance of cooking techniques. I was brought up in a largely Punjabi home and my mother made vegetables sometimes in a medium-thick gravy. The base was always puréed onions, and she used to ask how some kitchens produced ultra-smooth, thin gravies. She said she had tried but just couldn’t get it.

I wish I knew then what I know now: that Indian gravies can be made without any onion at all. She had less exposure, there was no Internet, no cable TV, and Indian cookbooks were limited to narrow cuisines. Her only access to ‘other’ cooking was through Western cookery books and recipes in Woman and Home.

Wildly exciting

We have food that’s shallow fried, steamed, braised, sautéed, roasted, grilled, charred and chilled. We simmer our fish in watery soups or thick pastes, sometimes after deep frying and sometimes without… and what a difference it makes to the jhol, jhaal or kaliya. A Kashmiri kaliya has some similarity, but different spices.

I used to find that the cuisine of any part of India other than my own was wildly exciting and full of endless variety and possibility. Only after more exposure and more eating I find that there’s a limited repertoire in most spice cupboards. Some regions often use mustard seeds, chana dal and curry leaf in the tempering; some, closer home, are deadly boring because it’s cumin and coriander. All my mother’s mutton curries had the same spices — sometimes roasted, sometimes ground, sometimes whole — the only differentiator was the stage at which they were added to the dish. But eating and talking with friends, I increasingly find that their traditional food is a treasure chest of taste and if I borrow a pinch, my cooking is enhanced.

But for that, I have to step out of the Lakshman rekha drawn by my upbringing, and be open to new ideas. It’s happened in the past, gradually and so surely that we now accept it as integral to our lives. If we could take proud ownership of ‘alien’ foods once, continuing to do so would enrich our present and the heritage of generations to come.

‘Kashmiri’ Mutton Koftas

Serves 3-4

(This is loosely based on a Kashmiri Pandit recipe called muchch/ mutsch, but with variations I like.)

Ingredients

400g lean mutton mince

Marinade for mince

3 tsp mustard oil

1 tsp hung yoghurt (or 2-3 tsp solid yoghurt)

2 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder

2 drops of powdered hing (asafoetida) mixed in water

1/4 tsp powdered saunth (dried ginger)

½ tsp powdered saunf (fennel)

Salt

For the gravy

2 tbsp mustard oil

1 tsp cumin seeds

1 clove

1 green cardamom, broken

2-3 drops of hing solution

2 tsp hung yoghurt (or 2 tbsp firm yoghurt)

2 tsp chilli powder mixed in 1 cup water

Salt

1/4 tsp powdered saunth (dried ginger)

½ tsp powdered saunf (fennel)

Pinch of garam masala powder

Method

1. Thoroughly mix mince and marinade ingredients together. Shape into little torpedos, like mini cocktail sausages, and place neatly on a tray.

2. Start on the gravy: heat the mustard oil in a wide bottomed pan and fry cumin seeds till crisp. Add clove and cardamom (many people use black cardamom) followed by hing solution. Add yoghurt and keep stirring on medium heat till moisture evaporates and oil appears at the edges.

3. Add chilli powder in water and stir in salt, saunth and saunf.

4. When the liquid starts boiling, gently lower in koftas. Keep it bubbling till the water evaporates and the koftas start drying up. A thick spice-and-yoghurt paste will start wrapping around the koftas. Keep simmering on low heat and stirring with a spatula to prevent it catching.

5. Meanwhile, boil another ¾ cup of water and pour it on to the sides of the kofta pan. Bring it to the boil, add garam masala powder and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve with steamed rice and a green vegetable, preferably leafy.

Should East ruff at any point, South would over-ruff, cash the other high trump, and return to dummy with a ruff. East’s exact distribution was known, so South should never ruff the “wrong” major in dummy. The king of diamonds would draw the last trump and dummy would be high. Should East never ruff, the last three tricks would all be high trumps, starting with a trump to South’s 10.

40,2020/03/07,"Not enough evidence to summon former CBI Special Director Rakesh Asthana, says court","Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal made the observation while taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed by the CBI

A Delhi court on Saturday said there was not enough evidence to summon former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Special Director Rakesh Asthana in a bribery case lodged by the agency.

Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal made the observation while taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed by the CBI, in which Mr. Asthana’s name was mentioned in Column 12.

Column 12 means there is not enough evidence to make a person an accused.

The court made a similar observation about CBI Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Devender Kumar, who was arrested by the agency in 2018 and later got bail. His name was also mentioned in Column 12 of the charge sheet.

The court, however, summoned “middleman” Manoj Prasad, who was arrayed as an accused in the charge sheet.

It also summoned Mr. Prasad’s brother Someshwar Srivastava and father-in-law Sunil Mittal, saying there was sufficient material to proceed against them.

Both Mr. Srivastava’s and Mr. Mittal’s names had cropped up during the probe.

The court directed Mr. Prasad, Mr. Srivastava and Mr. Mittal to appear before the court on April 13.

“There is sufficient evidence to proceed against Manoj Prasad, Someshwar Srivastava and Sunil Mittal. I summon them for April 13. Rakesh Asthana and Devender Kumar are not being summoned since there is no sufficient evidence against them,” the judge said.

The CBI may file a charge sheet if it finds anything against Mr. Asthana in its ongoing probe, the judge said.

The judge took cognisance of the charge sheet filed under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and 385 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The court was earlier told by the former investigating officer of the case, A.K. Bassi, that there were “clinching evidence” against Mr. Asthana.

The charge sheet, filed on February 11, had only arrayed Mr. Prasad as an accused.

Suspended DSP Mr. Kumar was the investigating officer in a 2017 case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Sana, who was arrested for alleged links to the Moin Qureshi money laundering case, had also claimed links to senior officials of the CBI and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).

The current case of alleged bribery was lodged on a complaint of Mr. Sana.

The court had on February 12 expressed displeasure over the CBI’s investigation into the case and had asked why the accused with bigger roles were roaming free while the probe agency had arrested its own DSP.

41,2020/03/07,Denial of starvation deaths in Jharkhand sparks anger,"Jharkhand Food Minister Rameshwar Oraon says State government ‘runs in continuity’

The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-Congress government, headed by Hemant Soren, has denied any starvation death in the State under BJP rule in the past five years.

Also read | Death by digital exclusion? : on faulty public distribution system in Jharkhand

The denial triggered a strong reaction from right-to-food activists and prompted questions about the coalition’s charge — in the run-up to the 2019 Assembly election — that irregularities in the public distribution system had resulted in such deaths.

Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) MLA Vinod Singh recently asked in the Assembly whether or not there were more than 12 deaths due to hunger and malnutrition in the past five years. The response by Food and Public Distribution Minister Rameshwar Oraon on March 5 was “negative” or “not true”.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Oraon, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said a State government “runs in continuity, and this is the report of the previous government, and how can this government say people died of starvation”.

He said, “We were in Opposition then (when the alleged deaths occurred) and the then government had cancelled 11 lakhs ration cards. Our people would go to the homes of these people and raise the issue of these deaths.” In none of the cases, he said, doctors had certified that the deaths were due to hunger or starvation.

In its election manifesto, the JMM had referred to starvation deaths. “Even today, Jharkhand is in the news across the world for its starvation deaths,” it had said.

Mr. Oraon said the government would not open a fresh probe into the deaths. “If such an incident happens, we will not try to hush it up as the previous government did. We are working to ensure that none is suffering from hunger.” In this year’s Budget, he said, it was proposed to give rations to additional 10 lakh people, with an allocation of ₹187 crore.

However, right-to-food activists, who played a key role in highlighting the irregularities in the Public Distribution System under the BJP, said the government’s denial of starvation deaths was “very unfortunate”.

42,2020/03/07,"Naveen Patnaik announces RS nominees’ list, ends speculation over pact with BJP","BJD is placed in a comfortable position to win three seats

Putting speculation to rest, Odisha Chief Minister and Biju Janata Dal president Naveen Patnaik on Saturday announced the names of his party’s candidates for elections to the four Rajya Sabha seats in the State.

Subhas Singh, Munna Khan, Sujeet Kumar and Mamata Mahanta will be the candidates for the elections scheduled on March 26.

While Mr. Singh was the chairman of the Odisha Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, Mr. Khan was adviser to the Minorities Affairs Department and Mr. Kumar was adviser to the Special Development Council. Ms. Mahanta is a prominent leader of the party women’s wing in Mayurbhanj district. They belonged to coastal, southern, western and northern regions respectively.

Earlier, there was speculation that the BJD may not field a candidate for the fourth seat if it enters into any kind of understanding with the BJP. The party had supported BJP nominee Ashwini Vaishnaw in the Rajya Sabha polls last year following requests from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Of the four seats now going to the polls, one was vacated by BJD’s Anubhav Mohanty following his election to the Lok Sabha last year and the terms of Narendra Kumar Swain, Sarojini Hembram (both BJD) and Ranjib Biswal of the Congress were due to end early next month.

Going by the membership strength of different parties in the Assembly, the BJD is placed in a comfortable position to win three seats. There may be a contest for the fourth seat if the BJP fields a candidate.

While the BJD has 113 members in the 147-member House, the BJP has 23, the Congress nine, the CPI(M) one and one is an Independent legislator.

The BJD may succeed in winning all four seats as the BJP does not have the number required to win a seat on its own. The Congress is unlikely to contest.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/88l48r/article31011305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ORISSA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/naveen-announces-rs-nominees-list-ends-speculation-over-pact-with-bjp/article31011175.ece
43,2020/03/07,Workplace safety still an issue: survey,"It says 36% of respondents from media houses say they have experienced sexual harassment

Over 70% of respondents who had approached an internal committee to report sexual harassment at the workplace were not completely satisfied with the outcome, said a survey report released on Saturday by the Network of Women in Media, India (NWMI) and Gender at Work.

The survey found that 36% of all respondents reported having experienced sexual harassment at the workplaces. Of the respondents who experienced such harassment at work, 53% did not report it to anyone. A small percentage made a report to the internal committee (IC) of their media houses. But 70% of those who made a complaint were not completely satisfied with the outcome, the report found.

Also read | Focus on safe workplaces

Among the women who said that their organisation did not have a mechanism to deal with sexual harassment, 47% had faced sexual harassment.

In the report titled ‘Creating safe workplaces: prevention and redressal of sexual harassment in media houses in India’, the two organisations found that in terms of the kinds of harassment experienced by the respondents, the most common were sexist comments, unwelcome sexual jokes, embarrassing gestures or body language, attempts to establish unwanted romantic and/or sexual relationships, and pestering for dates.

The promise of rewards for compliance, accompanied by threats of mistreatment following a refusal to engage in sexual behaviour, were also reported. In addition, unwanted touching, fondling, sexual assault and rape were documented.

The online survey conducted to assess whether and how effectively media houses across India responded found that a large percentage of respondents had never attended a training workshop on sexual harassment, as required by the law.

“The results of the survey underscore the need to step up awareness raising and other preventive measures to bring about a change in the work culture in media houses,” said Laxmi Murthy, one of the authors.

“While calling out sexual harassment in other spheres, as they should, the media industry must also look within and set its own house in order,” said Aayushi Aggarwal, another author.

The survey had 456 participants, including journalists, journalism educators, trainers and researchers. Most respondents were based in metropolitan centres such as Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Pune. More than 70% were full-time employees and about 11% were freelancers, the report stated.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lzzhtc/article31011135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/workplace-safety-still-an-issue-survey/article31011136.ece
44,2020/03/07,Madhya Pradesh govt. comes down on BJP MLAs accused of poaching bid,"Mines sealed, part of resort torn down; notice served on another for encroachment

Two days after the Madhya Pradesh government closed down two iron ore mines in Jabalpur district owned by the family of BJP MLA and baron Sanjay Pathak, accused by the Congress of attempting to topple its regime, the family got another shocker on Saturday as the Umaria district authorities tore down part of their resort encroaching the Bandhavgarh forest.

After another MLA was served a show-cause notice earlier for an alleged encroachment, the action, days after the Congress reportedly foiled a bid by the BJP to subvert its government by bribing MLAs to switch over, prompted Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava to submit a memorandum to the Governor on Saturday alleging vendetta and misuse of administrative machinery by the Congress to harass the party leaders and close down their businesses.

“The government is misusing the administrative machinery to shut businesses of MLAs, instilling fear among them by taking action and harassing their family members, as a result of which they are feeling unsafe. We request you to direct the government to stop working on ill-will,” he wrote in the memorandum.

Umaria Collector Swarochish Somavanshi told The Hindu the 2.001-hectare encroachment of the 17-hectare Syna Resort, the largest illegal occupier of forest land in the area, was razed as the firm didn’t heed eviction orders served upon it on February 12 under Section 248 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code.

Also read | ‘Rescued’ M.P. MLAs deny BJP coercion

“The order was served on 11 resorts and the drive began on Saturday with the removal of encroachments from two resorts,” he said. The resort is run by the Nirmal Chhaya Nature Resort, owned by the family of Mr. Pathak, named, among five other BJP leaders, by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh of attempting to indulge in ‘horsetrading’.

On Wednesday, the day the Congress leaders claim to have rescued six of the 10 MLAs of the Kamal Nath government from the BJP’s clutches at a hotel in Haryana, the Jabalpur administration sealed the mines, claiming they were being operated on forest land in violation of a Supreme Court order issued almost a year ago in May 2019. Sources within the Congress said Mr. Pathak, former BJP Minister, had provided logistical support, including chartered planes, to ferry the MLAs to New Delhi.

Though in June last year, Jabalpur Collector Bharat Yadav ordered the cessation of the mining activity, he stayed his own order in August to allow it to resume based on the “opinion” of the State Advocate General and a representation of Nirmala Minerals, the owner, which had contended the court order didn’t apply to its operational area, according to a press release.

Mr. Yadav told The Hindu, “The mines have been sealed as per procedure as it had been six months yet the firm couldn’t prove how the court order did not apply to it.”

Mr. Pathak, MLA from Vijayraghavgarh who alleged the removal of gunman by the government from his security cover was a conspiracy to get him killed, told reporters in Bhopal: “They closed our family’s business and snatched jobs of 1,200 workers, razed the resort and tried to kidnap me. I am not scared, will not bow my head down.”

The Congressman who’d switched to the BJP earlier, Mr. Pathak said he’d remain with the BJP until his last breath. “They are stuck on the false hope that I will return to the Congress, otherwise face their wrath. Instead of accusing me of horse trading, they must look within as their government, which doesn’t enjoy complete majority, is standing on the outside support of other parties’ MLAs bought over. There is infighting in the Congress and they’re intent on reducing our numbers by planning to get us killed,” he said.

In another instance of action against a BJP leader named by Mr. Digvijaya Singh, the Sagar district administration on Wednesday served a show-cause notice on Bhupendra Singh for encroaching upon revenue land with illegal agricultural fields. He had allegedly ferried BSP MLA Rambai Parihar, who backs the Congress government, to New Delhi.

Saying though the Congress had acted just within a couple of days to target him, he would abide by the rule of law, the MLA from Khurai said, “The land has been marked out; it’s our ancestral land. Without marking it out, how was it decided that it is encroached upon. Everybody knows why they are taking action.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jy6382/article31010886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08SANJAYPATHAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhya-pradesh-govt-comes-down-on-bjp-mlas-accused-of-poaching-bid/article31010887.ece

48,2020/03/07,Jaishankar to head for Sochi for talks with Chinese and Russian counterparts,"Afghanistan, collapse of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty top the agenda

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is set to visit Sochi later this month for talks with his Chinese and Russian counterparts Wang Yi and Sergey Lavrov, which could range from the situation in Afghanistan to the danger to international security posed by the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.

The three diplomats are expected to hold two-day parleys in the Russian resort city, from March 22 under the Russian India China (RIC) banner, highly placed sources told The Hindu.

“The trio is expected to brainstorm and seek convergence on a Eurasian perspective on global events,” the sources said.

The RIC has emerged as an important forum, which has been evolving in recent years among the three countries, which are also members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) — a grouping of emerging economies.

The leaders of the three countries have now met on two previous occasions — on the sidelines of G-20 summits — raising the forum’s profile. The RIC also provides an opening for regular meetings of the National Security Advisers in the trilateral format.

The sources pointed out that the meeting in Sochi would have an open-ended agenda, but three issues could stand out.

The trio is expected to exchange notes on Afghanistan, including last month’s deal in Doha, between the U.S. and the Taliban which details a timetable for the withdrawal of the American forces from the strife-torn nation, linked to Taliban’s commitment to deny sanctuaries to international terror groups such as the Islamic State and the al-Qaeda. It also calls for the start of an intra-Afghan dialogue, starting with a meeting on March 10 in Oslo.

Both Russia and China are strong advocates of a ‘regional’ solution of peace in Afghanistan, which, besides India, also includes Pakistan and the Central Asian Republics (CARS). Analysts say the Afghanistan Contact Group of the SCO, which has India, Pakistan, China, Russia and CARS as members, could be tapped as the prime opening for a strong Eurasia-led initiative on Afghanistan.

The sources said the RIC forum converges on an “Aghan-led and Afghan owned” solution of the conflict, but the devil is in the detail. China is fully engaging the Taliban and the Afghan government to end the civil war. “China will continue to be a supporter, mediator and facilitator of the Afghan peace and reconciliation process and play a constructive role on the basis of respecting the wishes of all parties in Afghanistan,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the signing of the Doha accord.

Unlike Beijing, Russia has been selectively engaging the Taliban, especially those who are ‘nationalistic’ and do not necessarily take their cue from Islamabad. India is yet to take a call on any future engagement with the Taliban or its factions, though the presence of the Indian envoy as observer in Doha could signal a rethink.

During the meeting in Sochi, the Chinese and the Russians are expected to raise questions about India’s vision of the Indo-Pacific, especially the future of the security-oriented Quad — the India, Japan, U.S. and Australia cluster. Diplomatic sources say Washington, Tokyo and Canberra want Australia’s inclusion in the Malabar naval exercises, scheduled later this year, with a formal announcement possibly being made during Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s proposed visit to New Delhi in May. But government sources say India has been non-committal and has, so far, been disinclined to accommodate the expansion of the annual exercise.

The three Ministers are also expected to discuss the likely proliferation of tactical nuclear weapons following the collapse of the INF treaty, which had, so far, helped contain the spread of nuclear tipped missiles between 500-5,500 km range. Both Beijing and Moscow apprehend that the U.S. could now deploy tactical nuclear weapons, even in non-nuclear weapon countries, triggering another round of nuclear arms race, which is likely to engulf India as well.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2a83wh/article31010738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TH-THGRP-SOCHIs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jaishankar-to-head-for-sochi-for-talks-with-chinese-and-russian-counterparts/article31010739.ece
49,2020/03/07,"Coronavirus, CAA put a pause on high-level visits","PM Modi’s visit to Dhaka on March 17 is under way despite concerns over security

Planning for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Dhaka on March 17 is under way without any changes, said officials, despite concerns over security after several Islamist groups threatened major protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Delhi violence.

On Friday, thousands of protesters, including those belonging to the influential Islamist coalitions “Hefazat e Islam” and “Jamiat Ulama e Islam”, demanded that the Bangladesh government cancel Mr. Modi’s visit for the centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman there this month. When asked, government sources said they have already confirmed Mr. Modi would be visiting Bangladesh and there is no rethink. However, it is understood that the security teams in both capitals are monitoring all the protests held there since February 28 closely, including one expected on March 12 where clerics have called for a nationwide “human chain”, and have even threatened to block PM Modi’s airport route if the visit goes ahead.

A Bangladeshi official told The Hindu that all arrangements would be in place for the visit, and that protests “by a few groups” would not derail it.

The PM’s visit to Bangladesh, which would be his first trip abroad in 2020, marks the latest of high-level visits to face hiccups over the CAA protests, the COVID-19 scare and other issues. The scare that began in China has caused cancellations of nearly all major multilateral conferences and bilateral visits globally.

For PM Modi, a visit to Brussels for the E.U.-India summit and to Cairo, both scheduled for next week, have been put off due to the spread of the virus. Officials said no other visits have been scheduled now until a trip to Moscow on May 10 to attend the Victory Day anniversary celebrations there.

The troubles have also cast a shadow over some incoming visits. Since December, Bangladesh has cancelled four Minister-level visits including that of the Foreign and Deputy Foreign Ministers, the Home Minister and the Parliament Speaker’s last week, ostensibly due to upset over the CAA, which names Bangladesh among the three countries from where persecuted minorities will be granted fast-track citizenship. Also in March, four other high-level incoming visits expected to be scheduled were put off including those of leaders from Bhutan, Kazakhstan and Chile. Officials said the postponements all took place due to “domestic issues” in their own countries but with the virus scare, it is unlikely they can be rescheduled in the near future. Another visit looked forward to in April was that of Australian PM Scott Morrison, who was unable to visit in January because of the bushfires crisis there.

The visit of Japan’s PM Shinzo Abe who had to cancel his visit to Delhi and Guwahati due to the anti-CAA violence in Assam in December, is also unlikely to happen in April, as officials had been planning. Ties between India and Japan were strained this week over Tokyo’s demarche to Delhi over the government’s decision to cancel visas for Japanese travellers because of the COVID-19 cases there.

“The demarche said the situation in Japan is totally different from that of other countries [India suspended all visas granted to the nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan on or before March 3], on parameters including per capita incidence of the virus, rate of increase in patients etc, and this should have been considered before the decision,” a diplomatic source said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eb0mi/article30453925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-MODIMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-caa-put-a-pause-on-high-level-visits/article31010485.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has contributed to more than half of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global target to give healthcare coverage by bringing 55 crore people under the Ayushman Bharat Scheme, BJP president J.P. Nadda said on Saturday.

Mr. Nadda, a former Union Health Minister, also said the government aims to open 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres across the country.

“The World Health Organization says it will bring 100 crore people under healthcare coverage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already given that to 55 crore people through the Ayushman Bharat Scheme,” he said.

The BJP chief said 55 crore people have been given health coverage of ₹5 lakh each under the scheme.

On the occasion, the Prime Minister interacted with some Jan Aushadhi Kendra owners and Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojna (PMBJP) beneficiaries through a video conferencing session, which was attended by Mr. Nadda at Krishna Nagar.

“In nearly 700 districts, through 6,700 Jan Aushadhi outlets, medicines worth around ₹2,200 crore were provided to people at a cost of just ₹390 crore, in 2019-20,” Mr. Nadda said

The Prime Minister has tried to help the common man with good quality and affordable medicines through these outlets, he said. In 472 districts, 825 dialysis centres have been opened through which 5.80 lakh people have benefited, the BJP president said, adding that poor people are being provided free dialysis through 4,920 machines throughout the country.

Mr. Nadda said around 20,000 health and wellness centres have already been opened and 25,000 more are to be opened this year. In 2014, when the BJP came to power at the Centre, only 100 medicines were in the national list of essential medicines whose prices are determined by the government, he said.

“This number has now been raised to 350 at present. A committee has also been set up so that such medicines that are important for many people are brought under the list,” Mr. Nadda said.

Union Minister Smriti Irani said on March 7 she was “enraged” that the death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape case were making a “mockery of justice” by their delaying tactics and asserted that urgent steps were required to stop it.

“We need to go a step forward, especially with regard to the conviction rates... what we saw in the Nirbhaya case and it is happening.

“The fact that rapists can throw caution to the winds, the fact that they can laugh in the face of justice is a fact that enrages me to no end,” she said inaugurating a national conference on women in police and Central Armed Police Forces, organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD).

The Union Women and Child Development Minister said urgent steps are needed to ensure that such “mockery of justice” does not take place anymore.

“Since the issue [Nirbhaya case] has not come to end, I will request the MHA that after the hanging of these convicts, all arms of the government need to sit down along with the judiciary to see to it that once evidence has been collected and once a decision has been made by courts, this mockery of justice does not happen,” Ms. Irani said.

A trial court in Delhi issued fresh warrants on Thursday with March 20, 5.30 a.m., as the date for the execution of the Nirbhaya case convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) — after a series of mercy petitions and pleas filed by them were rejected.

The execution of their death warrants has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting legal remedies. All the convicts in the case are to be hanged together.

At the conference, she urged the BPRD, a police think-tank under the Home Ministry, to help her Ministry in framing procedures to ensure that children of under-trial women are helped so that they do not suffer.

“These children have no role in the crime committed and I would like to offer the services of my Ministry to BPRD so that a joint effort in this context is undertaken as it is the need of the hour,” Ms. Irani said.

Similar steps need to be taken to improve the condition of under-trial women in jails, she said.

The Minister added that a “historic” step is being taken with regard to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, in conjunction with the BPRD, NIMHANS and NALSAR, as these organisations will soon go to each district of the country to engage with every stakeholder in this domain.

Ms. Irani said her Ministry has also sanctioned procurement of forensic kits, as requested by the BPRD, under the Nirbhaya fund.

She asked the police think-tank to help in framing of standard operating procedures for about 700 one-stop centres that act as the first point of contact for female victims across the country.

BPRD Director General V.S.K. Kaumudi said, “Individuals with criminal mindset misuse the cyber platform for targeting women through Internet.”

“Crime against women are often un-reported and even if they are reported they do not end up in conviction,” the BPRD chief said, adding that the conviction rate of women-centric cyber crimes in 2018 was only 15.6%.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/ci2sdc/article31010179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SMRITI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/enraged-at-nirbhaya-convicts-mocking-justice-system-need-to-stop-this-smriti-irani/article31010143.ece

It was not banking but buccaneering, Mr. Chidambaram said. “Did no one in the RBI and the government read the balance sheet of the bank at the end of every year? Why did nothing change after the CEO was replaced and a new CEO appointed in January 2019?”

He questioned the fact that the financial health of the bank didn’t improve even after a former Deputy Governor of the RBI was appointed to the Board of the bank in May 2019.

The alarm bells should have rung when the bank reported it’s first ever quarterly loss in the quarter Jan-March 2019.

“The Yes Bank fiasco is only part of the mismanagement of financial institutions under the watch of the BJP government,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

As per the resolution plan, the SBI has proposed to invest ₹2,450 crore to pick up a 49% stake in the restructured capital of the Bank at not less than ₹10 per share.

“This is bizarre, when the net worth of the Bank is perhaps zero,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

Saying the depositors’ interests should be completely protected, he said he believes the SBI didn’t volunteer to rescue the bank. “Just like LIC did, SBI is also doing a command performance.”

Reacting to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s comment that most of these loans were extended during the Congress-led UPA government’s tenure, Mr. Chidambaram said: “Sometimes when I listen to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman I feel that UPA is still in power and I am the Finance Minister while she is in Opposition.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/itamyq/article30730464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THTNCHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-rbi-didnt-bother-to-read-the-balance-sheet-of-yes-bank-says-chidambaram/article31009171.ece

55,2020/03/07,“I have seen God in you”: beneficiary of govt. medical scheme tells PM Modi,"The Dehradun resident was expressing how she had suffered due to high cost of medicines after she suffered from paralysis in 2011.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had an emotional moment on Saturday when a woman beneficiary of his government’s generic medicine programme told him that she had “seen God” in him.

Dehradun-resident Deepa Shah, who suffered paralysis in 2011, was interacting with the Prime Minister through video-conference on the occasion of Jan Aushadhi Diwas.

“I have not seen God, but I have seen God in you,” she said, tears rolling down her eyes. PM Modi looked visibly emotional as the woman repeated her remark.

She also thanked the Uttarakhand Chief Minister and others who had helped her all along and said doctors had once told her that she cannot be cured.

“But on hearing your voice I have become better,” she told Mr. Modi while profusely thanking the Prime Minister for his efforts to reduce the cost of medicines.

The Prime Minister paused for a moment before telling her that it was her courage that had won over her disease and that she must carry on with the spirit.

Ms. Shah was expressing her plight and how she had suffered due to high cost of medicines after she suffered from paralysis in 2011 and has now started saving ₹3,500 every month after benefitting from the government’s low-cost generic medicines programme.

Soon after Ms. Shah rose to express her views, PM Modi asked her to sit and speak as he said she was uncomfortable while standing.

“You have defeated disease with your own will power. Your courage is your God and that same courage has given you the strength to emerge from such a big crisis. You should carry on this confidence in you,” Mr. Modi told her.

He said some people still keep spreading rumours about generic medicines, going by their past experience, wondering how can medicines be available so cheap and that there must be something wrong with the medicine.

“But, by seeing you countrymen would gain confidence that there is nothing wrong in generic medicines. These medicines are not at all of inferior quality than any other medicine. These medicines have been certified by the best laboratories. These medicines are made in India and is ‘Make in India’ and are cheap,” the Prime Ministersaid.

He said there is demand for generic medicines from India across the world and the government has made it mandatory for doctors to prescribe generic medicines to patients, unless necessary.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iogff3/article30067660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRICS-SUMMITLEADERSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i-have-seen-god-in-you-beneficiary-of-govt-medical-scheme-tells-pm-modi/article31008515.ece

The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday questioned Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor for the second day in connection with the bank’s loans to the troubled Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL). Searches were also conducted at the residences of his three daughters.

The ED had questioned Mr. Kapoor till late in the night on Friday at his Worli residence over the bank’s association with DHFL.

“The need for further questioning was felt as there were a lot of unanswered questions and some new facts have also come to light, which need to be verified. We also need to corroborate out findings with documentary evidence, and hence accounts details of Mr. Kapoor, his wife and his daughters are being scrutinised,” an ED officer said.

Under the scanner

The bank first came under the scanner after it came to light that it had granted two loans collectively amounting to ₹3750 crore. One was given to DHFL and another to an entity called RKW developers, which was at the time headed by Kapil Wadhawan, a promotor of DHFL. Mr. Wadhawan was arrested by the ED in January this year.

Sources said some information has also come to light indicating that kickbacks amounting to around ₹600 crore were paid to Mr. Kapoor, and that this money was credited to the accounts of his family members. The money trail is now being further verified by the ED.

The ED has been investigating alleged large-scale financial malpractices by the DHFL and several other parties connected to it. In 2019, the ED had found that the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Board had invested ₹2361.20 crore from its employees’ provident fund with DHFL, and the money was lost when DHFL ran into troubled waters.

No country in the world says everybody is welcome, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Saturday, hitting out at those criticising India over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Mr. Jaishankar criticised the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for its criticism on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, saying its director had been wrong previously too and one should look at the U.N. body’s past record on handling the Kashmir issue.

“We have tried to reduce the number of stateless people through this legislation. That should be appreciated,” he said when asked about the CAA at a media event in New Delhi. “We have done it in a way that we do not create a bigger problem for ourselves.”

“Everybody, when they look at citizenship, have a context and has a criterion. Show me a country in the world which says everybody in the world is welcome. Nobody says that,” the Minister said.

The External Affairs Minister said moving out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was in the interest of India’s business.

Asked about the UNHRC director not agreeing with India on the Kashmir issue, Mr. Jaishankar said: “UNHRC director has been wrong before.

“UNHRC skirts around cross-border terrorism as if it has nothing to do with country next door.

Monuments, including Taj Mahal in Agra, would be free for all women visitors, domestic or foreign.

He added that apart from this “small tribute” from the Ministry, the ASI was also working to make its monuments safe and secure for women visitors.

“In our country, women are worshipped from much before the International Women’s Day was conceived. In our culture, women have the status of goddesses since ancient times. This is a great initiative,” Culture Minister Prahlad Patel said on Saturday.

Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy said the status of non-tribal people in the violence-hit hill State was similar to that of Kashmiri Pandits in 1991.

Three people were killed and several others injured in violence at Ichamati of East Khasi Hills on February 28 following a meeting the Khasi Students’ Union had convened to discuss Citizenship (Amendment) Act and Inner Line Permit, a temporary travel document needed for outsiders to visit four other states in the northeast.

“I saw the need to repeatedly talk to ministers and senior civil servants of the State. The non-tribals in the State were in a thoroughly demoralised state and I got the impression their position and status is something like that of the Kashmiri Pandits of 1991 when they had to leave the Kashmir Valley,” Mr. Roy told newspersons in Meghalaya capital Shillong on Friday.

“One fundamental thing is that we are Indian citizens, where we are Khasi, Garo, Bengali, Sardar and whatever and we are living in a part of India. There cannot be any discrimination other than what is provided in the law. The law provides for some kind of abridgement of the rights of citizens in the State like you (non-tribal) cannot buy land except in a small part of Shillong. Apart from what is forbidden by law, there should not be any discrimination and people should not be afraid of moving around like free citizens,” he said.

Mr. Roy said he made it clear to senior Ministers and civil servants that as the Governor of Meghalaya, he would not allow any citizen to suffer from any indignity or fear. He said he had instructed the authorities to work towards restoring normalcy and the morale of the non-tribal people.

There have been sporadic incidents of violence, including the stabbing of non-tribal people in Shillong since February 28. Night curfew continues to be imposed in parts of Shillong and other affected areas of East Khasi Hills district.

Two days ago, 260 labourers from Assam who had hid in jungles to escape violence were rescued and brought to Guwahati by the police of the two States.

Maharashtra Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking appointment of a party leader as a member of the Ram Temple Trust formed to oversee construction of the temple in Ayodhya.

Sarnaik, who represents Ovala-Majiwada assembly constituency in Thane, also invoked Sena founder late Bal Thackeray’s contribution in the campaigning for the construction of the temple.

Sarnaik made the demand ahead of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to the temple town on Saturday.

In the two-page letter, which Sarnaik said he had sent on Friday, the MLA also said that Sena president Uddhav Thackeray too had campaigned hard for the cause of the temple.

PM Modi on February 5 announced in the Lok Sabha the formation of the 15-member Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust to construct Ram temple in Ayodhya as directed by the Supreme Court in its landmark verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case in November last year.

Referring to that, Sarnaik alleged that the contribution made by the Sena for the cause was “conveniently forgotten” while making appointments of the trust members.

“As the temple is going to be constructed, the Central government should never forget the participation of thousands of Shiv Sainiks and that of the Thackeray family. Hence, requesting you to nominate a Ram devotee Shiv Sainik as a (temple) trustee,” Sarnaik stated.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/appoint-shiv-sena-member-on-ayodhya-temple-trust-mla-writes-to-pm-modi/article31007716.ece

The Centre on Saturday lifted the 48-hour ban imposed on Friday on two Malayalam news channels for reportage that could “enhance communal disharmony” across the country, sources said.

The ban on Asianet News was lifted at 1.30 am, while the ban on Media One was lifted at 9.30 am on Saturday, a source at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting told PTI.

Sources said the two channels had written to the ministry seeking revocation of the bans, following which it was lifted.

The channels were suspended for 48 hours over their coverage of last month’s communal violence in Delhi, with the official orders saying they covered events on February 25 in a manner that “highlighted the attack on places of worship and siding towards a particular community“.

“Channel’s reporting on Delhi violence seems to be biased as it is deliberately focusing on the vandalism of CAA supporters,” the ministry order on Media One had said. “It also questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction. Channel seems to be critical towards Delhi Police and RSS.”

The ministry ordered prohibition of transmission or re-transmission of Media One and Asianet News for 48 hours on any platform throughout India with effect from 7.30 pm on Friday to 7.30 pm on Sunday.

68,2020/03/07,Centre slaps 48-hour ban on two Malayalam news channels,"Action taken over their coverage of riots

The Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry headed by Prakash Javadekar has imposed a 48-hour ban on two Malayalam news channels — Asianet News and Media One — for their coverage of the Delhi riots, which, the Ministry in its orders said, could “enhance communal disharmony”.

Both channels went off air from 7.30 p.m. on Friday and will remain so till 7.30 p.m. on Sunday.

In a seven-page order, the I&B Ministry indicted Asianet for stating that “the Central government did not act to control the riots” and that “Central forces reached the riot-hit areas after long hours of the meeting of Union Minister Amit Shah.”

In the case of Media One, the Ministry has said: “The channel’s reporting on Delhi violence seems to be biased as it is deliberately focusing on the vandalism of CAA supporters. It also questions the RSS and alleges Delhi police inaction. The channel seems to be critical towards the Delhi police and the RSS.”

The Ministry has held both channels responsible for reportedly highlighting “the attack on places of worship and siding towards a particular community”.

Also Read Ban on channels invites criticism

The coverage of Delhi riots by both the channels as per the Ministry, was in contravention of Rule 6(1c) of the programme code prescribed under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, that provides that no programme should be carried in the cable service which contains attack on religions or communities or visuals or words contemptuous of religious groups or which promote communal attitudes.

The two channels have, the Ministry order says, also violated Rule 6 (1e) that provides that no programme should be carried in the cable service which is likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promote anti-national attitudes.

Reprimanding both the channels in two separate orders, the Ministry has said that ""utmost care and should have reported it in a balanced way. Such reporting could enhance the communal disharmony across the country when the situation is highly volatile.""

The Ministry also noted that repeated advisories have been issued directing the channels to follow the laid down rules.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sqr4tu/article31004582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IBJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-slaps-48-hour-ban-on-two-malayalam-news-channels/article31004531.ece
69,2020/03/07,Local body polls: testing time for police in Chintoor division,"Area considered to be a strategic location for Maoists groups to escape into Telangana, Odisha and Chhattisgarh

The Chintoor division became a gateway for the banned Maoist groups for the procurement of logistics and ammunition apart from serving as a safe route to escape into three States — Telangana, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.

The Left-Wing Extremist activities reported since the inclusion of the seven mandals with 211 revenue villages of Khammam district in Telangana into East Godavari district continue to pose a major challenge to the police to conduct the local body elections 2020 in a peaceful manner.

Chintoor, said to be the gateway for the members of the banned left-wing extremist groups to gain entry into Andhra Pradesh from Telangana, Chattisgarh, and Odisha, gained momentum as a strategic location for the Maoists in recent years.

In November 2019, the East Godavari police seized 358 gelatin sticks in the Rampa Agency, in which six militia members surrendered before the police in early 2019. In mid-2018, a 24-year-old Maoist Mulchuka Lakshmaiah, a native of Sukma in Chhattisgarh, was nabbed by the East Godavari police in the Chintoor area.

Lakshmaiah’s presence in the Rampa Agency speaks how the tri-State border serves as the emergency escape route for Maoists from the police through any State border. He was allegedly wanted in the 20 extremist activities registered under the Chintoor division.

In 2019, three Gutti Koya tribals — Bodike Bheemaiah, 33, Guttupalli Suresh, 26, and Punem Ramesh, 30, —were arrested while supplying gelatin sticks and 39 electric detonators in the Chintoor sub-division.

The troupe of 40 police personnel had a miraculous escape from the landmine blast executed by the Maoists in Kaligonda forest in the Rampa Agency in early 2017.

On Saturday, East Godavari Superintendent of Police Adnan Nayeem Asmi said; “We have problematic villages due to the left-wing extremist groups. We are preparing to estimate how much security force is required to be deployed in our Agency to conduct the local body elections peacefully in the conflict area.”

Mr. Nayeem has added that the list of problematic villages will soon be finalised, enabling the State government to depute the additional forces (mostly paramilitary forces).

Speaking to The Hindu, Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA-Rampachodavam) Project Officer Nishant Kumar said; “There are 120 panchayats in the ITDA jurisdiction.” Majority of incidents with Maoists were reported under these panchayats.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/local-body-polls-testing-time-for-police-in-chintoor-division/article31011549.ece

71,2020/03/07,"Will sweep local body elections, says Dadi Veerabhadra Rao","YSRCP leader blames Chandrababu Naidu for stalling implementation of enhanced quota for Backward Castes

YSR Congress Party general secretary Dadi Veerabhadra Rao on Saturday asserted that the ruling party would sweep the forthcoming local body elections by winning 90% of the seats.

Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Rao alleged that Telugu Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu was responsible for stalling the implementation of enhanced quota for Backward Castes (BCs) from 27% to 34% in the local body polls.

“The BCs will not forgive Naidu for approaching the High Court and later the Supreme Court through his protege Pratap Reddy to stall the implementation of enhanced quota,” Mr. Rao said.

The YSRCP leader claimed that Mr. Naidu was now trying to project himself as a champion of the downtrodden, but as Chief Minister had done little to enhance the quota for BCs/SCs/STs in local body elections.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has fulfilled all the commitments made by him in his election manifesto and during the padayatra, notwithstanding financial constraints,” Mr. Rao said.

CAT order

Hailing the Central Administrative Tribunal’s order justifying the suspension of IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao for disclosing defence secrets through his son’s firm, he said that the government has been asked to file a chargesheet in this matter by April 7.

“The State Government is committed to giving house sites to 30 lakh poor people and enable them to construct houses within the next four years. In recognition of the good governance of Mr. Jagan, the YSRCP will win local body elections with a thumping margin,” Mr. Rao said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/will-sweep-local-body-elections-says-dadi-veerabhadra-rao/article31011457.ece

CBI officials said that Venu Gopal Naidu, while working as Sub Post Master at Kotturu between September 1, 2018 and August 27, 2019, received cash remittances from the branch post offices under his jurisdiction.

73,2020/03/07,Postponement of SSC exams draws flak,"We lose the momentum due to gap, rues a student

“Once we start preparing for examinations with a particular date in mind, getting an extended period only de-motivates us and we lose the momentum gained so far,” rues Arpita G, reacting to postponement of the SSC (class 10) examinations.

The State Board of Secondary Education has pushed back the dates to facilitate smooth conduct of the local body elections scheduled to be conducted in three phases from March 21 to March 29.

The students will now have to wait for the elections to pass before they take their tests. “Deferring of the examinations can never be a boon to students who are into serious preparation and scrupulously follow a time-table,” says T. Mohan Rao, a 10th class student from Gowtham English Medium School.

Akshay Jain from Kurapati Chandrasekhar Rao English Medium School at One Town is upset for a different reason. “There are a couple of weddings back home in Rajasthan and I so wanted to attend them. Postponement of the examinations will disturb our travel plans,” he laments.

Teachers are also a worried lot. “There will be no classes before the examinations as the teachers will be on election duties. They will first undergo training followed by election duty and then counting of votes. This gap will dilute the students’ exam preparedness,” admits P. Babu Reddy, State general secretary of United Teachers’ Federation (UTF).

Training for teachers

The State government’s ambitious plan to introduce English as a medium of instruction in schools from the next academic year necessitated teachers to undergo training in the integrated communication skill programme, imparted by the agency of Cambridge University faculty roped in by the State. Over 6,000 municipal teachers from across the 13 districts were off their classroom teaching to attend training. This was followed by another orientation programme. “There are fears of a dip in the 10th class results this year for many such reasons. Now the decision to postpone exams will do no good to students who are eager to be done away with them and slip into a relaxation mode,” says S. Ramakrishna, State president of Municipal Teachers’ Federation (MTF).

He says the government should consider exempting 10th class teachers from election duties.

“Politics have taken precedence over education and this is not a good sign,” said a parent of a 10th class student, dismayed by the decision.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/postponement-of-ssc-exams-draws-flak/article31011223.ece
74,2020/03/07,Chittoor stepping on the gas,"Car sales jump by 50% in the district on the back of steep discounts being offered on BS-IV models

Car sales have registered a jump in Chittoor district, with hundreds of buyers lapping up steep discounts being offered by dealerships on BS-IV models in their inventory.

Close to 70 dealerships in the district are now looking forward to a smooth transition to the new BS-VI norms as they are positive of selling their BS-IV stock before April 1, on which day the BS-VI norms will come into force.

Chittoor district has several outlets of major car manufacturers at Tirupati, Chittoor and Madanapalle, with an average monthly sale of around 600 cars/SUVs apart from a large number of tractors and cargo vehicles. The large number of sales are due to the customers’ business interests in Bengaluru, Chennai and elsewhere in the southern States.

The shift from the BS-IV to BS-VI norms is part of the Centre’s initiative to weed out polluting vehicles on Indian roads and bring down harmful emissions that pollute the atmosphere.

A Maruti Suzuki dealership at Tirupati has sold 42 cars with BS-IV norms in just three days between March 3 and 5, thanks to attractive discounts. The dealership’s general manager G.K. Chowdary said, ""The sales on these three days is a record of sorts for our showroom. In fact, customers are queueing up to avail discounts ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.25 lakh. We are offering them hassle-free registration too,"" he said.

""Though the government’s objective is to go eco-friendly, the future of BS-VI norms looks hazy and the prospects of CNG fuel look bright. Our company has a clear-cut policy of not coming out with BS-VI diesel vehicles unless the required oil market expands accordingly. The customers are convinced that they will be safe with BS-IV petrol vehicles for the next 10 to 15 years,"" he said.

A.V. Eeshwar Reddy, former general manager (Honda) at Tirupati, said that though the BS-VI vehicles are set for registrations from April 1 as per new guidelines, there is no facility for Euro-VI diesel pumps, except in Hyderabad and Noida. ""This forced customers to stick to BS-IV petrol vehicles. Though there is a provision for some upcoming BS-VI vehicles to use Euro-IV diesel, the lifespan would come down from 2 lakh km to just 20,000 km. Who would risk this?"" Mr Reddy said.

A couple of dealers observed that both BS-IV and BS-VI norms would be vanishing in the near future thanks to the eventual CNG revolution that is on the cards.

Deputy Transport Commissioner (Chittoor) Basi Reddy told The Hindu that the furore over the registration deadline for BS-IV vehicles has arisen out of ignorance of the reality. ""There are absolutely no hassles for registration. The registration process is a normal process. Customers do not have to worry at all. The car dealers themselves would finish the registration for them. Post the announcement of the BS-VI norms, we have not heard any complaints over the matter,"" he said.

The DTC, however, warned that ""those who possess the unregistered BS-IV vehicles from April 1 onwards should know that they are possessing just dead vehicles. We have very strict guidelines issued by the Supreme Court to take the violators to task.""",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chittoor-stepping-on-the-gas/article31010386.ece
75,2020/03/07,HPCL gearing up to meet new standards,"Most of the petrol pumps in Visakhapatnam are already supplying BS-VI-compliant fuel

With the deadline fast nearing, HPCL Visakh Refinery is gearing up to meet the deadline for supply of Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) compliant fuels as per the emission standards fixed by the European Union.

Hectic preparations are under way by the oil companies to make use of BS-VI-compliant fuels by April 1. Already, most of the fuel pumps in Visakhapatnam are selling fuel that meets EU-prescribed standards. Visakh Refinery plays a key role in meeting fuel requirement of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. Whenever required, it also sends fuel by tanker ships to Chennai, Kochi, Mangalore and other ports for use by other oil companies as part of an arrangement whenever such a need arises. It also supplies through pipelines to various destinations in South India.

""We are confident of making it 100% the supply of BS-VI-compliant fuels by April 1,"" HPCL Visakha retail regional head Ravi Shankar Pammi said. He said they had always accorded top priority to supply of clean fuel and meeting the emission standards.

To meet the increasing demand for supply, HPCL is implementing its Visakh Refinery Modernisation Project on a fast-track mode with an investment of ₹20,928 crore. The Project Management Consultancy was awarded to Engineers India Ltd over three years ago, and is scheduled to be completed by July this year.

The project will expand the present capacity of the refinery from 8.33 million tonne per annum to 15 mtpa. The brownfield project will also have revamp and capacity expansion of existing units, augmentation of utilities systems, integrated effluent treatment system, captive power and associated facilities.

As part of the project, the refinery will have a 9 mtpa Crude Distilation Unit replacing one among three CDUs, a 3.3 mtpa vacuum gas oil hydrocracker unit and a 2.9 mtpa naphtha isomerisation unit.

Larsen and Toubro has completed and flagged off to HPCL an 1,885-tonne hydrocracker reactor considered to be the country’s heaviest for VRMP.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hpcl-gearing-up-to-meet-new-standards/article31010384.ece
76,2020/03/07,End of the road for BS-IV vehicles,"Manufacturers and dealers are offering attractive discounts to clear their inventory before new emission norms kick in

Those in the market for a new car or a motorcycle need to act fast if they want to buy a vehicle with Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) emission norms, as the deadline for registration of such vehicles is March 31, 2020.

Post that date, BS-IV vehicles will no longer be registered and will have to be sold as scrap, say officials. The Supreme Court has ordered that no new motor vehicles with BS-IV emission norms can be sold after March 31, 2020. However, vehicles which have already been bought and registered can be driven till their expiry, which is 15 years from the date of purchase.

Buyers beware

""The onus of registering new BS-IV vehicles before the deadline is on the buyer. Those planning to buy BS-IV vehicles should go for registration at least three/four days before the deadline as last-minute failure of registration due to technical hurdles cannot be an excuse. Such vehicles would have to be sold as scrap. Those applying for fancy registration numbers should do so much ahead of the deadline,"" said another official requesting anonymity.

Buyers of new vehicles have to ensure that the vehicles are marked BS-VI and not BS-IV. Some motorists are under the impression that the emission norms are only for cars as the relevant marking is generally seen on cars but not visible on two-wheelers. The emission specifications will be given in Form 22 and invoice of the vehicle. Buyers have to confirm the specifications in Form 22 and not by the stickers fixed on the vehicles, officials said.

While some automobile dealers do not seem to be worried as they are confident of exhausting the BS-IV inventory before the deadline, there are others who may be left with unsold vehicles. ""We are giving hefty discounts to clear our inventory, which our customers are also making use of. It is a win-win situation. Technological upgradation is important for protection of the environment and safeguarding the lives of the public at large,"" said Yellapu Raghuram, proprietor of Jupiter Honda, an authorised dealer of Honda two-wheelers.

There are around 20 two-wheeler dealerships, a dozen car retailers, three truck dealerships, three autorickshaw retailers and light commercial vehicle dealers in the city.

Rising awareness

""We have already launched BS-VI cars. Awareness among customers has also increased on the need to protect the environment. The oil companies are already selling BS-VI fuels. BS-VI fuel can be used in BS-IV vehicles, but not vice-versa,"" said Abbas Khan, general manager of Varun Maruti in the city.

The major difference between the BS-IV and BS-VI vehicles is the presence of sulphur quantity in the fuel. It is estimated that air pollution will drop to a great extent with BS-VI norms, said a car dealer.

It may be recalled that the sale and registration of new BS-III vehicles was ordered to be stopped as BS-IV norms were implemented with effect from April 1, 2017. Huge inventories were left unsold with the dealers at that time, even after manufacturers and dealers offering huge discounts to clear their BS-III inventory.

While most of the unsold vehicles were sold as scrap by the dealers, a large number of the vehicles were procured by unscrupulous travel operators at throwaway prices, taken to Nagaland and registered there by allegedly manipulating the date of purchase. The vehicles were brought back to Andhra Pradesh and re-registered.

An unidentified youth, claiming that he was a village volunteer, had drugged an elderly couple at their residence and decamped with gold ornaments at Thattivaripalle village of Kurabalakota mandal in the district on Friday, which came to light on Saturday.

According to information, a stranger approached the elderly couple – Achhamma and Venugopal (in their 60s) – at their residence late on Friday evening. He had reportedly informed the couple that their fingerprints were urgently needed and to be updated in the village records, failing which they would lose the government benefits, if any.

After collecting their fingerprints on a white paper, the stranger had told them that the imprints were not clear. He had reportedly applied a liquid to their fingers and sought them to drink a juice-like substance, claiming that it would help in getting clear fingerprints.

After the couple fell unconscious, the stranger had reportedly relieved the woman and her husband of the gold ornaments, followed by a frantic search of the house for valuables, before disappearing from the spot, locking the door from outside.

An hour later, the couple’s daughter-in-law, Sasikala, returned home after collecting fodder for the cattle. Finding the house locked but seeing the couple on ground inside, the woman got panicky and alerted the neighborhood.

The unconscious couple were rushed to the Government Area Hospital at Madanapalle, and were declared safe. Back to senses around midnight, the couple narrated the sequence as to how they were subjected to fraud.

Businesspersons who have an account in crisis-ridden private Yes Bank rue their fate as they are unable to carry out regular financial transactions in the wake of the Reserve Bank of India placing it under moratorium from March 5.

“We opened accounts in the new-age private bank as the services offered by the staff are far better than other banks,” said a group of clueless customers standing outside the Yes Bank branch on the busy Kurnool road here as the RBI capped withdrawals to ₹50,000 till April 3. “'I am not in a position to meet my commitment to my counterpart in Mumbai,” said a cloth merchant Srinivasa Rao from the Bapuji market complex. “How is it possible to wait for a month without doing any business,” added another businessman Venkateswara Rao, who sources marble slabs from Rajasthan. They were unable to carry out even online transactions, they complained.

82,2020/03/07,Govt. goes the whole hog to tackle coronavirus in State,"There are no ‘positive’ cases so far; ₹60 crore to be spent on special wards

The government has decided to spend ₹60 crore on maintenance of special wards in Vijayawada and Anantapur to treat coronavirus patients.

The government has also decided to earmark ₹200 crore to meet exigencies, if any.

These apart, a call centre will be set up to disseminate information on the COVID-19 suspected cases. There are no ‘positive’ cases so far in the State.

At a review meeting on the issue on Friday, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials not to create panic among the people on coronavirus.

“Instead, create awareness among them. Provide necessary medical care if there are any suspected cases. Involve the village secretariats in the prevention of coronavirus. Information on do’s and don’ts should be shared with the village / ward secretariats,” the Chief Minister said.

Meanwhile, the government has asked the super-speciality hospitals in Vijayawada and Anantapur to handle the coronavirus cases. Ambulances have been kept ready to shift persons suspected to have contracted the disease to the hospitals. The ambulances will be sterilised once the patient is dropped at the hospital.

As part of efforts to meet any eventuality, 351 beds have been kept ready. This apart, 47 ventilators, 12,444 personal protective equipment and 1.10 lakh masks have been acquired.

Orders have been placed to acquire 12,000 personal protective equipment and 50,000 masks. Isolation wards are being arranged.

All those returning from abroad are being asked to be under observation for 14 days.

At least 6,927 persons who arrived from foreign destinations were screened at the Visakhapatnam airport till March 5. Similarly, 60 persons were screened at the Gannavaram airport. On the same lines, 790 persons who arrived by ship at the Visakhapatnam port and 469 at the Krishnapatnam port were also screened.

It is found that 20 out of the 24 suspected cases have tested ‘negative’ for coronavirus. Details of the remaining four are awaited.

The virus can be prevented by maintaining personal hygiene. It has been found that only 5% of the ‘positive’ cases turn critical, more so when a person is already suffering from some other ailment. “Doctors are being trained to handle the screening tests,” the officials said.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister (Medical and Health) Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said there was no ‘positive’ case in the State and people need not panic.

“Every hospital is equipped with isolation wards, medicines, and equipment. Raids have been conducted on medical shops for selling masks at a higher price. Cases have been registered against a couple of medical shops in the State,” he said.

“A five-member team is in New Delhi to attend a special training session being organised by the Central government. Members of the team will, in turn, conduct State-level training session on March 9,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/u9d0ih/article31005000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VJPG4-COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-goes-the-whole-hog-to-tackle-coronavirus-in-state/article31005001.ece
83,2020/03/07,4 students in trouble for mischievous COVID-19 post,"College suspends them, to file police complaint

Four students of a private college in Kadapa allegedly spread scare among the public through a fake social media post. The college promptly announced their suspension and decided to file a nuisance case against them with the police.

The students, in the second and third year engineering at a private college in the city, reportedly made a post similar to a television footage grab containing the words ‘Breaking News: Corona virus scare in Kadapa’, in a bid to spread panic and threaten fellow students.

Taking a serious note of the mischief, the principal suspended them from the college and hostel and said that a complaint would be filed against them at the Chennur police station in Kadapa.

However, the parents of the four students were learnt to have pleaded with the college authorities not to make it a big issue and leave the students with a warning.

The Chennur police were waiting for the principal to file a complaint, when reports last came in.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4-students-in-trouble-for-mischievous-covid-19-post/article31004958.ece

At a press conference here on Friday evening after holding a district-level meeting with party workers and MLAs to strategise on how and whom to allocate party tickets, Mr. Satyanarayana blamed the TDP for coming in way of providing higher percentage of seats to BCs based on their population.

“We will give tickets to BCs, SCs, and STs as per our party president’s wish to empower the backward classes and had already implemented in nominated posts,” said the district in-charge Minister.

Liquor curbs

The government might even think of completely stalling the sale of liquor during the period from notification of elections to announcement of results as it is now controlled by a government agency, Mr. Satyanarayana said when asked why the government cannot take such a step instead of criminalising liquor distribution. The distribution of money would also be looked into very keenly and the government would take action irrespective of who resorts to such practicess, he said.

87,2020/03/07,Govt. gears up to distribute house sites pattas on Ugadi,"Jagan lays emphasis on quality in construction of houses

The State government has geared itself up to distribute 26.6 lakh house site pattas to the poor on Ugadi, the Telugu new year.

The government has set for itself a target of providing housing for all by 2024. As many as 14,097 YSR Jaganna housing colonies will be constructed in the State as part of the programme.

Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who reviewed the housing programme on Friday, said houses should be constructed for those who already own a house site. Houses should be constructed even for those who would be given pattas, he added.

“Maintain construction quality, provide proper drainage system, water facility and electricity in the colonies and plant saplings. Ensure that banks give a loan of ₹25,000 at 25 paise interest rate to each beneficiary. The remaining amount will be borne by the government. The loan will be helpful to the beneficiaries to meet exigencies,” he said.

The officials said that a plan of action was ready for the construction of over 19.3 lakh houses to the beneficiaries identified in towns and municipalities.

88,2020/03/07,BJP leaders seek Sanchaita’s suspension from party,"‘She committed a grave impropriety by accepting temple, MANSAS Trust positions’

Finding fault with manner in which GOs were issued and the procedure followed in the appointment of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as Simhachalam Devasthanam Trust Board and MANSAS Trust chairperson, BJP leaders on Friday said the party would resist any move to annexe endowment land.

MLC P.V.N. Madhav said the BJP had nothing to do with her appointment and had written to the central leadership to suspend Ms. Gajapathi Raju, BJYM national executive member and spokesperson in New Delhi, for being supportive of the YSRCP government while the party was in the opposition in Andhra Pradesh.

A GO was first issued forming the trust board and on February 29 hereditary trustee P. Ashok Gajspathi Raju was invited as Chairman for the trust board swearing in. Another GO was issued on March 3 appointing Ms. Gajapathi Raju and the other GOs with regard to the MANSAS Trust, Mr. Madhav said. The subsequent GOs were issued at midnight and were not uploaded on the Endowments Department website, he pointed out. The secretive manner raised doubts about the motives, particularly with regard to the thousands of acres of land under the temple and MANSAS Trust and smacked of a conspiracy, he said at a press conference here.

Land issue

The State Government that had taken up land-pooling for its housing programme asked the authorities to identify endowment land. The Simhachalam devasthanam had around 10,000 acres mostly donated by devotees over several generations and the Padmanabha Swamy temple another 2000 acres besides land under other temples. Its decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital and searching for land roused suspicion, the MLC said.

The trust had 14,500 acres in four districts supporting 13 educational institutions. He aid the government eyed the land under the devasthanam and the MANSAS Trust and BJP would oppose any move to use temple land for other purposes other than those specified, he asserted.

Alleging that the traditions followed in the temple and the trust were turned into an ugly political game, former Floor Leader of BJP in the Assembly P. Vishnu Kumar Raju said if Ms. Gajapathi Raju had taken the decision (to accept the position) for the carrot of power, she should reconsider it on moral grounds.

89,2020/03/07,Aquaculturists in jitters over coronavirus impact on shrimp exports,"There has been a fall in the market price of the produce in the last couple of weeks

D. Gopinath, an aquaculturist at Tangutur in Prakasam district, had raised Vannamei shrimp, hoping to get some decent returns as the market price for the export-oriented produce ruled steady in the market till recently.

But he is unsure whether the price of ₹500 per kg for a count of 30 and ₹380 per kg for a count of 40 will continue in the month of May when the harvest peaks.

The reason is that there has been a fall of up to ₹50 per kg in the last couple of weeks following the outbreak of coronavirus in China, before recovering slightly after resumption in the movement of containers to the eastern neighbour.

“I am very much worried about how the market condition will be when the harvest of shrimp picks up in a couple of month,” he said while taking stock of the situation arising out of the coronavirus outbreak, which, after originating in China, had spread to other parts of the world, infecting a large number of people.

It is estimated that economic growth will stagnate in the key shrimp consuming countries, which included China, the U.S., Japan and European countries, affecting consumption of seafood as well.

“In view of the uncertainty, we have decided to scale down the operations by 20 to 30% of the normal acreage this year,” a group of aquaculturists in the Kothapatnam area said.

“We are hoping against hope that the health situation in the shrimp consuming countries improves soon,” they said.

Cause for worry

Enterocytozoon Hepatopenaei (EHP) and White Feces Disease (WFD) were adding to their woes, said another aquaculturist K. Mallikarjun Rao, who adopted new culture technologies, including use of probiotics, to ward off diseases in his farm.

According to an estimate, the State, on an average, produces 5 lakh tonnes of shrimp. While 60% of it is exported to the U.S., China accounts for 20% and other countries the remaining.

“Aquaculturists need not be too much worried on the future demand as seafood is not in the list of banned items in China,” said Avanti Feeds Limited general manager (Technical & Marketing) S. Mohanty.

Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Aquaculturists’ Association State general secretary A. Kondal Rayudu underscored the need for creating demand for shrimp within the country. Cold chain infrastructure should be created to improve the shelflife of the produce, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aquaculturists-in-jitters-over-coronavirus-impact-on-shrimp-exports/article31004872.ece

Shortage of masks

“We seek the intervention of Chief Minister Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy to find a permanent solution to our long-pending grievance, which is making way for fish landing at the Visakhapatnam harbour. Denial of landing at the Visakhapatnam habour will make fishing more expensive, forcing us to spend more on fuel and other maintenance for fishing,” Mr. Rao said.

When contacted, East Godavari district Joint Director (Fisheries) P. Jaya Rao told The Hindu: “The issue of using the Visakhapatnam harbour for the fish landing by the mechanised boat operators from our district is yet to be settled. This issue has been taken to the notice of Fisheries Minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana”.

The Visakhapatnam boat operators continue to deny the entry of their counterparts from East Godavari to use the Visakhapatnam fishing harbour, reportedly on the grounds of hike in the cost of ice and dip in the prices of tuna fish.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/itczx4/article31004733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-VJ-TUNAFISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kakinada-boat-operators-seek-fish-landing-at-vizag-harbour/article31004734.ece

The heritage of Rayalaseema is all set to be showcased in a grand manner during the two-day Lepakshi Vaibhavam festivities to be held in Lepakshi and Hindupur on Saturday and Sunday.

The entire route from the Kodikonda checkpost on NH-44 (Hyderabad-Bengaluru highway) to Hindupur Town has been decked up with most of the public buildings and temples getting a new coat of whitewash and festoons tied at many places.

The festival aims at providing visitors an experience of rural life in the southern region of Andhra Pradesh.

Carnival of local arts

A wide range of art forms will be showcased at the festival. Karra-Samu, Tappeta Gullu, Chakka Bhajana and Guruvaiahlu are some of the art forms that will be presented to audiences. Over 10,000 artistes and students will take part in a Shobha Yatra from the world-famous Lepakshi Nandi temple to the venue of the main function on Saturday.

The carnival will begin at 4 p.m. on Saturday with over one lakh people expected to be in attendance for the inaugural session.

On both days, people can take a ride on bullock carts from Kodikonda checkpost to the festival venue, said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu while flagging off a bicycle rally at Lepakshi to popularise the event and generate interest among schoolchildren. A 5-K Run was also organised in Hindupur town by schoolchildren.

Sandhya Murthy and her troupe will perform a folk dance, while Sravana Bhargavi and Hemachandra along with other popular singers will perform at a live concert in the evening. Village sports would be organised throughout the day.

A ‘proto village’ has been set up close to the main venue, where the visitors can experience the daily activities that go on in the villages of Anantapur district.

COVID-19 threat

Though the fear of COVID-19 looms large in people’s minds, there are no suspected cases in the district and people are expected to attend the event in large numbers, officials said.

“The district administration has taken sufficient care to supply masks and establish healthcare kiosks at all possible locations keeping in view the mass gathering. The District Medical and Health Officer and his team would also spread awareness on preventive measures to be taken by people to minimise the risk of contracting COVID-19,” officials said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jrbz8c/article31004705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-VJ-LEPAKSHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lepakshi-vaibhavam-to-showcase-seema-culture/article31004706.ece
99,2020/03/07,‘Govt. committed to raising potential of MSMEs’,"Performance-linked incentives a step in that direction, says official

Director of Industries, Commerce and Export Promotion J.V.N. Subramanyam said there were about 1,00,000 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the State and they account for a substantial chunk (₹50,000 crore) of the gross value added by the manufacturing sector (₹85,000 crore) to GSDP but only a negligible number of them were upgrading due to various factors.

A big drawback of the MSMEs was their inability to cater to the export markets despite having the potential. Keeping these things in view, the State government has decided to give performance-based incentives to MSMEs to enable them to grow and it gave importance for export promotion in the upcoming Industrial Policy - 2020-25, he said.

Participating as the chief guest in the inaugural function of a three-day MSME Mega Expo-2020 jointly organised by Federation of Andhra Pradesh Small and Medium Industries’ Association (FAPSIA) and National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) here on Friday, Mr. Subramanyam said the government was taking necessary steps to reduce the initial cost of capital of industries and exhorted the stressed MSMEs to avail the One-Time Restructuring (OTR) of loans under the YSR Navodayam scheme.

He said the Reserve Bank of India has permitted the extension of OTR of loans beyond March 31, 2020, and called upon the banks to encourage viable projects.

‘Focus on branding’

The total exports from the State were worth about ₹98,000 crore whereas the true potential was far higher. This was because MSMEs which constitute the backbone of the economy did not have confidence ,while productivity and quality issues marred their prospects. The MSMEs need to gear up and pay attention to branding.

Mr. Subramanyam said to provide qualified manpower to industries, the State government was setting up a skills university at Visakhapatnam and robotics and artificial intelligence university in Tirupati in addition to sector-specific development centres in each one of the 25pParliamentary constituencies.

Union Bank of India deputy general manager V. Ramesh spoke about certain anomalies in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which were adversely affecting the MSMEs and advised them to be disciplined in the deployment of working capital.

These laboratories will start functioning shortly in Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute, Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences, and Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences.

That apart, the ICMR has also identified sample collection centres in Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Science in Ballari and Kalaburgi Institute of Medical Sciences.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), said the new laboratories would help ease the load on the two designated laboratories in Bengaluru. Currently, the virology laboratory in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute and the NIV branch in Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases are doing COVID-19 tests in Karnataka.

Meanwhile, two new cases were reported in Ballari and Bagalkot on Saturday. With this, a total of nine persons are admitted in isolation wards in designated hospitals in the State. Of the eight admitted on Friday, one has been discharged.

101,2020/03/07,COVID-19 scare: Many schools announce early summer vacation,"Many schools in Bengaluru have announced early summer vacation for their students this academic year as a precautionary measure amid COVID-19 scare.

B. Gayatri Devi, principal of Little Flower Public School, said the summer vacation was supposed to begin from March 20, but now the students of kindergarten and classes one to four would have vacation from March 11. “Students of these classes do not have any examination, so we can advance the summer holidays,” she said.

A parent of a student in a north Bengaluru school said, “The school management has said the summer vacation will commence from Thursday. We did not anticipate this and now will have to make alternative arrangements for our child’s stay as we are both working parents. At some level, we feel that managements are going overboard by making these decisions.”

Many schools took this decision following requests from parents. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said many of their member-schools had sought advice and they have been told that they can declare early summer holidays for the pre-primary classes.

102,2020/03/07,HC upholds levy of ₹2.1 crore back billing charge on MAHE for ‘unauthorised use of electricity’,"The High Court of Karnataka has upheld the back billing charge of around ₹2.1 crore levied on Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), a deemed to be university, and its allied institutes for the “unauthorised use of electricity” between 2006 and 2013 contrary to the norms of the Mangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (Mescom).

Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while dismissing the petitions filed by MAHE, TMA Pai Hospital and Research Centre/Kasturba Medical College and Hospital, Manipal College of Dental Sciences, and Manipal School, all located at Attavar locality in Mangaluru.

Undertaking

Mescom had stated that the petitioners had secured enhanced high-tension power supply in 2005–06 by giving an undertaking that the power supply would not be extended to the new dental college building and that the enhanced power supply was required for the existing building without addition to plinth. However, on inspection during 2013, it was found that the petitioners unilaterally carried the power supply through their own cables to the other buildings without permission from Mescom.

The petitioners claimed that extension of power supply to the new building does not require permission as all the buildings are on the same “premises”.

Not accepted

The court, however, declined to accept the claim while holding that power supply was “purpose and building specific” and it was not a wholesale supply to the “premises” as such and to all structures erected on the “premises”. Also, the court said that action of the petitioners in extending power supply to new buildings was contrary to their undertaking.

On the petitioner’s claim that there was absolutely no material to show that power was unauthorisedly used from August 2006 to December 2013, the Bench said nothing prohibited the petitioners, during the two opportunity of hearings given to them, from producing materials on when the new structures, in respect of which unauthorised use of power is alleged, were built.

‘No benefit of doubt’

“... the petitioners are not persons from rural areas, depressed classes or otherwise disabled; they are a reputed ‘deemed to be university’ and the famous institutions run by it; several law reports bear testimony to this; therefore, they cannot seek refuge under the leaking umbrella of benefit of doubt,” the court observed.

Meanwhile, the court directed Mescom not to discontinue existing power supply if the petitioners paid the charges demanded, all and whatever interest or other levied, within two weeks.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-upholds-levy-of-21-crore-back-billing-charge-on-mahe-for-unauthorised-use-of-electricity/article31011486.ece

105,2020/03/07,‘Left only’ signals at traffic junctions to be switched off on trial basis,"The traffic police is considering a proposal to switch off the ‘Left Only’ signals at traffic junctions across the city.

It will be carried out for a week on a trial basis from Sunday before the proposal is finalised.

Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Sandesh Kumar told The Hindu after holding a Traffic Advisory Committee meeting on Saturday that the police had taken note of the traffic violations taking place at junctions having ‘Left Only’ signal.

“When the Left Only signal turns green, we have noticed that some motorists proceed straight and even take a right by riding in a zig-zag fashion at the junctions”, he said.

Most of the complaints have come from K.R. Circle.

The trial will be carried out across all the traffic junctions where four or more roads meet.

Before taking a final decision in this regard, the proposal of the traffic police to create an ambulance corridor will also have to be considered. “We are planning to create an ambulance corridor by allowing ambulances to take a free left”, Mr. Sandesh said. He clarified that the ‘Left Only’ signal at junctions was different from the ‘Free Left’ traffic signboard. There will be no change in the ‘Free Left’ option.

For, wherever the ‘Free Left’ traffic signboard has been installed, there is a median on the road, which prevents the motorists from jumping the signal.

However, he said there is no need for the trial to be carried out at T-junctions. “For, such a violation is not observed at T- junctions”, he said citing the example of the intersection of Temple Road and Hunsur Road near KSOU campus.

Mr. Sandesh said the monthly Traffic Advisory Committee meetings, which had been resumed after a gap of about two years, will be held on the first Saturday of every month at the office of the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) on Vinobha Road.

The former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda has said that it was time to introspect on the party’s debacle and the need of the hour is to speak out openly on issues that affected the party, before keeping the step forward to strengthen the outfit.

Mr. Gowda emphasised on the need to save regional parties, like the JD(S), at a time when national parties were trying to suppress them, in his inaugural speech at the two-day workshop and training programme for JD(S) workers from the Belagavi division.

The Former Pm chose to make a short speech at the inaugural ceremony on Saturday after the former Chairman of Legislative Council and former Minister Basavaraj Horatti released two books, one by thinker Devanur Mahadeva and the other on the contributions of Mr. Gowda towards the development of North Karnataka

He recalled what had happened to the party in the last six decades and referred to the past leaders of the Janata Parivar who moved away to find political alternatives.

“I am 87 now and still with the party. Many, including Ramakrishna Hegde, Veerendra Patil, J.H. Patel and others, have left,” he said, adding that he wanted the regional party to be saved.

Mentioning that they might have erred, Mr. Gowda said that the party had proved that why regional parties were important for development of a State.

He also said that he would not go into the details of why the party had not received the required support in the northern districts or why he had to face accusation of being casteist or being Old Mysuru centric and others.

“I am here for two days to listen to you. I want you to speak out openly on all the issues that might have affected the party. I will also interact with you separately and at the time of concluding ceremony I will speak in detail about the way forward,” he told the workers. Earlier, Mr. Horatti emphasised the need for taking remedial steps to strengthen the party.

Making introductory remarks, State general secretary Y.S.V. Datta said that the workshop was a first step towards broadening the party’s base. Making a veiled attack on those who left the party, Mr. Datta said that while the husk have been blown away in the wind, the grains have remained, and they have planned to build the party using the grains.

108,2020/03/07,Vision to ramp up government hospital standards: Minister,"He acknowledges staff shortage, promises to strengthen healthcare system

The government has long-term plans for the upgradation of public hospitals in the State and to raise them to the NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Health Providers) standards.

Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar said here on Saturday that the government wants to provide the best quality healthcare and every government hospital under medical college should have NABH standards.

Asked to elaborate on the plans, Mr. Sudhakar said this was only the beginning and the journey was long and there were immense challenges. “But that is my vision and dream and this would call for ramping up infrastructure and strengthen the healthcare system.”

The NABH provides a framework for improving the quality of hospitals with focus on quality of healthcare, leading to high standards and work culture.

Mr. Sudhakar said there have been no recruitments in government hospitals and medical colleges across the State for quite some time and had resulted in scarcity of staff. He would try to address the issue.

With regard to the K.R. Hospital in Mysuru, the Minister said it was an ‘ancient’ building and there were issues related to space and staff. Given the heritage structure, additional or new construction cannot take place. But once the superspecialty hospital was ready, the patient load on K.R. Hospital and Cheluvamba Hospital would decrease. The superspeciality hospital will have some beds for paediatrics as well along with ICU and NICU facilities.

However, the Minister said he was not satisfied with the current state of the trauma care centre.

Mr. Sudhakar, who went on an inspection spree of government hospitals in the city, visited the Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Science and Research to apprise himself of the infrastructure.

He was taken around the hospital by Director C.N. Manjunath and other staff who informed the Minister that the institute was handling around 500 patients daily. The doctors were performing cardiac intervention surgeries on about 20 to 30 patients every day.

With the Congress high command continuing to maintain silence on revamping the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) for the past three months, the incumbent president Dinesh Gundu Rao called on former party president Rahul Gandhi and urged him to appoint the new party president without further delay.

Mr. Rao said he had not demanded his continuation as the party president, but only urged Mr. Gandhi to expedite the process of appointment of the new KPCC president to revive the party’s fortunes in the State.

Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting with Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Rao said the central leaders of the party are expected to decide on the KPCC president early next week. Sources said the party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi had gone abroad and she is expected to return to the national capital early next week.

Sources also said that Mr. Rao asked Mr. Gandhi to reconstitute the State committee office-bearers to enable him to effectively discharge responsibilities in case it was not interested in the appointment of a new KPCC president at present.

A key Congress functionary said the party’s office-bearers had been acting like bureaucrats and had lost touch with the workers.

Meanwhile, senior leader D.K. Shivakumar also reached the national capital even as the AICC continued to deliberate on the reshuffle of the party’s State unit. There is no word yet on Mr. Shivakumar, one of the aspirants for the post, meeting the former Congress president. Mr. Shivakumar is expected to meet Mr. Gandhi as the leadership appears divided over revamping of the State unit.

Mr. Rao and Leader of the Congress Legislature Party Siddaramaiah had tendered their resignations after the party’s dismal performance in the Assembly bypolls on December 9, 2019, which were swept by the BJP and ensured the stability of the BJP government headed by B.S. Yediyurappa.

110,2020/03/07,Ramesh Babu quits JD(S); says ‘loyalty is weakness’ in party,"Former MLC says many are upset in the party

Upset with the party “depriving him several opportunities” to enter the Legislative Council, former MLC Ramesh Babu resigned from the primary membership of the Janata Dal (Secular) on Saturday. He was the party’s national general secretary, spokesperson, and core committee member for years.

Mr. Babu submitted his resignation letter to party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda. Stating that he would now contest as an Independent candidate, Mr. Babu said he was also considering joining other political parties.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Babu said there was no scope for loyal workers in the JD(S). “Our loyalty has become our weakness. Not just me, several others are also upset about this,” he said, hinting at the possibilities of more exits in the party.

While MLC Puttanna is already out of the party, another member Madhu Bangarappa is also planning his exit. Former JD(S) Minister G.T. Deve Gowda too has been distancing himself from the party.

Mr. Babu said the party had sidelined him over a period of time. “I was deprived a chance to enter the Legislative Council at least four times although I was eligible and deserving. Although Mr. Deve Gowda proposed my name as the party’s candidate for the MLC election from South-East Graduates’ Constituency this time, I was denied a chance,” he said.

“I am leaving the party with a heavy heart as my association with the Janata Parivar has been over four decades. Although I worked hard for the development of the party, it is unfortunate that my efforts were not recognised. I served as MLC only for a short term as I had got elected in the byelections from Teachers’ constituency,” he said.

Asked if Mr. Deve Gowda did not stop him from leaving, he said: “He expressed helplessness. Whatever the reason, my sincere thanks to everyone in the party who allowed me to work with the public. I will not make any allegations now,” he said.

No comment, says HDD

111,2020/03/07,"Seek hike in cess, GST rates to meet revenue shortfall: Panel","Committee, led by the State Chief Secretary, advises Finance Dept. to take up issue in GST Council

Following a sharp fall in the State’s share in Central pool of taxes in 2019-20 and reduction in allocation by the 15th Finance Commission in 2020-21, a committee headed by State Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar suggested to the government to demand increase in rate of cess or increase in Goods and Service Tax (GST) rates to meet the shortfall in GST collections in the State.

It suggested to the Finance Department to take up this issue in the GST Council. Cess is different from taxes as it is charged over and above the existing taxes. The two large cesses on taxes that the State imposes are Infrastructure Cess and State Urban Transport Cess.

Infrastructure cess is 15% on excise license fee, 10% each on Motor Vehicle Tax and stamps duty on certain documents for augmenting Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., Infrastructure Initiative Fund, and the Chief Minister’s Rural Road Fund.

There is 1% cess imposed on Motor Vehicle Tax for contribution to the State Urban Transport Fund to bolster the urban transport schemes. Cess collections in 2019-20 is estimated at ₹1,489 crore.

The Fiscal Management Review Committee (FMRC) headed by the Chief Secretary noted the reduction in GST compensation to the State. The panel advised the Finance Department headed by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to follow up with the Centre to get the GST compensation due for December and January released at the earliest. The FMRC met on February 27 and reviewed the current as well as projected fiscal situation.

The State’s share in Central taxes was reduced by ₹8,887 crore while the GST compensation was reduced by ₹3,000 crore, totalling ₹11,887 crore in 2019-20. There would be a reduction of ₹11,215 crore in the State’s share of Central taxes in 2020-21 following reduction in allocation by the 15th Finance Commission. Owing to these cuts, the Budget proposed to hike fuel and liquor prices.

There is more bad news in the Medium Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP 2020-24). It noted that Motor Vehicle Tax collections and stamps and registration fee collection are expected to see a marginal shortfall due to reduction in sale of vehicles as well as on account of showdown in the real estate sector, respectively, the MTFP said.

On salaries

The panel has also instructed the Finance Department that salaries to the Grants in-Aid institutions should only be disbursed on Human Resources Management System (HRMS) starting April 1, 2020. The panel instructed administrative departments to come up with strategies to improve expenditure effectiveness.

The FMRC advised the Finance Department to examine various revenue-generating options on taxes, cess, fee revision for non-tax revenues under various departments, local bodies, boards, corporations, and other parastatal bodies so as to augment their resources and at the same time increase tax to GSDP ratio of the State.

It noted that the government’s committed expenditure reached 90% of revenue receipts on account of increasing salaries, pensions and interest payments.

‘Recover loans from PSUs’

The committee headed by State Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar has suggested that the Finance Department initiate measures to recover loans disbursed by the State government to public sector units (PSUs) and other boards and corporations, as directed by the Fiscal Management Review Committee (FMRC) last year. The Chief Secretary further advised the Finance Department to have regular meetings with the administrative departments at the secretary level to ensure timely recovery of loans.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/seek-hike-in-cess-gst-rates-to-meet-revenue-shortfall-panel/article31010679.ece
112,2020/03/07,"Tension as group storms hospital, assaults patients","There was tension for a while at the district general hospital on Saturday, after a group of around 15 persons stormed the casualty ward and began to assault a patient and his brother, who tried to rescue him.

The incident happened soon after District in charge and Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan departed after visiting the hospital.

In the ensuing panic, people started running from the ward.

The victims have been identified as Shankar and Yallalinga, sons of Rangappa, member of the Pogalapur Gram Panchayat.

Mr. Rangappa said that there was a conflict between one Ajay Reddy Yelheri and Shankar on Saturday morning over the parking of a motorcycle.

According to sources, the situation turned ugly and Shankar allegedly assaulted Ajay Reddy Yelheri, following which both got admitted to the hospital.

As the news spread, the relatives of Ajay allegedly stormed the hospital and assaulted Shankar and Yallalinga, sources said.

This is the second incident in a week as the similar incident in which a woman and her husband assaulted by another man. However, hospital authorities have failed to increase security arrangements ensuring safety of the patients admitted.

Narayanappa, district surgeon, who was said to be attending the Minister’s programme, was not available for a reaction.

Rishikesh Sonawane, Superintendent of Police, said that they will book a case in the incident.

“It is unacceptable for a group to enter the hospital and assault patients, creating public nuisance.

Speaking to presspersons in the city on Friday, Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar said there was no need to panic over COVID-19. He said that as per the guidelines announced by the Health Ministry, a mechanism was in place to screen and isolate individuals displaying symptoms.

He said precautionary measures were in place and an awareness drive has been launched to spread information on COVID-19 and the simple measures that one needs to take to avoid contracting it. He said people who have travelled abroad in recent weeks and returned have been screened, while individuals with symptoms such as headache, fever, and infection in the eye, mouth or nose were advised to get themselves medically examined. The authorities have created an isolation ward at K.R. Hospital and at the Centre for Epidemic Disease. They have also advised the public against wearing face masks unnecessarily.

The Health Department is carrying out public awareness drives on COVID-19 and information leaflets and brochures containing certain guidelines have been distributed, besides being prominently displayed in public places, including the city bus stand and the railway station.

District Health Officer Venkatesh said all precautionary measures were in place and teams constituted for screening and monitoring. He said international tourists or delegates were being casually questioned about their place of origin, while the special teams constituted to screen people in the border areas with Tamil Nadu and Kerala continue to be stationed. The team in Bavli village, where a river constitutes the border with Kerala, is monitoring the situation and subjecting people to random checks, and so far no one has tested positive.

He said certain simple measures such as maintaining good hygiene, washing hands with sanitizer or soap, avoiding crowded places, and maintaining a safe distance from people suffering from cough or tending to sneeze would go a long way in minimising the chance of being infected.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5f29nq/article31004493.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGMYSDCCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/district-administration-allays-fears-over-covid-19-in-mysuru/article31004494.ece

121,2020/03/07,KSPCB chairperson’s appointment set for curious legal battle in High Court,"Govt. says Sudhindra Rao’s appointment was wrongly done; chairperson to contest government claim

The State government, which appointed M. Sudhindra Rao as chairperson of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) on December 30, 2012, on Friday made a U-turn on its decision by telling the High Court of Karnataka that it was “wrongly” done as the rules for appointment to the post were not framed as per the apex court’s 2017 directions.

Mr. Rao, however, chose to defend his appointment by the government as his counsel sought time to file a statement of objection to the government’s contention.

Curiously, after contending before the court that the appointment of Mr. Rao could not have been done “wrongfully”, the government backed out from withdrawing the appointment order but insisted that it was better the court decided the issue while adjudicating the four PIL petitions — three questioning the legality of the appointment of Mr. Rao and one seeking directions to the Union government to frame rules for appointing chairpersons to the State Pollution Control Boards.

While the Additional Advocate-General, on instructions from officials, submitted that appointment could not have been made without framing rules as per the apex court’s judgment, the counsel representing Mr. Rao said he would oppose the government’s claim by filling statements. Mr. Rao’s counsel also pointed out to the court that the government simply cannot withdraw the appointment order as it had to follow the procedure prescribed under the law for removal of the chairperson.

Kinagi, which heard the petitions, recorded the submission made on behalf of the government and adjourned further hearing till March 17 after asking the counsel for the chairperson to file the statement of objection.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kspcb-chairpersons-appointment-set-for-curious-legal-battle-in-high-court/article31004392.ece

124,2020/03/07,Funds set aside to buy printing machine for Braille press,"Usually, the press gets orders for printing 15,000 to 20,000 Braille textbooks every year

The supply of Braille textbooks to visually challenged children in about 32 schools across the State from Karnataka’s only government Braille textbook printing press in Mysuru is expected to be in time, thanks to the allocation of funds for the purchase of another printing machine.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, in the 2020-21 Budget, announced ₹80 lakh for procuring a state-of-the-art printing machine to meet the demand for timely printing and supply of Braille textbooks.

Till May last year, the press had two printing machines. After one machine broke down, the burden fell on the remaining one, forcing students to wait for the books.

Usually, the press gets orders for printing 15,000 to 20,000 books every year. Unlike the printing of normal books, each Braille textbook runs into seven or eight volumes — ie, seven to eight books become one Braille textbook. Therefore, the press and staff had to work vigorously for at least three months from June to print the books.

The press has seven staff members, though the sanctioned number of posts is 17. The press, which is completing 40 years, functions under the Directorate of Disabled Welfare and Senior Citizens.

When the imported machines broke down in the past, textbooks had to be outsourced from presses in New Delhi and other places. The machines are sophisticated and repair needs to be done by technicians in Mumbai. They are made in Norway and are advanced, sources at the press said.

Subject textbooks from classes 1 to 10 are printed here, besides the Braille calendar. Braille books on general knowledge, music, Kannada and English grammar are also printed at the press. Books are supplied to children in primary schools free of cost, while one-third of the printing cost of books supplied to high school students is collected by the press. The books are supplied to the four government schools for the blind, besides regular schools where special children are taught under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in all districts.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/87xviy/article31004377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGPRINTINGMACHINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/funds-set-aside-to-buy-printing-machine-for-braille-press/article31004378.ece

However, I don’t know which one to pursue for my Master’s and I didn’t get any related information regarding their job description in the private sector or public sector. Please suggest which one should I pursue, and the career opportunities available in these fields. — Bhavika Sugla

Dear Bhavika,

What would you like and enjoy more — empowering a client and a person one at a time or make a difference to a community at large? What is the kind of work that interests you — social or educational?

Job opportunities after MSW are huge. You could become a medical social workers — responsible for providing support to patients with chronic or terminal illnesses, as well as their families; a substance abuse counsellor at a rehabilitation clinic or a hospital; a child welfare case worker with a NGO or the government; a school social worker or a clinical mental health social worker.

However, a special educator’s role is very different from this. Jobs could vary from being a tutor, to a home school teacher, to teaching Learning Disabilities (LD) students full time at a school, helping out with remediation, or becoming a Learning Disabilities Teacher Consultant (LDT-C), a reading specialist, a guidance counsellor, a special education advocate or an educational consultant.

Both are lucrative, deeply fulfilling and personally rewarding as professional career choices. Wishing you the very best!

I am an undergraduate with honours in commerce from Shri Ram College of Commerce. I am confused about my future. I aspire to study, but I am confused between pursuing LLB and M.Com. Please guide me. — Shivani

Dear Shivani,

It really depends on you. Would you want to be a lawyer, or would you prefer a job at a bank or a corporate financial firm?

To do law — you have to undertake an exam to secure admission into a law college (depending upon the university you select). The duration of the course is three years and the course is divided into six semesters. Job opportunities range from being a human resource manager to a business consultant, to a management accountant, an advocate/lawyer, an attorney general, a law reporter, a deputy legal advisor or an assistant advisor.

Opportunities post an M.Com are becoming a CA, a CS, a lecturer or a professor, a banker, applying for government jobs and becoming a chief accountant or a chief internal auditor. Draw up a list of what you would enjoy and follow that. Best wishes.

I am a 19-year-old, second-year B.A. (Hons.) Psychology student. I am confused about my career and am unable to decide whether to prepare for government exams such as banking, UPSC, and so on, or study further in psychology. I am interested in psychology as well as in other subjects. I want to land a well paying job before I turn 23, as there will be parental pressure to get married. What are the career prospects? — Vasundhara

Hi Vasundhara,

You seem almost stressed to be financially independent before you turn 23 and get married. It seems to be driving you to want to do something concrete with your life. I would really recommend that you meet a career counsellor and get a complete profile done for yourself so that you are able to study the subjects that you are passionate and fond of, thereby finding yourself work in the similar field post your academic completion. By doing that, working in that area would come effortlessly and be a mere basic extension of your identity that you can carry on with, even being married.

Currently, I would like to do research in my field, but I am not sure about the next step. I am not interested in teaching but would like to start earning early. Please guide me. — Shalu Nair

Dear Shalu,

That was clever thinking. Zoology is a very vast field and comprises of everything — embryology, evolution, classification, habits, habitats, distribution, body structure and their interaction with ecosystems. There are numerous specialisations and research possibilities within it. Post an M.Sc, you can choose to do your research in any of the following topics such as ecology, bioinfomatics, evolution of animals, animal physiology, immunology, cell biology or genetics. Job opportunities are also really diverse across different sectors such as healthcare, animal husbandry, research and development, pharmaceutical sector, NGOs, government departments and also wildlife conservation bodies.

127,2020/03/07,Family ties,"What is the meaning and origin of ‘to eat humble pie’? (Vijay Bhat, Bhopal)

This expression is frequently heard in informal contexts. When someone is made ‘to eat humble pie’, he/she is forced to admit that he/she is in the wrong about something; he/she accepts defeat. The expression suggests that the person has been embarrassed or humiliated. It has more or less the same meaning as ‘to eat one’s words’ and ‘to eat crow’.

If Vinod’s project fails, his colleagues will take great delight in making him eat humble pie for several months.

After losing in the very first round, I had to eat humble pie.

The word ‘humble’ in this context does not refer to ‘humility’. It comes from the Old English ‘umbles’, and the word was mostly used to refer to the inner organs — liver, heart, kidneys, and so on — of an animal. Rich people seldom ate the flesh from these parts; it was the servants in the household that usually consumed them. They used the minced meat not eaten by their master to make an ‘umble pie’. So, when you ate ‘umble pie’, you were being like the ‘humble’ servant. With the passage of time, ‘umble’ was replaced by ‘humble’.

How is the word ‘nepotism’ pronounced? (S Devika, Nellore)

The first syllable rhymes with the words ‘hep’, ‘pep’ and ‘rep’, and the following vowel sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The ‘s’ is pronounced like the ‘z’ in ‘zoo’, ‘zip’ and ‘zero’. The word, which comes from the Latin ‘nepos’, meaning ‘nephew’, is pronounced ‘NE-pe-tiz-em’ with the stress on the first syllable. It is mostly used in everyday contexts to show disapproval. Nepotism is favouritism based on kinship; a person uses his position of power to promote or help the members of his own family. Many of our politicians do this all the time.

Like most politicians, the Chief Minister was guilty of nepotism.

How did I get a job in this wonderful company? Nepotism, of course!

Is it okay to say, ‘If you will come first in class...’? (K Janaki, Erode)

No, it is not. We do not usually use ‘will’ in conditional clauses — i.e. clauses beginning with words like ‘if’, ‘when’, and so on. In such cases, we normally use the simple present tense. For example, “If you come first in class, I’ll buy you a bicycle.” What this suggests is that a certain condition has to be fulfilled for the person to get a bicycle in the future — the condition being, coming first in class. Here are a few more examples.

128,2020/03/07,5 ways to handle exam anxieties,"There are several ways to make sure you survive the exam days. Better planning and staying calm are a few tips to start with

Sitting in the exam hall, your moment of truth is here. All those hours spent cramming are finally going to pay off. You read through the questions, and so far so good… but wait; what’s this question? You vaguely remember reading about the topic but have forgotten the details. Oh well, it’s only one mark, you can come back to it later. You continue reading, and here is one more question you can’t recall the answer to. And one from a section you skipped studying because you didn’t think it would be given importance — but here it is, making a grand appearance and worth a whopping four marks. Super! Why is nobody around you freaking out? Are you the only one who is stumped? Is this exam going to destroy your future?

In the thick of exam season, anxiety is a common phenomenon. The tense atmosphere of the exam hall, coupled with the pressure (both from others as well as from yourself) to do well, can build up and be set off by the smallest speedbump — a forgotten answer, or a pen that stopped working halfway. Anxiety can throw you off your game, no matter how well you have prepared.

Here are some suggestions on how to better manage anxiety in an exam setting:

Tackle the unknown: If you don’t plan to cover the entire syllabus, or are not confident of recalling some sections, prepare a strategy for dealing with such questions if you encounter them. For instance, you may decide to prioritise time for questions you know the answers to; and for the ones you don’t, you could skip them initially but schedule a 15 minute window towards the end to revisit them and see if you have any flashes of brilliance.

For instance, you may decide to prioritise time for questions you know the answers to; and for the ones you don’t, you could skip them initially but schedule a 15 minute window towards the end to revisit them and see if you have any flashes of brilliance. Know thyself: It’s always good to put a plan to test. Take practice exams and mimic the exam hall setup as close as possible (formal seating, no distractions or access to textbooks). When finished, review your answers of course, but also think about your actions. Did your answering strategy give you confidence or make you nervous? Did you stick with it throughout or abandon it halfway to try something new? Did the new plan work? Where did you find yourself getting stuck and losing the most time? Did you blank out or day dream, and if so, in which part of the exam? Have you been monitoring time properly? Analysing your own test-taking habits will help you better prepare for dealing with the real thing.

Stay focused on yourself: Outside the hall, avoid friends who want to do last minute studying with you, if you know that’s going to make you nervous. During the exam, don’t be tempted to see what the rest of the world is doing. It has no bearing on your own performance. This time is about you, not about others, so focus on yourself.

If you find your paper to be particularly difficult, pause to take deep breaths before you tackle the hard parts. It will take you less than a minute to do, and will help clear your head. Forget about the future, focus on the “now”: While writing the exam, if you find yourself starting to worry, recognise this and pause your train of thought. Avoid thinking about the lofty goals you have set for your future — you will have plenty of time to mull over these when the results are out. In the hall, fix your mind on only one target: getting through the next few hours and leaving the room. The rest can wait.

129,2020/03/07,Truly global,"The course structure, among many other reasons, is what attracted Unnetri towards this university

I completed my under graduation in Sociology from St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata, and a post graduation in it from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar. During these years, I developed an interest in Human Resources and further research made me want to pursue a degree in Human Resources. That led to me pursuing a degree in Human Resource Management (with CIPD pathway).

I applied to a number of prestigious institutions in the U.K. and Europe in 2018 and eventually finalised University of Sheffield because of its academic excellence, global reputation and course structure.

The Management School is Triple Crown accredited by AMBA (Association of MBAs), AACSB (Associate to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), and EQUIS (EFMD Quality Improvement System). My course grants me exemptions towards the CIPD Level 7 Diploma in Human Resource Management.

Apart from Human Resources, the course offers modules such as Accounting and Strategic Management to transform students into well-rounded professionals. I was anxious about the teaching methods used in the U.K., but I was relieved by the amount of guidance the university offered through their skill centres.

Diversity

I have also received an International Postgraduate Student Scholarship from the University — a 10% reduction on my tuition fees. This course is intense but I still work as a Postgraduate Student Ambassador. Working and simultaneously managing my studies helps me enhance my time management skills.

Here, I feel like I truly belong to a global community. I have met many students from diverse parts of the world. Interacting with peers from different cultures greatly enhances my knowledge about the world.

The experiences and knowledge that I am gaining here will remain with me throughout my life and will play a significant role in my professional achievements.

130,2020/03/07,Grants that make a difference,"From education loans to scholarships and more, NSDL e-Governance is going all out to address the monetary concerns of students

As a step towards bridging the funding gap that exists for the students of India, NSDL e-governance Infrastructure Limited, has entered the field of education technology infrastructure with three service verticals, Vidyasaarathi, Vidya Kaushal and Vidya Lakshmi.

Although the primary focus is on the financial spectrum of the education sector, each vertical adheres to providing different services. Students can avail of scholarships of domestically through Vidyasaarathi, a single entry point through the scholarship or grant route. It acts as a catalyst between companies looking to contribute to the education space with their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds and students.

“Corporates can choose to create their own schemes and criteria to give scholarships to the deserving students. However, the schemes are designed and moderated by Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), our partner for this project. So far, 23 corporates have associated with Vidyasaarathi to design and provide scholarship schemes to students,” says Gagan Rai, MD, and CEO of NSDL- e governance.

Skill development

They have also developed Vidya Kaushal, a first-of-its- kind portal, which enables deserving and needy students to apply for financial assistance to pursue skill development training courses, under National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). “It is an aggregator which brings together all the stakeholders in skill education, like students, training centres, and financing agencies to identify quality leads for financers and financing options for students. It also provides skill course counselling,” adds Rai. Students are required to fill a form to register themselves for availing access to these courses.

Monitoring system

Apart from loan procurement, sufficient efforts have been directed towards creating a comprehensive monitoring system for education loans in the country. Vidya Lakshmi is the product of this initiative. “It was developed as a mechanism for students to track their application status and communicate online with banks to ensure a smooth, hassle-free process of loan procurement and our vision that no student should miss out on higher education due to lack of funds,” says Rai.

Students can register themselves in the individual portals, using their unique credentials to get started.

131,2020/03/07,Striking a balance,"Hostel life, burning the midnight oil, forging friendships that would last a lifetime, and more... Rituparna Ghosh’s book is inspired from her experiences at IIT-M

Going back to your college days and wanting to relive them is an emotion that many graduates can relate to. While some relive them by talking about them or sharing stories around tables, Rituparna Ghosh, an IIT Madras alumnus, decided to write a book based on her experiences.

The book, Unloved in Love, which was launched recently, deals with the emotional journey a student goes through while making the tough choices between career and relationships in their college days. The book has been published by Readomania.

A transformational life coach by profession, this is Ghosh’s first novel. “I spent most of my childhood being lost in the world of books. They were my dream world, an alternate reality that I sought to escape the perils of coordinate geometry, vectors, periodic tables. As a young adult, I sought out romance because I loved the ‘high’ being in love gave me. I still remember having entered into IIT with this feeling, the expectation that anything could happen,” recalls Ghosh.

Campus life

Ghosh, who had lived the hostel life before, felt that IIT was an extended fun trip with friends. “Despite the fact that there were assignments that kept us awake late, surprise tests at drop of the hat and the mandatory attendance, it all seemed easy with so much happening around us. Nothing could beat the lively atmosphere in IIT, where we were encouraged to follow our dreams and passion.”

She is quick to add that the friendships that were formed on the campus during the LAN games, all-night study sessions, last-minute deadline rush and festivals, are still going strong today, 15 years later.

While she does not define this book as an autobiography, she does admit that a lot of it is inspired by her campus experiences.

Considering her book is based on striking a balance between career and relationships, how did Rituparna manage to achieve the balance. “Ahem! Considering I wrote a book about it, you can imagine how it was!” she laughs in response.

“Love, like everything else in IIT, is a serious business. You are out in the world for the first time as adults/ almost adults and forced to be independent, but IIT gives you that confidence to reach out for the impossible. You have people supporting you, and you know even if you mess up, you will be in a forgiving environment. The trust placed in you automatically makes you accountable, and even though a part of you would want to spend every waking moment walking hand in hand or being on the phone, another part will be unwilling to ignore the mountain of assignments, or exams. You learn to find the middle ground, respect your choices and strive for balance,” she adds.

From the fairy tales we read in our childhood to the movies we watch in college, the idea of ‘happily ever after’ usually strongly rules our imagination of our future. However, The IIT alumni, through her book, breaks the silence on the struggle that one goes through to achieve the proverbial ‘happily ever after’. “It’s the biggest myth that romance as a genre has circulated. In fact, in real life, the actual journey begins after you have fallen in love. Try living together with the love of your life, when there are bills to be paid, dinners to be made, all the ‘happy’ goes out of the window and all that stays are arguments. But no one prepares you how to walk down these thorny parts of a relationship; no one tells you that to be happy you have to continuously work towards it, you will have to, sometimes, chip away parts of you to fit in with the other person, and re-prioritise your life.”

Quitting the rat race

Ghosh spent almost 10 years in research and analytics, hoping that the elusive job satisfaction would follow on the heels of the next organisation or promotion. It was only when she was forced to quit the rat race, due to personal problems, that she realised she was losing her true calling. “In this world of Instagram selfies and Snapchat stories, today’s youth is struggling with what they want to do and what the world expects them to do. The realisation made me sign up for the life coach diploma. In fact, it was my love of observing people and understanding them that helped me sketch characters.”

Change is constant

She graduated from IIT Madras in 2005 and a lot has changed on the campus since then. However, Ghosh has embraced these changes positively. “As I belonged to the earlier generation, I have enjoyed the greenery, the trek outside the campus to eat something different, or catch up with old friends in Gurunath. We never thought this would change; it was our constant. The other day, while launching the book, I was grateful for Café Coffee Day, the swanky classrooms; I interacted with students and realised that this was their normal. This growth is required for the kind of society we have today. Ten years later, someone will be nostalgic about the changes that stump us today,” she says, signing off.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/lt280r/article31007456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09EPBSRITUPARNA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/education/striking-a-balance/article31007457.ece
132,2020/03/07,The chemistry of engineering,"With many branches of engineering stemming either directly or indirectly from chemistry, AICTE’s move to remove the subject as a core requirement for admission sends a confusing message

All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has not mandated chemistry as a subject of study in higher secondary course (HSC) for pursuing undergraduate engineering/technology programmes in the country. As per AICTE’s ‘Approval Process Handbook 2020 - 21’, the candidates are required to have studied mathematics and physics only, compulsorily and, as an optional subject, any one of chemistry, biotechnology, biology, computer science, IT, information practices, agriculture, engineering graphics, business studies and technical vocational subject.

It is true that more importance is given to physics in engineering, and to chemistry in medicine. For instance, in breaking the tie between candidates that arises in ranking for counselling, priority is given to marks in physics for engineering, and to marks in chemistry for medicine.

Relevance

However, chemistry is not irrelevant to engineering. Undermining chemistry’s importance in engineering is not of recent origin. Fifteen years ago, chemistry was made a one-semester subject for BE/BTech programmes, offered only in the first semester of the first year. Consequently, in many self-financing colleges in Tamil Nadu, chemistry departments were operated only in the odd semesters and were closed down, retrenching the services of the staff, in the even semesters. For this reason and for the reason of its own importance, subsequently, chemistry was restored for the first two semesters.

If the concept that chemistry is not required for engineering gains acceptance, then chemistry need not be taught in engineering colleges; the department can be closed. The states where entrance exams are conducted for engineering admission cannot examine candidates in chemistry, since all the candidates would not have studied chemistry. National level exams such as JEE(Main) and JEE(Advanced), meant for admission in IITs, NITs, IIITs and other willing institutions may have to change their pattern of question papers. In Tamil Nadu, the rank list prepared for counselling for admission in engineering can use only the marks in two subjects, namely, mathematics and physics. This will result in more candidates being ‘tied’ (with the same total ranking marks). Any suggestions to also consider the marks in the optional subject may be resented because of the differences in their difficulty and content levels.

Most of the engineering subjects are based on physical sciences which comprises both physics and chemistry. These two subjects are complementary, with many overlapping concepts, such as entropy, enthalpy and so on.

Core influence

While many branches of engineering directly stem up from chemistry, many others belonging to the core areas like civil and mechanical engineering depend on it in a diffused way. Concrete/mortar admixtures and additives, corrosion prevention, hydrophobics, tunnelling/mining, resins, sealing/bonding, emulsion and water proofing are some areas in civil engineering which borrow heavily from chemistry. Refrigerants, lubricants, metal extraction and processes, aviation fuels, exhaust products and polymer composites are examples in mechanical engineering and its constituent areas such as aeronautical engineering and naval architecture. Design and manufacture of electronic components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, batteries, oscilloscopes, high precision sensors, lasers, polymer insulation and areas of wafer engineering, VLSI and physical electronics are samples from electrical/ electronics engineering. According to R. Padyala, a senior scientist, “Chemistry is very important... because it is based on the most fundamental law of nature — the law of stoichiometry.”

For these reasons, among the freshers in engineering colleges, those who have not studied chemistry as a subject in higher secondary course may lag behind those who have studied it. This may only further reduce the charm of engineering which is already in the decline. It may be noted that the basic subject of Nobel laureate Venkataraman Ramakrishnan who hails from Tamil Nadu, was Chemistry. Following AICTE, the Medical Council of India may delete physics and make only biology and chemistry as compulsory subjects in HSC as a qualifying condition for MBBS programme.

This move by AICTE could be reconsidered. Chemistry is everywhere in our everyday life — in foods we eat, air we breath, the way we cleanse our dirt, preserve our stuff, protect the environs and even experience emotions of love, hate, compassion and desire. Engineering/technology being a study concerned with betterment of living conditions of humans cannot, therefore, be learnt properly without the basic study of chemistry as a prerequisite.

1. Chemical Engineering/Technology

2. Chemical and Electrochemical Engineering

3. Ceramic Engineering

4. Petroleum Engineering

5. Petrochemical Engineering

133,2020/03/07,‘Silk District’ to be launched in Wayanad,"The Rural Development Department, as part of its poverty alleviation project, is gearing up to launch the Silk District project, a Centrally sponsored scheme, to tap the sericulture potential of Wayanad.

“The Central government has selected the hill district as one of the 50 districts in the country for executing the project under its ‘One district one product’ scheme. The project is envisaged to attain self-sufficiency in raw silk production in the country,” said P.C. Majeed, poverty alleviation project director, Wayanad.

The Central Silk Board aims to expand mulberry cultivation from the current 2.84 lakh hectares to 3.25 lakh hectares in the next three years. The district was selected for the project after considering its huge potential in raw silk productivity and marketing of cocoon in the district, said Mr. Majeed.

As a district that produced bivoltine (producing two broods in a season) cocoon, Wayanad had huge untapped potential in sericulture, he said. Sericulture and its allied sectors could provide a lot of job opportunities to youths in the rural areas, said Mr. Majeed, adding that sericulture farmers could earn ₹600 to ₹700 a kg of cocoon after a sharp decline in silk production in China recently.

Mulberry cultivation is spread over 70 acres in the district and the project plans to expand the cultivation to 100 acres in the first phase. The district was producing 9.5 tonnes of raw silk a year at present, and it would be increased to 13 tonnes a year, said sericulture department sources.

135,2020/03/07,Second rail line cleared for operations,"Ambalappuzha-Haripad corridor will have two-way traffic from March 14

With the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) giving the nod to operate trains on the newly laid 18.3-km Ambalappuzha-Haripad corridor, Railways are bracing to complete the doubling of the Kayamkulam-Ambalappuzha stretch of the coastal railway in four months.

The corridor cleared by Commissioner of Railway Safety K. Manohar after an inspection on February 26 will be thrown open for train operations on March 14 at 80 km per hour, an official said.

Underbridges

Railways have built seven road underbridges in place of seven level crossings in the stretch for hassle-free movement of trains and road users. Once trains start running on the newly laid line, the construction wing will take up the work to extend the eight subways in the next four months. As part of the doubling works, the nine level crossings in the stretch will be provided with interlocking signals, enabling swift movement of road users. “The closing of level crossing gates for the movement of trains will be limited to three minutes once the interlocking signals are provided,” the official said.

The Ambalappuzha-Haripad stretch got an outlay of ₹13.95 crore for doubling in the 2020-2021 Union Budget. The 31-km Kayamkulam Junction-Ambalappuzha doubling, taken up at an estimate of ₹450 crore, will improve the operational efficiency and punctuality of trains. Delay in making available land has hit the doubling of the 68-km Ernakulam-Ambalappuzha corridor. A decision on doubling the stretch is yet to be taken as Railways are demanding cost-sharing of the project by the State. A sum of ₹750 crore is needed for acquiring land, official said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/78hhiz/article31011690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tv-railcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/second-rail-line-cleared-for-operations/article31011531.ece
136,2020/03/07,UDF chalks out a plan for Kuttanad Assembly seat,"Congress likely to contest, with the front acknowledging Joseph faction’s claim to the seat

The confusion within the United Democratic Front (UDF) over the Kuttanad byelection may finally come to an end. As the bitter fight between the two factions in the Kerala Congress (M) continues unabated, the UDF leadership has begun working on a formula to field a Congress candidate in Kuttanad, after acknowledging the P.J. Joseph group’s claim over the seat. The deal is being worked out following apprehensions that a unilateral takeover of the seat by the Congress, the leading partner in the coalition, may complicate the situation further.

The latest move comes even as the warring factions have toughened their stance on the seat. The Joseph faction maintains that it has been contesting from the seat since 1979. But, the Jose K. Mani faction seeks to dismiss the claim and point out that it was allotted to the KC(M) in 2011 when the Congress wanted to contest from Punalur.

On March 10

“At a consensus meeting on March 10, the UDF leadership will request both factions to concede to the front’s intent to field a Congress candidate. For, the coalition regards the byelection as its best chance to wrest back the seat from the Left Democratic Front in the absence of Nationalist Congress Party strongman Thomas Chandy,” said a senior UDF leader. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has acknowledged the UDF candidate at Kuttanad in 2016 as a Joseph group member. With Mr. Joseph already announcing plans to field Jacob Abraham from the seat, the UDF’s move to acknowledge his claim over the seat is intended to pacify the leader. If the UDF succeeds in convincing Mr. Mani during the meeting on March 10, the announcement will follow soon after.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-chalks-out-a-plan-for-kuttanad-assembly-seat/article31011521.ece

A faction of the Kerala Congress (Jacob), led by Johny Nelloor, merged ‘unconditionally’ with the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by P.J. Joseph here on Saturday. Both Mr. Joseph and Mr. Nelloor gave a call to hundreds of party workers at Rajendra Maidan to work for farmers and small traders who had put their trust in a united Kerala Congress. Mr. Joseph, who inaugurated the merger meeting, said Kerala was ripe for a major public action against some of the policy decisions of the Left Democratic Front government. Land transactions had become costly under the present regime. Kerala was ripe for a revolution in sectors such as tourism and food processing. Infrastructure such as the north-south expressway, which was proposed long ago by him, needed to be constructed.

‘Not after power’

Mr. Nelloor, the party’s chairman for 27 years, said some in the media had described him as hankering after power. However, if he was looking for power and position he would have joined the State Cabinet led by former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in the erstwhile United Democratic Front government. He claimed that at that time he had pledged his loyalty to the late Minister T.M. Jacob. However, Anoop Jacob, MLA and Kerala Congress (Jacob), leader had not understood the current political situation. He alleged that Kerala was witness to rampant corruption. People must rise against the policies and actions of the LDF government.

140,2020/03/07,Defective pipeline to be replaced,"After much delay, the work to replace 1,524 m of defective pipeline under the Alappuzha drinking water project will begin next week.

As per the decision, 1,084 m of faulty pipeline at Thakazhy and another 440 m at Kelamangalam will be replaced. Officials said they had prepared a tentative schedule for the pipe-relaying work as directed by the government.

“As per the plan, the work will begin on March 18. We have already given letters to the Public Works Department (PWD) and Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), urging them to provide the estimate for the restoration of the road after completing the pipeline work. Once the estimate is received, we will deposit the amount with the ULCCS,” A. Sheeja, project manager, UIDSSMT, said here on Saturday.

Road to be dug up

The work will be carried out after digging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road. The KWA will bear the cost of restoring the road dug up for laying the pipeline.

The road restoration work will be carried out by the ULCCS.

Officials said that 1,000-mm high-density polyethylene pipe would be replaced with 900-mm mild steel pipe.

The pipe relaying will be done by the same contractor who laid the pipeline and bear the cost of the mild steel pipe.

It is expected to be completed before the onset of the monsoon.

The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) will stop pumping in order to carry out the work.

Alternative measures

However, alternative measures will be introduced to supply drinking water to consumers in Alappuzha municipality and eight nearby grama panchayats. Apart from drawing water from borewells, water will also be distributed through tankers and from reverse osmosis plants.

The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the KWA with Central assistance under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) in 2017.

However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 40 times, including 30 major bursts at Thakazhy, in the past three years, disrupting the water supply and damaging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road.

A high-level meeting convened by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 had decided to replace the defective pipeline in three months, sources said.

However, a lack of permission from the PWD for digging the road has put the work on hold.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/defective-pipeline-to-be-replaced/article31011296.ece

The Fisheries Department on Saturday seized Ezakiyal, a fishing boat owned by Munambam resident Raiju Antony, for juvenile fishing.

In a joint inspection conducted by the Marine Enforcement and Fisheries Department, the boat was found carrying huge quantities of fish below the minimum legal size. Apart from imposing a fine of ₹2.5 lakh, the entire catch in the boat was auctioned for ₹40,000 and the amount was credited to the government.

The department has strengthened surveillance measures after it has been reported that several boats are bringing in huge volumes of juveniles and other marine creatures.

The inspection was led by Neendakara Fisheries Assistant Director Naushar Khan, marine enforcement Circle Inspector S.S.Biju, Sub-Inspector Sumesh, Civil Police officers Vimal, Manu and lifeguard Roy.

143,2020/03/07,Riverbank to host rural market,"It will help producers connect directly with buyers on the banks of Kodoor river

After paddy farming and water tourism, the next thing to come up on the banks of the Kodoor river, which was restored recently through a series of conservation activities, is a rural market.

Kadavoram, one of the local tourist destinations recently opened by the Meenachil-Meenanthara-Kodoor river-linking programme, will soon turn into a trading place for the local fishermen and farmer collectives every evening.

The items on offer include indigenous fish and vegetable varieties, alongside a rare range of traditional utensils.

According to K. Anil Kumar, work is on to constitute local collectives of farmers and fishermen.

The idea is to offer them a solution to the logistical problems of distance to wider markets, remoteness, and lack of infrastructure.

“The chance to establish a market at Kadavoram is very exciting as it is at this point that the river begins to transform beyond its chocked riverbed and silted up canals,” he said.

Favourite hangout

A few hundred meters along the Vakathanam-Panachikkad road, the destination is fast becoming a favourite evening hangout.

The opening of this rural market will help producers connect directly with their buyers by avoiding intermediaries, he added. The project takes a cue from the traditional rural markets that thrived along the riverbanks of the region when a majority of the goods were transported through water routes.

The waterways along the Kodoor river lost its significance with the expansion of the road networks and they fell into an even sorrier state over the last decades with the canals silting up and they got levelled overtime. The river-linking project, through works taken up in different phases over the last couple of years, stabilised its canals and even dredged the channels. Panachikkad panchayat president E.R. Sunil Kumar will officially launch the market at a function to be held here on March 10. Mr. Anil Kumar will present the report.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9k4b0b/article31011264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv08skadrives,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/riverbank-to-host-rural-market/article31011257.ece
144,2020/03/07,CU to be more lenient on attendance,"This follows the suicide of a student at Malabar Christian College

The Syndicate of Calicut University (CU) has decided to be more lenient towards graduate students who are denied chance to write their final examination after they face attendance shortage in the fifth and sixth semesters.

This follows the controversy surrounding the suicide of Jaspreet Singh, a third year student of B.A. Economics at Malabar Christian College (MCC), Kozhikode. Jaspreet’s family members had accused the college Principal and other teachers of turning down his request to let him write the examination. He had cited domestic issues for his inability to attend classes.

A meeting of the Syndicate on Saturday decided to allow students to approach the college Principal with a special request to let them write the examination. It was pointed out that the final word on allowing students to write examinations rested on the university and not college Principals.

Malabar Christian College Principal Godwin Samraj and the teachers who had been named by the family would be asked to be present before the students’ grievance cell for a hearing on the university campus on March 9. Action would be initiated if their reply was not satisfactory.

Withdraws circular

The Syndicate decided to withdraw the controversial circular that asked students and parents to give an affidavit during college admission that the former would abstain from using drugs and liquor and that action would be taken without notice if they were found to violate it. The circular was issued following a recommendation of an internal panel. The Syndicate pointed out that the panel had no right to take decision on admission-related issues. A three-member panel had been set up to inquire into the controversy.

Board of Studies

Vice Chancellor V. Anil Kumar would address the complaints of senior teachers who had claimed that unqualified people were appointed to the Board of Studies. The decision to appoint a History professor in the Board of Studies of Political Science had been cancelled. The meeting urged around 10 teachers who threatened to quit the boards in protest to remain in their posts. Digitisation of the Pariksha Bhavan would be expedited in view of the allegations raised in a recent audit report.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cu-to-be-more-lenient-on-attendance/article31010567.ece
145,2020/03/07,AI Express cancels Kuwait flight,"Gulf nation slaps a week-long travel ban in the wake of COVID-19 scare

Air India Express cancelled its budget flight from Calicut International Airport at Karipur to Kuwait on Saturday following a week-long travel ban imposed by the Kuwait government in the wake of the COVID-19 scare.

Air India officials said all their Kuwait flights would be cancelled until further orders.

India was one of the seven countries from where passengers were banned by Kuwait. The other countries are Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.

Shocked

A section of passengers who reached Karipur on Saturday morning without being aware of the suspension of flights by the Kuwait government were sent back home by Air India officials. Several of them were in shock as they faced visa expiry threat if they could not return to Kuwait within a few days.

When Air India alerted some of its passengers about the cancellation, many others could not be contacted. Initial confusion and uncertainties soon gave way to patience as the airline and airport officials convinced the passengers at the airport.

Etihad Airways too returned its passengers who were to go to Kuwait via Abu Dhabi.

Last week, Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on Umra pilgrims from all countries across the world causing panic among thousands of passengers from Kerala.

A section of the pilgrims had to be deboarded from the flight at Karipur as the announcement about the ban on Umra passengers came when the boarding was taking place.

Similarly, Oman Air had to deport its Umra passengers while they were in transit at Muscat airport.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/75sf7z/article31011712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvFlight,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-air-india-cancels-flight-as-kuwait-slaps-travel-ban/article31010329.ece
146,2020/03/07,Parallel market bleeds gold merchants dry,"Illegal inflow has always been a concern for authorised traders in State

With gold prices hitting an all-time high and the spike in smuggling, authorised traders in the State are struggling to tackle the steep decline in sales.

While the first week of March recorded the biggest single-day surge in recent years, the price has been hovering around ₹32,000 per eight gram gold (22 Carat) for the last couple of days.

Dent in demand

Merchants say most of the customers now come for assessments or old gold sales and there is a very visible dent in demand and consumer spending. While the illegal inflow has always been a matter of concern, they also allege that a parallel market is functioning in the State, aggravating the situation.

“The market has been down for a few months and now the recent fluctuations in price has worsened the situation. Currently we are facing a 60% dip in sales and this parallel market is one main reason,” says Shajau Chirayathu, president, Kerala Gold and Silver Dealers Association.

Smuggling

According to Kerala State GST Department officials, there has been a considerable rise in smuggling cases of late and the gold bars go straight to the manufacturing units in northern districts.

“Post the hike in import duty from 10% to 12.5%, we have intercepted several consignments from nearly all parts of the State. They have agents in all districts who collect details of potential customers, mainly wedding parties. The moment halls are booked for weddings, they approach the families directly with promises of delivering home tax-free ornaments,” says an official.

He adds that the department has been keeping a close watch on regular carriers who deliver the ornaments.

“There is no big gamble involved as they can always pay the penalty and release the gold. So there are carriers who have been caught multiple times and they still do it despite strict warnings,” he adds.

Margin factor

Since the parallel market can offer a good margin to the customers, many of them opt for it. “Jewellery manufacturing has become a cottage industry in districts like Thrissur and they use Chinese machines to do the fake hallmarking. We are not talking about traditional goldsmiths, but big units that produce machine-cut ornaments and they operate without any licence,” says S. Abdul Nazar, treasurer, All Kerala Gold and Silver Merchants’ Association. Merchants also allege that enforcement agencies are turning a blind eye to such units, allowing them to thrive.

“They know a such a racket is operating in Kerala but they deliberately go easy on hubs like Thrissur and Kozhikode. A single gold bar weighing one kg can fetch the smugglers a profit of over ₹six lakh while the merchants in the organised sector are bleeding. Yet there has been no large-scale crackdown on such cartels and their illegal operations,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/upr6at/article31011811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tv-goldcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/parallel-market-bleeds-gold-merchants-allege-traders/article31009935.ece
147,2020/03/07,Birds within 1-km radius of infected areas to be culled,"Kodiyathur and Vengeri are the affected areas in Kozhikode district

All birds within one-km radius of the bird flu-infected areas in Kodiyathur grama panchayat and Vengeri in the Kozhikode Corporation limits will be culled in the coming days. This follows confirmation of the avian influenza in the State after a gap of four years.

The Animal Husbandry Department said in a release on Saturday that precautionary steps had been taken and the infection was unlikely to spread among humans. Samples of chicken in a farm at Kodiyathur were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, after a large number of the birds were found dead in a short span of time. The presence of bird flu was confirmed on Friday night.

Bird flu or avian influenza is referred to the infection of birds by H5/H7 strains of avian influenza Type A viruses that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds around the globe and can affect domestic poultry and animal species. Infected birds can shed the virus through their saliva, nasal secretions and faeces. Birds get infected when they are exposed to the virus after they are shed by those infected or through surfaces that are contaminated.

M.K. Prasad, Director, Animal Husbandry, said the areas within one-km radius of the spots from where the infection had been found would be under surveillance. A list of birds within another nine-km radius had been collected and those areas too would be under observation. Right now, the infection was likely to affect only birds, Dr. Prasad said.

Control room numbers

The department has set up a 24-hour control room with phone number 0495 2762050. The State-level numbers are 9447016132 and 7012413432. A rapid response team was set up in Kozhikode district. It would be led by K. Sindhu, District Animal Husbandry Officer, and V. Sunil Kumar, Additional Director, Animal Husbandry, would be in charge of the containment works.

148,2020/03/07,"Chicken stalls, farms closed","Sale of ornamental birds, chicken dishes banned in hotels

Functioning of chicken farms and stalls has been stopped within Kodiyathur grama panchayat and in Vengeri within the Kozhikode Corporation limits after bird flu cases were reported from there on Friday.

The sale of ornamental birds and chicken dishes in hotels too has been banned for the time being. Animal Husbandry Department officials said bird flu was being reported for the first time in Kozhikode district. Reports of illness and deaths of backyard poultry following a rise in atmospheric temperature and stress-related secondary infection, however, were being monitored for some time.

An alert was issued as the disease has a rare chance to spread among humans and the mortality and morbidity rate is high. But, M.K. Prasad, Director, Animal Husbandry, said the virus causes human infection only in rare circumstances.

Department officials said the disease did not get transmitted through consumption of cooked eggs or poultry meat. The virus will die within half an hour if exposed to 60 degrees Celsius temperature. Formalin and bleaching powder can destroy it. S.M. Sabu, Joint Director, Poultry, said the egg and meat of chicken, duck and quail could be consumed if cooked properly.

Case in Kuttanad

In 2014 and 2016, it had caused huge losses to the duck farmers of Kuttanad. No human transmission had happened on both occasions.

Migratory birds are the natural reservoirs of this virus as they may carry it to long distances. The virus can survive for days in a damp environment.

Live bird market, waterbodies, and visiting sites of migratory birds are high-risk areas. Sudden and heavy unusual rate of deaths is a warning sign. Affected birds may show respiratory difficulty, bluishness of comb and haemorrhages on non-feathered areas or they may die without any clinical signs.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/r9opqz/article31011783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TVKZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chicken-stalls-farms-closed-in-affected-areas/article31009727.ece
149,2020/03/07,Protests erupt in Kerala over Centre’s move to ban two Malayalam news channels,"Chief Minister condemns the ban; Opposition terms it fascist

The Central government’s decision to ban two Malayalam news channels for their coverage of the New Delhi riots triggered a flurry of protests in Kerala on Saturday.

Chief Minister Pinarayi condemned the move and said in a Facebook post that it reflected a dangerous trend that presaged an era of political and religious intolerance.

The Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Friday slapped a 48-hour ban on Asianet News and Media One news channels for what it described as biased coverage of the communal violence. The Centre has since lifted the ban, and the channels are back on the air.

Mr. Vijayan said an undeclared emergency prevailed in India. The Centre had infringed on independent journalism. It wanted civil society to fall in line with its divisive political agenda. The Centre had sent an unequivocal message. “Anyone who dares criticise the RSS will earn the Centre’s ire”, he said.

The Centre had cited criticism of the RSS and the Delhi police as the reasons for banning the news channels.

The Constitution guarantees citizens to air their opinion fearlessly. Hence, no entity was above criticism in a democratic polity. “Is the RSS a holy organisation that is above reproach? Is there such a rule in the country?” he asked.

Mr. Vijayan said journalists had demonstrated against the ban. However, no sound of protest had come from the association of media owners, he said. The people had a right to know what is happening in the country and journalists must inform them. By banning two media organisations, the Centre has trespassed on the rights of both groups. The RSS has a history of using intimidation as a tool to cow down opponents. It has now used it against the independent media, the judiciary and in Parliament.

The Kerala Union of Working Journalists took out a march to the General Post Office in Thiruvananthapuram to protest the ban.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Centre had shown its true fascist colours. CPM State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran and KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran also condemned the attempt to “stifle” the media.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pfzrva/article31008026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kerala-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/protests-erupt-in-kerala-over-centres-move-to-ban-two-malayalam-news-channels/article31008001.ece

151,2020/03/07,‘Kerala govt. eavesdropping on journalists’,"It’s targeting whistle-blowers who flagged graft in Police Department: Congress

The Opposition has accused the Kerala government of eavesdropping on the phones of mediapersons and leaders of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) to get information on whistle-blowers who had flagged corruption in the Police Department.

The government on Wednesday constituted a three-member team of Home Department officials to investigate the “leakage of information and documents related to a report submitted by the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) of India”.

Challenging the government to arrest him, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and Congress leader, Ramesh Chennithala, on Friday released two Home Department documents which, he said, pointed to the “entrenched corruption in the police”. The papers pertained to irregularities in the purchase of 145 patrol vehicles and a large number of multimedia projectors using Central funds for police modernisation.

He said State police chief Loknath Behera had sanctioned the pricey acquisitions by overlooking the store purchase manual rules and Central Vigilance Commission norms. The government glossed over the lapses by regularising the deal. It had let off Mr. Behera with the usual warning to follow norms in the future. Mr. Chennithala said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan appeared obliged to protect Mr. Behera.

‘Quixotic project’

Mr. Chennithala said the CAG’s report and processes that preceded it were open and transparent. The government had embarked upon a quixotic project by ordering an inquiry into “CAG leaks”. By ordering the enquiry, Mr. Vijayan had proven that his mindset was no different from that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He termed the probe fascist and retributive. Instead, the government should probe CPI(M) workers in Kochi for siphoning off funds meant for flood relief.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran said the government was fearful of more instances of police corruption tumbling out and hence had ordered the probe to intimidate journalists and civic-minded persons.

On March 10, Congress workers will lay siege to the Vizhinjam police station as part of a State-wide campaign to highlight the police corruption spotlighted by the CAG, the party said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/79ouxd/article31007151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06KRARAMESHCHENNITHALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-govt-eavesdropping-on-journalists/article31007152.ece

With the demand for drinking water already up on account of the summer, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) is making additional arrangements to ensure adequate supply for the thousands who will converge on the city for the Attukal Pongala on Monday.

The KWA has installed 1,270 temporary taps in the city in view of the festival. Arrangements for ensuring adequate water for devotees will be completed by Saturday, the KWA said.

Tanks installed in the Pongala zones will be replenished using tanker lorries. The KWA has also set up 50 showers at the ghats in the Attukal region, a KWA spokesperson said. The KWA has divided the festival region into four zones — Attukal, Fort, Chala, and Sreevarahom.

Seven hundred taps will be installed in the Attukal zone that covers Attukal, Kalippankulam, Konchiravila, Kuriathy and Manacaud wards. As many as 130 taps will be set up in the Thampanoor and Chala wards included in the Chala zone; 160 in the Fort zone covering Fort and Eanchakkal wards; and 280 taps in the Sreevarahom, Ambalathara, Kamaleswaram, Manikyavilakom, and Puthenpalli wards included in the Sreevarahom zone.

154,2020/03/07,Man arrested for filing false complaint,"Claimed gang took away lottery ticket

The police on Friday arrested a 49-year-old man who had filed a false complaint that a gang had taken away the bumper lottery ticket which had won a prize of ₹5 crore.

The police arrested Muniyan, a native of Tamil Nadu who resides at Pavangad in Kozhikode. He had filed a complaint at the Taliparamba police station that the monsoon bumper lottery ticket which won the first prize was purchased by him, and that a gang had taken the ticket from him.

He claimed his rights over the ticket ME174253, which was won by Parassinakadavu resident Ajith in the draw conducted on July 18 last year.

The accused, in his statement, claimed that he had bought the winning ticket from Parassinikadavu on June 16 and had written his name and mobile number on the ticket. However, his ticket was taken by the gang when he visited Parassinikadavu again on June 29, he said.

The Taliparamba police verified the ticket with the help of the forensic department and found that the claims made by Muniyan were false. There were no names or numbers found on the ticket as claimed by him.

The police summoned him to the station where he was later arrested. He was charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for filing a false complaint, and misleading and cheating the police. The police are investigating the reason for filing the false complaint and also whether there was any racket behind him.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/man-arrested-for-filing-false-complaint/article31005280.ece
155,2020/03/07,Survey on for building dam on Kabani’s tributary,"Project to use 30 tmcft of water allotted to Kerala by Cauvery tribunal

The Kabani basin under the Cauvery division of the Water Resources Department is gearing up to construct a dam across the Moolithodu rivulet, a tributary of the Kabani, in Edavaka grama panchayat, to tap a small percentage of water awarded by the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal a few years ago.

The department has begun a geographical survey for the project and it would be completed in a month, K.V. Unnikrishnan, executive engineer (Cauvery division ), told The Hindu. The project envisages collecting 0.3 tmcft of water after constructing an earthen dam across the Moolithodu rivulet to irrigate 1,411 hectares of land in Thondarnadu, Edavaka, and Vellamunda grama panchayats in the district, Mr. Unnikrishnan said.

A meeting of the residents in the area would be convened soon to clarify doubts regarding the project, he said. A detailed project report would be prepared after a survey on the topographical, geological, geophysical, hydrological and environmental impact of the project. The report would be submitted to the Central Water commission for its final approval of the project, he said.

The tribunal had awarded 30 tmcft of water to the State from the three river basins of the Cauvery such as the Kabani in Wayanad (21 tmcft), the Bhavani at Attappady in Palakkad (6 tmcft) and the Pambar in Idukki (3 tmcft) but, the government was yet to formulate any projects to utilise the water allotted to the State.

As every year, 96 tmcft of water flows into the Cauvery from its catchment area in Wayanad, the government plans to construct dams across seven streams in the district such as the Kadamanthodu, Thondar, Chundalipuzha, Noolpuzha, Kallampathy, Thirunelly, and Peringottupuzha to utilise the water allotted by the tribunal.

The proposals for two dams in Wayanad across the Chundali and Kadamanthodu was frozen a few years ago after a public protest. However, the government is adopting measures to implement the Kadmanthodu project with the support of the public in the wake of the desertification process that has started in grama panchayats such as Mullankolly, Pulpally, and Poothadi on the Kerala-Karnataka border.

The Banasura Sagar dam, the largest earthen dam in the country and the second largest in Asia, in the Kabani river basin was built to support the Kakkayam hydroelectric power project. It was also aimed at providing water for irrigation but the target is yet to be achieved even after ₹53 crore was spent on the project. The full potential of the Karapuzha irrigation project is also yet to be tapped owing to technical reasons.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sn2wqe/article31005257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvwysurveyforthondarproject,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/survey-on-for-building-dam-on-kabanis-tributary/article31005258.ece
156,2020/03/07,KSEB reconnects power supply to DDE office,"Power restoration after C. Ravindranath writes to M.M. Mani

The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) reconnected power supply to the office of the Deputy Director of Education (DDE) here on Friday morning following pressures and high-level intervention.

The board had disconnected power supply to the office on Thursday, citing non-payment of a bill of ₹17,068 in arrears as the reason. The KSEB superintendent here had spurned a request by DDE K.S. Kusumam for condoning the delay in the payment of bill arrears.

M.M. Mani, Minister for Power, ordered reconnection of power supply after a request by Minister for Education C. Ravindranath. The Minister had pointed out that power supply was essential as the DDE’s office was gearing up for the SSLC examinations beginning on March 10.

Employee organisations of the ruling party too intervened fearing that their rival organisations would exploit the “power faceoff” to tarnish the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. An employee organisation of the Opposition Congress had begun to collect funds to pay the power bill arrears of the DDE office.

KSEB officials reconnected the power supply before the office started functioning on Friday morning, and thus thwarted the move by the employees owing allegiance to the Congress.

Meanwhile, a section of employees alleged that the power disconnection was a vindictive move by a KSEB officer with allegiance to the Congress. They alleged that several other government offices had similar arrears to pay, but the KSEB had not taken any drastic action against them.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kseb-reconnects-power-supply-to-dde-office/article31005248.ece
157,2020/03/07,Payyambalam beach declared plastic-free zone,"Those found disposing of plastic in the area to be fined

In a major step to promote healthy tourism and to create awareness among the people, the Payyambalam region will now be treated as a plastic-free zone.

Utilising the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) fund of ₹30 lakh, projects would be prepared jointly by the Tourism Promotion Council, Suchitwa Mission, the district administration, and Kannur Corporation in order to implement the project.

These decisions were taken at a meeting chaired by District Collector T.V. Subhash here on Friday. He said it had been decided that the sale, distribution and use of all types of plastic and non-recyclable plastic materials would be prohibited in the area.

Plastic carrybags, non-woven carrybags, plastic flex, banner, plates, cup, straw, spoon, bottles, pouches, flags, sheets, cooling film, decorative items, and other plastic materials would be banned in the region.

The Collector said it was also decided to impose fines on those found disposing of plastic in the area. In addition to this, stringent action would be taken to identify waste depositors in the project area. The proposal was aimed at addressing complaints that people from outside were dumping plastic waste here.

Surveillance cameras

To make the project more effective, it was also proposed to install surveillance cameras at various places. Alternative products for use in place of plastic would be made available for visitors. The project would provide better facilities to visitors, including an additional toilet, the Collector said.

Merchants should ensure that there were no plastic cups when selling items such as ice cream. Steps would be taken with the help of the corporation to control traffic on the beach premises.

Besides, a team would be constituted with the support of Kudumbashree to administer the project. A team of 10 persons would be selected for this and they would also be given special training.

Payyambalam has the largest number of visitors on Saturdays and Sundays. The scheme also seeks to address parking problems.

The decision to merge the Malappuram District Cooperative Bank with the Kerala Bank was stayed by the Kerala High Court on Friday. It was on a petition filed by Abdul Majeed, president, Thuvvoor Panchayat Cooperative Bank, that the court issued the order.

The case will be considered on March 23. Though all the district cooperative banks were merged with the Kerala Bank, the Malappuram bank could not be merged as the resolution to this effect could not be passed.

All-party meet mooted

Special Correspondent writes from Thiruvananthapuram: A meeting of the association of primary agriculture cooperative societies here on Friday charted out a series of steps to gauge the impact of various Central laws on the cooperative sector in the State.

The meeting, held at the behest of Cooperation Minister Kadakampally Surendran, decided to urge Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to hold an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. It has also been proposed to send an all-party delegation to Delhi to submit a memorandum to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on the proposal to do away with the income tax concessions enjoyed by the cooperative sector.

Chief Minister, Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday said that the government was considering the long-pending demand for the creation of a new district with Mayiladuthurai as its headquarters, by bifurcating Nagapattinam district.

Speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Nagapattinam Government Medical College in Orathur near Nagapattinam, he said that one of the long-pending demands from the people and elected representatives of Nagapattinam district has been fulfilled with the laying of the foundation stone for a medical college.

The other demand to create a separate Revenue District with Mayiladuthurai as headquarters was under the active consideration of the government, he said. “Handlooms Minister O.S. Manian and the MLAs of Mayiladuthurai and Sirkazhi have been pressing the demand ever since the new government under my leadership took over the regime after the demise of Puratchi Thalaivi Amma,” he added.

Stating that the setting up of a medical college would help the people of Nagapattinam district avail the best medical treatment, Mr. Palaniswami listed out various projects implemented throughout the State to improve the healthcare services offered to the people of Tamil Nadu through the network of government hospitals and primary health centres.

Thanking the Prime Minister and Union Health Minister for granting permission to start 11 medical colleges at one go in Tamil Nadu, the Chief Minister said the State government was pursuing with vigour the Godavari-Cauvery river linking project proposal, to find a lasting solution to the persistent problem of shortage of water for irrigation in the delta region.

Speaking on the occasion, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said that the long-pending demand of the people of Nagapattinam district to have a medical college in their district would soon become a reality.

Thanking the Chief Minister and the Health Minister for the setting up of the Medical College in Orathur, Mr. Manian said the hospital would have 750 beds and would have an intake of 150 students per year in the MBBS programme. The Medical College-cum-hospital is to come up at 60.04 acres at Orathur at a total cost of ₹367 crore and the admission for the medical course at this college was likely to commence from the 2021 academic year itself.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dwoe54/article31008633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MARTH-MEDCOLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/government-considering-bifurcation-of-nagapattinam-district-says-tamil-nadu-chief-minister/article31008635.ece
160,2020/03/07,Southern Railway gets net metering nod for its 4MW rooftop solar project,"The solar projects have been planned at 22 locations, including railway stations, across the State.

Southern Railway has received approval for net metering connections for its 4 MW rooftop solar projects across 22 locations, including railway stations across the State.

It had filed a petition with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) seeking a direction to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to grant connectivity and net metering to is projects as per the State’s old solar energy policy in 2012.

The requirement of the solar roof top plant capacity varied from 50 kwp to 1000 kwp in various locations of Tamil Nadu which consist of both HT / LT service connections.

The projects were to be set up at Chengalpattu, Katpadi, Arakkonam, Tambaram, Chennai Egmore, Jolarpettai, Tiruchi, Villupuram, Madurai, Virudhunagar and Coimbatore railway stations, among other locations like Moore Market Complex and Basin Bridge Junction.

Southern Railway said it had approached Tangedco for extending the net metering facility for the project. However, its chief engineer had stated that the net metering facility can only be available for LT consumers.

“Tangedco’s response of not allowing net metering for HT III tariff category service connections is complete insubordination of the TNERC’s order. Not allowing the net-metering for solar projects at HT supply points will lead to poor investment from developers which will finally hamper the development of roof top solar panel arrangement. It is a national loss, it pointed out in the petition.

The TNERC noted that Southern Railway had filed its petition and the hearings were held before the issue of Tamil Nadu’s new solar policy 2019, in which there is no explanation about net metering for HT consumers. It directed Tangedco to provide the metering connectivity to the 4 MW projects.

However, the TNERC said that future cases would be decided based on its order from time to time. If the net meters are not available with the Tangedco, Southern Railway might be permitted to procure them as per the specifications, it added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/southern-railway-gets-net-metering-nod-for-its-4mw-rooftop-solar-project/article31008534.ece
161,2020/03/07,Tamil Nadu Chief Minister plants seedlings in paddy field in Tiruvarur district,"Edappadi K. Palaniswami was on a tour of the delta regions, when he got down from his vehicle in Siddhamalli and planted seedlings alongside farm workers

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who often proclaims to be a farmer, sought to give a brief demonstration of his skills as a farm hand by joining a group of labourers in transplanting paddy seedlings in Siddhamalli in Tiruvarur district on Saturday.

On a day-long tour of the delta region, Mr. Palaniswami, while heading to Nagapattinam, got down from his vehicle in Siddhamalli and walked straight to a paddy field where farm workers were transplanting paddy nurseries.

After exchanging pleasantries with them, the Chief Minister folded his dhoti to get into the ankle-deep slush and started planting paddy seedlings alongside the workers. Watched by Food Minister R. Kamaraj and his security guards, who too followed the Chief Minister into the field, Mr. Palaniswami went about the task for a few minutes. Impressed by his deft work, some of women workers stood in awe and applauded the Chief Minister.

After spending about 10 minutes in the field, Mr. Palaniswami washed his legs and hands using the water gushing from an agricultural pumpset nearby before resuming his journey.

Earlier, in a brief address at a public reception in Needamangalam, Mr. Palaniswami affirmed that his government would stand by farmers and do everything to meet their expectations. The enactment of the law making the Cauvery delta an agricultural zone was intended to protect the livelihood of farmers and farm workers, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/74pmx0/article31007899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MARTH-CMSaplingjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-chief-minister-transplants-seedlings-in-paddy-field-in-tiruvarur-district/article31007735.ece
162,2020/03/07,Tamil Nadu’s Guidance Bureau restructured to bring in more investments,"A 40-member team that has MBA graduates, legal experts and analysts, is working at the Guidance’s head office with a mandate to find potential investors and convert MoUs into actual investments

Guidance, the nodal agency of Tamil Nadu government for investment promotion and single-window facilitation, has restructured its operations to bring in more investment proposals into the State.

Apart from creating country-specific desks and sector-specific desks, the department has brought in the best brains from the industry in various roles. A 40-member young team including MBA graduates, legal experts and analysts is working at the Guidance’s, (formerly known as the Guidance Bureau), head office in Egmore, with a mandate to find potential investors and at the same time convert Memorandums of Understanding that were signed during the two Global Investors Meet (GIM) into actual investments.

“We have set up a matrix structure with desks which will look into country-specific investor requirements and sector-specific needs. We have a buddy system for each sector – this means each sector will have 2-3 people who will track sector-specific investments and help companies with getting clearances and scouting for land,” Neeraj Mittal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Guidance Tamil Nadu, said. He added that the young team has been cherry-picked through an interview conducted by the department. “We had one government official and three people from the industry in the interview panel. This helped us pick candidates who have a passion to bring in investments,” he said adding that the Chief Minister is reviewing all these activities.

Another senior government official said that Chief Minister Edappadi. K.Palaniswami has asked the Industries Department and Guidance to pro-actively participate in all events nationally and globally. “Teams are being sent out to sell Tamil Nadu as an investment destination,” he added.

Over the last two months, the State government has ensured that deals that were inked during the two GIMs commence production and in some cases, they have laid the foundation stones too. Industrialists from across the State also said that officials from the State government are calling them for meetings and asking them what best can be done for businesses to run smoothly and for expansion.

P. Ravichandran, president, Danfoss India, said, “They are very investor-centric and there is renewed focus to grow and expand into new sectors including promoting southern districts as attractive destinations for investments. The State government has made significant steps in not only re-branding the Guidance Bureau but has undertaken several measures to attract new investments.”

Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, president of The Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), said that for several States in India, mind-share is greater than market share. “In Tamil Nadu, despite being the second-largest contributor to the GDP in India and growing at a higher clip than the national average, mind-share continues to trail market share.” he said. “In this context, curating a series of investment-linked events, meetings with diplomats from dozens of countries, visits of State leaders to different countries creates a drum beat of positive mind-share, locally and globally. In addition, setting up of country-specific platforms will help provide customised attention to different profiles of investors and help find solutions to their challenges. Collectively, these initiatives by Guidance, Tamil Nadu should significantly boost mind-share which is quite important given that every State in the world is competing for the same opportunity pie,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadus-guidance-bureau-restructured-to-bring-in-more-investments/article31007565.ece

166,2020/03/07,RS polls: AIADMK keeps everyone guessing,"A section in the party is pitching for nominating a candidate from ‘smaller’ communities

With the selection of two veterans, K.P. Munusamy and M. Thambi Durai, being strongly considered by the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for two of the three Rajya Sabha seats, the spotlight is on who will be the third nominee.

Several names are doing the rounds within the party as allies — the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) and the New Justice Party (NJP) — are said to be pressuring Chief Minister and the party co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami for the third slot.

Several contenders

DMDK’s deputy general secretary L.K. Sudheesh, TMC’s chief G.K. Vasan and NJP founder A.C. Shanmugam, who contested on the AIADMK symbol in Vellore last year, are the aspirants.

Among those who are in contention within the AIADMK are V. Maitreyan, P.H. Manoj Pandian and P. Venugopal, former Members of Parliament; Natham R. Viswanathan and Gokula Indira, who were Ministers in the Jayalalithaa Cabinet during 2011-16, and J.C.D. Prabhakar, who was elected twice from Villivakkam Assembly constituency.

Vijila Sathyananth, whose term is getting over as Rajya Sabha member, is making a strong bid for renomination.

Apart from these names, Mr. Palaniswami and the AIADMK’s co-coordinator and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, will have to consider many factors such as caste, ability to be resourceful at the time of Assembly elections, track record and oratorical skills in English, while choosing the nominees.

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had adopted such a yardstick while picking her candidates either for the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. This explains the repeated selection of Mr. Thambi Durai, Dr. Maitreyan, Mr Manoj Pandian and Dr. Venugopal.

Some members are asking questions whether the party is going to get benefited by choosing members of dominant communities such as Kongu Vellalars and Vanniyars.

They are saying that these two communities were not backing the party as solidly as they did in the past. They place Mukkalathors too in the same league as in the case of the other two, despite the community getting accommodated “adequately” within the party hierarchy.

The case that these members of the party are making is that enough opportunities should be given to communities which are numerically small.

There are reports that leaders of such communities are being wooed by the Dravida Munentra Kazhagam (DMK) and admirers of actor Rajinikanth, who is planning to launch a political party soon.

‘Small castes rewarded’

Countering the argument of this section of the party those who support the present leadership of the party recall the choice of A. Mohammedjan and N. Chandrasegharan for two RS seats in July last year to underscore that even now, representatives of smaller communities continue to be “rewarded.”

The AIADMK’s decision to field Mr. Mohammedjan, former Minister and a Muslim from the Vellore district, had to be seen against the backdrop that it was being labelled as “B team” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Chandrasegharan belongs to the Arundathiyar community a marginalised group within Scheduled Castes (SC).

Even as the debate goes on within the party, according to a senior leader who says that around 100 persons are keen on securing nomination for the three seats, the final decision on three candidates will be out in a couple of days.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/b9vwzv/article31005204.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THMARCHAIADMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rs-polls-aiadmk-keeps-everyone-guessing/article31005205.ece
167,2020/03/07,State has powers to decide on hydrocarbon projects: Centre,"‘Only procedure to grant environment clearance has changed’

The Centre has only changed the procedure for grant of environmental clearance for hydrocarbon exploration projects and the power to decide on whether to allow a particular project in a particular region remained with the State government, Babul Supriyo, Union Minister of State for Environment and Forest, said in Parliament on Friday.

The Minister made the assertion in response to a query raised in the Lok Sabha by Dayanidhi Maran (DMK) seeking to know whether the Centre decided to issue environmental clearance for hydrocarbon projects without conducting public hearings and the impact of the decision in Neduvasal village in Pudukottai district, where the villagers had stalled an exploration project through a mass protest in 2017.

The MP’s query comes in the wake of stiff opposition from farmers and activists to the Centre’s recent move to amend the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2006, exempting oil and gas companies from having to seek environmental clearance for exploratory drilling. Clarifying on the amendment, Mr. Supriyo said the Centre had only re-categorised on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration projects from Category ‘A’ to Category ‘B2.’

Category ‘A’ projects

However, on-shore and off-shore oil and gas development and production remained under Category ‘A’ and would require public hearings before grant of environmental clearance. Clearance has to be obtained for any on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration project from the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), which is under the purview of the State governments.

“Therefore, the power to take the decision, as to whether allow any particular project in any particular region would remain with the State Government. Further, such projects are required to obtain consent under the Air and Water Acts from State Pollution Control Boards,” Mr. Supriyo said.

His Ministry, in response to the concerns over “the agricultural zone in Cauvery belt” raised by the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, had clarified that the requirement of environmental clearance still remained and only the procedure for grant of the environmental clearance had been modified.

It has been informed that the State government had the power to take the final decision whether to allow any particular project in any particular region, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/q9mq82/article31005195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THTNBABULSUPRIYO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-has-powers-to-decide-on-hydrocarbon-projects-centre/article31005196.ece

170,2020/03/07,‘Stalin conveyed decision on phone’,"Alagiri says Congress cadre expect DMK to reciprocate its support to Kanimozhi

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri on Friday said DMK president M K Stalin had informed him over phone about nominating DMK party members for three Rajya Sabha seats and promised the Congress leader that it would be given a seat during the subsequent biennial election.

With cadres of the Congress upset over the DMK’s “snub” in the recently held rural local body polls and the Rajya Sabha nominations, Mr. Alagiri told a press conference that Mr. Stalin had explained his party’s position to him.

Congress cadres had expected a nomination to the Rajya Sabha since the party supported the DMK candidates although there was no power-sharing arrangement during 2006-11 to ensure the election of Kanimozhi and Tiruch Siva to the Rajya Sabha, he said.

Petrochem corridor

Mr. Alagiri was of the view that setting up a petrochemical corridor will enhance Tamil Nadu’s economy and the State must learn the best practices from States like Gujarat and developed nations in setting up petrochemical industries.

“This corridor will provide lakhs of jobs to the youth of the State, if it is set up in the Cuddalore-Nagapattinam belt, it will lead to another National Highway being laid, a two-line broad-gauge railway line with electricity…it will benefit the districts,” he said.

172,2020/03/07,Security tightened for top BJP leaders,"Police told to take action on hate messages circulating in social media

Security has been stepped up for senior BJP and ruling party leaders in Tamil Nadu after the State intelligence perceived a threat to their safety from the ongoing protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. All city/district police have been alerted and told to activate their intelligence machinery to keep tabs on religious fundamentalists who had come under adverse notice in the recent past.

According to police sources, intelligence interception of certain messages pointed to some outfits or activists planning to attack senior BJP leaders. This input was communicated to the politicians and their security revised taking the level of threat perception into consideration, police sources said on Friday.

After the incidents in Coimbatore where a Hindu Munnani leader was attacked a couple of days ago and the alleged attempt to cause an explosion in a mosque using a petrol bomb, tension between pro- and anti-CAA protesters escalated resulting in an uneasy calm in the western districts.

Social media

“We have asked the cyber crime teams to intensify vigil on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and prevent the spread of hate messages. Firm action will be taken against any person posting or sharing any message that has the potential to cause communal disharmony or promote hatred between two groups of people.

After preserving evidence, we will take steps to delete such posts and register cases against the accused persons,” a senior police officer said. The protests over CAA had taken communal turn with the agitators divided on the lines of religion. “This does not seem to be a protest against the legislation any more. People belonging to two religions and others supporting them respectively have taken a stand for or against the Act,” the officer contended.

Border security

Vigil had been enhanced along the shoreline by the Coastal Security Group in coordination with the Navy and Coast Guard besides the local police strengthening patrolling and vehicle checks at check-posts on roads leading to neighbouring States.

“Adequate security arrangements are in place to prevent any intrusion of anti-social elements into the State. Security has also been tightened at vital installations and quick reaction teams positioned at vantage points,” the officer added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/leuop9/article31005077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THPOLICECHECKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/security-tightened-for-top-bjp-leaders/article31005078.ece
173,2020/03/07,High Court keeps in abeyance its order on CAA protests,"All stakeholders to be heard before taking a final decision

The Madras High Court on Friday kept in abeyance till Wednesday an order passed by it on Thursday directing the police not to allow either pro- or anti-CAA protesters to block a public road in Tiruppur much to the inconvenience of schoolchildren and other users of the road.

A Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy took the decision after a battery of senior counsel, representing a host of anti-CAA protesters, informed the judges about the antecedents of a litigant on whose petition the orders were passed on Thursday and his “ill intentions.”

Senior counsel R. Vagai said the litigant K. Gopinath, an advocate and president of Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam (HMK), had not conformed to the court’s PIL rules which require every litigant to disclose that he/she was aware of similar petitions pending in the court.

She claimed that he had suppressed the fact that many other similar cases were pending in the court.

Also stating that his antecedents were questionable, she said his outfit HMK had reportedly announced a bounty of ₹1 crore for Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalan’s head for the latter’s remarks against Hindu temples.

The senior counsel urged the court to hear all stakeholders before passing any orders on protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 and to keep its order in abeyance till then.

Another designated senior counsel M. Ajmal Khan too contended that courts should not entertain litigations aimed at stifling democratic dissent.

A group of other advocates, including N.G.R. Prasad, Sudha Ramalingam, T. Mohan, B. Poongkuzhali and Raja Mohammed, urged the court to permit them to make their representations on behalf of impleading petitioners who included Henri Tiphagne of People’s Watch, a human rights organisation based in Madurai.

The lawyers said the orders passed by the court on Thursday had been used by the police in Madurai and other districts across the State to forcibly disperse even those who had been protesting peacefully.

Agreeing to hear all lawyers at length on Wednesday, along with other PIL petitions that had been filed in the court seeking a direction to curtail unauthorised protests being held in various parts of the State, the judges said their Thursday’s order should not be given effect to by the police till then.

Police free to act

However, at the instance of the State government pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan, the judges clarified that irrespective of the court order having been kept in abeyance, the police were at liberty to proceed in accordance with law.

“We are of the view that in as much as a larger issue is involved, it would be appropriate to take up the matter and pass a detailed order touching upon the right to indulge in protest and to occupy a place chosen by the protesters sans permission as against the interest of the general public,” the judges added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-keeps-in-abeyance-its-order-on-caa-protests/article31005067.ece
174,2020/03/07,HC spares 72-year-old of contempt proceedings,"He had written a letter to Registrar General with false claims

Justice S. Vaidyanathan of the Madras High Court has spared a 72-year-old man of facing contempt of court proceedings for having written a letter to the Registrar General of the court complaining that his daughter was subjected to medical examination by the High Court without her consent in a case related to divorce proceedings initiated by her husband.

Making it clear that the woman had consented for medical examination in the presence of her parents, the judge said: “The contents of the letter are baseless and though such false statement is offensive, entitling this court to initiate criminal contempt against the father of the woman, this court at this stage does not want to do so taking his age into account.”

“It is no doubt true that it is his primary duty to safeguard the interest of his daughter. At the same time, it should always be remembered that truth alone triumphs and a man at the age of 72 should be a role model to youngsters,” the judge said and spared the septuagenarian from undergoing the arduous task of facing criminal contempt proceedings.

The judge pointed out that ideally the High Court transfers divorce cases from one district to another considering the convenience of women. However, insofar as the present case was concerned, the woman was working in a nationalised bank in Chennai, but her father filed a petition to get the case transferred from Chennai to Thoothukudi.

During the course of hearing, the judge found out that the main grievance of the husband was that the wife was under medication for some mental illness and that fact was suppressed before marriage. However, the woman told the judge that she was not suffering from any illness and agreed to undergo medical examination. Hence, the judge referred them to an expert at Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) which gave a report confirming that she was schizophrenic. In the meanwhile, the woman’s father wrote to the Registrar General complaining about the entire process and that letter was placed before the judge for appropriate orders.

After pardoning the author, the judge dismissed the transfer petition on the ground that the woman’s father could not seek transfer of the case and directed the Family Court in Chennai to dispose of the divorce case within a year by taking into account the report submitted by a doctor attached to SCARF.

The judge made it clear that at the time of recording the evidence of the woman, her father should not be allowed to be present either in the open court or in the chambers of the presiding officer of the Family Court. If the woman refuses to tender evidence without her father’s presence, an adverse inference should be drawn against her, he ordered.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-spares-72-year-old-of-contempt-proceedings/article31004896.ece
175,2020/03/07,DMK general secretary Anbazhagan no more,"Mr. Anbazhagan had served as MLA for nine terms and as Lok Sabha MP for one term.

K. Anbazhagan, DMK’s general secretary for 43 years, four-time Minister and a close friend of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, died in the wee hours of March 7. He was 97 and is survived by two daughters and a son born through his first wife. He had served as MLA for nine terms and as Lok Sabha MP for one term.

Mr. Anbazhagan, one of the stalwarts of the Dravidian movement, was admitted to the Apollo Hospitals in Chennai on February 24 following age- related health complications. His condition remained critical ever since in view of his old age.

An academic-turned-politician, Mr. Anbazhagan first became the general secretary of the DMK in May 1977 after then incumbent V.R. Neduchezhian had parted ways to initially form his own party before eventually merging it with the AIADMK founded by M.G. Ramachandran. He continued in the position till his death. He was also the first secretary of the DMK’s trade union movement.

Perasiriyar (Professor), as he was known in Tamil Nadu, had joined as a lecturer of Tamil in the Pachaiyappa’s College and served for 13 years, between 1944 and 1957.

Born Ramaiah in Kattur near Mayiladuthurai, he changed his name as Mr. Anbazhagan and studied Tamil in Annamalai University in Chidambaram. His father M. Kalyanasundaram, was a Congressman and even ran a khadi store in Mayiladuthurai but quit the Congress along with Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, founder of the Dravidar Kazhagam. He shifted his base to Chidambaram to facilitate good education for Anbazhagan and his brothers.

“I had read Kudiyarasu run by Periyar and Navasakthi by Thiru.Vi.Ka even when I was 10 years old,” Mr. Anbazhagan had once recalled.

Also Read When Anbazhagan was given a back seat

He first met Karunanidhi in 1942 while accompanying C.N. Annadurai, who later founded the DMK, to Tiruvarur.

“Anna wanted to see Kalaignar (Karunanidhi), who had penned the short story Ilamaipali for the Dravida Nadu magazine. He also advised him to concentrate on his studies,” Mr. Anbazhagan had reminicised in an interview.

In Annamalai University, he was the favourite student of Tamil scholar Ka.Su. Pillai and his classmate Nedunchezhian. As the secretary of the Literary Association he first invited Annadurai to speak in the university and he spoke on Athoram (Beside the river). Impressed with the speech Anna was asked to deliver a speech on, The world of old and new.

Close associate of Periyar

Though a close associate of Periyar, who stayed at his parent’s house in Chidambaram and Annadurai and despite being actively involved in the Dravidar Kazhagam during his student days, his job as a college teacher prevented him from openly identifying himself with the DMK. He resigned his job to contest in the 1957 Assembly elections and was elected from the Egmore constituency.

He lost the election in 1962 and was elected to the Legislative Council. In 1967 he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Tiruchengode constituency. Though after Anna’s death he was among those who opposed the leadership of Karunanidhi, subsequently he patched up and both of them remained close till their last days.

“I accepted his leadership not because he has become the Chief Minister. There is no one in the party who has the energy to match his capacity. Tamil Nadu needs a leader who has talent and commitment,” he later said. Mr. Anbazhagan became the Health Minister in the DMK cabinet (designated number 3) in March 1971 and held the post till the dismissal of the M. Karunanidhi government in January 1976.

He was elected from the Purasawalkam Assembly constituency in 1971, 1977 and 1980. He won from the Anna Nagar constituency in 1989 and became the Education Minister in the DMK Cabinet, a portfolio he retained during 1996-2001. He won in the Harbour Assembly constituency in 1996, 2001 and 2006. He held the portfolio of Finance during 2006-2011. He lost the Assembly elections in 2011 and opted out from electoral politics in 2016 citing old age.

During the last term of the M.G. Ramachandran government, in December 1986, the Assembly adopted a motion expelling Mr. Anbazhagan and nine of his colleagues from the House for having burnt excerpts of the Constitution of India as part of the party's opposition the Centre’s move to “impose” Hindi in the Press Information Bureau offices.

Endorsed Stalin

Mr. Anbazhagan had publicly endorsed the elevation of Karunanidhi’s son M.K. Stalin in the party organisation at various stages.

Well-read and delved deep into Tamil literature, he rejected religion, even though he admired Vadalur Vallalar Ramalinga Adigal. “If I need a religion, I have no hesitation in embracing Vallalar,” he once said.

“Unlike the leaders of the Dravidian Movement, who have reservations about Bharathiar, Anbazhagan admired the poet and appreciated his scholarship,” said K. Thirunavukkarasu, the historian of the Dravidian Movement.

Mr. Anbazhagan declared himself as follows: “First I am human being; secondly, I am Anbazhagan; thirdly a rationalist, fourthly the younger brother of Anna, fifthly the friend of Kalaignar. This will continue forever and only death can destroy the order.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gs5dgn/article31006075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Anbazhaganjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-general-secretary-anbazhagan-no-more/article31004456.ece
176,2020/03/07,"‘Thalaivi’, ‘Mookuthi Amman’, ‘Raangi’: 10 women-centric Tamil films to root for this Women's Day 2020","This International Women’s Day on Sunday, we arc the spotlight on what promises to be an interesting year for Kollywood, as a slew of films headlined by women get ready for release. Small victories, but we’ll take them

Thalaivi

Kangana Ranaut’s long-awaited return to Tamil cinema comes with the Jayalalithaa biopic, that is directed by Vijay and armed with an army of A-listers as cast and crew. While the first looks and trailers have created polarizing opinions, with a subject as heavy-duty as the former actor-politician’s life and a performer at the peak of her powers like Kangana, this should be the mother.... erm, amma of all biopics.

Soorpanagai

The first look of this film, starring Regina Cassandra, was just released and received some positive comments from the film fraternity. The buzz is that Regina has a strong women-centric role in this mystery drama that’s a Tamil-Telugu bilingual and directed by Caarthick Raju. Set against a period backdrop, this team is reportedly shooting in some never-before-seen lush locales in Tamil Nadu.

Ponmagal Vandhal

Jyotika has been doing some interesting roles in her second innings. And 2020 will see her play a laywer in Ponmagal Vandhal. Directed by Frederick and supposed to be a thriller, PV, which is slated to hit screens soon, has been produced by Suriya’s 2D Entertainment.

Mookuthi Amman

Christened the ‘Lady Superstar’ of Tamil cinema, Nayanthara plays an ‘Amman’ in this upcoming film that has been directed by RJ Balaji and NJ Saravanan. The film marks RJ Balaji’s debut as a director and is slated to be a ‘devotional film with a twist’. We’re waiting. Are you?

Nishabdam (Silence)

If not for anything, fans of Anushka Shetty will just be happy to see her on screen again after a gap of over two years. That the talented actress can carry off any role isn’t a debate any more: her repertoire of diverse work speaks for itself. But it does remain a mystery why she doesn’t take on more projects. With Silence, a horror-mystery, where she plays a speech and hearing-impaired character, the Baahubali star will showcase a wide range of her potent acting skills — and we couldn’t be more thrilled for her.

Raangi

Trisha’s had middling success with female-centric movies in her career, with the likes of her Jessies and Jaanus in dramas faring much better. However, the actor’s 2020 looks primed to kill: first up is Raangi in which she plays a modern-day journalist, on a mission to take down a nefarious operation. She also has the Tamil remake of NH10 in Garjanai, and an untitled venture she headlines with Petta co-star Simran! What’s not to love?

Penguin

Ever since Mahanati, Keerthy Suresh’s career graph has climbed higher and higher. Her deserved National Award for the movie only cemented her place as one of south India’s best performers, capable of headlining a movie on her own, and set the box-office ringing. Penguin, produced by Karthik Subbaraj, looks to further that trend; very little is known about the Eashvar Kartic directorial, except that the poster shows Keerthy as a pregnant woman. Murder-mystery? Horror-thriller? A romantic vacation in the woods gone wrong? Only time will tell.

Paris Paris

Part of the long-mooted four southern remakes of Queen, the Tamil version sees the formidable Kajal Aggarwal step into the shoes of Kangana’s now iconic character of Rani Mehra from the original. A tried-and-tested storyline, an experienced director in Ramesh Aravind, and in Kajal, a bonafide star who finally wants to prove that she can make a film work without a leading man alongside her: Expectations are high.

Adho Andha Paravai Pola

Post Aadai, Amala Paul is a force to reckon with. In this film, directed by Vinoth KR, Amala gets all adventurous and explores a forest where mystery awaits her. There have been certain delays in its release, and we’re hoping they get cleared soon.

Velvet Nagaram

Her Velvet Nagaram has just hit screens, and Varalaxmi already has a couple of films, including Krack, that she has a prominent role in. Slowly moving away from heroine and character to roles to playing the lead, this sassy actor is sure looking at a busy 2020 up ahead.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/p2r9fx/article31009677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/women,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/thalaivi-mookuthi-amman-raangi-10-women-centric-tamil-films-to-root-for-this-womens-day-2020/article31009681.ece

Refuting rumours that actor Ajith was finally going to join social media officially, his legal team has issued a public notice stating that a fake newsletter was doing the rounds yesterday, and that the Valimai star would not be appearing on any social media platform.

“It has come to our notice that there is a letter dated March 6, 2020 purportedly written by Ajith, which has been posted on social media stating that he has decided to re-join social media and would have an official account. It is shocking to note that the said letter has been printed on a fake letterhead with our client’s name and bears his forged signature,” reads the letter from Ajith’s team.

It adds, “Our client has issued a public notice in the past and has on repeated occasions maintained that he does not have any social media accounts and that he does not have or support any official fan page on any stream of social media.”

The actor is currently shooting in Chennai for H.Vinoth’s Valimai, that is produced by Boney Kapoor. With two more schedules of the film remaining, Valimai is expected to be a Diwali release.

180,2020/03/07,Woody Allen’s memoir ‘Apropos of Nothing’ cancelled by Hachette Book Group,"The publisher dropped the project following the director’s estranged children, Ronan Farrow and Dylan Farrow, condemning the plan, and a protest by the company’s employees

Woody Allen’s autobiography was dropped by publisher Hachette Book Group following the controversial director’s estranged children, Ronan Farrow and Dylan Farrow, condemning the plan, and a protest by the company’s employees.

“The decision to cancel Mr. Allen’s book was a difficult one,” Hachette said in a statement on Twitter on Friday, reports eonline.com.

“At HBG, we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books. As publishers, we make sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard.”

Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette, announced on Monday that his book Apropos of Nothing would be released in April.

Ronan, whose 2019 book about sexual misconduct by men in the workplace, Catch and Kill, was published by another imprint of the group, slammed the decision on Twitter a day later.

He said his sister “has never been contacted to respond to any denial or mischaracterisation of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Woody Allen”.

Ronan had condemned his father publicly after Dylan, one of Woody and ex Mia Farrow’s adopted children, in 2014 accused the director of past sexual abuse.

He has denied Dylan’s allegations and has never been charged with a sex crime.

“It’s wildly unprofessional, in multiple obvious directions, for Hachette to behave this way,” Ronan wrote in his tweet.

“But it also shows a lack of ethics and compassion for victims of sexual abuse, regardless of any personal connection or breach of trust here. I’ve encouraged Hachette, out of respect for its readers, authors, and reputation, to conduct a thorough fact check of Woody Allen’s account, in particular any claim that implies my sister is not telling the truth. I’ve also told Hachette that a publisher that would conduct itself in this way is one I can’t work with in good conscience.”

Dylan had also condemned Hachette’s plan to publish Woody’s autobiography, saying in a statement on Twitter on Monday: “Hachette’s publishing of Woody Allen’s memoir is deeply unsettling to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men.

“For the record, I was never contacted by any fact checkers to verify the information in this memoir, demonstrating an egregious abdication of Hachette’s most basic responsibility.”

A day before Hachette announced the cancellation of Woody’s memoir, Hachette employees staged a walkout to protest their company’s plans to publish the book.

“As a company, we are committed to offering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff. Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others,” Hachette’s statement said.

“After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG,” they added.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qqewf2/article31008675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOODYALLENAMAZON,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/woody-allens-memoir-apropos-of-nothing-cancelled-by-hachette-book-group/article31008676.ece
181,2020/03/07,We have to look at cinema beyond the lens of business: Subrata Beura,"With the 11th edition of the Indian Film Festival of Bhubaneswar behind him, coordinator Subrata Beura talks of nurturing cinema in Odisha

The Film Society of Bhubaneswar (FSB) was started in 2004 and since then the organisation has consistently been holding monthly screenings, film festivals and retrospectives. It has screened more than 500 films from across the world and held conversations, master classes, readings, art exhibitions and workshops around cinema. It also organises the Indian Film Festival of Bhubaneswar (IFFB), the only film festival in the country with a focus on Indian cinema. The latest edition was held in January this year. Subrata Beura — formerly the director of business planning and strategy at an American IT firm — was the festival coordinator of IFFB 2020; he is also the Secretary of FSB. He spoke about the challenges of running a film society in Odisha and the emerging indie cinescape. Excerpts:

From a high-flying corporate career, why did you shift into the role of a cinema activist as the Secretary of FSB?

As FSB was launched in the winter of 2004, I was involved with friends Satyajit Puhan, Bharadwaj Panda and filmmaker Subas Das, but stayed in the background — buying films during my travels abroad and slowly building a film archive.

I had an epiphany on November 8, 2016. I was in London, working on a European workforce reduction plan, when demonetisation was announced. The next morning, I woke up to the news of the Trump victory. I decided I could not work to strengthen the ruling elites any longer. I quit my job in February 2017, relocated to my hometown, Bhubaneswar, in 2018, and became a full-time worker at FSB.

What are the challenges of running a film society in a small city like Bhubaneswar, which is not exactly known for its cinema culture?

The city is a space for young people to escape from. Young women in colleges and universities live under curfew; they are debarred from an evening in the city, as hostels shut women in by 5-6 p.m. So, the biggest challenge is to find people who will engage in voluntary work. Our universities don’t offer cinema as a subject of study. The film society movement is non-existent.

When did IFFB come into being? Why was a need felt for it?

IFFB was started with the realisation that we didn’t have a festival dedicated to showcasing the diversity of contemporary Indian cinema. The idea was to bring to our audience films made in languages such as Khasi, Ladakhi etc. that are difficult to access. It was also important to focus on first-time filmmakers. We decided to shift the focus of our festivals and launch IFFB in 2017. We’ve also started to focus on Indian documentary films since 2018, with a separate festival called the Indian Documentary Film Festival of Bhubaneswar.

What was the curatorial thinking behind IFFB 2020?

The focus of IFFB 2020 was to showcase the diversity of contemporary Indian cinema, the works of debutant filmmakers, to ask important questions of our times surrounding identity, food, gender, economic development, social strife and possibilities of compassion. Aani Maani by Fahim Irshad Khan, Aise hi by Kislay, Lorni by Wanphrang Diengdoh, Cat Sticks by Ronny Sen, and Ghode ko Jalebi Khilane Le Ja Riya Hoon by Anamika Haksar are some of the outstanding films that we had the honour to screen this year.

Who are some contemporary filmmakers whose work excites you?

Apart from the filmmakers I have mentioned, whose work we featured this year, Rima Das is a significant voice whose works engage with very local realities in a contemporary and powerful fashion. Hemant Gaba’s work on Kota (An Engineered Dream) brings out the political economy of our education system. Mukul Haloi from Assam (Ghormuha) is also an emerging filmmaker to track. One has to watch the works of the Ektara Collective (Turup) from Bhopal as they explore the majoritarian challenges we face today in a nuanced manner. Stanzin Dorjai Gya (Shepherdess of the Glaciers, Growing in the Himalayas) from Leh is a documentarian whose works tell stories of people from trans-Himalaya in a language distinctly his own.

Still from ‘Aani Maani’.

Entries (especially feature films) from the Odia film industry have been conspicuous by their absence in festivals organised by FSB. Why is this?

We in Odisha are around 4% of national population; our programming reflects that proportion. But we are always on the lookout for Odia films. The matter of concern is student films; we don’t get Odia movies for our student film competition section. We are always looking for Odia cine classics as well. But due to lack of archival and digital material available at the National Film Archive of India and in the State, one is handicapped.

For the last few years, FSB has been criticised by a section of the Odia intelligentsia for taking corporate financial support for its film festivals, even while espousing progressive causes in the films it screens. How do you respond to this criticism?

In India and elsewhere, no successful film festival has thrived without the support of the government and city councils. We in Bhubaneswar do not have that. Whatever support we get, we use. One needs to see what that support is being used for. We need to build more inclusive cultural spaces where women, the elderly and children feel comfortable and can express themselves. We at FSB are planning to introduce a children’s film festival to the city’s cultural calendar.

What, according to you, is the political role of cinema in the charged times that we live in?

Every day we hear of oppressive structures clamping down on constitutional rights. Filmmakers and curators have a role to engage with our social, political and economic realities. The political role of cinema is to enable reimagining a just and inclusive society by opening up spaces for conversations.

According to you, what are the challenges facing the Odia film industry?

This is a question of policy. Let us deconstruct the new film policy of the Government of Odisha. One notices the fascination with big numbers, talk of ₹100 crore-plus budgets and tax exemptions, about distribution and screening spaces by tie-ups with multiplexes. We have to look at cinema beyond the lens of business. One dreams of a platform that can support young filmmakers from Odisha who can make works in Odia, Munda, Kui and Santhali languages.

182,2020/03/07,Reversing privilege in ‘Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan’ and ‘Chhoti si Baat’,"Two scenes in which humour and fantasy are deployed as soft weapons against privilege

Revisiting two 1970s Hindi films recently, I was struck by light-hearted scenes that showed how the underprivileged can deal with the privileged without direct confrontation. Humour, including biting sarcasm, can be one such tool; so can pure fantasy, which allows you to ‘reverse’ a situation — even if the reversal occurs only in your head.

Rich lad Arvind Desai buys four bottles of Black Label (beer, not whisky!) at a shop. He hands over a currency note and then walks away clutching the bottles as the vendor’s assistant calls out to him to take the change. But instead of being grateful for this casually bestowed ‘tip’, the shopkeeper shakes his head and chuckles: “Rehne do, yaar. Saalon ko paise lene mein bhi takleef hoti hai.” (These wealthy people find it troublesome even to take their money back.)

In an earlier scene in this film, Saeed Mirza’s Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan, the protagonist — heir to a business empire but also a troubled young man experiencing a nascent form of political awareness — has a self-congratulatory glow on his face after showing kindness to a street boy. But we then see this boy making fun of Arvind behind his back.

Sly observation

Mirza’s film offers more hard-hitting variants on the theme of the poor meeting the privileged gaze: it ends with exploited carpet-weavers staring accusingly at the camera. But that casual ten-second scene at the theka operates in a much lighter register, wittily undercutting the self-congratulatory delusions of the “benevolent” rich and making a sly observation about the Indian class waltz, one that is equally pertinent in the soft-socialist and the post-economic liberalisation eras.

The scene might also make you ask what Arvind was really intending to do, a question that is inseparable from the casting of the young and callow Dilip Dhawan in the part. Dhawan, though very likable, had a limited acting range, so you wonder: was Arvind airily walking away after leaving a tip, or was he just sheepish — as many of us are — about hanging around to collect a small amount?

Either way, I think of the scene often. There was a time when, if someone was delivering food to my door and the bill came to, say, ₹490, I would hand over a ₹500 note and mutter “Rehne deejiye” if the man started to look in his pocket for change. After watching the film, if I find myself in the same situation, I will make sure to hand over another ₹30 or ₹40 so the tip seems more substantial. And it isn’t just heightened sensitivity, it’s also because a part of me thinks this will reduce my chances of being mocked: the delivery man might not joke about me with his friends; the status quo between us will remain.

Middle-class fantasies

If Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan was part of what became known as the parallel movement or the cinema of struggle, a very different treatment of the lack-of-privilege theme can be seen in the gentle comedy-romances from the so-called Middle Cinema. Take a scene from Basu Chatterjee’s Chhoti si Baat, an archetype of the cosy ‘middle-class film’. The diffident Arun (Amol Palekar) can barely bring himself to speak to the girl he likes (Prabha, played by Vidya Sinha), but then he goes to a hall and watches a film where a mainstream hero has no such confidence issues. As the brawny Dharmendra sings ‘Jaaneman jaaneman’ to Hema Malini, Arun imagines himself and Prabha in their place on the screen, and there is even a marvellous moment where the transition from the big movie stars to the everymen is briefly left incomplete — so that we see Dharmendra crooning to Vidya Sinha for a few seconds. Two universes have brushed against each other.

The Middle Cinema often shows us what form fantasy can take in ordinary lives and everyday contexts (another such scene that comes to mind is Palekar imagining himself as a big star while a jobless Amitabh Bachchan languishes outside a studio in Gol Maal) — and while this is often presented as fun and games, it is also a view of the underdog lording it over the pampered poodle. Imagination does have its limits, though: the shirt Palekar wears in the ‘Jaaneman’ fantasy sequence appears two sizes too big, as if it had been fitted for Dharmendra’s muscular chest.

Actor Tessa Thompson has confirmed that Hollywood star Christian Bale will be playing the antagonist in Marvel Studios’ Thor: Love and Thunder. The actor shared the news during her interview with Entertainment Tonight on the sidelines of HBO’s Westworld season three premiere event.

“I’ve read the script. I can’t tell you much. Lots of exciting text messages exchanged between Natalie and I. We’re going to have fun. Taika is writing (and) directing. Some familiar faces. Some new people coming into the mix. Christian Bale is going to play our villain, which is going to be fantastic,” Thompson said.

It was reported in January that Bale, who previously played DC superhero Batman in Christopher Nolan’s critically-acclaimed The Dark Knight trilogy, is set to make his debut into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

Taika Waititi is back in the director’s chair after delivering MCU’s 2017 blockbuster Thor: Ragnarok.

Chris Hemsworth will once again play Norse god Thor, while Natalie Portman is returning as Jane Foster. Thompson will be reprising her character of Valkyrie.

Marvel Studios or parent company Disney are yet to officially confirm Bale’s casting.

On a hiatus post the release of NGK with Suriya, director Selvaraghavan, at an event hosted by a college, confirmed speculations that he is indeed going to start work on the much-anticipated sequel to the 2006 cult classic, Pudhupettai.

In a video doing the rounds on social media, Selvaraghavan can be heard saying amid loud cheers, “I’m revealing for my fans, and because it is the college where I completed my engineering. After NGK, I’m working on a film with Dhanush. As we were discussing on what film it could be, we decided on doing Pudhupettai 2.” Last month, the actor posted a cryptic tweet to his Twitter page, which said, “Giving final touches to my script”, which was cause for excitement for his fan base.

Pudhupettai saw Dhanush play the role of Kokki Kumar, considered one of his most iconic characters and the sequel will see his re-emergence as Chennai’s most dreaded gangster.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced in the Assembly on Saturday that he had information about Andhra Pradesh government proposing to increase the number of districts in that State from 13 to 25.

He said West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh were the only States that did not reorganise their districts so far.

Discussing the dangers from Citizenship Amendment Act, he said the Telangana government will not compromise and demanded national identity cards for citizens instead of rolling out National Population Register and National Register of Citizens as per the new legislation.

He wondered how he could prove his date of birth as he was not issued birth certificates like millions of citizens of his age in the country. All he had was a “janma nama patra” issued by a priest in his native village. If this be the case for people like him, imagine the hardship of poor SCs, STs and other weaker sections.

187,2020/03/07,MGU teacher questioned about ‘lewd texts’,"A six-member committee, with a member of Women Protection Cell, was constituted

District Superintendent of Police A.V. Ranganath on Saturday confirmed that a vice-principal of Mahatma Gandhi University, accused of sending lewd texts to a woman student was in police custody, and an enquiry was opened.

“The above vice-principal is still in our custody, enquiry is in progress. It is wrong to say that he was counselled and let off,” the Superintendent of Police stated in a police-media WhatsApp group, assuring a full disclosure post-enquiry.

According to police sources, Y. Punith Kumar, an academic consultant and vice-principal of the University College of Engineering at Panagal, on the town outskirts, allegedly sent lewd texts to a final year B.Tech student. His cellphone and WhatsApp conversations are being examined by the police.

Official sources of the MGU, confirming the incident, said the male teacher was in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department.

“Soon after the incident was reported, a six-member committee, including a member of the Women Protection Cell and the security officer, was constituted and enquiry was taken up. The report has been filed and the teacher was removed,” an official said.

Screenshots

The aggrieved student had produced WhatsApp screenshots as evidence that the teacher sent lewd texts and sought sexual favours from her, they added.

It was also confirmed by sources that the student approached SP Ranganath on Feburary 28 and requested action, following which the teacher went absconding. He was nabbed only recently and an investigation was opened.

Meanwhile, student organisations – Students’ Federation of India, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and others took to protests, demanding stringent action against the teacher.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mgu-teacher-questioned-about-lewd-texts/article31011308.ece
188,2020/03/07,Private hospitals play safe on isolation wards advisory,"There’s not enough accommodation, say managements, but ready to provide primary treatment and refer to nodal hospitals

There was mixed response to the State government’s advisory to private hospitals on the measures to be taken for treatment of COVID-19 suspect cases and setting up of isolation wards, special counters and training of doctors and para-medical staff to prevent its transmission.

Majority of the private hospital doctors said they are ready to provide treatment to COVID-19 suspect cases if the patients visit their hospitals and after suspecting the virus they would immediately refer the cases to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad or to the district headquarters hospital for treatment at an isolation ward. “We cannot open special isolation wards in our own hospitals and provide treatment to the patients suffering COVID-19,” said a senior IMA leader of Karimnagar district.

Quoting anonymity, the senior physician of the district said that private nursing homes and hospitals do not have proper accommodation to create isolation wards. “Already, the district headquarters hospitals have set up isolation wards and the private medical colleges have also come forward to set up isolation wards. Then where is the need for opening isolation wards in private hospitals?”, he asked.

“If we set up an isolation ward and open special counter for the treatment of suspects, the regular patients would be scared and would not come again to our hospitals,” he feared. Even the situation was the same in the government headquarters hospitals also. Whenever a suspected case of coronavirus was reported in the government hospital, the government doctors were immediately rushing the suspect to Hyderabad for treatment and not taking risk by providing medication at the district hospitals, he added.

“We are not denying treatment to the COVID suspect cases or others. But, the government deciding to dictate the prices that private hospitals should charge and instructing the method of treating a patient is not correct,” said a doctor.

IMA state president Edavelli Vijayender Reddy said that “we are ready to support the State government during the critical situation and participate actively in the launching of awareness programmes”. However, the private hospitals were not consulted by the government for opening isolation wards to treat the suspects, he maintained.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/h9c0is/article31011242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08ISLATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/private-hospitals-play-safe-on-isolation-wards-advisory/article31011244.ece
189,2020/03/07,‘Never said a job for each household’,"It’s impossible to create 1 crore jobs in public sector: KCR

Chief Minister K.Chandrahekhar Rao on Saturday refuted claims that he had ever committed himself to offer one job per household in Telangana, and made it clear that it is not possible for the government to create a crore jobs in public sector.

During his reply to the Legislative Council on the thanks giving motion on Governor’s address, Mr.Rao said the claims were manufactured towards political ends.

The subject of unemployment has become a political rhetoric which is leading to disillusionment among youth and subsequent suicides, the Chief Minister remarked.

Clarifying on the said claim, he said he had merely stated that Telangana as separate State would give employment for at least a lakh people.

Already 85,000 posts have been filled up in departments such as Police, Panchayat Raj, Electricity and Agriculture, he maintained.

Questioning how many lakhs of jobs were created by parties which had ruled earlier than TRS, the chief minister said the trend in every state, nation-wide and worldwide speaks for the fact that governments cannot create jobs for all.

Telangana has merely three lakh public sector posts, which is less than the number private sector has in each field.

In all artisanal jobs of construction, workers from other states such as Bihar, Orissa and Rajasthan are finding employment here, while those from Telangana are heading for mirages of the Middle East, he remarked.

It has become a trend for opposition parties to criticise government over its policies, but implement the very same policies when they come to power, Mr.Rao said.

“We are taking people in wrong track, which is bad for the nation... We should change the orientation of this political rhetoric,” he said, even while observing that youth from Telangana need to apply more for Central services such as Defence, Banking and Railways and efforts are being made to prepare them by setting up more study circles.

He ruled out the promised unemployment allowance in the next financial year too, and cited economic slowdown as the reason.

The promise will be fulfilled during this term, but not immediately, he said.

In reply to a question, Mr.Rao admitted that the quality of education, especially in primary schools, is below expectations and needs improvement. He promised to appoint Vice-Chancellors to all universities soon, and allocate required funds.On PRC and retirement age, decision will be taken soon, he said.

In another announcement pertaining to double bedroom housing project, he said government is preparing proposals for one lakh more 2BHK housing units, in addition to the 2.76 lakh under different stages of construction.

One lakh homes are already completed, and ready to be handed over, while 30,000 to 40,000 have already been distributed. The remaining will be handed over by the end of the financial year.

190,2020/03/07,Congress MLAs suspended from Assembly,"CM moots curbs on speech of MLAs

A ruckus created by Congress MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy just when Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was about to commence his reply to the debate on Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s Address in the Assembly saw Mr. Rao making a case for the expulsion of the MLA from the membership of the House on Saturday.

Mr. Rao sent sheaves of papers to Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy to consider them as evidence of misleading the House when it came to expelling Mr. Rajagopal Reddy.

Earlier, the entire Congress group was suspended from the House for the day following Mr. Reddy’s outburst against the Chief Minister over an incident involving filing of nomination by a Congress leader from Nalgonda in the election of Directors of MARKFED.

Confusion reigned from sometime as Legislative Affairs Minister V. Prashant Reddy moved the motion for suspension of Mr. Rajagopal Reddy alone but all the remaining five members of Congress were also asked to leave.

Mr. Rao described the showdown by Congress as nothing but an attempt to “literally run away” from the address that he was going to make. In fact, Mr. Rao lost his cool with Mr. Rajagopal Reddy twice when the latter remarked that they had not come to listen to his speech.

Replying to Mr. Rajagopal Reddy’s charge that the Mission Bhagiratha programme of supplying safe drinking water to all households had made tardy progress, Mr. Rao produced evidence of the MLA affixing signature to the resolutions of gram panchayats in his constituency of Munugode wherein it was highlighted that all the 12,000 odd houses in 334 habitations had received water under the programme.

Mr. Rao demanded stern action against the MLA for misleading the House and requested the Speaker to consider if such a member was allowed to continue. There was no place for such scenes by the MLA in the Assembly. The government would have been helpless in the absence of these papers, he said and sent the papers containing resolutions and the MLA’s signature to the Speaker.

He requested the Speaker to consider if the members should be asked to “prove or perish” if they made allegations against the government. A new rule was needed to bar members from making sweeping statements. It was high time the House took up the matter seriously.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-mlas-suspended-from-assembly/article31011036.ece
191,2020/03/07,Export permits to rice millers,"Supply far exceeds demand in local market: CM

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao raised the need for export permits to rice mills in the context of huge jump in food grains production in the State due to execution of irrigation projects.

He told the Assembly on Saturday that the production of paddy was likely to touch an all time high of 225 lakh tonnes in the two agricultural seasons this year. But, the domestic market was limited to 100 lakh tonnes and consumption only 65 lakh tonnes. The Food Corporation of India was prepared to procure the balance 125 lakh tonnes.

Considering the difference between domestic market and consumption, he said the 2,000 odd rice mills in the State should be given export permits to sell the produce elsewhere in the country.

He expected the area under cultivation in the State in two seasons to go up from 78 lakh acres to one crore acres in the coming years due to execution of irrigation project. The State will be in a position to not only meet local requirements but cultivate fine varieties of rice as the soils were fertile. The agriculture university had developed a variety of rice whose consumption did not risk growth in blood sugar levels. He felt the need to motivate the farmers to cultivate such rice.

He also said the water from Kakatiya canal of Sriramsagar project was supplied up to Suryapet and Kodad for 120 days. In a few days, water from Kaleshwaram project would also go to Siddipet. Since there was plenty of water, the government will go ahead with 24 hour free power supply for agriculture and Rythu Bandhu scheme of investment support to farmers. The water had also helped overcome the problem of flourosis in Nalgonda as certified by engineers of Ministry of Water Resources.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/export-permits-to-rice-millers/article31011019.ece

The Congress MLAs said they were going to inspect the farm house, which the Congress MP, A. Revanth Reddy had alleged, was constructed in violation of GO 111. They wanted the government to demolish the building or explain why it was not being demolished.

Mr. Bhatti demanded the resignation of KT Rama Rao and the Agriculture Minister, S. Niranjan Reddy accusing them of misusing their power to violate the norms. He alleged that TRS leaders have occupied 2,000 acres and Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao was silent on the issue.

“Why are they afraid of our visit to the farm house if there was no violation of norms,” he asked and demanded that the Chief Minister ask the Ministers to resign immediately.

Earlier, the police had booked cases against Revanth Reddy and six others accusing them of using drones to take pictures of the farm house without taking permission from the authorities.

193,2020/03/07,Govt. to increase power tariff,"CM hints at marginal hike in RTC fares

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao informed the Assembly on Saturday that the State government will definitely hike power tariff but it will be done only after taking public into confidence.

“We will definitely raise power tariff but will explain to public and do so”, Mr. Rao said in the Assembly while replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the Governor’s address.

Mr. Rao recalled that the government had increased road transport corporation (RTC) fares and power tariff only once in the last six years of TRS rule. Therefore, a need has arisen to enhance power tariff up to required limit to sustain 24-hour supply. The government will also study one more hike of 1-2% in the fares of RTC for the survival of the organisation.

The Chief Minister said the power position in the State has improved vastly since the formation of the State in 2014 when the installed capacity was only 7,778 MW with a disproportionate distribution system. Now, the position has highly stabilised with a capacity of 16,246 MW and seamless in distribution.

The State topped per capita power consumption in the country with 1,896 units against the national average of 1,100 units. It was 1,356 units per capita in the State in 2014, as per the statistics of Central Electricity Authority.

He assured that the quantum of drinking water supplied to households in Hyderabad will be increased from 119 million gallons a day (MGD) to 127 MGD after the ring main of the bulk pipeline of Mission Bhagiratha water supply scheme was completed. The entire city will start getting water from Krishna and Godavari rivers then and consequently no shortage of water in city.

He also said the L & T had sought the government’s help for metro rail project but he insisted with the concessionaire to complete the work in Old City as a pre-condition for any concession. There was no hitch to the work in Old City as the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen had also been persuaded to relent on its demands.

Mr. Rao stressed the need for one more government hospital in Old City in addition to Osmania General Hospital but the Congress set up obstacles as it did not want any landmark projects identified as his brainchild. About 350 more neighbourhood clinics will be opened in the city. The government will ensure flow of clean and fresh water in Musi river under a project before the end of its term, the Chief Minister added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/llal26/article31010795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08KCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-to-increase-power-tariff/article31010769.ece
194,2020/03/07,Old City being denied Krishna Phase-2 water: AIMIM,"Centre faulted for low devolution of funds to State

People of the Old City were being kept thirsty by denying Krishna phase-two water to them as it was being taken to quench the thirst of others, AIMIM Floor Leader Akbaruddin Owaisi alleged in the Assembly on Saturday.

Speaking on the Motion of Thanks on the Governor’s Address, he said although the movement for Statehood to Telangana was fought for due share in river waters, funds and employment, available water was not being given to the people of Old City.

Stating that the budgetary allocation for minorities was increased to about ₹2,000 crore last year from just ₹26 crore in the combined Andhra Pradesh government, he said it was not released in full due to shortfall in GST devolution from the Centre.

He criticised the government for neglecting several historical institutions and landmarks in Hyderabad such as Osmania General Hospital, Osmania University, Secretariat and others as they were in bad shape due to paltry allocation of funds year-by-year. Turning to the Centre, he alleged that it was handing step-motherly treatment to Telangana and denying due share of funds to the State. It was nothing but undermining the autonomy of States in the federal structure, he felt.

The debate on the motion was moved by A. Ramesh and seconded by K.P. Vivekanand, both legislators of the TRS. Mr. Ramesh said the TRS government was not discriminating the Assembly constituencies represented by other parties unlike in the past when development used to be concentrated only in the segments of the Chief Minister and a few ministers. He stated that no welfare scheme was pruned in spite of economic slowdown.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/old-city-being-denied-krishna-phase-2-water-aimim/article31010740.ece
195,2020/03/07,Implementation more important than policy formulation: Venkaiah Naidu,"Vice President lauds role of ASCI in nation-building

Vice-President of India M. Venkaiah Naidu said that effective implementation of the policies on ground was more important than the policy formulation.

Interacting with the faculty members of Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) at Bella Vista in Hyderabad on Saturday, the Vice President called for inclusive and sustainable approach to development.

He argued for improving service delivery of government programmes and they should reach the last man in true spirit of Antyodaya as espoused by the great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.

Stating that the Public-Private-Partnership was very important for development of India, he however said people’s participation in governance was a must for inclusive growth. “No person, community or region should be left behind,” he added.

He also called for making optimum use of digital technologies to improve the service delivery and bringing down corruption. He wanted ASCI, through its training programmes, to help administrators in formulating suitable strategies for improving governance.

Appreciating the role of ASCI, he said every officer receiving training from the institute must imbibe a citizen-centric and result-driven approach, which is the need of the hour to ensure inclusive growth.

During his visit to ASCI, the Vice President went around the campus and interacted with the students of PGDHM and PGDM. He also planted a sapling on the lawns of ASCI.

Earlier, ASCI Chairman K Padmanabhaiah, who chaired the session, highlighted the contribution of ASCI in nation building and underlined the need of recognising ASCI as an institution of excellence.

196,2020/03/07,Poachers snare unexpected catch — foresters,"Forest Department officials likely to face action as skeletons come tumbling out

More heads are likely to roll in Kagaznagar Forest Division in Kumram Bheem Asifabad as skeletons come tumbing out of the cupboard. Top officials are inquiring into reasons for failure of a 50 hectare plantation under the prestigious Telanganaku Haritha Haram (THH) plantation drive in one of the forest ranges.

It is reliably learnt that while negligence in maintenance of the plantation led to dying of plants, concerned officials put into practice a bizarre logic of removing the unchecked growth of grass and weeds from it. They let sheep graze in the plantation last October contending that the animals will eat away all the grass and weeds, which actually resulted in further deterioration of the condition of the plantation.

When it comes to failure in control of poaching, one Deputy Range Officer was placed under suspension on Friday for his alleged negligence in checking out activities of poachers in setting up electrified traps for wild animals in the area under his jurisdiction which, unusually though, led to the electrocution of the poacher himself instead of a tiger which was the target.

Going on for long

In another development a few days back, a few kilogrammes of binding wire was seized from the range which is one of the most ecologically sensitive one in the division.

“The size, or weight, of the haul reveals that poaching is going on in that range,” opined an officer as he talked of the situation. “The smallest of negligence can play havoc with the survival of wild animals in the area,” he added.

Officials who are disturbed over the developments want the Excise Department also to be part of the drive as poachers are known to be brewing liquor illicitly, the brew known as gudumba locally. “Our study of the behaviour of poachers makes us believe that when poachers get deprived of gudumba, they do not go into forests,” the officer contended.

“So far as control of poaching by using live wires is concerned, insulating all the power cables that pass through forests and its fringes will do the trick. This may be a costly affair but it would be a perfect and long lasting measure,” he observed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/b1rceh/article31010362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08KAGAZNAGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/poachers-snare-unexpected-catch-foresters/article31010359.ece
197,2020/03/07,"Congress, BJP lists out TRS government failures on many fronts","Handful of villages have got 2BHK houses, Congress MLA Rajagopal Reddy pointed out

The Opposition Congress and the BJP have come down heavily against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government for its failure to keep several promises made to the people and also making the Governor recite lies in her address to the joint sitting of the Legislature.

Speaking on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s Address in the Assembly on Saturday, Congress MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy alleged that the State government had been making the poor continuously wait for the last six years for the double-bedroom houses promised to them by stating that they were under construction. Except in a handful of villages in Gajwel, Siddipet and Sircilla constituencies the 2BHK houses were not given to the needy anywhere in the State, he pointed out.

He suggested the government to provide at least 1BHK house to the poor or give money to those having house sites since they were losing hopes on getting 2BHK houses. He also sought to know the fate of unemployment allowance promised before the elections.

Mr. Rajagopal Reddy criticised the government on the Mission Bhagiratha scheme stating that water had reached only 40% of households so far in spite of the Chief Minister’s repeated statements before the 2018 Assembly elections that they would not seek votes without giving treated drinking water to every household in the State. He alleged that nearly ₹50,000 crore borrowed for the scheme had helped only to fill the pockets of contractors.

On the 24×7 free power to agriculture, the Congress MLA said no farmer in the State was seeking uninterrupted supply as it had been harming the groundwater table badly. He suggested the government to call for intelligence reports as to what the farmers were thinking about it before taking a decision. He stated that 12-hour supply a day, 6 hours during the day and 6 hours in the night, was sufficient.

He also lashed out at the government on its idea of going for new Secretariat and sought to know the rationale behind carving out 23 new districts. Closure of Secretariat was denying not only the people but also the elected representatives an opportunity to meet ministers to represent their constituents’ problems. “Meeting the Chief Minister is more difficult than having ‘darshan’ of Venkateswara Swamy,” he remarked.

Another Congress legislator D. Anasuya alias Seethakka suggested the ruling party to stop blaming the previous combined State administration for all the ills stating that many of the ruling party functionaries were also part of the decision-making then. Lone legislator of BJP T. Raja Singh also criticised the government for not keeping its promises.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rv7u0t/article31010685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08KOMATIREDDYRAJAGOPALREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-bjp-lists-out-trs-government-failures-on-many-fronts/article31010259.ece

Three passengers, including two minor boys, were killed, and 16 others suffered injuries when a passenger autorickshaw went off the road and turned turtle near Rangapur in Wanaparthy district on Friday night.

Chittiamma alias Padmavathi (30) and her 6-year-old nephew died on the spot, while their 7-year-old relative succumbed to his injuries at the Government Hospital in Kurnool in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.

The accident occurred at around 10.30 p.m., when the victims, hailing from Pebbair, were returning after attending prayers at a church in Erravalli of Jogulamba-Gadwal district.

According to Pebbair SI Raghavender Reddy, as the auto was overloaded, driver Nagaraju made four people sit on the front seat. Subsequently, he lost control of the vehicle, and it overturned after going off the road.

“However, Nagaraju said that the accident took place when an unidentified vehicle hit his three-wheeler from behind. We have launched a probe to know the exact reason,” he said.

202,2020/03/07,Equal rights for women sought,"Rasta roko staged against increasing cases of atrocities against women

Activists of Center of Indian Trade Unions and All India Democratic Women’s Association, here on Friday, staged a rasta roko protesting against an increase in atrocities on womenfolk and harassment and discrimination against them at work places.

Speaking on the occasion, Noorjahan and S. Latha, district secretaries of CITU and AIDWA respectively, said that after the BJP led NDA had come to power at Centre for the second time atrocities and assaults on women and children have risen. Women were being subjected to economic exploitation as they were treated as second rate citizens, they added.

Demanding equal rights and equal pay for equal work for women, they felt that they should be provided with social security and 33 % reservation in the law making Houses. Special interest must be taken to prevent violence against women and strict implementation of the Acts to ensure severe punishment for the culprits, they said.

In the last six year rule of the TRS sexual attacks on children and women and their murders also increased. Gruesome incidents like rape of a six month old baby in Hanmakonda, murder of Manasa, Laxmi, Priyanka Reddy, Naresh-Swathi; Madhukar-Amrutha; and Pranay took place in the last five years. State government miserably failed to prevent them, said they.

Ms. Noorjahan said that the non-implementation of provisions of the law indicated the lack of sincerity of rulers that be in providing safety and security to women.

203,2020/03/07,Pay taxes and bag goodies,"Vepakuntla gram panchayat rolls out a novel lucky draw scheme

With the end of current fiscal fast approaching, some proactive elected representatives of the rural local bodies are trying inventive ways to ramp up collection of property tax, including dues, to augment revenue for the local self governments.

The elected body of Vepakuntla Gram Panchayat (GP) in Raghunadhapalem mandal has rolled out a novel initiative to encourage villagers promptly pay property taxes and clear pending dues by announcing a lucky draw scheme.

The GP headed by Sarpanch D Shyamsundar recently passed a resolution to step up property tax collection to make their GP, located about 8 km from Khammam, a self-sustaining institution.

In pursuit of this endeavour, the GP has embarked on a campaign to spread awareness on the “lucky draw scheme” among the 3,000-odd residents of the village.

The novel idea has received appreciation from several elected representatives of the local self governments as well as officials concerned.

As an incentive for villagers to pay their house and water taxes promptly, the lucky draw scheme has been announced, said Mr Shyamsundar.

The lucky draw will be conducted at the GP office on March 31 to choose the winners from the eligible villagers, who pay their house and water taxes before March 30.

A fridge will be given as the first prize.

There are ten other attractive prizes, including household items like electric cooker, iron and dinnerware set to be won, he added.

The move is also intended to recover the property tax dues to the tune of Rs 4.10 lakh from several villagers and bring some new households under the purview of the GP to raise revenue for providing better amenities to the villagers, the sarpanch asserted.

The village has witnessed a slew of development work, including installation of LED street lights, and provision of tap connections in almost all households under the Mission Bhagiratha in recent months, he noted.

He added that special focus has been laid on property tax collection, which is the major revenue source for the GP., apart from the Finance Commission Grants.

Our village needs more funds to plug the gaps in physical infrastructure, averred a local farmer. The GP is in dire need of a new building and a library must be set up in the village for the benefit of local youth, he insisted.

The lucky draw scheme announced by the elected body of the Vepakuntla GP is a welcome initiative, said District Panchayat Officer K Srinivas Reddy.

Several other GPs have evinced keen interest to implement the novel idea, Mr Reddy said, adding that the elected representatives of the GPs are being constantly encouraged to step up tax collection drive and effectively implement Palle Pragathi programme to ensure comprehensive development of villages.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/lyow5v/article31004415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07KHAMMAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pay-taxes-and-bag-goodies/article31004416.ece
204,2020/03/07,Life lessons,"GK Maastarara Pranaya Prasanga, which tells the story of a teacher who imagines he finds love, will be staged today

Vikasam, started by like-minded theatre enthusiasts in 2017 is led by actor Ashok B. When the production company wanted to do something different a few years ago, Ashok approached Bhaskar Ninasam to adapt and direct Jnana Peetha awardee Chandrashekara Kambara’s novel GK Maastarara Pranaya Prasanga for stage.

“Bhaskar conducted a three-month workshop,” says Ashok, who usually takes the main role. “It was a life-changing experience and has run houseful for seven shows already.” Ashok says he is with the lighting group this week, adding that right lighting is paramount to set the mood for a love story.

Ashok, a medical representative of veterinary products, has been acting since he was a child. “All 45 members of our troupe are corporate employees. They consider the stage a devotion. We have staged many plays including Poornachandra Tejaswi’s Engtana Pungi, Lankesh’s Stella Emba Hudugi, and Dundiraj’s Pukkate Salahe which will soon see its 50th show. We also have street plays to spread awareness on social issues and nature.”

Speaking about the simple storyline of GK Maastarara Pranaya Prasanga Ashok says, “The play is about GK Maastar, a Sanskrit teacher and principal of a college with an ailing wife. GK is close to retirement. Destiny however has different plans and Cupid strikes when he is attracted to his student, Roja, who could pass off as his daughter. He is known for his virtues, his students and other lecturers fear him, while his detractors grudgingly admire him.”

The play follows GK as he innocently flirts with Roja, tackles other students, especially Girrappa, a student union leader whom Roja is in love with, and finally sees reality after Roja and Girrappa play a prank. “It is a story of denial and misplaced priorities. Kambara’s intricate handling of passion comes through in Bhaskar’s poignant direction,” says Ashok.

Bhaskar who did his advanced training at Ninasam, says he always wanted to direct this particular novel by Kambara. “It is a dream come true. I remember telling the 20 actors involved, do not act, get into the skin of the character, feel and experience them. It is a moving 90-minute play with music by Sathya Radhakrishna,” says Bhaskar who has directed nearly two dozen plays and has also acted in a 500-episode Zee Kannada TV serial Sriram Srimati.

Bhaskar picks out the swimming scene at Koodala Sangama where GK competes with Girrappa for Roja’s attention. “The property design, lighting and effects have come in for a lot of praise for its realistic portrayal.” Bhaskar, who has also been acting since childhood starting with Mandya Ramesh’s plays, says, “GK’s dream sequences and the torment he goes through when he realises that neither his wife nor his fantasy love are going to stay with him forever are particularly effective.”

GK Maastarara Pranaya Prasanga will be staged on March 7 at 7.30 pm at KH Kalasoudha, Hanumanthanagar.

206,2020/03/07,Allahabad HC stays Bijnor ADM’s recovery notice,"Recovery notice of ₹2.2 cr was slapped on four persons after anti-CAA protests

The Allahabad High Court on Friday stayed a Bijnor ADM order directing the administration to recover ₹2.22 crore from four persons accused of damaging public property in clashes during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests on December 20, 2019.

“We are of the view that the Rules under which the impugned notice has been issued is under challenge before the Apex Court,” a Division Bench of Justices Manoj Mishra and Deepak Verma said.

“Therefore, the ends of justice demand that the effect and operation of the impugned notice is put in abeyance till the issue is determined by the Apex Court,” the order said.

Issuing notice to the State government, the bench has listed the case for April 20. The Bench was referring to the writ petition filed by advocate Parvaiz Arif Titu which is being heard by the Supreme Court. Mr Titu’s petition described such notices as “arbitrary” and asked for an independent judicial inquiry to probe the incidents.

V.M. Zaidi, senior advocate, representing the four accused said he argued that the ADM (Finance) had no power to issue such recovery notices.

“The Supreme Court guidelines (in Destruction of Public and Private Properties vs State of A.P (2009) and Kodangallur Film Society vs Union of India (2018)) says that in such cases a serving or retired High Court or district judge is to be appointed as a Claims Commissioner by the High Court,” Mr Zaidi told The Hindu.

“It seems like a case of State terror to name and shame people without proper evidence. It has come after a stay order was passed by the honourable High Court when Mohammed Faizan of Kanpur approached against a similar recovery notice issued by ADM, Kanpur. I hope all such orders would be eventually set aside,” added Mr Zaidi.

The order has come after Javed Aftab, former municipal corporation chairman, Bijnor, moved the High Court along with Parvez Aftab, Shahadat Ali and Zeeshan Baig against the recovery orders issued by ADM Avadesh Mishra.

Official sources said 61 protesters were identified through CCTV footage and slapped with recovery notices.

In his order, Mr Mishra said the accused were given several opportunities to prove their innocence but they failed to do so.

Interestingly, the stay order came on the same day when the Lucknow administration pasted photos and recovery notices of those who allegedly vandalised public property during anti-CAA protests in public places in the city on December 19.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/allahabad-hc-stays-bijnor-adms-recovery-notice/article31011050.ece

The Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH) will display a unique Rajput miniature painting of Rani Padmini (Padmavati) of Chittor to mark International Women’s Day.

Jayanta Sengupta, secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, said that the unique painting by an unknown artist is being displayed for the first time in the museum’s galleries.

“The painting was purchased by the VMH on October 3, 1913, from Ganeshi Lall and Sons, art traders. It is just out of our reserves. It will be on display in the Prince Hall on the southern side of the museum from next week,” Mr. Sengupta said.

The painting shows the queen trying on a turban and surrounded by women. The miniature measures 33.7 cm X 27 cm.

“In our collections, we have certain other iconic paintings like the Bharat Mata by Abanindranath Tagore and that of an Indian woman dancing with an English gentleman by Gaganendranath Tagore from the Bengal school of art that celebrate womanhood. But this miniature is also unique,” he said. The VMH’s curator said the museum made a choice from its Indian art collection for Women’s Day.

“Usually the VMH is known for the collection of its Western paintings like Daniells and Zoffanys. But not many people know that we have a good collection of Indian art, which includes hundreds of miniatures which we will be slowly bringing to display,” Mr. Sengupta said.

The VMH is also opening up a mother and child room (baby nursing room) adjacent to the entrance hall. “This is part of our ongoing effort to make the museum more inclusive and friendlier to people,” Mr. Sengupta said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/10xyos/article31011026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/As-Received,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/victoria-memorial-to-display-rare-miniature-of-rani-padmini/article31011028.ece

The Punjab government on Saturday denied that training was being imparted to the field staff for the National Population Register (NPR) exercise in the State, saying there was no question of going against the Assembly resolution on the issue.

“The ongoing training is a routine exercise related to the conduct of housing census, scheduled to take place in Punjab in May-June, and had absolutely nothing to do with NPR,” said an official statement.

The statement added that Sanjay Kumar, Additional Chief Secretary (local government), had given clear instructions to this effect to the Deputy Commissioners during a recent workshop. The DCs were asked to exclude the NPR training chapter from this exercise, it added.

The resolution passed by the State Assembly in January had categorically rejected the NPR.

It stated: “Given the apprehensions about National Register of Citizens and that the National Population Register is a prelude to the NRC designed to deprive a section of persons from citizenship of India and implement CAA, this House further resolves that Central government should amend the forms-documentation associated with the NPR to allay such apprehension in the minds of the people and only thereafter undertake work of enumeration under NPR.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vzzltb/article31010878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08AMRITSAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-training-being-imparted-for-npr-exercise-punjab-govt/article31010879.ece

“We know there are many people who want to contest on BJP ticket but don’t know where to reach or whom to approach,” said BJP National Secretary Rahul Sinha.

“The BJP, being a believer in the true spirit of democracy, wants to give them the chance to apply for candidature,” Mr. Sinha said.

212,2020/03/07,Class 10 paper in Madhya Pradesh refers to PoK as “Azad Kashmir”,"Chief Minister orders probe into objectionable question

Chief Minister Kamal Nath has ordered an inquiry into a question asked in the social science paper of the State Board class 10 examination that referred to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as “Azad Kashmir”. Two officials have been suspended.

While the first row containing five options in the “match the following” question mentioned ‘India-Pakistan War’, the second row had “Azad Kashmir” as one of the options. In another question, students were asked to identify “Azad Kashmir” on the map of India.

“As soon as the information of the objectionable question reached Chief Minister Kamal Nath, he ordered an inquiry into it,” said State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja.

Mr. Nath had said immediate action must be taken against whoever had set the paper and they should be suspended. “The Chief Minister said such incidents will not be tolerated,” said Mr. Saluja.

Later, School Education Minister Prabhuram Choudhary on Twitter said the teacher and moderator responsible for setting the paper containing the objectionable question had been suspended.

“The officials have suspended the Commissioner, School Education Department, for negligence and not showing expected attentiveness,” said a note by S.K. Chourasia, Public Relations Officer, State Board of Secondary Education.

Assailing the Congress government, State BJP media incharge Lokendra Parashar said Mr. Nath must answer whether all this was being done with his agreement.

In the preliminary examination of the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission in January, a contentious question had presumed criminal nature of the Bhil tribe, drawing ire of Mr. Nath, who had clarified he respected tribals and ordered action against erring officials.

Taking suo motu cognizance, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights directed the State government to submit a report within a week on the incident it termed a “criminal offence” prima facie.

Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo, writing to the Secretary, State Board of Secondary Education, said, “ Such kinds of questions are potentially misleading which can negatively influence the minds of children, since ‘Azad Kashmir’ is not a constitutionally approved phrase/term”.

He said the usage of such terms was viewed as their endorsement, which was not in consonance with the Constitution.

The Commission asked the government whether such terms were part of the school curriculum, and if not, how come they were used in the question paper.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/k5wmxs/article31009167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BOARDEXAM-AMFARUQUI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/class-10-paper-in-madhya-pradesh-refers-to-pok-as-azad-kashmir/article31009136.ece
213,2020/03/07,Coronavirus | Assam sanitises route taken by U.S. tourist,"The American was on a seven-day cruise on the Brahmaputra River in the State

Assam on Saturday went on a sanitising and quarantining overdrive along the route taken by a U.S. tourist during his tour of the State before leaving for Bhutan where he tested positive for COVID-19 on March 5.

The tourist had begun his India tour on February 21 and had gone on a seven-day cruise on the Brahmaputra River three days later. He stayed at a five-star hotel in Guwahati and a resort in eastern Assam’s Jorhat town beyond the Kaziranga National Park.

An entire floor of the hotel where the U.S. couple had stayed was vacated and sanitised while health officials collected a list of all the employees who served the duo for screening. “We are trying to track everyone they came in contact with from and back to the airport and assist the health teams in ensuring people cooperate,” Addl. DGP Harmeet Singh said.

A health team also screened the crew and the passengers of the cruise ship the couple and two others had booked. The ship, which had been sailing with 22 foreign tourists and 35 crew members on board, was made to stop at Neamatighat in Jorhat district for screening.

Employees and guests of the Jorhat resort had also been screened.

Officials in Majuli, an island-like formation in the Brahmaputra, have launched an exercise to identify the people the U.S. couple had met. The pair had visited a satra (Vaishnav monastery) in Majuli.

The authorities in northern Assam’s Tezpur have quarantined an Italian tourist who checked into a hotel there on Friday. The tourist, who arrived in India more than a month ago, has been isolated in his hotel room.

Kaziranga Utsav postponed indefinitely

A festival each in Assam and Meghalaya have become the casualty of the COVID-19 scare. The authorities of the Kaziranga National Park have postponed the Kaziranga Utsav, scheduled from March 12-15, indefinitely as many foreign tourists were expected to attend.

The Meghalaya government too scaled down the Meghalaya Age Festival scheduled from March 7-15 at Thadlaskein in West Jaintia Hills district. “In view of the public advisory issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, we have made it a small-scale event for a limited number of invitees,” Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said.

The Assam government has advised the people not to panic and that measures are being taken to keep the virus at bay.

“There hasn’t been a single positive case among the 112 people we have kept under surveillance so far. We are conducting health checks at all airports and have asked various airlines to report to us if any passenger arrives with fever,” Assam’s junior Health Minister Pijush Hazarika said.

CISF personnel under observation

The Guwahati airport authorities have put five Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel under observation after the news of the U.S. tourist was conveyed from Bhutan, airport’s Director Ramesh Kumar said.

The tourist and his partner had boarded a Bhutan airline flight from the Lokapriya Gopinath Bardoloi International Airport to Bhutan’s Paro International Airport on March 2. Eight of the 10 passengers on board were Indians.

“We have identified five CISF personnel who may have come in contact with the infected tourist. They are being kept under observation,” Mr. Kumar said.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday offered ₹1 crore for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

The amount would not be on behalf of the Maharashtra government or his party Shiv Sena, but a personal contribution towards the Trust in the capacity of “a Bhakt,” he clarified.

Addressing a press conference in Ayodhya, Mr. Thackeray said he might have parted ways with the BJP, but that did not mean a departure from Hindutva. “Hindutva and BJP are separate. The meaning of Hindutva is not BJP.”

The Ayodhya administration on Saturday, hours before the arrival of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray here to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at the makeshift temple, put three Hindu seers under house arrest for threatening to greet the CM with black flag, said police.

The seers had threatened to greet Mr. Thackeray with black flag saying that he has formed government in Maharashtra with the help of those who had dubbed Lord Ram as an imaginary figure.

The three seers who were put under house arrest on early Saturday morning are Mahant Raju Das of Hanumangarhi Temple, Mahant Paramhans Das of Tapaswi Chhawni Temple and Rakesh Dutt Mishra, the president of Hindu Mahasabha, said Ayodhya Senior Superintendent of police Ashish Tiwari.

Mr. Thackeray reached the temple town shortly after the noon.

Sources said three teams of police personnel swooped on the houses of the three saints and served them with the adminstration order to stay in the house arrest and left after deploying a few policemen outside their residences to prevent them from venturing out.

217,2020/03/07,"West Bengal teachers oppose new law on recruits’ antecedents, reproductive health","“It violates one’s right to privacy and the right over one’s own body,” they say

Teachers in West Bengal are questioning a new law that will subject fresh recruits in all State government-aided colleges to police verification and also a medical examination assessing, among other things, the reproductive health of female candidates.

There are nearly 600 universities and colleges across West Bengal that are State government-aided and critics say that the new law — which requires applicants to specify whether they were originally a resident of Pakistan, Bangladesh or Nepal — was totally unnecessary at a time when the country was witnessing anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests.

“We suspect this to be a roundabout way of implementing the CAA, even though on the face of it Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is opposed to CAA. Or else, why do they want to know whether a candidate originally hailed from Pakistan or Bangladesh? As for police verification, it only makes candidates vulnerable to political victimisation. And what is the point of such an elaborate medical check-up? Are the candidates applying for the Army? We strongly oppose this law,” Kesab Bhattacharya, general secretary of West Bengal College and University Teachers’ Association, told The Hindu.

The notification, issued on February 24, says: “Every [State government-aided] university or college shall take immediate steps to have done all procedural formalities regarding police verification and medical examination of the incumbent so appointed. However, confirmation of service shall be withheld till receipt of report of police verification and medical examination even after completion of usual period of probation.”

For male candidates, the medical examination will determine, among other things, the girth of their chest, and for females, it will evaluate the functioning of ovaries and uterus.

“This is unprecedented and deplorable. It violates one’s right to privacy and the right over one’s own body. It will discriminate against pregnant women and the transgender community. The whole thing is shocking, to say the least, and seems to have sinister motives,” said Ishita Mukherjee, a professor of economics at the University of Calcutta and also the president of the teachers’ association there.

A section of teachers that supports Ms. Banerjee says such regulations were already in place in government colleges and the only thing new is that they have been extended to government-aided colleges. “The number of government colleges is very less, that is why [such regulations] escaped attention and no one talked about them, but now that government-aided institutions have also been brought under the law, people are making noise,” said Sujoy Ghosh, spokesman of West Bengal College and University Professors’ Association.

“The [West Bengal] Education Minister [Partha Chatterjee] has already said that he was open to discussion with any group that had problems with certain clauses of the law. We fully support his statement,” said Mr. Ghosh.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-teachers-oppose-new-law-on-recruits-antecedents-reproductive-health/article31007995.ece

220,2020/03/07,Coronavirus | Visva Bharati puts off Vasanta Utsav,"Decision comes in the wake of letter from HRD Ministry advising against large gatherings

Visva Bharati has decided to postpone Vasanta Utsav (Celebration of Spring), a century-long tradition at the university that was set up by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.

After several hours of meeting of the University’s executive council on Friday evening, the authorities at Santiniketan announced the decision to postpone the festival, which is held on the occasion of Holi.

The authorities said that they were left with no option after they received a letter from Ministry of Human Resource Development, which has advised universities not to have large gatherings on the campus. The authorities cited a letter from University Grants Commission secretary Rajnish Jain.

“We were keen on organising the festival this year. The State government was also willing to extend all its cooperation. The crowd this year was expected to be about five lakh. But this year Vasanta Utsav is not happening,” Sushovan Banerjee, the President’s nominee to the University’s executive council, said.

Mr. Banerjee said that the decision was in the interest of health of students to ensure that there was no spread of the virus. Over the past few days, elaborate rehearsals for the grand celebrations were also held. “The decision not to hold Vasanta Utsav will incur financial costs both to the University as well as the State government,” he said.

The authorities said that only after the virus spread was contained, the University will think of holding some alternative programme.

Vasanta Utsav is celebrated with immense fervour at Visva Bharati, with students of different departments dressed in traditional yellow observing a long musical dance in the morning on Tagore’s songs. Ashramites (elderly boarders) at the Visva Bharati campus said that they could not recall any other occasion when the festival, which is part of the heritage of the University, had been cancelled or postponed.

221,2020/03/07,Pehlu Khan lynching case: Juvenile Justice Board convicts two minors,"Board to pronounce sentence soon

In the first conviction for the lynching of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan in 2017, the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) in Alwar has held two minors guilty of participating in his murder as members of a mob of cow vigilantes. Six persons accused of having led the attack were acquitted by a Sessions Court in August last year.

The JJB, headed by Principal Magistrate Sarita Dhakad, on Saturday deferred the hearing on the sentence against the convicted teenagers to March 12. Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the minors can be held in custody for a maximum period of three years for the offence which had created a nationwide outrage.

Editorial | Justice for the mob

Khan, 55, a dairy farmer from Haryana’s Nuh district, his two sons and a few others were waylaid by self-styled cow vigilantes at Behror on the Jaipur-Delhi National Highway on April 1, 2017. They were thrashed on suspicion that they were smuggling cows for slaughter. Khan succumbed to his injuries two days later in a hospital.

The Alwar Sessions Court had acquitted six accused in the case on August 14, 2019, giving them the benefit of the doubt on the basis of the police probe. Those let off by the court were Vipin Yadav, Kalu Ram, Dayanand, Ravindra Kumar, Yogesh Kumar and Bheem Rathi.

The State government filed an appeal in the Rajasthan High Court against the Sessions Court’s verdict after a special investigation team pointed out loopholes in the probe conducted earlier by four investigating officers. Another juvenile, who is older than 16 years, is facing trial as an accused in a court in Alwar, where his case was transferred because the offence is covered in the category of heinous crimes.

While the JJB will announce the grounds for conviction of the two minors in its order of sentence, Asad Hayat, lawyer of Khan’s sons, told The Hindu that the Board had not recorded the evidence of those injured in the incident as witnesses. “As the minors have been convicted on hitherto unknown grounds, they may get relief in their appeal in the higher court,” he said.

Mr. Hayat said Khan’s sons Arif and Irshad would move an application before the JJB for recording additional evidence in the case. “We have learnt that the certified copies of evidence recorded in the court, where another juvenile is facing trial as an accused, were submitted to the JJB. Such evidence is not admissible in the Board.”

The High Court had earlier quashed the case of illegal transport of cattle for slaughter against Khan, his sons and the owner of the truck in which they were travelling. The court had ruled that Khan had purchased the animals for dairy and not slaughter.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/crlgt2/article29833155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pehlu-Khanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pehlu-khan-lynching-case-juvenile-justice-board-convicts-two-minors/article31007297.ece
222,2020/03/07,Rain damages crops in U.P.,"Rain and hailstorm in western Uttar Pradesh have come as a dampener for farmers in the festive season.

Expecting a bumper crop of wheat, the region is seeing widespread damage to not only the wheat crop but also potato and rapeseed. High-speed winds have flattened the wheat crop in many areas.

Yogendra Singh, a farmer in the Shikarpur area of Bulandshahr, said 25-30% of his wheat crop was affected by the unseasonal rain. “It would affect both the quality and quantity of the crop. And, it seems, it is not over yet as high-speed winds and rain continue to remain a threat.”

Balbir Singh, a potato farmer in the Iglas area of Aligarh, also put his loss at around 25-30%. “It is a double blow to farmers. We could take the last week’s rain in our stride, but this one, particularly the hail, was not expected,” said Mr Singh.

“In places, where rain and hailstorm were accompanied with high-speed wind, the loss of crop could be up to 50%,” said Parvez Rizvi, professor of Agriculture at Aligarh Muslim University.

“Wheat and mustard which are almost ready are the worst affected. The high amount of precipitation will lead to water stagnation which will lead to fungal infections. Water stagnation will also affect the potato crop that is lying in the field,” said Prof. Rizvi.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rain-damages-crops-in-up/article31007272.ece
223,2020/03/07,900 athletes arrive for Gulmarg winter games amid COVID-19 scare,"Sports persons from 20 states are participating in the mega event, first since the revocation of J&K’s special status on August 5 last year

Around 992 athletes and sports officials from across the country converged on snow-bound Gulmarg for the first ever Khelo India winter games in Kashmir on Friday, despite the civil society groups expressing concern over organising such events in the wake of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the country.

The five-day event will see athletes participating in games like Alpine ski, snowboarding, snow shoeing, sledging, snow derby, snow rugby, snow baseball etc. from March 7. Sports persons from 20 states are participating in the mega event, first since the revocation of J&K’s special status on August 5 last year.

Union minister Kiren Rijiju arrived in Gulmarg to preside over the event, pipped as an indicator of return of normalcy in J&K. “Come, witness and enjoy India’s first ever Khelo India Winter Games at Gulmarg. It will not only promote sports but also generate huge tourism Industry and benefit the local economy,” tweeted Mr. Rijiju, ahead of his arrival in Kashmir.

Many see the games a significant event to turn around tourism economy, dented due to tense situation in the past seven months.

“It’s going to be a big event. The event will showcase Kashmir’s tourism potential, besides the talent of the participants on the snowy slopes,” Director General, Youth Services and Sports, Saleem-ur- Rehman said.

However, several civil society groups have raised their concern, as the event comes despite the administration on its toes to contain any infiltration of Coronavirus case into Kashmir. “At least 7,000 people have been screened in just two days,” government-designated nodal officer Dr. Shafqat Khan said.

G. N Var, head of the Private Schools Association of J&K (PSAJK), questioned the government move. “Why is the government going ahead with the games even as major events across the globe has been cancelled? Thousands of spectators from the entire country and outside will be coming to watch it. They would be huddled in a small place with snow and cold temperature everywhere. Everybody knows that the virus grows wildly in cold temperature,” said Mr. Var.

Meanwhile, the PSJK, with around 2,700 private as its members, has asked the school authorities either to restrict morning assemblies to bare minimum time or cancel it. “All unnecessary examinations need to be deferred. Every school has to remain in touch with local hospital. Teachers will keep an eye on each and every student for any flu like symptoms,” Mr. Var said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/900-athletes-arrive-for-gulmarg-winter-games-amid-covid-19-scare/article31005988.ece

Hours after Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday issued a statement about the State government notifying COVID-19 as an ‘’epidemic disease’’, an official spokesperson of Chief Minsiter’s office stated the virus had not been declared an epidemic.

Admitting that the press release issued by the Health department on the issue had inadvertently described COVID-2019 as an epidemic disease, the official spokesperson said later that there was absolutely no ‘epidemic’ of the disease in the state.

The health department had issued an advisory under the said Act only as a `temporary regulation’ to combat the threat of COVID-19, said the spokesperson, adding that there was no cause for panic at present and the situation was totally under control.

The health department had merely issued a precautionary advisory under The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which provides for special measures to prevent outbreak or spread of any dangerous epidemic disease.

“As of now, samples of two of the three persons who came from Italy to Hoshiarpur had been admitted in GMCH Amritsar after they tested positive in preliminary report of AIIMS, Delhi. The final reports were awaited from NIV, Pune, where the samples had been sent,” said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson made it clear that while the advisory notification, listing the preventive and precautionary measures, was issued in line with the decisions taken by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to ensure that the disease does not spread in the state, the government had not taken any decision to declare the disease an epidemic.

Notably, earlier in the day, the Health Minister had said that the State government has notified COVID-19 as an epidemic disease.

Mr. Sidhu also said: “Till date, 71,900 patients had been screened across the State, of these, 48,867 passengers at Amritsar Airport, 5,116 passengers at International Airport of Mohali, 5,401 passengers at Wagah-Attari Border check post and 12,516 passengers had been screened at Dera Baba Nanak check post.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hours-after-declaring-covid-19-as-an-epidemic-punjab-govt-reverses-stance/article31005380.ece
226,2020/03/07,63 villages in Odisha to pass resolutions against CAA,"The tribals are expected to get the resolutions passed at gram sabhas by March 15

Sixty-three tribal villages in Odisha’s Ganjam district are planning to pass resolutions in gram sabhas against the National Population Register (NPR), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

These villages are expected to get the resolutions passed by March 15, which will be sent to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Ganjam District Collector. The resolutions will urge the Odisha government to pass a resolution in the Assembly against these ‘anti-people’ laws of the Centre.

Organisations like Jan Jagran Abhiyan (JJA), Ganjam Zilla Gramsabha Samity (GZGS), Marjyadara Saha Banchibara Abhiyan (MSBA) that are opposing the NPR, the NRC, and the CAA have played a major role in motivating these tribals to conduct special gram sabha meetings.

230,2020/03/07,"‘Operation Money Bag, not Operation Lotus’","Large scale dissatisfaction among BJP workers in Madhya Pradesh leading to spending spree, alleges Digvijaya Singh

Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, who recently flagged a purported bid by the BJP to destabilise the Madhya Pradesh government by luring its MLAs, on Friday said there was “large scale dissatisfaction” among BJP workers in the State as they were caught in various scams, and were ready to shell out any amount of money as temptation.

“They [BJP leaders] gave thousands of crores worth contracts through e-tendering, and now the Economic Offences Wing is tightening its vice over them. Similarly, they indulged in a scam in Madhyam (Madhya Pradesh government's public relations agency) in which an FIR has been registered. So, they are worried and to save themselves, they are ready to spend any amount of money,” he told reporters in Bhopal.

Earlier this week on Monday, Mr. Singh had accused BJP leaders of luring its MLAs with offers of ₹25-₹35 crore to cross over, in an attempt to dislodge the Congress government.

“It was not ‘Operation Lotus’, but ‘Operation Money Bag’ involving big money bags,” the Congress leader said on Friday.

Mr. Singh dismissed Congress MLA Hardeep Singh Dang’s resignation on Thursday night, saying, “It is not his resignation, but a statement.”

Mr. Dang, legislator from Suwasra, in his resignation letter addressed to the Vidhan Sabha Speaker, had claimed Cabinet Ministers ignored his region while the Chief Minister paid no heed to his appeals. He is believed to be among the four MLAs suspected to be taken to Bengaluru by the BJP.

The Congress allegedly ‘rescued’ six MLAs from a Manesar hotel on Wednesday morning. On the remaining four returning to Bhopal, Mr. Singh said, “Where will they go? All MLAs are experienced, and they work as per their wisdom. No one is saving them, and no one is trapping them.”

Mr. Singh further asserted that the Congress government was entirely safe. “It is 100% safe. They said the government won’t last three months, but it’s been one and half years since it was formed.”

231,2020/03/07,M.P. must be known for principled politics: Kamal Nath,"The State should not be infamous for salable politicians, says Chief Minister

Chief Minister Kamal Nath said on Friday that Madhya Pradesh should not be infamous for “salable” politicians, but for principled politics based on service.

“We need to protect politics from downfall,” he said at a public event here. “We need to create such an identity of politics that we should be proud of.” When there was a downfall, everyone thought politicians were “salable”, could be suppressed. “But people must say a politician in Madhya Pradesh is not salable. They are into politics based on principles and service. This will invite investment, spurring economic activity,” he said.

His remarks come two days after the Congress said it foiled the BJP’s alleged attempt to woo some MLAs of the Congress, the BSP and the SP, besides Independents. Mr. Nath had backed Congress MP Digivijaya Singh’s charge that the BJP was trying to lure MLAs with crores of rupees.

Mr. Nath asked the public if the State should be known for mafia, the Bhopal gas tragedy, “or that kind of politics that we need to stay away from.”

He said the biggest challenge before the State was to secure the future of the youth. “If their future remains in darkness, how will development in Madhya Pradesh take place. Today’s youth do not want any commission, they want jobs. And this will be possible only when the State has an identity nationwide.” Investment would come to the State, he added, only if people had faith in it. “Our State must not be compared with smaller States, but with bigger ones.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c2ce1h/article31004991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAMALNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-must-be-known-for-principled-politics-kamal-nath/article31004992.ece

234,2020/03/07,Virus scare likely to affect tourism sector,"Coimbatore, which is the gateway to the Nilgiris and also attracts several domestic and foreign business visitors, is seeing a drop in visitors coming in because of COVID-19 scare world over.

The tourism sector is going to be affected a lot this summer, said the General Manager of a leading hotel here.

The average occupancy of hotels in the city is nearly 55 % and it is expected to fall further. Initially, it was feared that only the foreign travellers will cancel their visits. But, now, even domestic travellers do not want to travel outside the city. The cancellations started by the end of last month and is only getting worse, say sources in the hospitality sector.

With focus shifting to work on improving the personal immune system and taking precautions, hotels are finding it difficult to get sanitisers, even the premium brands. Further, earlier, sanitisers were placed only in certain locations. Now there are more sanitisers, in the lobbies, etc.

On the travel side, sources said leisure segment was affected largely. Italy is one of the favourite destinations in Europe for summer. However, people will not travel to Italy now. They are hesitant to travel to any European destination. Several international lines have grounded some of the flights, sources said.

People are being very cautious and are cancelling the vacations they planned, mainly to overseas destinations.

While there is a hope that part of this segment will look at shorter domestic vacations, the shift is yet to happen, the sources said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/virus-scare-likely-to-affect-tourism-sector/article31004790.ece
235,2020/03/07,No specific advisory for industries from industrial safety department,"Disposal of used masks will be a challenge, say officials

Even as there is panic buying of masks and hand sanitisers here and the prices of these have skyrocketed in the last few days, following reports of increasing number of COVID-19 cases globally, officials in the Department of Industrial Safety and Health clarified that they have not issued any specific advisory so far.

Handwashing

The State Government has not issued any specific direction or mandates so far on the precautions that industries should take against COVID-19. The Union Government has issued some dos and don’ts.

Proper and regular hand wash and covering the mouth will help, an official in the Department said.

If masks are to be used in large numbers, disposal of the used masks also need to be taken care of. The Governments have not issued any advice that masks should be used. If these are used and not disposed of properly, there can be more health issues, say sources in the industry.

Distribution of masks

One of the industry owners explained that distributing masks to workers would not be a problem. However, disposal will be. “We are already facing challenges in disposing of industrial waste,” the industry owner explained.

In engineering units, workers use a special soap to wash hands after work to clean the oil in the hands. If this waste water is not treated properly, the units face penalty. If masks are distributed, workers may dispose them of anywhere and it will become a challenge, the unit owner said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/w22imn/article31004783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06cbCoronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/no-specific-advisory-for-industries-from-industrial-safety-department/article31004784.ece
236,2020/03/07,COVID-19: units at SIDCO advised to provide masks to workers,"Suggestions given based on media reports, says Association

On Thursday evening, as the country reported 30 cases of COVID-19, the Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association issued guidelines to its members, asking them to provide N95 masks and hand sanitisers to the employees and workers at the units.

The Association also urged its members to create awareness among its staff and workers and to keep the premises clean.

P. Nallathambi, president of the Association, told The Hindu the suggestions were given based on media reports on how wearing masks and using hand sanitisers can protect people from virus. The SIDCO estate at Kurichi here has nearly 250 units, employing 4,000 to 5,000 workers. The guidelines were for the units so that the managements can provide the masks and sanitisers to the workers. On Friday, a handful of industries had followed the guidelines, he said. One of the industry owners at the SIDCO estate said that with specific reference to gear for protection against COVID-19, wearing of masks was not necessary in general engineering or foundry units as the shopfloor workers spend most of the time in a surrounding of high temperature. Hence, hardly any industry was adopting these measures. Probably, those units that have controlled temperature for the shopfloor would have to adopt safety measures.

V. Perumal of Coimbatore District General Engineering and Mechanical Workers' Union (CITU) said that in Kerala, the State Government had taken up the task of providing protection gear to the workers and creating awareness about COVID-19. In Tamil Nadu, if such guidelines were issued, the State Government, the industrial association, or the industry should take up the responsibility. An industry will employ workers in all categories - permanent, temporary, casual, etc. Not all of them can afford to buy masks, he said.

According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, the State was so far not affected by COVID-19. If such instructions were given to workers now, most of them are not likely to follow it. Even in micro units, workers generally used soap and washed their hands regularly even at the workplace because of the materials they handled.

R. Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries’ Association, said, “In many units the workers do not use the safety gears, such as shoes or helmets.” So, it may not be possible to convince the workers in small and medium-scale units to use masks.

At the International Engineering Sourcing Show that went on in the city from March 4, and had a large number of overseas visitors, the organisers had given hand sanitisers to all and used disinfectants on the premises (CODISSIA Trade Fair Complex) regularly. What is needed is awareness among workers, staff and the employers on the virus, how it spreads, and the precautions that can be taken at the personal level, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bowzar/article31004771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB07COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-units-at-sidco-advised-to-provide-masks-to-workers/article31004772.ece

The summer festival will conclude with the 62nd Fruit Show at the Sims Park in Coonoor which will be held over three days starting from May 29 and ending on May 31.

With the announcement of the dates, it means that the five shows will be held across 16 separate days over the month of May.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Subbaiyan said that the Department of Horticulture has already begun preparations to ensure that the five shows which will headline the summer festival season in Udhagamandalam will be a grand success.

“As this year will also mark 25 years since the opening of the Ooty Rose Garden, we have planned special events to mark the occasion,” said Mr. Subbaiyan.

Also present at the press conference was joint director of horticulture, Nilgiris, Sivasubramaniam Samraj.

Hoteliers, restaurateurs and business owners in the Nilgiris said that the biggest threat that could overshadow the summer festival this year is the global outbreak of COVID-19, with the number of foreign visitors to the district already witnessing a steady decline over the last few weeks.

Luxury hotels hit

Luxury hotels in the district have been the ones to have been affected, so far, the most.

Ismael Khan, Resident Director of the Gem Park Hotel in Udhagamandalam, said that the hotel had already seen cancellation of bookings by foreign tourists due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “All we can hope for is a swift containment of the outbreak that will lead to more people starting to travel again,” said Mr. Khan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ooty-flower-show-to-be-held-from-may-15-to-19/article31004704.ece

Bazaar Street, First Agraharam and Second Agraharam have been included in the first phase of smart road works. Though the traders welcomed the development works, they requested the civic body to complete the works at the earliest.

One of the traders said that at least 15% of trade had been affected in the area. Many people, including traders in the region, suffered injuries riding through the road which was in a bad shape.

The traders said that once the works were completed, the civic body must ensure that the road was not dug again unnecessarily.

Corporation Commissioner R.Sadheesh said that the smart road works on Bazaar Street and Chinna kadai Veedhi would be completed by March 15. Gravel had been laid and only final works had to be done.

The works at First and Second Agraharam would be completed immediately after this, he said.

The Corporation officials said the delay in completing works for various utility services had affected the progress of the road works.

The works were carried out only at night as the traders complained that the works in the day affected their business.

Lara’s name on the giant screen resulted in a roar going around the stadium. Wearing jersey No. 400, the left-hander hit the stride running against Zaheer. A slash to the point fence, followed by a drive through the line were fleeting glimpses which left the fans eager for more.

The scores: West Indies 150/8 in 20 overs (Shivnarine Chanderpaul 61, Darren Ganga 32, Zaheer Khan 2-30, Munaf Patel 2-24, Pragyan Ojha 2-27) lost to India 151/3 in 18.2 overs (Virender Sehwag 74 n.o., Sachin Tendulkar 36, Carl Hooper 2-19).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ivlnd9/article31011363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08SEWAG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/road-safety-world-series-sehwag-sachin-roll-the-clock-back/article31011364.ece
245,2020/03/07,Perry to undergo surgery,"Injured allrounder ruled out for six months

Star Australian allrounder Ellyse Perry has been ruled out of action for at least six months as she will undergo surgery on her injured hamstring next week.

It was during Australia final group game of the T20 World Cup against New Zealand that Perry got injured while trying an athletic throw in the field. “The timing has been good, I still get to come tomorrow and next week I’ll (have surgery),” Perry was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

“From my perspective, I’ve had the most incredible run, I’ve been very fortunate with injury for a long period of time,” she said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6yl2g1/article31011228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08ELLY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/perry-to-undergo-surgery/article31011229.ece
246,2020/03/07,Harmanpreet’s words stirred me up: Poonam,"It was a stinging rebuke from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur during the tournament opener against Australia that fired up Poonam Yadav, who eventually played an instrumental role in India’s march to its maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final.

The 28-year-old Indian has emerged as India’s wrecker-in-chief with nine wickets, including a four-wicket haul in the opening match.

“When I got hit for a six in the first over, she (Harmanpreet) came to me and said, ‘Poonam, you’re one of the most experienced players in the team, and we expect better from you’,” Poonam was quoted as saying by the ICC.

“So, that kind of stirred something within me. I told myself if my captain has that much faith in me, I should be able to make a comeback. I took a wicket off the very next ball, and haven’t looked back since.

“Now when I look back at that moment, it means so much in the context of my individual performance and run to the Final,” said the bowler from Agra.

India’s highest wicket-taker in T20 cricket, Poonam had missed the preceding Tri-Series, involving Australia, due to an injury on her left index finger.

Poonam said she used her time on the sidelines to analyse the weaknesses of her opponents which came in handy during the World Cup.

“I had not even played the Tri-Series, so thanks to the selectors for showing faith in me,” she said. “When I was on the sidelines, I worked quite hard knowing the quality of competition in the World Cup.

“So, I would watch a lot of videos of the Australian and England teams and tried to find out their weaknesses. My preparation that way was good, so despite the pressure, the nerves, I was able to do well,” she said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4rqdds/article31011221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08POONAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/harmanpreets-words-stirred-me-up-poonam/article31011222.ece
247,2020/03/07,Wasim Jaffer: A Nawab who stood out from the rest,"Wasim Jaffer carried on in the domestic circuit long after ending his international stint

More than 24 years ago even as Saurashtra’s batsmen were pounding the Mumbai bowlers on a placid Rajkot track in a Ranji Trophy league game, a Mumbai senior asked a rookie - playing his second First Class game - to egg the bowlers on and pressurise the batsmen a bit. The novice replied: “Woh sab theek hai but apna batting aayega kya (that’s fine but will we get to bat at all?).”

Appetite for runs

After Saurashtra declared at a gargantuan 595 for four, the rookie came out to open and scored an unbeaten 314. Wasim Jaffer had well and truly arrived, taking his appetite for runs from Mumbai’s maidans to the bigger stage.

Since then - and till he announced his retirement on Saturday after a glittering career turning out for Mumbai, India and Vidarbha - Jaffer has continued in the same vein. But more than the plethora of records he has notched up - especially in the Ranji Trophy - Jaffer has inspired both his contemporaries and the next generation, especially those who worship the purest form of cricket.

Jaffer’s rise in itself is an inspirational tale. The son of a bus driver, he grew up in a transit camp near the Bandra reclamation. Jaffer would bat for endless hours on an open plot off the seaside.

His rise to being an opener for India - and also be a part of nine Ranji titles - may seem seamless but that is the result of astonishing hardwork put in over the years to be at his best.

The last

With Jaffer’s retirement, perhaps, comes the end of an era of domestic giants. He may well be the last of those who continued to ply their trade on the domestic circuit for years after ending their international sojourn.

He persisted with what he loved doing the most - batting long hours and passing on his work ethic to youngsters - for more than a decade since his last international appearance.

Seldom will you see any cricketer from the IPL generation returning to domestic cricket after being dropped from the national team. That is where Nawab - as Jaffer is fondly called by teammates - stood out from the rest.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5uta1p/article31011064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08JAFF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wasim-jaffer-a-nawab-who-stood-out-from-the-rest/article31011066.ece

Opening batsman Janneman Malan was on Saturday added to South Africa’s squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series in India on the back of his strong show against Australia.

Malan will be part of a 16-man squad which will depart for India from here on Sunday.

“Proteas opening batsman, Janneman Malan has been included into the team’s ODI tour to India. They will now travel with a 16-man squad for the three-match series taking place in Dharamshala, Lucknow and Kolkata,” Cricket South Africa said.

“The team departs for India tomorrow morning,” it added.

The series begins in Dharamshala on Thursday, followed by matches in Lucknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18).

The 23-year-old was not included in the squad which was announced last Monday after being dismissed first ball on his ODI debut against Australia.

249,2020/03/07,SA vs Aus | Labuschagne ton in vain as South Africa sweep series 3-0,"Applauded by a large group of his South African family at Senwes Park, Labuschagne made 108 in an Australian total of 254 for seven after they were sent in to bat.

Australian Marnus Labuschagne's first one-day international century proved to be in vain as South Africa breezed to a six-wicket victory in Potchefstroom on Saturday and a clean sweep of the three-match series.

After being sent in to bat, Australia posted a below-par 254 for 7 in their 50 overs, with South African-born Labuschagne hitting a run-a-ball 108 to bolster an otherwise mediocre effort from the visitors.

The home side always looked in control of their chase, JJ Smuts playing the anchor role with a career-best 84 and ably supported by other new faces Kyle Verreynne (50) and Heinrich Klaasen (68 not out) as they romped to victory with 27 balls remaining.

South Africa continued their recent dominance of Australia in this format having won 11 of their last 12 ODI meetings dating back to 2016.

“We have not been at our best, we have been good in patches and then let our foot off the gas,” Australia captain Aaron Finch said at the post-match presentation.

“Credit to South Africa, they put us under pressure with bat and ball. We only took 12 wickets in the series, but all round we have not been at our best.”

Australia struggled to get going in their innings, managing just 39 in the first 10 overs for the loss of David Warner (4), and were three down for the addition of another 16 runs as South Africa picked up the key wickets of Steve Smith (20) and Finch (22).

Finch was a debut wicket for South African seamer Daryn Dupavillon (1-21), who was in the team after the home side rested the spearhead of their attack, Lungi Ngidi.

Labuschagne set about rebuilding the innings, though, as he put on 81 for the fourth wicket with D'Arcy Short (36) and 53 for the fifth with Mitchell Marsh (32).

He reached his maiden ODI century off exactly 100 balls, much to his delight and that of a sizeable group of family and friends in the stands.

South Africa's chase came at a good rate, with Smuts's 84 coming off 98 balls, including 12 fours, before he fell with his hundred, and victory, in sight.

He added 96 with Verreynne for the third wicket, a partnership that laid the platform for a comfortable victory as man of the series Klaasen smashed the winning runs with a six to take his tally in the three matches to 242.

It is a “no brainer” that the ICC should introduce reserve days for all World Cup knockout matches, including the men’s T20 showpiece later this year, Australian quick Mitchell Starc said on Saturday.

England women’s team was left aggrieved on Thursday after its semifinal clash against India was washed out without a ball being bowled and it sent India into the summit clash due to their top finish in the group stage.

“In my opinion, it’s a no-brainer,” Starc was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

“I’m sure if both games were washed out, everyone would be barking mad at the ICC for no reserve days. Considering it’s a double-header, there’s obviously no downside for either team with turnaround for time between finals.”

Starc left Australia’s tour of South Africa midway to watch his wife Alyssa Healy play in the T20 World Cup final against India.

“I only heard the other day that it’s the same (rules) for ours,” he said.

“It’s not for me to change the rules. It’s up to the ICC. If that’s the way they go for our World Cup, I think it needs to be looked at for World Cups and all world events going forward.”

252,2020/03/07,PCB chief Ehsan Mani admits Asia Cup T20 will be held at neutral venue,"BCCI president Sourav Ganguly had earlier said that India can’t play in Pakistan - the designated host country - due to security concerns

Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Ehsan Mani on Saturday said the Asia Cup T20 later this year will be held at a neutral venue, virtually endorsing BCCI President Sourav Ganguly’s statement that the tournament will be held in Dubai.

A few days back, Mani had disagreed with Ganguly who had said that India can’t play in Pakistan - the designated host country - due to security concerns and that the Asia Cup will be held in the UAE. But, Mani on Saturday made the U-turn from his earlier stated position.

“We have to keep in mind the interests of Associate members of the Asian Cricket Council. We can’t be stubborn and insist we will host the tournament in Pakistan because India is not willing to come to Pakistan. The option is it will be held at a neutral venue but that has to be decided by the ACC members,” Mani told the media in Islamabad.

Ganguly had noted that in 2018 when India was to host the tournament, it was held in the UAE because Pakistan could not play in India.

Asked where the Asia Cup would be held in September, Mani said this will be decided by the ACC when it meets later this month.

“No decision has been taken on whether it will be held in UAE or Bangladesh,” he said.

The ACC was due to meet in Dubai last week but the meeting was postponed because of the coronavirus fears.

The ACC is now due to meet later this month to decide the venue for the event in September.

Broadcasting crew

Interestingly, while appearing before the National Assembly Standing Committee on inter-provincial affairs in Islamabad on Friday, Mani claimed that if Indian broadcasting/production crew was not involved, it would become impossible to show live the Pakistan Super League matches.

He also made it clear that the State-owned Pakistan Television Corporation did not have the facilities or trained manpower to show PSL or international matches live. He also conceded that the opening ceremony of the PSL-5 in Karachi had been a disappointment and was not up to the mark.

Australia are focussing not only on the wily Poonam Yadav but preparing to take on India’s spin-heavy attack by practising against “slow spinners” ahead of Sunday’s Women’s T20 World Cup final.

Poonam had bamboozled Australia in the opening game, snapping four wickets to power India to a 17-run win but skipper Meg Lanning urged her side to brace up for other threats including the left-arm Indian bowlers.

“It’s not just Poonam we need to worry about. They’ve got some really good left-armers too, such as Rajeshwari Gayakwad. They’ve got a really strong line-up right through their bowlers and they have spinners who can change their pace,” Lanning said.

“We will be facing some slow spinners at training. We’ll be as prepared as we can be and making sure we adjust to what’s happening at the time.”

India’s batting also boasts of young Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana besides all-rounder Deepti Sharma and Lanning said her bowling unit has to make the necessary adjustments when coming across India’s good batting unit.

“Obviously Smriti Mandhana is a world-class player too and Deepti Sharma has also played well against us. We feel our bowling line-up can adjust to different things,” she said.

“We are very well prepared for what the game will throw at us. It’s going to be a tough, hard battle tomorrow against India but I feel we are as ready as we can be to take it on.”

Four-time champions Australia are no stranger to title wins. Lanning herself had guided the team to glory at the last edition in 2018 but the skipper said it will be the “toughest battle” and “biggest moment” of her career when she walks out to a sold-out crowd at the MCG.

“We’re not coming just to put on a good show. We’re coming here to win and that’s the attitude we’re going in with. It’s been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I’ve not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,” she said.

Former India opener Wasim Jaffer on Saturday announced retirement from all forms of cricket, drawing curtains on his illustrious career spanning over two decades.

The 42-year-old Jaffer has played 31 Tests and scored 1,944 runs with an average of 34.11. He has five hundreds and 11 fifties in the longest format, with 212 as his highest score.

“First of all, I would like to thank The Almighty Allah, who gave me the talent to play this beautiful game. I’d like to also thank my family - my parents and brothers for encouraging me to pursue the sport as a profession and my wife, who left a cosy life of England to create a lovely home for our children and me,” he said in a statement.

“A special thanks to all my coaches, right from my school days to professional cricket, for helping me polish my skills. A heartfelt thanks to the selectors who showed faith in me,” added Jaffer, who is the highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy.

The veteran opener is also one of the few Indian batsmen, who has a double hundred in the West Indies. He made 212 against the hosts in St Lucia.

Jaffer, who made his Test debut in 2000 and ODI against South Africa in 2006, is, however, remembered for his feats in domestic cricket, particularly the Ranji Trophy.

He became the first batsman to score 12,000 runs in Ranji Trophy, the coveted domestic tournament in India.

The right-handed batsman played for Mumbai for most part of his career and then also represented Vidarbha. He is also the first player to play in 150 Ranji Trophy matches.

“My gratitude to all the captains I played under and all my colleagues from whom I learnt so much about the game and shared some lifelong memories. I would also like to thank all the support staff who were a constant pillar of support in my long journey,” said the Mumbaikar.

Known for his stylist shots, especially the cover drives, Jaffer was nemesis of the bowlers, who tormented them with his patient knocks.

A forced eight-day break has affected India’s preparations going into the Women’s T20 World Cup final on Sunday but the team is ready to rise to occasion in front a record crowd at the MCG, said skipper Harmanpreet Kaur.

An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden T20 World Cup summit clash after their last-four clash against England was washed out on Thursday.

India had defeated Sri Lanka in their last game on Saturday, followed by a semifinal washout, which meant the visitors haven’t played for the last eight days and Harmanpreet conceded her team has been ‘restless’.

“We haven’t been outdoors much and we didn’t manage to play the important game against England,” said Kaur on the eve of the final against record four-time champions Australia.

“We were all in touch and doing indoor training, but it doesn’t give you full confidence because the surface is totally different. Everyone was in good touch and thinking what they can do for the team.

“We did get rest also because when you’re playing for a long time, you need a break. No-one wanted to take rest, everyone was so keen, everyone was on the ground and ready to deal with the situation.”

Over 75,000 tickets have been sold for the finals and Harmanpreet said her team will look to enjoy the big stage and play positive cricket.

“It’s a great feeling. It’s the first time we’re going to see 90,000 people in the stadium and we’re really looking positive for that,” said Harmanpreet, who has played in front of a sold-out crowd in the 2017 Cricket World Cup Final against England at Lord’s.

“We are used to playing when a lot of crowd is around us. Sometimes there’s no noise going around in the stadium so we need to keep an eye on each of us. It’s a big moment.

“Rather than thinking about what is going to trouble us, it’s only about being there, enjoying the moment and giving our best.”

India had defeated Australia by 17 runs in the opening match of the tournament but Harmanpreet said it would be a fresh start for the two teams.

“One thing, we have to keep in mind Sunday is a fresh day, a fresh start. We have to start from ball one,” he said.

“We’ve done quite well in the league games. Both teams are under pressure and both are capable of winning.”

Australia eyes fifth title

Australian captain Meg Lanning says her team are ""pumped"" for their defence of the women's Twenty20 World Cup against India on Sunday with hopes high that more than 90,000 fans will cram the cavernous Melbourne Cricket Ground.

They go into the final as favourites, courtesy of being the sport's dominant side, winning four of the six tournaments so far, in contrast to Harmanpreet Kaur's India, who are in their first decider.

But with large numbers of Indian fans expected in the 100,000-capacity arena, there will be little in the way of home advantage.

Organisers have set their sights on beating the official world attendance record for a women's sporting fixture on Sunday, to coincide with International Women's Day.

That was set at the 1999 football World Cup final, when 90,185 watched the United States beat China at the Rose Bowl in California.

While widely accepted as the benchmark, an estimated 110,000 are said to have attended the Mexico-Denmark women's World Cup Championships final in 1971, but it was not a sanctioned event.

Pop superstar Katy Perry, who this week revealed she is pregnant, has been recruited to help get punters through the turnstiles, performing before and after the game.

""It seems like it has sort of fallen into place a little bit, and Sunday is going to be massive,"" said Lanning ahead of Australia playing their sixth successive final.

""So hopefully there is 90,000 people there. Everything's been done that could possibly be done, and we're just really pumped we get to be out in the middle and play in front of everyone.""

The final will be a repeat of the tournament opener, when India upset Australia by 17 runs after leg-spinner Poonam Yadav ran riot.

It made every game afterwards a virtual must-win for Lanning's team, and they rose to the task despite tournament-ending injuries to Tayla Vlaeminck and Ellyse Perry.

After beating Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, they edged New Zealand before overcoming South Africa in a nerve-shredding and rain-affected semi-final.

""It's been a hard road, certainly not smooth, but we've given ourselves a chance,"" said Lanning, who is wary of the threat posed by India.

""They're a class side, they've been playing excellent cricket through the tournament.""

Andre Russell hit six sixes in a blistering 14-ball innings as West Indies smashed their way to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and seal the two-match Twenty20 series on Friday.

West Indies’ bowlers limited Sri Lanka to 155 for six and then Brandon King struck 43 off 21 balls and Russell made 40 off just 14 balls as West Indies raced to 158 for three in 17 overs.

“We are peaking at the right time, but we still have some areas to work on,” said Russell whose appearances have been limited by a series of injuries in recent months.

The 31-year-old frequently rubbed his shoulder during his smash-and-grab innings in which he hit one ball out of the Pallekele ground.

No batsman has hit six sixes in so few balls in a T20 international.

Young opener King also sparkled with the bat, making 43 off 21 balls, including eight boundaries.

“The young man is finding his feet in international cricket. Russell finished it off and the bowlers were brilliant,” said West Indies captain Keiron Pollard who was elated at getting back to winning ways after suffering a whitewash in the three-match one-day series against Sri Lanka.

Dasun Shanaka was the pick of the Sri Lankan batsmen hitting an unbeaten 31 off 24 balls.

But captain Lasith Malinga admitted his side had managed a poor total.

With 12 games before going to the World T20 in Australia in October, Malinga said his team needed to “find consistency and confidence.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/embztc/article31004384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRILANKAWESTINDIESCRICKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/russells-six-sixes-in-14-balls-leads-west-indies-to-series-win-over-sri-lanka/article31004385.ece

261,2020/03/07,2-day verification drive to release financial aid to begin on March 7,"1,700 forms received till Friday afternoon, says Deputy CM

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said that the Delhi government would launch a two-day verification drive to release monetary compensation to riot-affected families of north-east Delhi on March 7.

The government has received 1,700 compensation forms till Friday afternoon and teams would be formed to check the claims, he said, adding that six senior IAS officers will be heading the two-day verification drive.

“Restoration and rehabilitation work is going on at a very fast pace and SDMs have been deployed at different parts of the violence-hit region. Compensation forms are being given out to the grieving families and on the basis of these forms, the process of providing monetary compensation to the affected families has started,” the Deputy CM said. He added that ₹25,000 has already been given out as an immediate relief and after verification of compensation forms, the entire amount would be given.

Mr. Sisodia said that the government is facing an issue of duplication of forms and therefore, the verification drive will be an important exercise. “Our effort is to give full monetary relief to the people as soon as possible so that they can get their lives back on track,” he added.

Compensation enhanced

The government has decided that each floor of a house will be treated as one residential unit and ₹5 lakh as relief money will be given to each unit, out of which ₹4 lakh is for restructuring of the house and ₹1 lakh for belongings if the entire house is charred or burnt, said Mr. Sisodia.

“In case of substantial damage to the house, ₹2.5 lakh will be provided out of which ₹2 lakh is for restructuring of the house and ₹50,000 for the belongings, if that has been damaged too,” he said.

Monetary relief of ₹5 lakh will be provided to schools as well (with less than 1,000 students) if they suffered damage during the riots. Schools with more than 1,000 students will be given a cash relief of ₹10 lakh, the government announced.

After visiting camps in Mustafabad, Cabinet Minister Gopal Rai said that people living in camps had to face difficulties because of the rain and that AAP volunteers had been working to provide comfort to those living there. “Ninety per cent of the riot victims have filled up the compensation forms and the amount will be disbursed shortly,” Mr. Rai said.

Mr. Gopal Rai said that it has come to his notice that many riot-affected people are finding it difficult to lodge an FIR with the police station concerned and he has spoken to the SHOs and DCPs to solve the problem and to accelerate the filing of FIR so that they can receive compensation at the earliest.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rqa5s3/article31005089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL07-BHAJANPURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2-day-verification-drive-to-release-financial-aid-to-begin-on-march-7/article31005090.ece
262,2020/03/07,Ashok Nagar residents wait for compensation to rebuild lives,"They claim that no one checked on them and all they have done is fill up forms

In a narrow bylane behind the Masjid Maula Baksh in Ashok Nagar, four houses, now completely burnt and looted by rioters on February 25, remain hidden. The occupants of the houses have shifted elsewhere with their relatives and are waiting for adequate relief material and compensation before their lives are restored.

Brothers Shoaib and Feroze, who owned a shop a few metres from their house, said that the mob burnt the shop as well. The shop was adjacent to the mosque which was attacked, they said.

“Since the incident took place we have been staying with our relatives in Welcome. Government officials come here daily and make us fill forms. But what about the compensation? The documentation process itself is taking such a long time. Earlier we were told that no documents are required to make the claims but now officers are saying that it is mandatory. If that is the case, by the time we get the documents redone, months will have passed. What do we do till then?” asked Shoaib.

No relief material has also reached the area, he said.

Where to go?

“It is only in other areas that the relief material are being sent. Nobody has even bothered to check on us. Soon our relatives will also ask us to leave. With large families and small houses how long can we possibly live with them?” Shoaib, who has a family of 10, asked.

Feroze, his brother, added, “Our shop is also gone. How do we restart our lives again? All that we have done till now is filling of forms.”

Unlocking a recently installed main door, Mohammad Sharib, a second year undergraduate student, walks into what was the family’s kitchen till around a week ago, now reeking of the burnt belongings.

“We had gone to Meerut to attend a wedding. Then on Tuesday we got a call saying that our house had been burnt. When we came back the next day, everything was gone,” the student of Delhi University’s School of Open Learning said.

Police inaction

Recounting of what took place when the mobs charged, Khurshid Alam, a battery rickshaw driver said: “Some of the people from the Masjid came to my house for shelter through the terrace when the attacks began. We kept calling the police but they were non-responsive. It was only after we contacted someone we knew in the police force that they came to rescue us. Later when we were at the police station, we got to know that our houses had been burnt.”

“The people who are behind the violence are now sleeping peacefully and look at what we have been reduced to. Why can’t the authorities come here, see the damage and give us the full compensation?” asked Shoaib.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aus7u6/article31005083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL07-ASHOKNAGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ashok-nagar-residents-wait-for-compensation-to-rebuild-lives/article31005084.ece
263,2020/03/07,Tahir Hussain sent to seven-day police custody,"He was arrested on Thursday in connection with alleged killing of IB staffer

A Delhi court on Friday sent suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain to seven day police custody in connection with the alleged killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer Ankit Sharma during the recent violence in north-east Delhi.

Hussain was produced before the duty Magistrate Rakesh Kumar amid tight security. He was arrested on Thursday after a court here dismissed his plea seeking to surrender before it in connection with the case.

A police officer said that Hussain will be taken to the warehouse where chemical substance stored on cold drink bottles was recovered and stone-pelting happened.

“We will take him to the place where he had been after the violence. He claimed to be in Chand Bagh area and was hiding at a house,” said the officer.

During interrogation, Hussain was asked about his hideouts during the run. Hussain claimed that he is innocent and have no idea about the miscreants who pelted stones from his building at the crowd. He refused to identify Ankit.

“Two of his mobile phones are yet to be recovered. The last location of his mobile phones were at Zakir Nagar. He claimed that he had lost his phone during the violence,” said the officer.

The officer added that around five people who were spotted on the terrace of Hussain have been identified from videos of the violence.

264,2020/03/07,PCR line went down on Feb. 24 due to traffic,"Control room received 4,500 calls on that day and 6,000 the next day: police officer

There was panic in the Police Control Room (PCR) of north-east district after it went down for several hours due to high volume of distress calls on February 24, when riots broke out in several parts of the district, said a police officer.

The officer informed that on February 24, they received more than 4,500 PCR calls and the number of such calls was 6,000 on February 25. Most of the calls were from Bhajanpura area, he added.

When a call lands on the PCR, it gets transferred to the nearest PCR van and the district PCR. Both the teams reach to the person in distress. On any other day, a district PCR receives about 350 calls on an average but during the violence, there was a sudden increase in PCR calls, the officer said.

“On February 24 and 25, we had moved staff from other desks to the north-east desk to transfer calls immediately, but it was not working on the ground because policemen were unable to reach out to callers due to safety and security reasons,” said the officer.

He added that most of the callers reported incidents of violence, arson, vandalism, firing, assault and stone-pelting.

Call status

The status of most of the PCR calls remained pending because the PCR vans and staff from the local police station were unable to respond. There was so much violence all over the place and it was impossible for a couple of policemen to control the situation. “We needed reinforcement to enter the area in order to respond to the callers,” he added.

The calls were received from Bhajanpura, Dayalpur, Karawal Nagar, Khajuri Khas, Jaffrabad and Jyoti Nagar police stations of the north-east district.

In any district control room, usually a staff of around 12 people work in a shift. But whenever any important call (like riot, rape or murder) lands, it is also transferred to the senior police officers of the district concerned.

During riots, Delhi Fire Services (DFS) also refused to attend calls due to safety and security reasons. A fire engine was torched and a fire operator suffered injuries when a mob attacked a DFS team on the way to attend a fire call.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/iwwxm2/article31005068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL07-SECURITY2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pcr-line-went-down-on-feb-24-due-to-traffic/article31005069.ece

The Delhi High Court directed all government hospitals to videograph the post-mortem of those killed during the communal violence in north-east Delhi last week.

A Bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and I.S. Mehta asked authorities to collect and preserve DNA samples from all the bodies, and not to dispose of any unidentified body till March 11, the next date of hearing.

The High Court’s directions came while hearing a habeas corpus petition by a man seeking details of his brother-in-law who went missing during the riots. Twenty-five-year-old Hamza went missing on February 26 evening.

During the hearing, the police informed the court that Hamza’s body was recovered from a drain in Bhagirathi Vihar on March 2 and his autopsy would be conducted during the day at the RML Hospital.

266,2020/03/07,New video of men firing from terrace surfaces,"In another video which went viral, DCP and his team were seen being thrashed by a mob

While relief measures are in full swing to bring back normalcy in north-east Delhi, a blame game is being played out on social media with the release of several videos recorded during the violence.

On Friday, a new video has surfaced where a group of men were seen firing from the terrace of a nursing home at the crowd below in Yamuna Vihar area.

In the video, a man in a black jacket and wearing a helmet is clearly seen firing at the crowd below while unmasked people standing next to him were pelting stones.

A video of the February 24 violence had gone viral on the social media on Thursday in which Shahdara DCP Amit Sharma and other policemen were seen being thrashed by a mob that includes women on Wazirabad Road near Chand Bagh. It was at the same place where head constable Ratan Lal was killed.

In a two-minute video, a team of policemen, including Mr. Sharma, was seen attacked by a mob from left and right. The police team could not move back because of a five-feet high central verge and they got trapped in heavy stone-pelting.

“Four-five men pushed me down and removed my helmet and hit my head with rods. They only left me when I was unmovable, thinking that I was dead,” said a policeman.

Alok Kumar, Joint CP (Eastern Range) said that the people who were part of unlawful assembly will be identified and arrested, he added.

6 bodies unidentified

Meanwhile, out of the 53 bodies, six remained unidentified on Friday. The DNA sample of the bodies have been preserved and it will be matched with the families of missing persons, said the police.

During riots, a total of 44 people were reported missing. Many of them came back or killed or were found injured in the hospital, they added.

683 FIRs registered

“We have registered a total of 683 FIRs in connection with the communal clash. Forty eight cases are under Arms Act and 1,983 people have been detained. In order to restore normalcy and peace, Delhi Police had conducted 251 Aman committee meetings with members from both the communities,” said a police officer.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/new-video-of-men-firing-from-terrace-surfaces/article31005059.ece
267,2020/03/07,Riot victims spent sleepless night at Mustafabad camp,"They struggle to stay put as rains compounded their problems

Victims of the communal violence staying at Idgah relief camp in Mustafabad had to spent the whole night awake as their mattresses became wet due to the rain.

Nafeesa, a resident of Shiv Vihar, said that though water didn’t enter the tents, all their mattresses got wet as the tents were open. “All through the night, I, my daughters and many others stayed up or laid down on the centre where the mattresses were not extremely wet. It is becoming increasingly tough,” she said, adding, “I don’t know when we can go back to our houses. I am still scared.”

Nafeesa, a widow, ensures that her two teenage daughters are by her side all the time to “ensure their safety”.

A 20-year-old woman, who did not wish to be named, said that volunteers working at the camp helped them as much as they could. “They brought wooden planks and put them under the mattresses to raise it from the ground level. In the morning, when sun came out, we left the mattresses out to dry and brought them back later in the day,” she said.

Cleanliness factor

The streets leading to the Idgah are completely flooded and the sewage is getting mixed with rainwater, said Laik Ahmad from Doctors Unity Welfare Association.

Ahmad said the sanitation staff have been avoiding the area due to fear of violence. “Locals have been making efforts to clean the compound, mobile toilets and the trash but they are not professionals,” he said.

While rain has compounded their problems, at one corner of the room sat children surrounded by young volunteers. They were trying to bring the smiles back on the kid’s faces. The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has organised a ‘Reading Mela’ where children are engaged in reading, writing, drawing and story-telling, to distract them.

Holding a notebook, Lucky (12), said that he enjoys the time at the ‘mela’ as he gets to spend hours drawing. “I drew three pictures yesterday [Thursday] but someone stole my drawing book,” he complained.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has directed schools to take a host of preventive measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 that included suspension of morning assembly, putting on display a list of do’s and don’ts on the notice boards and other prominent places and appointing nodal officers at the school level for implementing the government’s decision.

The DoE has also advised schools to withhold biometric attendance for staff till further orders.

The government on Thursday ordered the closure of all primary schools here till March 31 as students of nursery and primary classes, they said, were too young to understate the risks associated with COVID-19. Students of secondary school, however, who have to continue attending school, have been advised to follow a list of measures.

“Preventive measures are important to stop the spread of this disease and schools must sensitise the students and staff about preventive interventions, such as frequent handwashing and respiratory etiquette like covering mouth while sneezing and coughing,” the DoE said.

Class teachers have been asked to keep a close watch on children for symptoms like fever and difficulty in breathing and to immediately inform the parents in case they spot any in order to get the child tested.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/doe-to-schools-take-steps-to-stop-spread-of-covid-19/article31005014.ece

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) from Global Alliance for Human Rights (GAHR), a non-profit organisation, on Friday said that they were planning to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek his help in protecting the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, improve their access to quality treatment, care and support services and demand their inclusion in the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.

“Many are dying due to unaffordable treatment, especially during shortage of drugs. Often, doctors refuse to treat patients and do not conduct surgeries due to the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS or because PLHIVs cannot afford to pay,” said Brijesh Dubey, chairman of GAHR.

Quoting the annual report data of National Aids Control Organisation, Mr. Dubey said that there are approximately 68,000 AIDS-related deaths per year in India and emphasised on the necessity to pay immediate attention to the problem.

Rani, a transgender said, “If my community comes to know that I am HIV-positive they will not support me. Survival will be difficult. Thus we need to be included in the Ayushman Bharat scheme.”

Anjali Gopalan, executive director of Naz Foundation, said that over 500 HIV-positive people were scheduled to travel to Delhi to meet the PM on International Women’s Day on March 8 for submission of their plea, but the number has reduced to 50 owing to the fear of spread of COVID-19.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/people-with-hiv-plan-to-meet-prime-minister/article31004999.ece

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday turned down the interim bail plea for the juvenile delinquent accused in the case of murder of a student of a private school here. The juvenile, in an application through his father, had sought interim bail for 45 days to take Class XII exams through National Institute of Open Schooling.

Saying that the “present application was partly allowed”, Judge Arvind Singh Sangwan ordered the Director (Evaluation), National Institute of Open Schooling, New Delhi, to change the centre of examination of the petitioner forthwith.

273,2020/03/07,"Riot victims return to Shiv Vihar, find homes looted or in a shambles","Families start stepping out of shelters, relief camps to pick up the pieces

Sanjeeda Beghum (33) finally gathered the courage to step out of a relief camp and returned to her Shiv Vihar residence on Friday morning only to find it in a shambles. Her jewellery and television set had been looted.

Shabana (35), who was at Idgah ground relief camp, said she was still scared to return home. She lived in a rented accommodation. She said her husband told her that they could not return home as the “situation was still not normal”.

RAF officials have been manning the streets leading to Shiv Vihar, one of the areas in north-east Delhi which witnessed the worst incidents of violence. While the streets were initially empty, one can now spot people slowly trying to rebuild houses they had left behind over 10 days ago.

However, there is still a sense of fear and insecurity among the residents.

Outside a temple near gali number 7, a group of young men were heard talking about the recent riots . “Hum kisi ko kuch nahi keh rahe hai. Jisko aana hai aaye, jisko nahi aana hai, na aaye. Lekin woh kuch kahenge toh fir pitenge [We are not saying anything to anyone. Whoever wants to come can come. Who doesn’t want to come, should not come. But if they speak up, we will thrash them again],” said a man who appeared to be in his early 20s and said he lived inside the temple. “Unhe bhi to pata lage ke Hindu bhi kuch hain [They should realise that the Hindus are powerful],” said another.

Sanjeeda, another resident of the area, said she had fled on February 25. Though the family had returned to the house, the members were not sure if they should stay there at night.

“We came here at 7 a.m. and found that the mob which entered the house did not set it on fire, but stole the TV set, gold jewellery and other valuables. They even took the vegetables that we had stocked in the house before the riots,” she said.

Ms. Sanjeeda said that her two brothers-in-law had come to check on their house a few days ago but one of them was caught by a mob and beaten up. “Initially, right after the riots, it was risky. But now the situation has improved. Our immediate neighbours are Hindus and they saved my brother-in-law from the mob,” she said, adding that she could gather the courage to return because a lot of others were also coming back. “It rained last night. For how long could we have stayed in camps or at relatives’ houses?”

Jamaluddin Mansuri was spotted outside his burnt and looted residence in gali number 20 where BSES officials were working to restore electricity. Mr. Mansuri recalled how he and his three sons were attacked by a mob on February 27 when they had come to check on the house. “A group of 20-25 people caught hold of us and started thrashing us. They did not want us to return. They pushed a rod inside my son’s foot. Eventually, a police van arrived and they fled,” said Mr. Mansuri who also had a bandage on his left foot.

Yasmeen (50) has been staying at her house only during the day for the last three days. She does not feel safe at night and therefore leaves for her brother’s house. “We built this three-storey house a year-and-a-half ago. I had taken loans from my siblings and I am still in debt,” she said, standing outside the house which was reduced to ashes.

Other locals, including Raziya and Habib-Ur-Rehman, who live in rented accommodations and had come to check on their houses, said they would eventually return but were scared at the moment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riot-victims-return-to-shiv-vihar-find-homes-looted-or-in-a-shambles/article31004946.ece
274,2020/03/07,"Delhi violence | When the Centre cannot hold — on communal fault lines, state apathy and hope that lingers amidst despair","In the worst communal violence in recent times, mobs went on a rampage in north-east Delhi for two days, killing 53 people and destroying homes, schools and shops. Bindu Shajan Perappadan and Anuradha Raman report on the communal fault lines, state apathy, and the hope that lingers amidst the despair

On February 27 afternoon, a few days after deadly riots rocked north-east Delhi, the busy marketplace of Maujpur is deserted. On the road lies a shoe and some charred clothes, reminders of the violence three days earlier. A tea shop, singled out and vandalised, is shut. “Ab yeh hain toh shanti hai (now that they are here there is peace),” says the owner, Wasim Khan, pointing to the men in varying shades of khaki and blue who are keeping vigil in the neighbourhood. Apart from the Delhi Police, personnel of the Rapid Action Force march in small batches in what is often referred to as an area domination exercise to secure peace. Khan is grateful that he is alive.

On February 24, an agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) quickly spiralled out of control when both CAA supporters and protesters ran amok in the neighbouring colonies of Maujpur. Jaffrabad, Shiv Vihar, Mustafabad, Chand Bagh, Brijpuri, Babarpur, Karawal Nagar, Khajoori Khas and Yamuna Vihar are all infamous — together these areas have lost 53 people to the violence; 250 are injured.

Delhi violence | Looted, burnt out homes offer little welcome to Shiv Vihar’s riot victims

In the vast, squalid urban sprawl that is north-east Delhi, pockmarked with open drains, Swachh Bharat is a distant dream. The development plank of the re-elected Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) does not resonate here. There are no tarred roads, only galis (streets) with numbers. They are often referred to as ‘20 foota’ and ‘25 foota’, indicating the width of a particular lane. Migrants from the populous States of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar live in these areas that are chock-a-block with houses and shops.

On February 24 and 25, as rioters from the Hindu and Muslim communities, armed with swords, guns, stones, rods and bricks, targeted shops, madrasas, masjids, schools, vehicles, and people, both the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government in Delhi and the Narendra Modi-led BJP government in the Centre simply watched.

Khan speaks softly. His lips quiver and his fingers shake as he talks of his shop being vandalised and his refrigerator being emptied out in the dark of the night. “I have no enemies,” he says. His neighbours in the marketplace say Khan will sell his shop soon and move out of the area.

Further ahead is Gonda Chowk where the skeletons of buses and auto-rickshaws lie on the road. Suddenly, there is a huge explosion. A thick plume of smoke goes up in a house behind a departmental store. In moments, the wail of a fire engine pierces the day. The sound is enough for everyone to down the shutters. In a battery-operated auto-rickshaw, a man whispers as he shares with us an incendiary WhatsApp message: “Wait till Friday”.

Friday, February 28, goes off peacefully. The faithful offer their prayers.

In several ways, that terrible week of February was a week of many firsts. For the first time in the history of independent India, a U.S. President’s visit to the country coincided with the worst communal violence in recent times. For the first time in recent memory, schools were targeted and burnt; ambulances were denied access to the grievously injured; and journalists were beaten up. The State and Central governments offered little help to the battered, setting off questions about why there was not even a semblance of control as marauding mobs took over the streets. In Votes and Violence, Steven Wilkinson wrote, “Abundant comparative evidence shows that large-scale ethnic rioting does not take place where a state’s army or police force is ordered to stop it using all means necessary.” From all accounts, for the first 26 hours since the riots began, the police did not do their duty. Instead, they watched as property was destroyed and people were lynched. Sometimes, shockingly, a few even participated in the violence.

Stabbed, burnt, shot

D.M.A. Anwar is supervising all those who walked into Al-Hind Hospital. A week after the riots, a ramp built in the hospital to facilitate the movement of wheelchairs is overflowing with people. People thronged Al-Hind Hospital in Mustafabad soon after the violence broke out. Anwar recalls how over 500 patients, just the first lot, were brought to the multi-storey building on the first two days alone. The number swelled over the next few days. “We have only 15 beds and five staff members. But people kept coming, so we just spread out bedsheets and carpets on the floor to accommodate the victims. There was blood everywhere,” he recalls.

While Al-Hind was the first port of call, the patient load soon spilled over to the Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital in Shahdara. “Twenty eight people died within the first three days of violence and another 10 died in the hospital. Some bodies were brought in totally charred,” says hospital superintendent Sunil Kumar. Both the hospital infrastructure and the patients’ endurance were being tested at the same time, says a hospital staff member. A list released by the hospital showed that several victims had died of assault and burns (from acid and fire). Many had died of gunshot wounds. Of the 298 injured, 170 people had suffered assault and burns and 67 had been shot.

Salmani’s brother was dragged out of his auto-rickshaw and chased down the lanes by men wielding iron rods. “We brought my injured brother out of Karawal Nagar on a push-cart because there was no vehicle in the neighbourhood. The police refused all our distress calls. It was neighbours who came to our aid,” says Salmani. His brother battled for life for two days before passing away.

Two days is what it took Ram Kumar Paswan, a rickshaw-puller, to identify the body of his son in the mortuary. Nitin, 15, had stepped out to buy noodles on February 25. He never returned.

Harjit Singh Bhatti, ex-president, RDA, AIIMS, was part of the first team of doctors to reach the riot-hit areas as a volunteer. He says it took him 12 hours to reach patients with gunshot injuries and multiple fractures. He recalls a patient with a deep gunshot wound in the stomach who refused to leave Mustafabad. “After convincing him to leave, we put him in an ambulance and headed towards GTB Hospital. We were stopped four times by the police. They inspected the patient by opening his bandages. That was the level of inhumanness on display,” says Bhatti.

Meanwhile, Al-Hind Hospital continues to receive patients who have gathered the courage to step out of their homes. Some have stab wounds and some have been hit with blunt objects.

Targeting schools

Shiv Vihar resembles a battlefield. Charred shops line the streets and burnt cars sit in a parking lot. On February 24 and February 25, two schools, Rajdhani Public School and DRP Public School, were targeted and burnt. The owner of Rajdhani Public School, Faisal Farooq, is distraught as he speaks about the future of his 1,400 students. One hundred and thirty students were preparing to write the Class X Board examinations which began in the rest of the country on February 27. The examinations have been postponed, but Farooq doesn’t know whether the students will be in the right frame of mind to take them. In a classroom, a clear message is written with chalk on the blackboards: ‘No NRC (National Register of Citizens), no CAA’. The clock ticks as Christ the Redeemer looks down from a poster on the wall.

Both schools share a wall, but that is all. Rajdhani Public School faces the predominantly Hindu neighbourhood of Shiv Vihar and DRP Public School is where the large Muslim neighbourhood of Mustafabad begins.

By a stroke of luck, the students are safe as the riots took place after the school had closed for the day. While rioters set the reception area of Rajdhani Public School on fire, the neighbouring DRP Public School suffered a worse fate. Chairs lie around, upturned, broken, burnt. Twisted fans hang from the ceilings. “Mobs scaled down the common wall with ropes and set fire to this school,” alleges DRP school owner Pankaj Sharma. He says his school was the best in the entire neighbourhood. It has students from all communities, he says, hinting that it was singled out by the attackers for its popularity. Both schools have filed an FIR against unnamed persons. However, the AAP MLA from Mustafabad, Haji Yunus, says the schools were targeted for a different reason. “I think the rioters thought that people of the other community would flock to the schools to seek refuge,” he says. Some say that the owners of these schools had pledged their allegiance to the AAP and the BJP, and were therefore targeted.

Arun Public School in Brijpuri was also burnt down. So was a mosque nearby. The owner of the school, Abhishek Sharma, says: “This is predominantly a Hindu neighbourhood. Eighty students from Class XII and 100 students from Class X were going to write their Board exams. I made 30 calls to the police and fire engines. No one answered.”

Search for identity papers

In Phase 6 and 7 of Shiv Vihar, Muslim families who ran small businesses and bakeries have fled their homes and taken shelter in Chaman Park in the homes of their friends. They find solace in numbers, they say. About 200 people have taken shelter here. In gali number 14, all the Muslim families have fled their homes. But it was not always like this, people insist. There was unity, says Harish Pal. “Every time, cries of azadi went up, our Muslim neighbours told us to take shelter, and every time cries of Jai Shri Ram went up, we told our Muslim neighbours to take shelter. We tried to save each other as long as we could,” he says. Pal works in a private automobile company which manufactures spare parts. His narrative offers a glimpse into how communities got deeply divided over the CAA. On the ground, those opposing the law were quickly painted as traitors and those who supported it as patriots.

It is dusk now and Muslim families with the help of the police have come to their homes to retrieve some of their clothes. Riyasat, who has taken refuge in a relief camp, has come to get his clothes and identity papers. He has not changed his clothes since February 24.

Young girls have taken shelter in old Mustafabad. In a tiny 100 sq ft room above a small bakery, more than a dozen families huddle together. Zainab, 19, who fled with her family as rioters closed in, is worried that her family’s identity papers have been left behind. It is the fear that these papers have been lost or destroyed that has the Muslim community on edge.

The CAA has made it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become full-fledged Indian citizens. Muslims are worried that they may not be considered citizens if the CAA, together with the proposed NRC, is implemented. The BJP-led government’s response to the CAA-NRC protests, which have been spearheaded by Muslims, has often been brutal. A majority of Muslims have opposed the Act and large sections of Hindus have supported it. But no one anticipated that the two communities would turn against each other.

Who attacked first?

People who fled their homes say they will return some day. However, a disturbing question remains unanswered: who attacked first? The answer depends on who is asked the question first.

The Medina masjid went up in smoke along with the house belonging to Naresh Chand. A wall separates the two. Chand, an insurance agent, says he doesn’t know the attackers. “There were some slogans raised and I couldn’t recognise anyone,” he says. He then quietly adds that the crowds came from the Muslim quarters.

The Auliya mosque too faced the ire of the mobs. There was an explosion of gas cylinders inside the mosque. Maulvi Shahrukh Khan says he is thankful to be alive. “I escaped just as mobs entered the neighbourhood. We had to retaliate in self-defence,” he says.

After the destruction, people have barricaded neighbourhoods with motorcycles, tables and wooden planks. One side is referred to as Hindustan. “That side [Mustafabad] is Pakistan. We have lived here together for years. But things have changed now,” says an old man, indicating that the divisions are here to stay. People have formed neighbourhood patrols. They say they haven’t slept a wink since February 24.

Offering help

After schools, shops, homes and lives crumbled, hope still floats. In Shiv Vihar, in some areas, people saved lives. Some of these streets were left untouched by the rioters. Many people used social media to reach out to one another and offer help. Human rights worker Harsh Mander with his Karwan-e-Mohabbat has been on the streets providing a healing touch. As Mander battles the sedition charge slapped on him by the state, his lawyer friends are helping people draft FIRs. “In all my experience of providing relief, I have never come across a situation where ambulances were not allowed to pass,” he says. Mander is also worried that the state administration did not initiate relief measures swiftly. When he started getting desperate calls from the injured, his only hope was Justice S. Muralidhar of the Delhi High Court, whose intervention was sought to prevent ambulances from being targeted. The order came, the ambulances moved. The police too obeyed the order from the court.

While the Delhi government claims that 327 shops and 79 houses have been gutted, several NGOs working on the ground say the numbers don’t add up. In the largest tyre bazaar of Gokalpuri, run entirely by Muslims in a Hindu neighbourhood, nothing remains. More than 500 FIRs, a majority of them against unknown persons, have been registered under the Arms Act of 1959 and persons have been detained.

On March 1, rumours again abound in Delhi about possible clashes between Hindus and Muslims. Panic has gripped the capital. But this time, the police is proactive and is busy quelling rumours.

275,2020/03/07,COVID-19: churches to depart from tradition during Holy Communion,"CSI asks clergy to use individual cups instead of normal practice of serving wine from a Chalice

It’s not only the IT companies, public transport and other institutions that are taking all steps to avoid novel coronavirus but some churches in the Twin Cities also are departing from the age old traditions during the Holy Communion.

“Keeping in view the outbreak of coronavirus and instructions of the State government to take precautionary measures to avoid the spread of coronavirus, from coming Sundays, we will be using small individual cups to partake in the Holy Communion,” a message from the Church of South India St. Thomas SPG Church, Telugu Pastorate, Secunderabad, informed its members.

The message said it was purely a temporary arrangement, till the outbreak is controlled. It also advised the church goers to avoid human contact or handshakes for the time being. As per the centuries old tradition, churches across the world distribute bread and wine during the mass to commemorate the Last Supper of Jesus Christ and his Crucifixion. According to a preacher in a leading church in Secunderabad, the normal practice followed by the clergy is to serve wine from a Chalice (a large, decorative gold or silver cup from which wine is drunk) into the mouth of the communicants).

According to sources, oral instructions were issued from the Church of South India, Diocese of Medak to committee members of all churches under its jurisdiction in Hyderabad and neighbouring districts to dispense with the old practice and go for temporary individual cups instead of drinking wine from the Chalice. “We received the communication from the Diocesan office and immediately held a meeting with the church committee members and decided to switch over to individual cups,” a senior member of the SPG St Thomas Church told The Hindu on Saturday.

WhatsApp message

A senior Parish priest of a Catholic church in the city said they had not received any instructions from the Archdiocese of Hyderabad. “But, we did receive a WhatsApp message from Mumbai Catholic church saying that they were offering wine on the palm instead of sipping from the Chalice. We leave it to the individual church goer to decide,” the priest said on condition of anonymity.

However, V. Hezekiah Maharaju, Pastorate Committee member of CSI Garrison Wesley Church, Lal Bazar, said their church was practising the Holy Communion by offering wine in small cups for the last one decade.

Reverend Jutike Prabhakar Rao of Bethel Bible Church, New Bowenpally and also Treasurer of Bowenpally Pastors Fellowship said several independent churches followed the small cup system for decades. “By praying and offering wine in individual cups, chances of spreading infections through saliva contamination is minimised and the practice will ensure more hygiene,” he remarked.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ve8ro/article31011503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08CHURCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-churches-to-depart-from-tradition-during-holy-communion/article31011504.ece

277,2020/03/07,SOP document to be made for IT companies,"It will tell how to deal with a situation in case any employee is diagnosed with coronavirus

A standard operating protocol (SOP) document on how to deal with a situation in case any employee shows symptoms of, or is diagnosed with coronavirus will soon be developed and adopted by IT companies.

This was decided at a coordination committee meeting with Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar (who is the nodal officer for companies in the IT Corridor for COVID-19), Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA), Department of Health, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and heads of IT companies. Those in attendance included staff from Wipro, Capgemini, Qualcomm, Cognizant and Tech Mahindra, among several others. Dr K Shankar, Superintendent, Fever Hospital too attended the meeting.

Steps to be taken

The SOP document will entail steps involved in guiding the suspected case, persons around the COVID-19 suspect, sanitisation of the premises, communication to staff working in neighbouring offices and the facilities managers.

The meeting also decided to share information with IT companies pertaining to the list of private hospitals which agreed to screen and provide isolation facilities. A poster of dos and don’ts pertaining to COVID - 19 prevention will also be created and widely shared.

All inbound passengers who are screened at airports will be self-isolated at home for a fortnight and a team is to monitor their condition remotely, twice a day, and keep a watch on their symptoms, if there are any.

Director of Preventive Health at Fever Hospital pointed out that N95 masks are meant for those who are ill and are suspected to have shown coronavirus symptoms. Those who are healthy are not required to wear them.

279,2020/03/07,Coronavirus threatens to take the colour off Holi celebrations,"Wholesale dealers complain that stocks have not been picked up by retailers yet

The widespread scare of coronavirus has taken a toll on the business of Holi festival, to be celebrated on Tuesday.

“Business is down by 30-40%. The stocks have not moved at all over the past few days,” says Harikishan Karwa, a wholesale dealer of Holi colours in the Begum Bazaar area.

Apartment blocks that usually put out notices about communal celebration of the festival of colours are yet to firm up their plans. “Not many people are very keen on celebrations as there is a scare about coronavirus. Even children are not so interested as they are being told to avoid public places and large crowds,” says Raj Reddy, who lives in an apartment complex in Nalanda Nagar.

In the maze of the streets in Begum Bazaar area there is a spray of colour on the road, bands of minstrels walk around with banging drums, singing; and then passing the bowl, but the shoppers are missing.

“I hope the shoppers will come by evening. Not many people are afraid of the virus. See, nobody is wearing masks,” says Ashok Singh hopefully pointing to the few shoppers moving about without any protection masks.

Days before the Holi festival, small kiosks set up by entrepreneurs pop up across the city. But this year, even they are missing.

“Retailers from Sholapur in Maharashtra, Bidar in Karnataka and some places in Andhra Pradesh pick up stock from us. But this year, that has not happened. Now it is too late, as tomorrow is Sunday and by Monday they need to have colours in their shops. Business was not this bad even after demonetisation,” says Mr. Karwa who has been supplying colours to outlying areas of erstwhile Nizam’s dominion for the past 95 years.

“This is a matter of tradition and religion. I think people will come out and celebrate the festival with gusto on Tuesday. Once we light the bonfire (Holika dahan), I don’t think people can stop themselves from enjoying themselves,” said Ajay Jaiswal, who lives in the area.

Advisory to devotees

Meanwhile, religious leaders for the jashn at the Moula Ali say they are asking visitors to take precautionary measures. “Every year there are five sandal (processions) to the Moula Ali shrine for celebrating the birth of Imam Ali. We are telling people to take extra precautions about hygiene as well as wearing masks while taking part in the procession,” informed Mir Abbas Moosavi of Badshahi Ashoorkhana.

Sources confirmed that the agency had filed a seven-day custody petition on Wednesday and after hearing arguments from the prosecution and the defence counsel, the court posted the matter for March 10.

On October 15, Maddileti was arrested by the Gadwal police for his association with the outlawed party and booked nder the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Section 120-B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

Later in December, the NIA booked him under similar charges and launched a probe into the allegation that he recruited young cadre for the party and sent them to Chhattisgarh. “Once the custody is granted, Maddiletti will be brought to the agency’s branch office in Hyderabad where he will be quizzed on his activities.

281,2020/03/07,"Akbaruddin raises CAA, NPR in Assembly","There should be a sunset clause, says AIMIM Floor Leader

Floor Leader of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in the Legislative Assembly Akbaruddin Owaisi has said that an attempt is being made by some political parties in the country to spread hatred and divide people in the name of religion with the help of Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register.

Such an agenda was being taken forward keeping aside the real issues such as economic slowdown, growing unemployment and providing shelter to the homeless, Mr. Owaisi said while speaking on the Motion of Thanks on the Governor’s Address on Saturday. He alleged that the issues of CAA, NRC and NPR were being projected as issues concerning only the Muslim community but in reality they were the issues of have nots and illiterate communities, he noted.

Thanking Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his Telangana Rashtra Samithi for opposing CAA in Parliament and assuring the Business Advisory Council of the Assembly for a debate on the issue in the House, the AIMIM legislator said it was necessary to give a strong message to the like-minded sections in the country. As such, Muslims were against CAA but they were not against giving citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs and a few other communities oppressed in our neighbouring countries, he said.

However, the law should have a sunset clause specifying the time till which the refugees would be given citizenship starting from 2014. Or else it would be an endless process.

Mr. Owaisi kept speaking on the subject till Speaker P. Srinivas Reddy intervened and told him to stick to the subject of Governor’s address following BJP legislator T. Raja Singh’s objection stating that he too be given chance to speak on CAA.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao too intervened and said there was no need for friction on the subject as it had already been decided to debate it. The State Assembly would make its view clear on the issue irrespective of whether the Centre would consider the view or not. “Let’s not vitiate the situation further as there is ample confusion and tension on the issue,” he suggested.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/lkoi2t/article31010718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08MIM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/akbaruddin-raises-caa-npr-in-assembly/article31010574.ece
282,2020/03/07,Two fake journalists face cheating charge,"A criminal case was registered against two persons, who, claiming themselves to be TV journalists, allegedly collected ₹2.5 lakh from a shepherd of Madhya Pradesh promising to help locate his stolen sheep.

The Kulsumpura police of West zone in Hyderabad are looking out for the absconding accused Naresh and Imran. According a complaint lodged by a shepherd, Tukaram of MP, 90 goats being raised by his family were stolen by unidentified persons.

“I received a video clip showing the goats through WhatsApp from a person claiming to be a Hyderabadi. He said those goats were in Mekalamandi of Jiyaguda,” the investigators quoted him as saying. Tukaram came to Hyderabad and approached the two ‘journalists’ through a mediator Ratan.

The ‘journalists’ promised the shepherd to get back the goats, stating that they were well connected with the Kulsumpura police, the investigators said. Initially, Ratan gave ₹1 lakh to the duo on behalf of the shepherds.

Later, Tukaram paid the duo ₹1.5 lakh more. “Daily the two ‘journalists’ would take the shepherd to the police station, ask him to wait outside and come out of police station saying police were working on it,” the police said.

Eventually, the shepherd realised that he was taken for a ride and filed a complaint.

283,2020/03/07,TS police prove exemplary in breaking gender tropes,"More women officers is the need of the hour, says Narayanpet SP M. Chetana

Patriarchy persists in various uniformed forces across the nation, but Telangana police are breaking new grounds to do away with this social evil. With a large number of women officers posted as Superintendents of Police and Deputy Commissioners of Police in the capital city and elsewhere in the State, gender stereotyping may soon become a memory in the State.

Several women IPS officers, who spoke to The Hindu about gender roles in the department, said that stereotyping or gender-based pigeonholing was the last of their worries. In fact, they said, they shrugged sway the ‘unwritten’ privileges generally attached to women officers.

“We do not expect any special treatment. But sometimes, subordinates have to be reminded that we are police officers, not female police officers. Based on hearsay or previous experiences, they can have misapprehensions such as not to call us at late hours even if there is an emergency. We give them clear instructions not to fall for any such easy patriarchal ideas.” the officers shared.

Shining comparison

According to them, the Telangana police are leading the way for the country in breaking old patriarchal norms and the support from the seniors was impeccable. The fact that four of five new districts (Mahabubnagar, Wanaparthy, Jogulamba-Gadwal and Narayanpet) carved out of erstwhile Mahabubnagar are led by women SsP is an example of how the force is marching towards gender equality.

“There are States, especially in North India, where female officers are still addressed with the male honorific ‘Madam Sir’. They are still given more of the indoor roles, with very little field responsibility, which hampers their chances of ever leading the police force in any significant manner. But, here it is completely different,” said an officer.

Gender carries no weight. It is the calibre that decides the level of responsibility given to an officer in Telangana, said Wanaparthy SP Apoorva Rao.

She said thag in this decade, with the growth of the internet and knowledge, policing had also modernised. “People can engage with police in many areas for multiple services. This situation demands that police develop an empathetic approach to serving the needs of society. Women police officers can play a vital role in making this happen,” said Ms. Rao, who is also holding charge of Jogulamba-Gadwal district said.

Kamareddy SP N. Swetha believes that with 33 % reservation, more women would join the force in the ranks of constable and SI, which would bring a sea change to gender justice.

“In the future things will be more sensitive to women. Presently, we have a good number of Station House Officers in the State, which speaks louder than any gender equality campaign,” she said.

Narayanpet SP M. Chetana said more women officers was the need of the hour in what was known as a male-dominated force. “The perception that police service is a male bastion is slowly but surely changing. Many women are opting for the job, which initially was thought of as being suitable for men. Women are also given prominent positions in the department and that defies patriarchy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-police-prove-exemplary-in-breaking-gender-tropes/article31010387.ece

285,2020/03/07,State govt. fights infodemic spawned by virus,"Health department pushing detailed information before unverified reports spread through social media

“The privacy of the patient is very important and should not be violated. A policy decision has to be taken to breach that,” says Dr. P. Nagabhushana Rao, as a scare about COVID-19 infection in a patient emptied out a neighbourhood in Secunderabad.

“There is no harm in people knowing information about an infected individual as there is no stigma attached to the illness which is just a flu that anyone can catch,” says M. Sujatha Rao, former Health and Family Welfare secretary.

As the nation grapples with the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus, social media has once again become a trigger for panic, raising questions about information. “Health emergencies should be treated with sensitivity. In 2003, when a large number of children died due to outbreak of encephalitis in Karimnagar, we were advised not to wear masks so as not to trigger panic. But we took people into confidence and controlled the disease within a few days. We need to handle this without creating sensation,” says Dr. Rao.

On Wednesday afternoon, as an email from an IT company in Hyderabad about a ‘confirmed case of coronavirus (Covid 19)’ became viral, a wave of fear and foreboding rippled through the city. Later, State officials asked the media not to reveal the identity of the patients. In the end, the virology test of the patient turned out to be negative.

“We need to do extensive contact tracing by ensuring that there is no irrational fear. We don’t have to reveal the name of the patient but sufficient information to trace all contacts so that they can be quarantined, given early treatment and counselling,” says Ms. Rao, who has worked on creating protocols and systems for National AIDS Control Organisation.

The National Institute of Epidemiology has a protocol: “Search for cases within the time and space limits of the case definition. Compile and update a line listing of cases. For each case, document at least the date of onset, age, sex, the zone of residence and the outcome.”

The Telangana government is proactively pushing detailed information even before unverified reports spreads through social media. The daily bulletins of Health Medical and Family Welfare Department has details ranging from the total number of suspects to people in home isolation and those in hospital isolation as well as the number of samples tested. For a change, the Health Department seems to be winning the battle against unverified information.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-govt-fights-infodemic-spawned-by-virus/article31004628.ece

287,2020/03/07,"Building No. 20 reopens, but DSM stays shut","A few report to office; many others opt to work from home

Days after witnessing a COVID-19 scare, Building Number 20 in Mind Space of HiTec City was reopened on Friday following sanitisation and disinfection. But DSM, the company whose employee later tested negative for coronavirus, continues to remain closed.

It was on March 4 that panic-stricken employees of at least four companies in the building rushed outside after a screenshot of an e-mail to DSM employees went viral. The e-mail purportedly touched upon a company employee showing symptoms of coronavirus.

According to techies who work in the building, the premises were thrown open at 12 p.m. While staff started to trickle in, many either took the day off or preferred to work from home.

A techie working with tech giant Cognizant said that while his colleagues did go to office, many were instructed to report to work on Monday. “Team leaders spoke to those reporting to them. My team was asked to report on Monday. I do not know the reason for this, but it is safe to say that this is to allay fears of employees,” he said.

Employees of different companies said it was business as usual. While the tides of fear were receding, an undercurrent of concern over coronavirus lingered. “When the DSM news broke, there was panic. It is not easy to immediately get over that panic; it will take some time,” said V. Santosh (name changed) a techie working for a social media company.

Speaking to The Hindu, IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan confirmed that DSM continues to remain closed. He added that he is monitoring the situation and is in contact with heads of companies in the building. “I have spoken to DSM. Monday and Tuesday are holidays for them because of Holi. They were given Friday off in view of the weekend ahead. They will open office after these holidays,” he said, adding that the situation in the building is normal and there is no reason to panic.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/79k7f5/article31004596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06-COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/building-no-20-reopens-but-dsm-stays-shut/article31004590.ece
288,2020/03/07,"Flight, passenger movement on a downward curve","Data shows slight slowdown in Jan.

The fall in aviation traffic, both international and domestic, as a result of the coronavirus scare is now apparent. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has reported a considerable reduction in movement of flights and passengers between December 2019 and January 2020.

The figure for February is not yet available since AAI releases the data every 45 days, but, a comparison between the aircraft movement in the previous two months shows a definite decline. For the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport where all the passengers landing from international locations are being thermal-scanned to check for body temperatures, the figures are like this: if there have been 2,404 international flights in December, the number has fallen to 2,353 the next month. It points to the cancellation of several flights in January itself when COVID-19 was yet to turn into a pandemic as it has happened now with positive cases detected here and elsewhere in the country too.

The number of international passengers fell to 3,72,329 in January when compared to 3,76,558 in December. The scenario is no different for domestic air travel — 14,819 flights carried 16,87,237 passengers in December. A month later, domestic flights reduced to 14,556 and the passengers count too came down to 16,08,998.

Nationwide trend

If one takes into consideration the nationwide situation, the number of international air travellers has fallen with 65,64,572 in December and further down to 64,87,267 in January. Passengers travelling within the country also reduced their air miles with 2,48,29,088 travelling in January as against 2,52,88,719 in December 2019.

If the total number of international flights to the country was 40,293 in December, it fell to 40,283 in January this year. On the nationwide domestic travel front, it is slightly different with 1,94,199 in December and marginally higher in January at 1,95,213.

From this data, all the signs point to a steeper fall in flight movement and the international and domestic passenger count in February-March considering the rising number of cases in Europe, United States and West Asia.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/c0i2i5/article31004579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07travelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/flight-passenger-movement-on-a-downward-curve/article31004571.ece
289,2020/03/07,"Rail travel unaffected, SCR sets sanitation goals","Grab rods, hand rails, toilet handles etc. will be cleaned regularly: SCR chief

Notwithstanding the coronavirus scare in the past few days, South Central Railway (SCR) has not yet witnessed a drop in passenger numbers even as it claims to have taken several measures to arrest the spread of the virus.

“Our trains are running full as usual with the only blip being in the suburban train services of MMTS as they have been curtained on account of infrastructure works for phase two. All our trains are cleaned on reaching the destinations, but now we are going to step up cleanliness and sanitation efforts,” said senior officials.

Top officials held brainstorming sessions and after confabulating with Railway Board, SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya has said that grab rods, hand rails, toilet handles and the likes will be cleaned regularly by the on-board sanitation staff.

Already, separate isolation wards for treating suspected COVID-19 cases have been created at the zonal railway hospital here and at all other six divisional hospitals. Help desks are being set up at main stations of Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kacheguda to provide information to passengers on the do’s and don’ts.

Through video-conferencing, medical personnel have been made aware of the protocol to be followed to handle suspected patients of the virus that is spreading worldwide, informed SCR chief public relations officer Ch. Rakesh.

Information Education and Communication material regarding coronavirus would be displayed at important locations at all stations in English, Hindi and Telugu. Machinery has been put in place for monitoring suspected cases on the railway premises at various levels, he said.

290,2020/03/07,City parks witness big drop in visitor footfall,"For the past 15 days, we have been seeing a fall of at least 15%, says an official of the Telangana Forest Department

Parks bore the brunt of coronavirus scare with several walkers and joggers keeping away from the green spaces. Some parks have reported a drop in footfall by at least 15%.

Several fitness enthusiasts or those who love a stroll in the lush green environs of the Kasu Brahmananda Reddy (KBR) National Park, also known as Chiran, in Banjara Hills said that they preferred to stay indoors given the reports of COVID-19 cases in the country.

Tipping point

“The reports of coronavirus cases were always scary, but the scare in HiTec City was the tipping point for me. KBR Park is frequented by businessmen and IT employees, who often travel abroad. I will stay away for at least a month,” said Roshan Ahmad, a businessman and regular visitor to KBR park.

While the Jalagam Vengal Rao (JVR) Park in Banjara Hills witnesses fewer visitors as compared to the KBR, some walkers said they plan to stay away. Several families, too, preferred not to venture into the green space.

“We visit JVR Park once a week. My kids are young, so my wife and I do not want to take any chances,” said Kaleem Khan, a techie and resident of Banjara Hills.

Weekdays vs. weekends

An official of the Telangana Forest Department, which manages the KBR National Park, confirmed to The Hindu about the drop in footfall. While the park has about 2,000 visitors on weekdays, the number rises to 3,000-3,500 on the weekends. “For the past 15 days, we are seeing a drop in visitors by at least 15%,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/np797s/article31004539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06-WALKINGSESSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/city-parks-witness-big-drop-in-visitor-footfall/article31004534.ece
291,2020/03/07,A life in music,"A drama that brings the life and achievements of Veena Doreswamy Iyengar to mark his Centenary will be staged by Kala Gangotri

The instrument veena has strings near-mimicking the human voice with a hoary tradition. It was this single Indian instrument that moulded three different schools — the Mysore, Thanjavur and Andhra baani (styles) — in Carnatic instrumental. It’s importance increased when iconic artistes such as Veena Seshanna and Veena Venkatagiriappa followed by Veena Doreswamy Iyengar received royal patronage at the Mysore court. In an age when most of the other Vainikas had started using the contact microphone Doreswamy Iyengar remained a purist and stuck to the ‘acoustic’ Veena. His Mysore baani is a distinctive style marked by signature movements for which accolades poured in during his career.

“This is the Birth Centenary Year of my father Doreswamy Iyengar and there are distinguished aspects to his persona that we would like to have on record. In our tribute we thought there would be no better way than bringing in a biographical play on him by the well-known troupe Kala Gangothri. Stalwarts like BV Rajaram will direct the show with playwright as Dr. N. Raghu, Assistant Director of Programmes - Akashavani giving us the storyline. This would be staged on March 7 at the Chowdiah Memorial Hall,” says D Balakrishna, vainika and son of Iyengar.

Young Doreswamy Iyengar graduated early from the practice room to the concert platform. At the age of 12, he made his debut at the Mysore Palace. When the fastidious Maharaja, Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar singled out Doreswamy for commendation, his guru Veena Venkatagiriappa was elated. “Make sure he is properly trained, as this boy will bring a name to Mysore,” the Maharaja's instructions to guru Venkatagiriappa was almost a command. Doreswamy was soon appointed a junior vidwan in the Palace orchestra. That was when he passed the examination in advanced theory of Western music conducted by the Trinity College of Music, London. He was barely 16 when he was nominated asthana vidwan (court musician) in the Mysore State, one of the youngest to win the honour.

As the boy made quick strides for himself, an impressed senior violin artist T Chowdiah insisted that Doreswamy accompany him in his violin recitals. “My father always said those were the first duets of the violin and the veena. But soon the violin vidwan made my father sit centre-stage and moved to be his accompanist,” recalls Balakrishna.

Later Iyengar was to play jugalbandis with other violinists, including Lalgudi G Jayaraman, TN Krishnan and MS Gopalakrishnan, and with the vocalists M Balamuralikrishna and Palakkad KV Narayanaswami. He also performed duets with Hindustani artists Mallikarjun Mansur, Ali Akbar Khan and Amjad Ali Khan.

Although Doreswamy Iyengar’s tonal purity along with his raga expanse and swaraprastara was hailed, he rendered even the lighter pieces with dignity. How much of his music can be translated on stage is what BV Rajaram explains. “We will have 20 people bringing his biography through, with bits of music trickling in often. The best is the live music performers as Balakrishna’s students have come in to take these roles,” he says.

Rajaram is happy to take up this challenge as Kala Gangothri, he says, has presented magnum opus shows as Mukhya Mantri, Mysore Mallige and Mukkajjiya Kanasugalu. “Iyengar’s life itself is so interesting that it’s not just his own veena play, but his creative abilities as a composer, another chapter of his life, has to be showcased. Nearly two dozen of the musical operas of Pu Ti Narasimhachar is his contribution. Their friendship is one of the main aspects to the play that is highlighted. This is apart from his majestic and yet simple persona that underlined his focus and determination to take the Indian instrument to greater heights,” says Rajaram.

The 90-minutes play has the storyline from Dr. N Raghu’s lines who has adapted his work from the Kannada original book on Iyengar ‘Veeneya Neralinalli’ authored by Bharati Kasaragodu. “Bharati’s work is authentic and exhaustive, it was a pleasure to have the interesting episodes culled out for bringing in the dramatic elements,” says Raghu who has also lent his voice for serialising the book in AIR in 54 episodes. “Stage is a bigger canvas but we had to take it across more skilfully so as to project his life and not make it a classical opera. Bringing in the technicalities of stage craft too for detailing a musician’s life, made it a refreshing experience,” says Raghu who has written plays for Akashavani.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hbpkw/article31008973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGM-VEENEYADORE2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/doreswamy-iyengar-d-balakrishna-bv-rajaram-kala-gangothri-dr-n-raghu/article31008974.ece
292,2020/03/07,A life of passion and humility,"Across the country, every ghatam that resonates with music, is sure to have come from Manamadurai. And passed through the hands of Meenakshi amma. Like most women, she too remained in the background and allowed men to take credit for her labour and love

It was December 2012. Instead of making that usual music season trip to Chennai, I had backpacked to Manamadurai. Ramesh, the ghatam maker, had agreed to take me on as an apprentice after my guru Sukanya Ramgopal had conveyed to him about my desire to learn ghatam making.

It was afternoon when I reached Manamadurai. After having a sumptuous meal that Ramesh and his wife Mohana had prepared for me, I accompanied Ramesh to the workshop, a few yards away from his house. His mother, Meenakshi, was working away all by herself inside the workshop. Everybody else went home for lunch, but Meenakshi’s lunch had to be delivered at the workshop, every day. She would take a short lunch break and get back to work. As I entered I peeped inside and greeted her. She looked at me dispassionately, gestured a welcome and went back to work.

In the ten days that I stayed with the family, Ramesh anna taught me the different aspects of ghatam making. I briefly learnt to mix the clay, turn the wheel, make small clay objects and then finally, attempted making the ghatam. ‘Everything needs practice’, Ramesh said. ‘Like learning to play the instrument, making too needs much practice and perseverance’. Our evenings were spent chatting away under a starlit winter sky and singing film songs. But Meenakshi amma would never participate in any of this. Once work was done, she would retire for the day.

About three days had passed. Meenakshi amma and I had not had any conversation. The next morning at the workshop I quietly sat next to her, keenly observing as she was ‘beating’ the ghatam. All of a sudden she stopped and asked: ‘Why are you interested?’ ‘I play the ghatam. Shouldn’t I know my instrument? I have come to learn from you’. She chuckled. ‘All reporters and researchers think that the men alone make the ghatams. Earlier they would interview my husband. Now they interview my son. But it is actually the women in this family that give life to the ghatams’. My eyes lit up. I said: ‘Yes. I know. That is why I have come to learn from you”. She gently patted me on my back, smiled and said ‘we’ll talk tomorrow’. That was the beginning of an incredible relationship that blossomed between us.

Years of hard work had left its imprints on her body, making her look older than what she perhaps was. I began to fondly call her paati (grandmother). Over the next few years, we had many precious moments - of serious discussions and frivolous banter. Sometimes she would draw me into her Kabir-like double play on the words ‘ghatam’ and ‘udambu’ (body). At other times, she would tease me as I struggled with my Tamil, but would go all out to help me understand what she was saying. In all this, she opened me to her worldview of the clay pot with extraordinary generosity. This, for me, was a worldview that went beyond technique, beyond grammar, beyond the stage, beyond performance and even beyond being a ghatam player. She often smiled mischievously; laughed rarely. And when she did, there was a glitter in her eyes and a profound wisdom that seemed to show an irreverence for the outside world. To her, the workshop was the world. She sat there breathing life and love into the pots she held with such care on her lap. In many ways, I had found a guru.

One day Ramesh anna and I embarked on an exercise to date Meenakshi amma’s birthday. After mapping incidents in her life to larger socio-political incidents, we gathered that she was born circa 1950; in Tirupoovanam, a village not far from Manamadurai. At 12, she was married to U.V. Kesavan and subsequently moved with him to Manamadurai. Apparently, at that time, the ghatam master Salem Vaiyapuri had said: ‘Kesava, nee Madurai Meenakshiyaye konduvandirukke’ (Kesava, you have brought home Madurai Meenakshi herself). As the daughter-in-law in a household of hereditary potters, Meenakshi apprenticed under her husband for about four years and learnt ghatam making. There is a special technique of ‘beating’ the raw clay pot after it is turned on the wheel. The pot is beaten 3000-4000 times before it acquires its shruti and comes alive. This technique of breathing life into the pot is only passed on to women. ‘Why only women?’, I asked. ‘Because it needs patience’, she said. Meenakshi inherited this skill from her mother-in-law and sister-in-law and then mastered this technique to perfection. As Kesavan’s professional partner, she participated equally in carrying on the family tradition and also passing on the legacy to her children and grandchildren.

In recognition of her mastery over ghatam making, her impeccable work ethics and commitment to perfection, she was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Puraskar for the year 2013. Accolades began to pour in soon after from the Tamilnadu government and other organisations. But all these sat lightly on her shoulders. She remained self-effacing in her own blissful world of ghatams.

In over 45 years, she had made hundreds of ghatams that travelled to performance platforms all over the world. Three generations of ghatam players will remain indebted to her for her labour of love.

I had once asked her, ‘Ghatam making is such hard work. Why do you do this?’ ‘Responsibility’, she said unflinchingly. ‘If I stop making ghatams, how will you play? No ghatam player that comes to my door shall ever go back empty-handed’.

In November 2017, Meenakshi amma left this world. I am told she went - like a ghatam that breaks - softly and quickly. After a few days of her passing, my mother handed me a book of Shishunala Sharif’s verses. She said: ‘Sharif must have written this song for her’.

The song was kumbaaraaki eeki kumbaaraaki, brahmaandavella tumbi kondiruvaaki . . . (Here is the woman potter, who holds the Universe within herself).

293,2020/03/07,PCB to procure high-tech machines to gauge air pollution,"The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) plans to procure state-of-the-art equipment to measure air pollution in the wake of frequent fires in the district.

Though the board has instruments to estimate the ambient air pollution levels, the need for additional high-tech equipment was felt in the wake of frequent fires at the Brahmapuram waste dumping yard.

Board officials said the plan was to procure instruments to make a clear analysis of toxic chemicals like dioxin and furan emerging from the sites. “We also witnessed fire breakouts at the solid waste dumping sites at Kalamassery and Vedimara near North Paravur recently. The evaluation of air pollution levels and toxic chemicals getting released into the air has turned crucial in view of the rising incidents of fire at waste dumping sites,” they added.

The regional office of the board requires better instruments to evaluate the levels of carbon monoxide emissions after a fire breakout. Researchers had often experienced difficulties in obtaining accurate levels in view of non-availability of state-of-the-art instruments to measure pollutants. The board also needs instruments to make precise analysis of volatile organic compounds and hydrocarbons.

Investigations conducted by the board after the Brahmapuram fire on February 18 using toxic gas analysers had found that ozone gas was present in exceeding concentrations (0.52 parts per million against the limit of 0.1 parts per million). The team had collected the results of different parameters from its monitoring stations at Ambalamugal and Vyttila.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-to-procure-high-tech-machines-to-gauge-air-pollution/article31005178.ece
294,2020/03/07,Legacy waste disposal an uphill task for government,"Pile-up of non-biodegradable waste at Brahmapuram a big challenge

The government is likely to face an uphill task with the remediation of legacy waste (old waste) in view of lack of data on the quantum of old municipal solid waste that has piled up at the Brahmapuram dumping yard over the years.

A proposal drafted by the regional office of the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) recommending a drone study to assess the exact volume of legacy waste is yet to be implemented by the Kochi Corporation. A total sanitation survey is a pre-requisite before clearing legacy waste, as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, said PCB officials.

The total station survey using drones is done to ascertain the exact volume of waste at the site. The PCB had also suggested a precursor study of the history of the site and compositional analysis of waste.

Site environment parameters such as baseline study of heavy metals in surface and subsurface soil and water, rainfall, soil type, surface hydrology, topography, and wind direction should be done before and after biomining, according to the board. The remediation process may face further hurdles as studies done by the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management and the PCB had revealed that non-biodegradable waste continued to be dumped over heaps of legacy waste at Brahmapuram in violation of the prescribed guidelines.

The findings came to light following site inspections and inferences gathered from data on the quantity of mixed waste brought to the site and transferred from there to agencies outside for recycling. The figures were taken and analysed for the months of May, June, and July last year.

According to records submitted by the corporation, only 37.53 metric tonnes of 3,889.18 metric tonnes of mixed waste were removed from the dumping yard in May for recycling, while the remaining 3,850.30 metric tonnes were deposited over heaps of legacy waste.

Inspections found that plastic waste alone was transferred to outside agencies after manual segregation by ragpickers at the site even though those responsible were collecting mixed waste, including plastic materials, from areas under the corporation on a regular basis. Ideally, the corporation should have set up facilities for safe storage and disposal of mixed waste at the site rather than dumping it over legacy waste, according to PCB officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/legacy-waste-disposal-an-uphill-task-for-government/article31005172.ece

The C-Branch of the city police has started summoning and collecting statements from staff posted at the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) section at the district collectorate at different points since 2018, in connection with the probe into the alleged misappropriation and diversion of relief funds in excess of ₹10 lakh in the aftermath of the floods two years ago.

Many of the staffers are now working at different places in the district. On the number of staffers employed in the CMDRF section, sources in the district administration said it varied from time to time though it was believed that not more than 10 were deployed at any point.

Whether anyone other than Vishnu Prasad, the key accused who served as a clerk in the section and since been arrested, had access to the user id and password of the official system was also being looked into.

Meanwhile, the district administration is going ahead with its internal audit to find out if more frauds had been committed.

Since it took over the case registered by the Thrikkakara police on a petition filed by the Additional District Magistrate, the C-Branch has arrested four while arraigning at least two more as accused.

296,2020/03/07,LSGD to handle legacy waste at Brahmapuram,"Daily collection and management of waste to rest with corporation

The State government will take over the handling of legacy waste at the Brahmapuram dumping yard, after the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) recently found that the Kochi Corporation had delayed the process, and the situation could lead to an environmental and health hazard for the city.

The daily collection and management of waste and operations at Brahmapuram will continue to rest with the corporation, said Venu V., Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management. He issued a Government Order (GO) on Thursday, entrusting the Local Self Government Department (LSGD) with the responsibility of handling the legacy waste and cancelling the tender process that the corporation had initiated for biomining.

Invoking the Disaster Management Act, the decision was taken by the State Executive Committee of the KSDMA, chaired by the Chief Secretary, at its meeting on Wednesday.

“The committee was informed of the impending disaster situation owing to smouldering fires in the legacy waste at the yard. We had several reports which showed that it could flare up again and lead to a huge public health disaster. Urgent steps have to be taken,” Dr. Venu said.

The committee had, at an earlier meeting this week, urgently called for the corporation’s records on the tendering process for legacy waste biomining, and tasked the District Collector with preparing a contingency plan to manage the smouldering fires at the yard. The corporation council meeting the next day to discuss issues at Brahmapuram also failed to arrive at a decision on the tender, and the committee concluded that the civic body was “not in a position to manage this complex matter effectively,” according to the GO.

As per the order, the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) will initiate the bidding process to identify an agency to handle legacy waste, and the District Collector will offer assistance in the process. R.S. Kannan, Special Secretary, LSGD, said the department would ensure that a time-bound action plan was prepared to implement the GO.

The order noted that the reports of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management, the State Pollution Control Board, and the District Collector all indicated that urgent steps were necessary to manage legacy waste.

The matter of accepting financial bid for biomining was opposed by ruling and Opposition councillors at the corporation council meetings over the past two months on the grounds that the rate quoted by the company was too high, the company had little prior experience, the tender process was unfair, and that the matter had not been considered by the standing committees.

The GO also said that the single bidder had experience as a sub-contractor only and “that his experience does not inspire the confidence that he will be able to complete the work.”

Mayor Soumini Jain said the corporation would have to heed the order, and that repeated opposition from the council had stalled the proposals.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lsgd-to-handle-legacy-waste-at-brahmapuram/article31005091.ece
297,2020/03/07,Chief Secretary to appear before NGT on March 20,"State government yet to implement tribunal’s recommendations on solid waste management

Chief Secretary Tom Jose will appear before the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in New Delhi on March 20 to explain the steps being taken by the State government to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

“The matter [failure to comply with the rules] is to be considered further in relation to the State of Kerala on March 20, 2020, when the Chief Secretary, Kerala, is scheduled to appear in person. The State of Kerala needs to consider action on the pattern of successful models of other States, where meaningful steps to deal with the issue have been initiated in consultation with the CPCB [Central Pollution Control Board],” said an order issued by the Bench comprising NGT Chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel and expert members Nagin Nanda and Siddhanta Das.

The directive was issued by the tribunal on February 28 while hearing the case (original application no. 514/2019) on non-compliance with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, causing huge pollution at the Brahmapuram solid waste processing plant. The Bench also referred to the report filed by A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, Chairman of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) constituted by the NGT (in original application no. 606/2018) to oversee compliance with directions on the issue of solid waste management in the State. He had submitted a detailed report to the tribunal on unscientific dumping of waste at Brahmapuram after the massive fire breakout at the site on February 18.

The Secretary, Urban Affairs, Kerala, was present at the hearing held on February 28 on a specific directive issued by the tribunal on January 24.

“A status report was filed on February 27 to the effect that certain steps had been taken. The fact remains that there is no progress in terms of actual remedial measures as expected and as required under the rules,” pointed out the NGT order. The Bench said that non-compliance with rules relating to waste disposal would result in damage to the environment and public health. “Any failure needs to be visited with assessment and recovery of compensation for such damage from the persons responsible for such failure,” it added.

The Bench had reiterated that each local body would have to pay a compensation of ₹10 lakh per month (for population of above 10 lakh); ₹5 lakh a month (for population between 5 lakh and 10 lakh), and ₹1 lakh per month for other local bodies for non-compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 from April 1. This compensation will be equally applicable to local bodies found erring on the issue of remediation of legacy waste.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/h5dewa/article31005030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvki-BrahmapuramREVcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/chief-secretary-to-appear-before-ngt-on-march-20/article31005031.ece

299,2020/03/07,Seeking tech solutions to pressing problems,"Regional hackathon gets under way

How about an artificial intelligence-driven system capable of monitoring emergency situations in Intensive Care Units and alerting medical staff promptly?

Six such technological cutting-edge solutions enhancing the service quality of health and social justice departments are likely to be developed at the end of the 36-hour-long regional hackathon that got under way at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology, Angamaly, on Friday.

This was the seventh in the first ever hackathon series, Reboot Kerala Hackathon 2020, organised by Additional Skill Acquisition Programme (ASAP).

Among other challenges to which technological solutions have been sought from the participating teams include developing an application, which would not only help HIV patients book appointments with doctors but also enable them to seek delivery of medicines to their places without revealing their identity, and a system that would warn office staff about prolong periods of idleness while also offering scientific inputs about proper postures, alignment between seating position and computer screen; and an easily assessable technical solution providing real-time data to the public about various health and treatment facilities like the availability of blood in blood banks and specialists in hospitals.

The participating teams qualified after a preliminary online hackathon are expected to throw up these solutions by the end of the contest on Saturday at 8.30 p.m.

The event is aimed at giving students of higher educational institutions in the State a platform to solve some of the pressing problems faced in daily lives. An expert team from health and social justice departments will review the progress being made by teams.

Based on the solutions, 15 teams will be shortlisted who will then present the solutions on Sunday. Out of them, the top three teams will receive a cash prize of ₹1lakh each and the opportunity to participate in the grand finale.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/seeking-tech-solutions-to-pressing-problems/article31004639.ece

301,2020/03/07,Quotation gang arrested,"A potential contract killing was averted after the Munambam police on Thursday raided a homestay along the beach and arrested an eight-member gang, including seven from Tamil Nadu, who were allegedly engaged by an Aluva-based goonda to settle scores with his local rival.

The arrested were identified as T. Yesu, 37, of Valliyoor; Bennin, 20, of Parvathypuram in Kanyakumari; Ramasamy, 36, of Nagercoil; Vinod, 25, of Chengalpet in Chennai; Remesh, 31, of Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu’ Arul Ananthan, 36, of Thoothukudy; R. Prabhu, 27, of Thoothukudy; and Habeeb, 24, of Munambam.

The gang was arrested on Thursday around 6.40 p.m. following a tip-off received by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik.

When the police team swooped down on the homestay, the gang was huddled inside their room. A few weapons, including two swords and an iron rod beside some liquor bottles, were also recovered from a car parked outside the homestay.

On interrogation, they reportedly confessed to staying at the resort for the past five days after being contracted for ₹3 lakh by an Aluva-based goonda to finish off his rival. They had been carrying out a recce of the routine of their potential target for the past few days and had planned to attack him once they had full information about his movements.

According to sources, the goonda who had hired the gang was under the impression that his rival was behind the attack targeting him in Aluva last month in which his friend was injured. So, to settle the scores in the long drawn out rivalry, he had hired the gang and paid for their food and accommodation at Munambam. It is learnt that the lone Malayali in the hired gang was his relative entrusted with the job of guiding the gang to the potential target. The police have reportedly arraigned in the goonda as the ninth accused in the case.

Most of the gang members from Tamil Nadu have multiple cases, including for murder, attempt to murder, assault, dacoity, extortion, against their names in various police stations. The accused were produced before the court and remanded.

302,2020/03/07,"HC slams Kochi Corporation, KWA for poor upkeep of roads","Superintending engineers of civic body asked to appear before court

Slamming the Kochi Corporation and the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) for the poor upkeep of city roads and the delay in completing road repair works, the Kerala High Court on Friday asked the superintending engineers of the Kochi Corporation to appear before it.

Officials from the five zonal offices of the Kochi Corporation would have to be present before the court on March 10, when it considers the case, ordered Justice Devan Ramachandran.

The court would interact directly with the officials to know the factors that were delaying road repair works, the judge said.

The court passed the order while considering a batch of petitions regarding badly damaged city roads.

The judge said the court felt ashamed by the sad state of affairs and the plight of people though the authorities who were responsible for the upkeep of roads didn’t appear so.

Despite the Advocate General assuring the court that road repair works could be completed before January 31, it had not happened.

The Kochi Corporation, which stated that the KWA had dug up several roads for water supply projects, said the paucity of funds had affected works. The KWA could not return the roads to the civic body on time after completing projects and repairing them, the court noted.

The navigation of vehicles through damaged roads was leading to increased pollution besides causing several diseases to general public, the court pointed out.

The court also noted that a few city roads, including the SRM Road, had become non-motorable long ago.

Meanwhile, the State government opposed the arguments of the Kochi Corporation on paucity of funds. The civic body gets assistance from the State government. Moreover, it could generate its own funds, the State submitted.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rnz9pd/article31004613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07KIROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-slams-kochi-corporation-kwa-for-poor-upkeep-of-roads/article31004614.ece
303,2020/03/07,Zigzag to the precipice,"A new book on street theatre doyen Safdar Hashmi serves almost as an emotional call to arms in these tumultuous times

Irreverence is the champion of liberty, and its only sure defence…

— Mark Twain

Creativity — satire and theatricality — is a decisive weapon in the non-violent armoury of Safdar Hashmi’s legacy. Actor-theatreperson Sudhanva Deshpande’s recent book Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi (LeftWord Books), published in Hindi and English, with translations due in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Marathi, recounts the engaged, albeit short-lived, interactions between Hashmi and the author in 1987, and the persona of the artist, poet, songwriter and activist.

Second only to Qamar Azad’s (Hashmi’s mother) book The Fifth Flame (1997), this anecdotal retelling begins with the day Hashmi was killed at the age of 34 (January 1, 1989). What begins with the seemingly dark, penetrating silence of death turns gradually into a life that foregrounds the unrelenting cry for truth and demand for fundamental rights, and also the power of protest for co-existence and co-empowerment.

Much of what we know of the beginnings of theatre group Janam (Jana Natya Manch, of which Hashmi was a founding member in 1973), and even of Hashmi’s commitments, is revised and augmented by the author by acknowledging the immense contributions of those who were with him — ‘Mala’ (Moloyshree Hashmi), his wife, as well as renowned thespian Habib Tanvir.

Response & repercussions

Hashmi arrives in 1969 at St. Stephen’s College, when the growing Naxalbari movement was taking root in the mind of the urban intellectual. He seems to capture the moment by making claims to civil rights, and years later, following a seven-day industrial strike in Delhi in 1988, Halla Bol was produced as a theatrical response, with violent repercussions.

The plays performed by Janam subsequently gained renewed force and included the now iconic Machine, Aya Chunav, Michil (Badal Sircar) and Samrath Ko Nahi Dosh Gosain, or Mai Diwas Ki Kahani. We must see this legacy in the context of the workers’ movement — labour and trade union activity — that has exponentially grown through the necessity to ‘organise’ and resist. Such performances, and their images, some of which are featured in the book, invoke the repeating arc of history — of the power of metaphor, the unflinching potency of symbols, and those dramatic and dynamic acts that bring meaning to the very essence of our unabashedly diverse cultural imprint on the world.

Untimely passing

Halla Bol puts forth the very need for a people’s theatre, a people’s will. This not only harks, as author Joyoti Roy mentions in the Lalit Kala Contemporary magazine (‘Depth of Field’, Vol. 52), to French dramatist Romain Rolland’s idea of ways in which performance can be used to create community awareness, but also to the essential task of advocating for social justice and human dignity as the bare minimum requisites of a society.

Hashmi was a full-time member of the Communist Party (Marxist), and 1989, when the book begins, itself stands alongside other significant Leftist developments taking place across the globe: the Velvet Revolution in Prague in memory of a student killed by Nazi forces 50 years earlier; or the students’ movement in Tiananmen Square demanding reforms to the freedom of speech (an event which has been strategically removed from textbooks and blocked on the Internet in that country); the collapse of the Berlin Wall following the terrible societal distortions it created along with the Cold War; or, in fact, closer home, the benchmark exhibition titled ‘Artists Alert’, which was organised by the Sahmat Trust at Lalit Kala Akademi in New Delhi to raise resources for the Janotsav art festival following Hashmi’s tragic and untimely passing.

No box

In essence, Deshpande’s book suggests that in order to defy the seemingly unmovable order of things, we must not only think ‘outside the box’ but also imagine that there is no box, that the fetters constructed by us, can only be destroyed by us, as suggested by NYT columnist Thomas Friedman.

To me, Hashmi’s life epitomises the art of countering — revolution, or peaceful protest, and how it must be seen in unison across the world — from the surge of voices chanting ‘We are the people’ at a church in Leipzig before the Berlin Wall came down to the artists in Turkey, one of whom (Erdem Gündüz) was later called The Standing Man, who quietly defied President Erdogan at Taksim Square in 2013.

Halla Bol compels us to revisit author Gene Sharp’s From Dictatorship to Democracy (1994), which creates the case for the single individual in society who dares to stand up — who in our present times could be Malala Yousafzai, Greta Thunberg or the congregation of brave women at Shaheen Bagh. They, in turn, remind us of moments such as the “eighteen golden days” (as recalled by novelist Ahdaf Soueif) of the Tahrir Square demonstrations, following which Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigned; or of acts of sheer disarming poise, such as that of anti-Vietnam War protester Jan Rose Kasmir confronting gun-wielding forces with a flower in October 1967 in Washington, D.C. (photographed by Marc Riboud). Together, these incidents suggest that “the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.” (Milan Kundera).

The book reminds us of the compelling stories of those who acted, documented and carried Hashmi’s legacy forward over the next 31 years. And it has poignantly lurched into our conscience at a critical time, when the very issue of citizenship rests before us. Perhaps a stepping away momentarily leads to greater perspective. It is only then that we will find ourselves racing “zigzag towards the precipice” as Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski said.

Deshpande suggests that we must continue to find ways of persevering, given that at one time Janam too seemed as though it was about to lose momentum. But Hashmi was unyielding. Like him, we too must scrutinise and volunteer constructive acts of defiance from our modern history — for instance, when press freedom was heavily curtailed during Emergency in 1975 and newspapers ran entire blank sections in protest.

And who better to quote than Bapu: “Given a just cause, capacity for endless suffering and avoidance of violence, victory is a certainty.”

304,2020/03/07,Play it again,"Contemporary theatre resonates with current affairs

Around Christmas last year, I met Hassan Abdulrazzak in London for dinner. For those who haven’t heard me talk enough about him, he is the award-winning Iraqi playwright of Baghdad Wedding, among many other important plays. He spoke to me of his latest work, The Special Relationship, which is currently playing in Soho.

Developed from interviews with ex-prisoners and experts in immigration and criminal law, this documentary play takes an ironic look at the so-called ‘special relationship’ between Britain and America through the lens of deportation. It tells the real-life stories of British subjects who were deported from the U.S. in the age of Trump, who we recently hosted here in India.

Relevant tales

Hassan Abdulrazzak is always pertinent. And it is unfortunate that his tales of strife remain relevant years after they have been written. Recent events in Delhi reminded me vividly of scenes from his play The Prophet, set in the 2011 uprising in Egypt. I must admit, it is rather bizarre how so much contemporary theatre that I have seen recently has resonated with current affairs, either knowingly or unknowingly. Hamilton, the blockbuster musical, is about a statesman trying to pass a bill, and deals with the troubles of immigrants.

Come from Away is a life-affirming tale about a community coming to the rescue of a large group of strangers in a crisis. I won’t reveal more. This is an excellent play. Get your hands on it or watch it.

A Museum in Baghdad is about the politics of preserving history in a changing landscape. And finally, the timeless Les Misérables, which covers too many socio-political issues to list here (including eventually quelled unrest), but drives home the fact that in the final analysis, not much has changed from early 19th century France.

Issue-based content

Recently, a lot of people from the arts were very vocal about their dissent with the goings on in our nation, and I’m hoping to see that permeate into the content they create this year, in whatever capacity. There seems to be a resurgence in issue-based content of late. While the Oscars’ darling, Parasite, paints a heartbreaking picture of class difference, cinema back home has also been taking subjects like homosexuality and domestic violence by the horns. These are interestingly charged times and theatre is always among the first mediums to be actively representative of the atmosphere.

Ancient Greek theatre, even the comedies, were extremely political. Aristophanes, back around 400 BC, wrote Lysistrata, which revolved around the women of Athens who decide to withhold sex till their husbands end the war. In March 2003, there were readings of the play held worldwide to protest against the possible war in Iraq.

Shakespeare too was fascinated with politics, and showed a keen understanding of it. We studied Julius Caesar in school, which is really one of the earliest political assassination thrillers I ever read. I recently watched a production of Coriolanus (written in the early 1600s), which is a great, sprawling action play, full of sword fights and social upheaval between Rome and a neighbouring tribe. It is also an extremely political play in which the issues of class, government and control are hotly debated.

Bertolt Brecht

Over the course of his career, Bertolt Brecht developed ‘epic theatre’, in which narrative, montage, self-contained scenes, and rational argument were used to create (or sometimes shock the audience into) realisation. His famous play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui was a satirical allegory of Hitler and the Nazi party.

Back home, I remember reading Girish Karnad’s Tughlaq in school and being quite taken with it. I even used a passage for an elocution competition. It is a somewhat Shakespearean study of political ambition and betrayal and a crazy despot’s whims.

Karnad wrote the play in Kannada in 1965 when India’s disillusionment with its government was at its peak. In an interview, Anupama Chandrashekhar says about Tughlaq: “I first read it in the 1990s, during the early chaos surrounding the Babri mosque’s demolition and India’s economic liberalisation, and I found the socio-political roiling of the 14th century strangely resonant. I reread it again recently and found premonitions of Trump. It is one of those rare gems that is both of its time and ahead of it.”

Circled back to Trump somehow. In Bombay, in the last decade, I have seen some terrific socio-political theatre, if I may call it that, by Quasar Thakore Padamsee (A Peasant of El Salvador, Project S.T.R.I.P.) and Sunil Shanbag (Cotton 56 Polyester 84, Sex, Morality and Censorship). And something tells me, there’s more to come.

305,2020/03/07,A tribute to five formidable women who have rewritten theatre history,"A salaam to five women of theatre

Theatre in Mumbai is about two things for me: language and space. While attending The Theatre of E Alkazi, a retrospective of Ebrahim Alkazi organised at the NGMA, I chanced upon Alkazi’s experiments at Megdhooth Terrace on Cumballa Hill in Mumbai. This was before theatre thespian Mama Warerkar identified the talent in this young lad; this was before Pandit Nehru requested the young lad to think about a national theatre institute; this was before NSD. As one studies the structure of Megdhooth Terrace you realise that the plays were made possible by “the humble carpenter.” It was a timely lesson for me that theatre is about the small things. It is about the nuts and bolts.

A peek at the halls in Mumbai where our plays are staged gives a good indication that most of them have been designed solely by male architects without consulting theatre persons. Most Mumbai groups have suffered while transferring their sets in and out of the Gadkari Rangayatan (Thane) on a rainy day. The Zaverben Hall (Ghatkopar) is located on the fourth floor and has only two lifts with no emergency exit. The sets have to be carried by an open lift. It is most cumbersome for transporting large pieces. The theatre thumbrule is that the size of the backstage area should be twice that of the stage. A walkway to the backstage is a must.

Which is why, when Sulabha Deshpande, a school teacher offered a makeshift hall to a Marathi theatre group on the top floor of a school in Dadar, no one dared imagine that “a dingy decrepit guerrilla space” would become the bastion for the avant garde Chabbildas Movement in Mumbai. Who could imagine that a rectangular hall on top of a rickety staircase would be the cradle for the most important theatre productions in 20th century Mumbai? One reason was for these doubts was that theatre had got stuck in a rut. The audience was accustomed to seeing plays in just one way. Chabbildas demolished those myths. For 18 years, Sulabha Deshpande was the backbone of the theatre symphonies at Chabbildas. Awishkar theatre group charged fifty rupees as rent for the hall, a fiver for spots, and three rupees for dimmers. For ₹150, you could stage a show and in many cases, even this was waived off.

Very few know that it was Sulabha Deshpande who played Virgil to Tendulkar’s Dante and coaxed him to pen children’s plays by promising to stage them in her school. Thankfully, Vijay Tendulkar complied.

Meanwhile, in a distant suburb of Mumbai, another space was born. Jennifer Kapoor created Prithvi Theatre at Juhu. In a way that curtain-less intimate space in Janki Kutir and her vision unshackled the performance praxis. I had a massive school boy crush on her (as I suspect everyone did). She was ironing costumes backstage when I saw her for the first time. She then placed the costumes on hooks (for a quick dress change) and on horizontal rods attached to the wings (for a double-quick costume change). The rest of the pile was carried to the greenroom and, in a short while, she emerged resplendent and ready for the show. For me, it became an allegory of life in the wings.

A few years later, thanks to Sanjna Kapoor who produced The Boy Who Stopped Smiling, I used to potter around Prithvi. On one such occasion, I chanced upon a pile of papers propping up a three-legged chair in the balcony. Among them, I found back-issues of PT Notes which Jennifer Kapoor published along with Tyeb and Sakina Mehta (exquisitely letter-pressed). And beneath that history, I found another history: Jennifer Kapoor’s Prithvi Theatre manifesto.

It contained a lot of simple tips. For example, “keep the stage area small and do not allow actors and audience to use the same entrance into the auditorium. Also, the stage area must be low or it will be impossible to light without a glare in the eyes of the audience. One must keep the actors’ world and the real world alone together but strictly separate.” She says, “beware of the multiple frame since it is suitable for everything, but good for nothing.”

She concludes the note by saying, “About Prithvi, let us not pretend we have not made enormous blunders. Every company which performs will have its pet complaints, some of which we will have to take seriously enough to make changes later. But let us present the theatre we intended to build, - perfectly meshed, no shabby curtains that ill-trained people hang around, and so on. Let us hope companies will use it in its ideal way, with the minimum of scenery, cameo sets within the area available. Or let us hope that eventually it will be used as a producing theatre with every production specially designed for this particular space.”

Two beneficiaries of this new space were Arundhati Nag and Veenapani Chawla. During their formative years in Mumbai, when they staged Gidhahe or Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, they realised the importance of a well-designed auditorium. Whether they worked with a theatre veteran like Mahendra Joshi or with an ensemble pool of actors, they grasped the importance of the thrust stage in which the audience is seated on three sides of the acting area; the fourth side being reserved for a permanent background. And finally, they realised the key to theatre was to decide on a form and make it as flexible as possible rather than adaptable to two or more forms.

A couple of decades later, Rangashankara (Bengaluru) and Adi Shakti (Puducherry) were born. Rangashankara is an honest tribute to Prithvi. Arundhati Nag had learnt her lesson well that there are basically two aspects to a good theatre: design and maintenance.

I recall my first tour around the work-in-progress structure, and I realised that most of the requirements had been fulfilled. Plus Nag had created a maintenance staff which ensures hygiene and upkeep. Since the designing of Rangashankara was done with assistance from a theatre person, it caters to the sensibilities of backstage and onstage requirements.

It has good depth of stage and technical backup. The light and sound arrangement along with the fly bars makes it easy to stage productions having large sets. Its backstage accessibility suits the heavy mountings that are required for a stage production.

Adishakti is less brick-and-mortar. It has a main auditorium plus a courtyard space which is deployed for training. The space is pretty and there is very little distance between the performance zone and the audience. It is the sort of theatre stage where you say to yourself that, if, like Moliere, I have to die on stage as an Imaginary Invalid, then it better be here. Since the death of Veenapani in 2014, Vinay Kumar and Nimmy Raphael are ensuring that the show goes on.

The one time I was in Pondicherry, Veenapani talked about ""the quality of hereness"" in theatre. I had no clue what she was saying. She spoke for a long time. The penny refused to drop till she pointed to a flower in bloom. “An actor's body is like that flower,” she said, and “the space should permit the actor to express those things.”

Such a thing is possible because of the intimate space. Which is perhaps why Adishakti productions have opened with visual metaphors. In The Hare and the Tortoise, for example, the performer is contained in a small box or square of light. Likewise in Adishakti's Brhannala, there is a scene where Drona is teaching the Kuru children. He does this through gestures, eyes, speech rhythms, content of word and movements. One can see the influence of a shadow puppet performance where the static puppets acquire mobility because of the mobile flame lamps. In 2001, Adishakti produced Ganapati. Again, the space permitted the Koodiyattam performer to be seen through a keyhole vision by the spectator.

Chandralekha’s dance pieces extend this vision. She once said, “In India, feminism has not been a failure because we have not even started trying it.” My final memory of her, stealing my sookha bhel on the Marine Line promenade. She was not permitted to eat “kachra” so it was being done stealthily. As the sea breeze blew in, on cue, the sookha bhel flew around here and there, and she remarked, “like dancers, they scatter in all directions”.

Like most theatrewallahs, I am attracted by unlikely juxtapositions and chance accidents on stage. I had made post-modern notes about Chandralekha creating visual poetry on stage. When I visited SPACES in Chennai, it offered me a vicarious experience. That is when I realised her rehearsing stage had no entry and exit. This may be a misdiagnosis but perhaps this is why her choreography had so many crisscross patterns in the background.

Chandralekha was the Pina Bausch of theatre for me. I mentioned this to her light designer and comrade Sadanand Menon. He recalled that when, in 2004, he stood with her at the SPACES main porch when the tsunami struck Chennai, the sea roared and the waves were 25 feet high. Chandralekha rushed to the main gate and commanded the waves to halt, and of course they did. Could your Pina Bausch do that?

As a theatrewallah what fascinates me are the turning points due to which our history has been rewritten. I salute all these five formidable women for doing what they did.

Salaam: Our plays would not be the same without you!

306,2020/03/07,Concern over Jagannath Temple’s deposits in Yes Bank,"Imposition of restriction on withdrawal of money from Yes Bank has sent political parties into a tizzy in Odisha as ₹545 crore belonging to Shree Jagannath Temple is deposited in the bank.

The two fixed deposits were to mature this month. However, the Reserve Bank of India cracked the whip on Yes Bank for its terrible financial position and serious governance issues.

All funds of the temple were parked in Yes Bank as the bank had then offered higher interest rate compared to other banks. The temple administration had, however, withdrawn a separate flexi deposit of ₹47 crore from Yes Bank.

The Shree Jagannath Temple managing committee at the last meeting on February 5 had taken a decision to transfer the fixed deposits from Yes Bank to any public sector banks through a tendering process on March 30.

Senior BJD leader and former Puri legislator Maheswar Mohanty said, “The temple administration should immediately consult RBI. It was a wrong decision to keep such a huge amount in Yes Bank in greed of higher interest rate.”

“The government must immediately take steps to transfer the fixed deposits to other public sector bank,” said senior Congress MLA Suresh Routray. A State BJP spokesperson said the government had no right to manage funds of Lord Jagannath so badly.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/concern-over-jagannath-temples-deposits-in-yes-bank/article31005064.ece
307,2020/03/07,Arunachal govt. seeks to stop border migration,"The Arunachal Pradesh government has sought pilot development projects to stop people living along its international borders, specifically with China, from migrating to faraway urban centres in the State.

Some MLAs representing the border constituencies said depopulation in border villages was posing a security threat, echoing former Chief Minister Kalikho Pul’s contention that foreign armies would find it easy to occupy vacant villages.

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,080 km border with China, 440 km with Myanmar and 160 km with Bhutan. Twenty of the State’s 60 Assembly constituencies touch the international borders, 13 of them with China.

Discussing the issue in the Assembly on Thursday, Chief Minister Pema Khandu agreed that people were migrating from the border villages but said depopulation in such areas was an exception and not the norm.

“Possible facilities are being provided to border villagers under the Border Area Development Programme being equally distributed to the border districts and it is for the elected representatives to ensure that the funds are utilised properly,” he said.

Mr. Khandu added the issue was serious and advocated selection of 10 census towns along the India-China border as pilot projects for infrastructure development so that people can be dissuaded from migrating for livelihood. He informed the House that the State government has proposed a special package of ₹4.60 crore to the Union Home Ministry for development of infrastructure in the border areas.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/arunachal-govt-seeks-to-stop-border-migration/article31005060.ece

309,2020/03/07,"Cong. wants to get me killed, says BJP MLA","‘Congress wants to reduce BJP numbers this way, secure govt.'

BJP MLA Vishvas Sarang, accused by the Congress for his involvement in the attempt at “horsetrading” recently, on Friday wrote to the Madhya Pradesh Director General of Police alleging the removal gunman from his security cover was a conspiracy by the Congress to get him assassinated, so that BJP numbers in the Vidhan Sabha fell and the government could be secured. The Congress has denied the charge.

“By withdrawing the gunman, the Congress wants to get me killed or lynched. I’ll still go out in public,” the legislator from Narela, Bhopal told reporters. “They are perpetrating injustice against us, and this is their way of reducing our numbers in the Assembly, so that their government is protected.”

Pointing that he was informed by the police that another gunman would be deputed with him, Mr. Sarang said he’d not accept the replacement. “With the new one, they’ll try to spy on me or kill me.”

Mr. Sarang is a former Minister who Congress MP Digvijaya Singh on Thursday blamed, besides four other BJP leaders, of indulging in the attempt at “horsetrading” recently. Mr. Singh had claimed the leaders were luring MLAs supporting the Kamal Nath government with bribes to cross over, in an attempt to subvert the regime.

Claiming the Congress government targeted him after Mr. Singh levelled the charge, Mr. Sarang said,“It seems like this episode was scripted by Digvijaya Singh. His own son led the ‘rescue’ of his own supporters. All this just to upstage his political existence,” he said.

Stating BJP leaders were seeking sympathy with such “frivolous remarks”, State Congress media incharge Shobha Oza said, “Such statements suggest that after the BJP’s plan to snatch away the government by murdering democracy was foiled, its leaders haven’t just gone mad but owing to sadness and disappointment become mentally deranged. Predators are now referring to themselves as prey.”

Ms. Oza explained that the charge was baseless as transfers of security personnel and government officials was a routine exercise.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/cong-wants-to-get-me-killed-says-bjp-mla/article31005038.ece
310,2020/03/07,"Free power, cash incentives in Assam budget ahead of polls","Opposition Congress walks out over leaking of document on govt. website

The BJP-led government in Assam has announced a slew of cash incentives for almost everyone from school students to the elderly, besides free electricity and a development corporation for indigenous Muslims, apparently with an eye on the Assembly elections next year.

State Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday presented a deficit budget of ₹1,249 crore for 2020-21 fiscal after the Opposition Congress staged a walkout against the alleged leaking of the document on the government’s website before his speech. Assembly Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami downplayed the issue.

“The budget has two parts – general proposals and tax proposals. The leakage of general proposals is not a breach of privilege,” he said.

Mr. Sarma proposed free electricity to all households with a monthly consumption of less than 30 units.

“About 14 lakh families will benefit from the scheme,” he said. The government would be transferring ₹400 crore to the Assam Power Development Corporation Limited to insulate other consumers from upward revision in tariffs.

The government has also proposed free ride for women and senior citizens in a fleet of dedicated pink buses under a new scheme named Bhraman Sarathi.

The scheme has been extended to the unemployed youth too, but for those appearing in various examinations or for job interviews.

The budget offers a windfall for tea plantation workers and indigenous Muslims. The proposals include transferring ₹3,000 each to the 7,21,485 tea garden workers who had received ₹5,000 during 2019-20 fiscal for “inculcating banking habits”, wage compensation of ₹18,000 in six instalments for pregnant Adivasi women, one-time support of ₹10,000 each for children of plantation workers who pass Class X and Class XII exams, smartphones for some 4,000 tea garden sardars and ₹50,000 as gratuity to tea workers.

“We have made provisions for creating a development corporation for indigenous Muslims in Assam. For this purpose, a socio-economic census of these communities is on a war-footing,” Mr. Sarma said.

For students

Assam has budgeted a substantial amount for students. According to the proposals, ₹1,000 would be provided each to 1 lakh students for textbooks in government-run schools.

The students will be entitled to ₹1,000 per month to cover hostel expenditure and a one-time education loan subsidy of ₹50,000 while top-ranked female students in Class XII will be given scooties.

“We shall be providing ₹40,000 in lieu of 1 tola of gold to newlywed brides with an annual family income of less than ₹5 lakh,” Mr. Sarma said. The elderly have been covered too. “We shall be providing a one-time grant of ₹25,000 to widows ,” he said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/tb3n4e/article31005017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE07BUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/free-power-cash-incentives-in-assam-budget-ahead-of-polls/article31005019.ece
311,2020/03/07,Irate locals block tipper lorries at Koodathayi,"They allege drivers violate speed limits and cause accidents

Flaying the alleged apathy of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) and the police in taking action against speed limit violations by overloaded trucks, a group of irate local residents on Saturday blocked around 50 tipper lorries at Koodathayi near Thamarassery.

The death of a doctor after being knocked down by a tipper lorry on Friday triggered the protest against erring lorry drivers. The protesters alleged that the drivers were creating terror on narrow village roads and that smaller vehicles, especially motorbikes, faced serious threat.

They claimed that speed breakers in the trucks were tampered with, in the absence of surprise inspections by the MVD or the police.

‘Roads being damaged’

The locals who took part in the road blockade claimed that the overloaded vehicles transporting quarry products were also responsible for damaging roads and causing long traffic snarls.

T. Majeed, a resident, said the trucks carrying stones and other quarry products from Mukkom violated speed limits and were involved in road accidents. The restrictions on operating the trucks during school time had put more pressure on drivers to finish their work early in the morning, he said.

Mr. Majeed pointed out that there were several incidents in which motorbike riders had a narrow escape from accidents caused by such lorry drivers on the Mukkom-Thamarassery route.

Following the protest, the issue was taken up for discussion at the Thamarassery Taluk Vikasana Samithi meeting on Saturday.

Tahsildar Mohammed Rafeeq said the police and MVD officials who attended the meeting were asked to take immediate legal measures for addressing public concerns. They would intensify road checking from Sunday, he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/8j2gm/article31011696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07KIPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/irate-locals-block-tipper-lorries-at-koodathayi/article31011697.ece
312,2020/03/07,Kozhikode gets good representation in reconstituted BJP State unit,"However, tug of war remains between party factions

Amid simmering differences, north Kerala, especially Kozhikode district, has secured proper representation in the revamped list of the State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit.

However, the tug of war in the party remains, as many senior leaders like K.P. Sreeshan, P.M. Velayudhan, Chettoor Balakrishnan, and P. Leelavathi, all from Kozhikode, have been left out.

M.T. Ramesh, who was tipped to be State president, was retained as State general secretary in the new team led by K. Surendran, who announced the list of new office-bearers on Thursday. Both had been presidents of the State unit of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), but now spearheaded two factions led by Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Mureleedhran and former State president P.K. Krishnadas respectively.

The coming days will witness more disgruntled elements coming out publicly against the leadership. The RSS State leadership and the Krishnadas faction have expressed their resentment over the nominations.

Incumbent State general secretary of BJYM C.R. Praphul Krishna, who hails from Ayyancherry near Vadakara, has been elevated to the post of president of the youth wing. The outgoing BJYM State president, K.P. Prakash Babu, who also hails from Kozhikode, has been made State secretary of the BJP. He was the party candidate in the Kozhikode parliamentary constituency last year.

P. Regunath, president of the north zone unit of the party and former BJP Kozhikode district president, has also been made State secretary. Likewise, outgoing BJP Kozhikode district president T.P. Jayachandran has been nominated to head the north zone unit.

V.V. Rajan, who was BJP district president and general secretary, has been made State vice president. N.P. Radhakrishnan, hailing from Vellayil in coastal Kozhikode and a functionary of the Bharateeya Mastya Sangham, has been nominated as State president of OBC Morcha, another wing of the party.

Demoted

Senior leader M.S. Kumar, who has been made State spokesman of the party, has aired his opinion against his new assignment. Shobha Surendran and A.N. Radhakrishnan, who were demoted to vice presidents from State general secretaries, are unhappy with their roles as well.

The Beypore Port Development Committee on Friday said it would take out a march to the collectorate on March 9 seeking the overall development of the port to equip it to greet more international cargo ships and facilitate easy movement of vessels by completing the pending dredging works and extension of wharfs.

At a press conference here, the committee leaders alleged that cargo vessels were finding it hard to anchor near the port with the huge deposit of silt in the area. During the tidal fluctuations, it was found affecting the movement of vessels, they said.

U. Pokker, chairman of the committee, said the poor length of the existing wharfs and the damaged cranes were creating a lot of trouble for the cargo vessel operators. Many a time, the wharfs were also found inadequate to manage the number of ships coming to Beypore, he said.

Committee leaders N. Anil Kumar and A.E. Mathew said several acres of land owned by the Port Department remained unused near the Beypore Port in the absence of a proper development plan. Even the port land earlier given on lease for the use of Steel Industries Kerala Limited was not taken back after the permitted term, they claimed.

According to them, official apathy was the main reason for the backwardness of Beypore Port, which was once the hub of maritime trade and had assumed a prominent role in connecting Kerala with West Asia. Though the State government had taken into possession three acres for port development, the transfer of land documents for starting any development activity was not done due to negligence on the part of a few officials, they claimed.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/activists-to-take-out-protest-march-against-neglect-of-port/article31005306.ece

The blast, which occurred around noon, resulted in the instant death of a worker, while Mariappan suffered grievous injuries. Fire tenders from Sankarankoil, Kazhugumalai and Vembakottai were pressed into service to douse the flames. Heavy smoke inside the shed led to delay in putting out the fire.

Mariappan was initially admitted to Sankarankoil GH and subsequently taken to Kovilpatti GH, where the doctors suggested that the patient get admitted in Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital. He died of his injuries in the forenoon on Saturday.

Government Rajaji Hospital’s neurology department began the celebration of its golden jubilee anniversary with a lecture series here on Saturday.

The two-day function was inaugurated by the Dean, GRH, J. Sangumani, the first head of the department K. Srinivasan and the current head of the department P. K. Murugan.

“Anaesthetics make a person unconscious but neurosurgeons make the patient conscious. This is the only branch of medicine which consistently takes time to understand the thorough history of the patient. This is why clinical teaching is still alive,” said Dr. Sangumani. He recounted the contribution of veterans to the field and added that Dr. Srinivasan who helped begin the department in Madurai, dedicated his entire life to teaching both inside and outside the classroom.

Dr. Srinivasan said that in 1970, the neurology department at GRH was the second to be started across all major hospitals in Tamil Nadu. “Unlike many centres in India and abroad, most sub- specialities are under a single roof. With the availability of MRI, PET scans and laboratory services at the GRH, it becomes easy to ensure that all relevant investigations are done here. The 50 year-old department has been serving the greater portion of south Tamil Nadu for years,"" he said.

Organising secretary and the HOD, Dr. Murugan said that the GRH can ensure that most patients who come in within three hours of a stroke can be stabilised without any disabilities for free. “The system in place is very effective now,” he said. He added that as part of the golden jubilee celebrations, a total of 50 lectures will be held over the next year.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/s1jsto/article31008746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MARTH-GRH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/golden-jubilee-of-government-rajaji-hospitals-neurosurgery-department-celebrated/article31008748.ece

Inaugurating the 36th annual conference of the Indian Radiological and Imaging Association, Karnataka Chapter, Mr. Narayan said many radiologists are worried over the provisions of PCPNDT Act as it affects the use of their imaging machines in the scanning centres.

“You know why this Act has been formulated. Think practically and suggest us solution,” Mr. Narayan said, and added that he understood the concerns of radiologists better as he came from the field of medicine.

Mr. Narayan asked the association to take up the issue in right earnest by forming a task force.

“Take up the issue on priority. If this problem is not solved then those in rural areas will be denied of necessary medical services,” he said.

The State has lagged in providing the necessary medical facilities to people and he sought the cooperation of radiologists in providing quality and effective treatment.

The Minister said that the State government was pushing forward private-public partnerships in providing various medical services.

330,2020/03/07,Come out of obsession with reporting on politics: Dy. CM,"He says giving priority to political matters will not be of use to common man

Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Saturday said that the media should come out of its obsession with reporting on politics. Speaking at the 35th annual State conference of the Karnataka Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) at the Town Hall, he said that giving priority to politics in reporting will not be of much use to the common reader.

Instead the media should explore developments in other diversified sectors which will help people in general, he said.

Post liberalisation, commercial interests dominated every sector in the society. In such a scenario maintaining values and credibility has become a challenge to journalists and media houses. Amid such environment, journalists will have to maintain individual values and not get lured by commercial interests, he said.

He said that nowadays it is not possible to have expertise in every field. Hence journalists can have expertise in a selected sector.

Sandhya Pai, managing editor, Taranga weekly, said that there was uncertainty over the future of print media as the reading habits of people was on the decline across the world.

Ms. Pai said that it was not right to use media to create unrest in society by twisting or glorifying news. “One has to ponder whether the media houses owned by corporates or individuals with political affiliations provide justice to readers while publishing the matters,” she said, adding that there should be competition among publications but not rivalry.

D. Veerendra Heggade, pattadhikari, Dharmasthala, said that journalists need to have a lot of patience and should publish matters keeping the interest and health of society in mind. Kota Srinivasa Poojary, Minister for Endowment, Ports and Fisheries, said that readers expected journalist to do justice to them.

Panicked Yes Bank customers were seen queuing up at the bank’s ATMs at various locations, but to no avail as as most cash-dispensing machines ran dry, after the Reserve Bank placed the crisis-hit lender under a moratorium.

However, customers said they were able to withdraw the stipulated amount of ₹50,000 through cheques at various Yes Bank branches.

Customers are also facing trouble because net banking services are not working and some even complained that their credit cards are also not working.







As the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has superseded the board of the private sector lender on a precarious financial condition and has appointed a former SBI executive as its administrator, customers cannot withdraw more than ₹50,000 under the moratorium period till April 3, 2020.

“If SBI goes solo and picks up 49% stake, then immediate investment requirement is ₹2,450 crore,” he said. He clariﬁed that a potential investor needs to comply with the ﬁt and proper criteria of RBI if they want to pick up more than 5% stake, as is the norm.

“There are many potential investors after seeing the scheme. They have approached us. And there are some good names. Anybody who wants to go above 5%,

they have to meet the ﬁt and proper criteria of the RBI,” he said. Observing investors sawopportunity in the country’s ﬁnancial sector, Mr. Kumar said SBI’s investment team will hold discussions with the potential investors and then present a plan to the RBI along with other investors.

“That is a possibility but no ﬁrm decision has been made as of now,” he said. The bank, which is under the RBI-appointed administrator now, is valued at ₹10 per share but later, when the administrator is removed, a new investor will have to pick up stake at a value which will be decided by the pricing formula of the market regulator. Mr. Kumar expects Yes Bank to quickly come out of the administration. When asked about the valuation of Yes Bank, he said while SBI’s investment team was working the valuation proposed by the RBI, prima facie, the valuation looks fair.

“If it is ₹10 (per share) and [there are] 255 crore shares, then the value of the bank is ₹2,550 crore. The bank has 1,150 branches, they have a strong retail franchise, which has a very good technology platform. So, it appears the bank is worth ₹2,550 crore,” he said

The SBI chairman said the impact on the capital position of the bank due to the investment will not be signiﬁcant. “We have done our math. The capital ratios will not be impacted. There is very marginal impact on the bank’s capital adequacy ratio. All the ratios, as a policy, we maintain them at 50 bps higher than the regulatory requirement.

We will continue to do that without any further release of the capital,” he said. Mr. Kumar said there is‘no question’ of requesting the government for any capital. Mr. Kumar defended the government’s decision to rope in SBI for the bailout of Yes Bank and said a bank’s failure had a consequences for the economy.

“SBI is a national institute of importance. When there s a banking institution in particular, the survival of the bank is a must otherwise there is a huge contagion effect. We have to keep in mind, when it is a bank, whether it is small, medium or big, its failure has huge consequences for the ﬁnancial sector and the economy.”

“If today, a resolution has to happen, realising that need, you need a credible name with the investors, creditors and depositors of the bank.

Yes, SBI is standing behind it, has been asked to stand behind it,” he added. Arm’s-length He clariﬁed that the SBI will keep arm’s-length from the day-to-day operations of Yes Bank and there was no question of conﬂict of interest. The SBI will also not try to lure the next customers of Yes Bank.

“We don’t thrive in misery of others. One thing has to be very clear, that it is a strategic investment. Like we do with all our associate and subsidiaries, it will be a professional board and a professional management team.

The bank, as a shareholder and investor, hascertain expectations from the management team and the board. Other than that, there is no question of any conﬂict of interest. We will keep, not one arm’s-length but two arms’- length from Yes Bank,” he said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/k9ueoe/article31007680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SBIChairman,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/maximum-investment-in-yes-bank-will-be-10000-crore-says-sbi-chairman-rajnish-kumar/article31007681.ece
338,2020/03/07,Centre invites bids for sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.,"However, sliding crude oil prices may prove a dampener on the process

The government on Saturday invited bids for the sale of its entire 52.98% stake in country’s second biggest State-owned oil reﬁner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL).

However, amid falling oil prices, analysts believe that the government will ﬁnd it diﬃcult to get a good valuation for the company.

“The government’s plan to sell its stake in BPCL could be delayed, as many global oil majors that have been looking at the company as an outlet to reﬁne their crude may revaluate their bids in a scenario of sinking oil prices,” said Fitch Ratings

Global oil majors, starting from world’s largest oil ﬁrm Saudi Aramco to U.S. major ExxonMobil, from Russia’s oil major Rosneft to Royal Dutch Shell, from Total of France to Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), are said to be interested in

buying out the government’s stake in BPCL. Expressions of interest for the strategic sale of BPCL have been invited by May 2, as per the bid document by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). “The Government of India is proposing strategic disinvestment of its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising 114.91 crore equity shares,

which constitute 52.98% of BPCL’s equity share capital, along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer (except BPCL’s equity shareholding of 61.65%in Numaligarh Reﬁnery Limited),” said the bid document. “Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell will be the front runners for BPCL. Saudi Aramco believes that their oil will last for eternity and so they want to get long-term

crude supply contracts for Saudi oil. For Shell, tough environment norms in the West will be major factor to make reﬁneries investment in India,” a director of an oil marketing company (OMC) told The Hindu.

BPCL shares on the BSE closed down 3.74% to ₹402.85 on the BSE in a weak Mumbai market on Friday, valuing the company at ₹87,388.4 crore. The government has set $10 billion minimum net worth as one of the eligibility criteria in the expression of interest (EoI) for BPCL.

In case of a consortium of investors bidding for taking a stake in the oil reﬁner and marketer, the minimum net worth for each member has been set at $1 billion, according to the bid document. The government has explicitly excluded public sector units (PSUs), having 51% government ownership, from bidding for BPCL, a move that will make Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) ineligible to bid for BPCL.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hg8fw0/article31007260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BPCL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/government-invites-bids-for-sale-of-bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd/article31007261.ece

China's exports tumbled 17.2% in January-February from a year earlier, while imports shrank 4%, as a fast spreading coronavirus outbreak caused massive disruptions in economic activity that rippled through global supply chains, customs data showed on Saturday.

340,2020/03/07,Monetary policy can’t combat the COVID-19 impact,"A rate cut can help to boost sentiment but that will be transient as the market’s reaction after the Fed rate cut proves

The huge 50 basis points cut in rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday to lift economic sentiment hit by COVID-19 has disrupted central banking worldwide. Even as analysts debate whether a monetary policy response is the right strategy, central banks across the world are feeling the pressure to follow suit to the largest rate cut by the Fed since 2008.

Central banks of Australia and Malaysia have cut rates already while others such as the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and the European Central Bank are contemplating joining the caravan.

First line of defence

With monetary policy turning out to be the de facto first line of economic defence against the ill-effects of the virus, the focus in India has turned to the Reserve Bank of India’s response. Yields on 10-year government securities fell by as much as 0.12% on Wednesday in the hope of a rate cut by the RBI and they stayed soft on Thursday. But what are the central bank’s options? Unlike other countries, the legal framework in India after the setting up of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is such that the RBI cannot unilaterally adjust rates. The MPC will have to meet and deliberate on the situation before the call to cut rates is taken and such a call will have to be based on an assessment of inflation in the economy. But is a rate cut the right response?

The first order impact on the global economy of the spreading virus is disruption to trade and to global supply chains. With China being the factory of the world, the clampdown in that country has already disrupted supplies of products ranging from cell phone components to bulk drugs and auto components. Factory lines across the world could freeze as supply chains get disrupted.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has estimated that global merchandise exports could shrink by $50 billion due to the impact of the virus. Compared to the total world merchandise exports of $19.48 trillion (2018) the shrinkage appears small but it could just be the beginning.

Editorial | Viral economies: On coronavirus impact

Monetary policy is excellent to address demand shocks but is a blunt tool when it comes to addressing supply-side issues. People may be encouraged to spend more due to a rate cut but what will they spend on if products go scarce, travel convulses and public spaces such as movie theatres and malls become no-go areas?

Pressure on RBI

A rate cut can, at best, help to boost sentiment but that again will be transient as the market’s reaction after the Fed rate cut proves. The Swedish central bank’s deputy governor Anna Breman has rightly questioned the logic of a rate cut as a response to the coronavirus impact pointing out that an expansionary monetary policy cannot improve the situation.

Yet, sentiment being what it is, the RBI may find itself under increasing pressure to act. Given the MPC constraint, it may well choose to do what it did in the February monetary policy-- unleash other weapons in its armoury to give the same effect as a rate cut. Thus, we may well see the central bank announcing another tranche of long-term repo operation, akin to the ₹1 lakh crore that it announced in February. That will mean that banks will gain access to three-year funds at the repo rate of 5.15%, much lower than the market rate. And then, there’s Operation Twist which the RBI employed to good effect in December, softening rates at the long end of the yield curve.

But it’s doubtful if any of these measures can address the hit to economic growth. The virus has undoubtedly surfaced at a very wrong time for the Indian economy which is showing hesitant signs of a return to growth. The impact will be felt on more than one front. Industries such as pharmaceuticals, electronics and automobiles could be headed for trouble given their high dependence on Chinese inputs. While the government is said to be formulating a response, including the possibility of airlifting supplies, the practicality of this solution needs to be watched as also its impact on costs for the industries concerned.

Possible fall in exports

The bigger problem could be from a fall in exports, which accounts for 20% of the GDP. If the developed world tips into recession due to the virus, exporters of products ranging from petroleum and textiles to leather and gems and jewellery will feel the heat.

The offsetting factor, of course, will be a lower oil import bill due to the sharp fall in oil prices. This may also have a benevolent effect on inflation. But there will be other headaches for the central bank if the developed world embarks on monetary expansion. The RBI will be faced with the challenge of staunching inflows of hot money coming in search of the higher returns available in India.

But as with every crisis, there’s also opportunity here. Economic growth is bound to suffer in the short-term but there could be long-term spin-offs if domestic industry and government get their acts right. Supply chains can be localised through fresh investments and India can bid to be an alternative to China in the global value chain.

The COVID-19 crisis has only underlined in red the lesson that global corporations learnt when trade war broke out between the U.S. and China-- the global supply chain needs alternative options to China. India is eminently qualified to assume that role. If only our policymakers and industrialists rise up to the challenge.

341,2020/03/07,Banking on bailouts: On Yes Bank crisis,"The prompt bailout proposal for Yes Bank, while commendable, raises several questions

Just one day after it placed the financially troubled Yes Bank under a moratorium, the Reserve Bank of India announced a draft ‘Scheme of Reconstruction’ that entails the State Bank of India (SBI) investing capital to acquire a 49% stake in the restructured private lender. The alacrity with which the bailout has been proposed is commendable, given that Yes Bank’s stock tumbled 56% on the BSE on Friday, eroding shareholders’ holdings and dragging the 10-bank S&P BSE Bankex down with it, an indicator of the contagion risk that a sudden bank resolution can pose to the financial system. However, the decision to suspend normal business operations raises several worrying questions, both about the health of the banking sector, and the adequacy of the oversight role that regulators essay. Yes Bank’s troubles are not exactly new or unique and its problems with mounting bad and dodgy loans reflect the underlying woes in the borrower industries, ranging from real estate to power and non-banking financial companies. The continued inability of several corporates to repay their loans resulting in many landing up in insolvency proceedings has meant that lenders have been the hardest hit. Yes Bank, which is yet to report third-quarter financials, suffered a dramatic doubling in gross non-performing assets over the April-September six-month period to ₹17,134 crore, even as it scrambled to raise capital to shore up its balance sheet. With the economy in the throes of a persistent slowdown, the prospects of banks’ burden of bad loans easing soon are limited.

Also Read Saying ‘yes’ to troubled borrowers cost lender dear

The fact that the lender ended up at the resolution stage, without ever being placed under the central bank’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, also raises a question mark over how and why Yes Bank eluded the specifically tailor-made solution to address weakness at banks. While some have pointed to the fact that the lender’s stated operational metrics had not breached the pre-set thresholds for triggering the PCA action, the central bank had in recent years flagged several concerns, including a distinct divergence between the reported and RBI’s own findings on the bank’s financials. This could then be a good opportunity for the RBI to review its PCA guideposts and revise them to ensure that such a slipping under the radar does not recur. The choice of SBI as the investor to effect the bailout reflects the paucity of options the government has. With several other public sector banks currently engaged in merging with weaker peers as part of the Centre’s plan, it has fallen on the country’s largest bank to play the role of a white knight to a private rival. While Yes Bank’s depositors are sure to heave a huge sigh of relief, India’s banking sector is still far from out of the woods. Clearly, the RBI and Centre have their task cut out in ensuring that the need for such bailouts is obviated.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/banking-on-bailouts-the-hindu-editorial-on-yes-bank-crisis/article31003751.ece
342,2020/03/07,Double-edged sword: On Supreme Court’s cryptocurrency ruling,"The SC ruling gives relief to cryptocurrency exchanges, but they still need to be regulated

That the Supreme Court struck down as “disproportionate” a 2018 circular by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that directed entities not to provide services to those trading in “virtual currencies” (cryptocurrencies) is understandable. After all, despite ministerial committee recommendations, and warnings by institutions such as the RBI about the problematic nature of their payment and exchange methods, the use of virtual currencies over the Internet continues to remain legal in India. But the immediate effect of the RBI circular was to choke the agencies that sought to provide a platform to facilitate trading in cryptocurrencies by cutting them off from banks. This, the petitioners claimed, had a chilling effect on the fledgling cryptocurrency exchanges industry in India and went against their entrepreneurial right to operate a business enshrined in Article 19(1)(g). The Court conceded this limited point saying that the “RBI has not come out with a stand that any of the entities regulated by it... have suffered any loss... on account of [cryptocurrency] exchanges” and this provides relief to the firms providing the virtual exchanges.

Also read | Supreme Court order on cryptocurrency will offer only temporary relief

After a decade or so of deployment and use, the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies are now well known. The primary misgiving with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has remained the highly speculative nature of assessing their value. From humble beginnings, the cryptocurrency traded at a peak of $20,000 in mid-2018 before crashing to $3,000 by the end of the year, signaling the volatility that came to be associated with this instrument. This limited its original purpose of becoming an alternative and stable currency that is not backed by any central institution but derives trust from its intricate blockchain ledger system. Moreover, reports suggest that bitcoins, with their assured anonymity, remain popular with currency speculators, and in use in illicit transactions over the “dark web”. But their utility due to the robust nature of the blockchain algorithm is also not to be sneezed on. Cryptocurrencies have now been adopted by international trading firms for use in lending, raising funds for other cryptoprojects besides facilitating easier cross-border payments. It is for these utilities that the Indian government should err on the side of jurisdictions such as the European Union which have not outrightly banned the instrument and have sought to regulate its functioning. The 2019 Bill even proposed the creation of a “digital rupee” as official currency. It is now imperative on authorities to find the right “regulatory balance” on cryptocurrencies, a task that is easier thought than done, considering their ever-evolving nature due to technological innovation.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/double-edged-sword-the-hindu-editorial-on-supreme-courts-cryptocurrency-ruling/article31003745.ece
343,2020/03/07,International Women’s Day: When hands that serve are raised in protest,"The fight for an increase in honorarium and demanding better working conditions

For years, thousands of midday meal and anganwadi workers have been fighting for an increase in honorarium and demanding better working conditions. They have held numerous protests, boycotted work and marched to the capital from different parts of the State, making headlines even as they did so.

Behind these massive movements is the meticulous planning by some union leaders, mostly women. S. Varalakshmi, State president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said that she realised she had the qualities to be an activist nearly three decades ago when she joined the union at a factory she was working in at Kumbalgodu.

She began fighting for workers who were being laid off after their apprenticeship. Her fiery speeches and ability to multi-task, she says, worked in her favour and she soon began mobilising workers in the industrial area around her factory to unionise. Once she started working with CITU as a full-time member in 1994, she started working with garment, midday meal, beedi and anganwadi workers.

She has participated in hundreds of protests, is named in six police cases and has been arrested twice, but there is no stopping, she says. “Mobilising such a large number of workers is a challenge. But when we are at a protest or begin a movement, the energy is infectious. It is enough to keep us going,” she says.

She has even attempted her hand at mainstream politics thrice, once successfully in a panchayat election.

Another woman who is seen at the forefront of the protests, particularly of the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, is D. Nagalakshmi of the All India Trade Union Centre (AITUC). Initially part of a women’s organisation in college, her activism dates back to 27 years ago. She later got involved with the trade union and has been the voice of several marginalised women.

“Protest is the only way a society can change. There are lot of hurdles, but every time I am involved in a protest, I feel like it is a step towards ending women’s problems,” she says. She admits there may be times when a protest may not succeed, but they need to introspect and strategise better for the next one.

Asked why she did not venture into mainstream politics, she says, “That requires money and muscle power. but ultimately everything is political. If I am given the opportunity to serve people in this manner, I will venture into it.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jm0a4d/article31011379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGANGANWADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/international-womens-day-when-hands-that-serve-are-raised-in-protest/article31011380.ece

345,2020/03/07,"Delimitation exercise ‘outdated on arrival’, say citizens","It is based on the 2011 census data and doesn’t reflect the ground reality

The draft of the ward delimitation exercise that the State government has recently published has drawn much criticism from several citizens, especially from the outer zones.

The substance of most critique is that the exercise is solely based on the 2011 census data and doesn’t reflect the ground reality and is hence ‘unscientific’, making the new wards ‘outdated on arrival’. Citizens’ groups have also come down heavily on the inaccessibility of the draft document, objections for which can be submitted till March 17.

Bengaluru Navanirmana Party (BNP), a new political outfit launched by citizens’ groups, has argued that apart from the 2011 census, electoral roles and databases of property tax payers, power and water connections should be the basis and area, length of roads, stormwater drains must also be considered while carving out wards.

“The draft lists areas of a particular ward, but doesn't give its map. There are no details of area, length of roads, stormwater drains and other public assets in these proposed wards,” said Srikanth Narasimhan of BNP.

The delimitation exercise mainly seeks to bring parity in the size of wards in the core city and outer zones, as outer zones have seen a explosion of growth, making those wards several times larger than the ones in the core city. Population in the core city grew at 17% during 2001-11 while the outer zones grew at a rate of 116%. This has only aggravated since then.

Data by the BBMP Restructuring Committee 2015 and electoral rolls of 2018 and 2019 show population in some wards in the core areas has actually gone down while wards in outer zones continue to see exponential growth.

But the draft doesn't bring in parity, argue citizens’ groups. For instance, in Mahadevapura, one of the largest zones, the draft increases the number of wards from eight to 10. However, Whitefield Rising, collating electoral roll data of 2019, indicated that contrary to the BBMP's objective to carve out wards of an average population of 42,000, the actual population of the 10 wards will be over 75,000, an increase of 78% to the ideal size fixed by the civic body for delimitation. They have called for a separate Mahadevapura corporation, as per the recommendation of the BBMP Restructuring Committee.

The average size of wards in 2007 (based on 2001 census) when BBMP was formed was kept around 30,000, but that has long been surpassed in most wards. Based on 2011 census data (84 lakh), the delimitation draft fixes the average ward size at 42,000. But by its own estimates, BBMP officially claims that the current population is around 1.30 crore. If the average population of each ward needs to be kept at 42,000, then the city needs to have 315 wards, not 198.

KMC Act limitation

However, the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (KMC) Act, 1976 doesn’t allow for a city corporation to have more than 200 wards.

Meanwhile, the recently presented State Budget has committed to a dedicated Bengaluru Governance Law that will bring the city administration out of the ambit of the KMC Act and the 200-ward limit. Work on the law is in the preliminary stages while the civic polls are scheduled for September 2020.

“The process should have been started much earlier. Now we are stuck in a catch-22-like situation. To do it right means promulgating a new law, increasing the number of wards, but delaying civic elections. If elections are to be held in time, we will be stuck with a delimitation exercise severely outdated on arrival. We suspect that this is only a ploy to delay elections,” said N.S. Mukunda, founder-president of Citizen Action Forum, an umbrella organisation of several RWAs in the city.

Restructuring report

The BBMP Restructuring Report 2015 had proposed five corporations comprising a total of 400 wards for the city.

“There seems to be no enthusiasm for multiple corporations. But ideally, we need to have more wards to take the administration nearer to citizens. We need to carve out wards and zones based on certain criteria like the maximum distance a citizen should go to his ward/zone office,” said V. Ravichandar, a member of the committee.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/delimitation-exercise-outdated-on-arrival-say-citizens/article31010710.ece

347,2020/03/07,Kannada film distributor held for harassing NRI woman,"He met the woman in Melbourne and followed her to the city

The Nandini Layout police have arrested a 37-year-old Kannada film distributor from Australia for allegedly blackmailing an NRI woman with private videos after taking ₹6 lakh from her.

“The accused, Roopesh, was arrested on Friday after he followed the woman from Melbourne to Bengaluru and started harassing her here,” said a senior police officer.

The woman finally approached the police and lodged a complaint following which a team arrested Roopesh from a hotel near J.P. Park, Yeshwantpur. He has been charged with extortion and outraging the modesty of a woman.

“Roopesh is a film distributor for well-known Kannada and other South Indian language films in Melbourne. That is where he met the woman, who was living with her husband and children,” said Shashi Kumar, DCP (North division). The duo exchanged phone numbers and he later met her at a restaurant where he allegedly spiked her drink and took videos of her in compromising positions.

“In her statement, the woman said he started blackmailing her and demanding sexual favours. He threatened to post the videos on social media,” an officer said.

Fearing her reputation, the victim paid him ₹6 lakh, but he continued to harass her. In an attempt to escape, the woman returned to Bengaluru and stayed with her in-laws. “Roopesh, however, followed her. He arrived in the city on February 22 and continued to harass her,” the officer added.

349,2020/03/07,Red sanders worth ₹4.75 lakh seized in Bhanavaram Reserve Forest area,"Four arrested while clearing away logs

Forest Department officials arrested four people for cutting and smuggling red sander logs from Bhanavaram Reserve Forest area.

The Bhanavaram Reserve Forest area near Sholinghur is home to a number of grown red sander trees. Incidents of red sander theft from the area have been reported earlier.

Forest officials patrolling in the forest found two illegally felled red sander trees. Three teams were formed to nab the culprits responsible, under the leadership of Muralidharan, Assistant Conservator of Forests, Vellore, and Forest rangers Balaji and Saravanan.

Four persons were found clearing away the logs in the early hours on Saturday and they were nabbed by the Forest personnel.

They were identified as Manikandan, 27, Manikandan, 20 — both from Pazhaya Vedanthangal — Vijayakumar, 27, of Maganipattu and Sathyaraj, 28, of Athipet.

351,2020/03/07,Banding together in the fight for dignity,"The ten-member transgender group rears milch cows and sells milk

In their gruelling fight for a life with dignity, the marginalised transgender community in Vellore district has forayed into forming a self help group (SHG), slowly gaining acceptance in society. With ten members, the SHG engages in rearing milch cows and selling milk.

Recalling the sequence of developments, Namitha, treasurer of the Sandhoshni Matha Transgenders Special Group, says that the group was started in Sedhuvalai village of Anaicut block in Vellore, a year and a half ago, to promote equality.

“With help from the State government, in the form of bank loans, we bought cows. We have three cows now”, she said.

Talking to The Hindu, an official from Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission (TNSRLM) said, “The SHG was given a bank loan of ₹2,00,000 to purchase milch cows. With prompt repayment, the loan was enhanced to ₹5,00,000, that is ₹50,000 per member.” The TNSRLM provides technical training and financial support for the highly marginalised sections of society to help them engage in self-employment.

Namitha pointed out that they want to be an “example for the next generation on what to do and what not to do”. “These efforts will hopefully help the next generation of transgenders in taking up dignified jobs,” she said with confidence brimming on her face.

“Each one is engaged in maintaining the milch animals. The milk is sold through co-operative society,” said Sandhoshni, secretary of the group.

She added that since the cows were getting older, the group had planned on expanding their business with a cattle farm. “This requires more money. Moreover, we require a permanent place for sheltering the animals, storing fodder and maintaining a trash bin to create manure from the cow dung.” .

“By engaging in self-employment, we can improve our livelihood and lifestyle. We also get respect from society. But for this, we need and expect more help from the government,” Mumtaj, president of the group, said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vcgyej/article31011377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07VELLORESHG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/banding-together-in-the-fight-for-dignity/article31011378.ece

353,2020/03/07,"Residents of Alandur apartment complex join the sustainability movement, make their own compost","Classified as a bulk waste generator by Chennai Corporation, Casagrand Aristo enforces strict waste segregation and composting practices within the community

Last July, when residents started moving into Casagrand Aristo, a 320-unit apartment complex spread over 5 acres in Alandur, a huge challenge was already in store. A month before that, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) had announced that it would no longer accept bio-degradable waste from bulk waste generators, which included multi-storeyed apartments and gated communities.

The apartment complex comes under Ward 162 in Zone 12 of GCC.

As per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the civic body mandated that bio-degradable waste should be composted within the premises and the recyclable waste handed over to authorised recyclers.

“The election for the RWA was held in December 2018 and Casagrand Aristo Owners Welfare Association (CGAOWA) was registered in March 2019. Having an RWA helped in putting together a plan for better waste management,” says Association secretary K.M. Rajan.

Sustained efforts for the past eight months have helped this community achieve total compliance in segregation and process all organic waste within the premises.

As with any waste management initiative, it wasn’t a smooth ride to begin with, as getting over 300 families to follow total segregation was a mammoth task.

“With residents just moving in, we sought time from GCC to set up the necessary infrastructure as well as educate the residents on the rules, which was the major challenge. We also used this time to create an organisational structure for the Association,” adds Rajan.

Planning and awareness

The Association formed a core committee comprising 34 executive committee members and five management committee members. The core committee members also served as block level representatives.

The committee members then conducted orientation programmes for the residents, domestic staff, housekeeping staff and gardeners in the community. Awareness pamphlets were distributed. Experts from the Corporation and environmental NGOs were brought in to raise awareness on source segregation.

“Educating the stakeholders was the major challenge. We created posters and put them up on notice boards and at each block with the different types of waste and clear guidelines on how they should be segregated. Periodical reminders were sent through WhatsApp messages and email. We also involved children in the process through quizzes and fun activities because they will have to carry the baton in the future,” says Aditya Krishnan, a core committee member, who was part of the awareness campaigns.

Trial and error

Each step was a learning process for this community. “Initially, we placed two colour-coded bins at each block for the residents to drop segregated waste. More often than not, mixed waste landed in the bins and the burden of segregation fell on the housekeeping staff. This prompted us to initiate door-to-door collection of waste,” adds Rajan.

The RWA committee decided to implement a ‘two-bin, one-bag’ system. Each house was given a green bin for organic waste, red bin for reject waste and a bag for dry and recyclable waste. The Association also procured three aerobic digesters from a Bengaluru-based firm which provides waste management solutions to urban communities.

Enforcement

According to Aditya, the key to successful waste management is community awareness and participation. “Once we set up the digesters and procured the bins and bags, a mass meeting was organised and the residents were given guidelines on what goes into each bin and the bag. We educated the housekeeping staff, gardeners, and facility managers. The housekeeping staff take the information charts to the houses to motivate new residents to segregate waste. The committee members also conduct awareness programmes to ensure compliance,” he adds.

The process

The door-to-door collection happens from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. every day. Four teams, comprising two housekeeping staff in each team, collect the segregated waste from the eight blocks. One aerobic digester, each having a capacity of 1.5 tonnes, is used at a time.

Organic compost is harvested every 45 days. | Photo Credit: B. Velankanni Raj

The organic waste is composted with layers of cocopeat and microbes. The community generates about 50 to 60 kg of organic waste in a day.

The first batch of compost, weighing about 300 kg, was harvested in 45 days.

“The generated compost is used in the common garden, and individual kitchen/balcony or terrace gardens. We are also in talks with a nursery to sell the compost for a nominal amount,” says Rajan.

The entire process cost the Association nearly ₹3 lakh which was spent from the corpus fund. “We look at it as a valuable investment and our payback is the positive contribution we make to the environment by preventing waste from going to the landfills,” says Aditya.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mrenhj/article31009117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CASAGRANDHOUSEKEEPING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-of-alandur-apartment-complex-join-the-sustainability-movement-make-their-own-compost/article31009126.ece
354,2020/03/07,Green steps in Alandur,"A visit to the main resource recovery centre in Zone 12 to understand a pan-Chennai exercise

The main Resource Recovery Centre (RRC) of Zone 12 (Alandur) bustles with the kind of activity that one wouldn’t associate with facilities of this kind. With clothes that had earlier been dropped at the minor resource resource facilities across the zone, two women staff make bags, floor mats, and money purses. They have been appointed by Zone 12 to bring value to discards.

A Zone 12 official says that two men have been appointed for repairing old and torn bags, slippers and shoes. After washing and drying the bags, the zips are replaced and a new sheet of cloth in stitched into the interior of the bags. The bags are distributed free of cost to students studying in schools run by GCC that are found in areas coming under Zone 12, the official points out.

The repaired and the polished footwear are sold to the members of the public every week at the Friday Market at Pallavaram, and they are usually priced between ₹30 and ₹50.

More than 160 tonnes of garbage is generated every day in the Alandur Zone. More than two lakh people live in areas coming under the jurisdiction of Zone 12.

A variety of discarded plastics, thermocol, tyres, slippers, and coir beds are transported to the main RRC located diagonally opposite Zone 12 office. Various types of plastic waste are sent to factories and vendors.

Some discards are sold to recyclers.

The Airports Authority of India, Chennai, as part of a Corporate Social Responsibility exercise, has decided to fund the establishment of an incinerator plant. The plant will be set up soon at the Kannan Colony Burial Ground. The ash produced from the plant will be used to manufacture inter-locking and fly-ash blocks, officials say.

“Through these initiatives, we have prevented more than 50 per cent of the waste from going to the the dumping round in Perungudi,” they say. “Besides, we collect the skins of lemon, sweet lime and other citrus fruits and make lemon peel powder, which is in great demand among beauty parlours. We also make lemon dish washer detergent powder. The lemon dish washer detergent powder is distributed to the staff at ‘Amma’ canteens to wash and clean the utensils.”

In Zone 1( Thiruvottiyur) of Greater Chennai Corporation, tailors as well as specialised tailors from self-help groups make cloth bags based on the clothes making it to the resource recovery centres. The cloth bags are used to distribute manure to farmers and residents. The cloth bags are sold for ₹2 and ₹3 a piece.

In addition, they repair old and torn school bags that can be re-used, officials point out.

After collecting the bags from the residents, the bags are washed and dried. The staff repair and fix the broken zips in the bags, stitch torn parts (interior and exterior) and add paint to impart a new look to them. The bags are distributed to students of schools run by the Corporation.

In addition, we repair and polish old and torn footwear. The refurbished footwear are distributed free of cost to poor school students and non-governmental organisations.

355,2020/03/07,This bane has reached Marina too,"Pavements on Kamarajar Salai usurped by motorcyclists

Has Chennai Corporation authorised two-wheelers to be parked on the wide pavements of Kamarajar Salai? Seeing these motorcyclists park their vehicles there neatly, that is impression many pedestrians and commuters get. Let us put the record straight: That’s not the case. Pavements are not for parking vehicles, and the State Highways Department that maintains the stretch is finding it a challenge to check this menace.

A majority of these motorcyclists are those visiting the beach, who find the pavements an easy parking place as there little checks in place. A few metres away, the narrow streets opposite the beach have also turned into illegal parking lots.

Thousands visit the beach every day, and the number doubles during weekends. In order to generate revenue from unutilised public spaces including service lanes along the beaches like Marina and Elliot, Chennai Corporation has been charging a minimum fee of ₹5 for two-wheelers and ₹20 for cars per hour. Vehicles are not allowed to park on the service lanes along Kamarajar Salai free of cost. This has made visitors, mainly motorcyclists, to park on the footpath of the busy stretch. Such illegal parking of two-wheelers is clearly visible at many spots on the stretch including in front of Vivekanda House and Gandhi statue.

“Rash driving especially during morning hours is common on Kamarajar Salai, walking on the carriageway is risky,” said S. Padmanabhan, a walker from Triplicane. Kamarajar Salai is a VIP route and many walkers wonder how this could go unnoticed. Pedestrians want such vehicles to be impounded and offenders penalised. The civic body has identified designated paid parking spots at certain public places like Marina and Elliot beaches. These spaces are mainly service lanes off arterial roads. Each zone has to identify areas where parking can be allowed.

“Steps will be taken to prevent such illegal parking on footpath along the stretch soon,” said a Corporation official",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xoxg7x/article31008965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08DCMYPRTWOWHEELERSPARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/this-bane-has-reached-marina-too/article31008967.ece
356,2020/03/07,Residents of this Chennai colony go on a ‘patrol’ to keep vehicles and vendors away,"With SIET Women’s College, IDFC Bank Apollo Hospitals and ICICI Bank in the same space, Seethammal Extension has been infamous for vehicles eating into the carriageway of three main roads. Vendors extend their shops into the space that belong to pedestrians. On working days, one can count not less than 80 vans and other vehicles parked from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., denying residents and their visitors any parking space.

Partly to address this issue, we formed SEWA — which stands for Seethammal Extension Welfare Association — four month ago. Our main objective was to find solutions to problems such as illegal parking and proliferation of make-shift shops.

The vans had damaged all the platforms and as a result, pedestrians had to walk on the road. Van drivers and their associates were also indulging in unlawful activities. While some institutions didn’t have sufficient parking space for their employees, the rest of them preferred congesting the roads for the sake of convenience, despite the availability of private parking space.

We sought help of MLA R. Nataraj, Corporation officials and the police to bring some calm to our locality. To start with, we spruced up our area and got permission to install bright planters at strategic places to reduce traffic. We went from door to door to initiate source segregation of waste. After a recent traffic meet, we suggested that haphazard parking at First Main Road be cleared. We are glad that necessary action was taken. We now monitor the stretch. Every day, residents go on a “patrol” at 1.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. We call it ‘Vigil Walk’ and go as a group of four or five; this way vehicle drivers don’t get into an argument and leave the street.

So far, only the entrances of our colony have been cleared of encroachments. We are next working on retrieving the side walks with funds pooled in by residents. Udaya Kumar, assistant engineer, Street Lights, GCC Teynampet, got his team to prune the trees, which improved the illumination at nights.

Special mention to Kothandaraman, secretary to MLA; Myilvahanan, DCP; Myilsamy, Traffic Police Inspector and engineers of the zone who supported us.

We are next looking at installing CCTV cameras on all streets and planting saplings.

357,2020/03/07,Discarded plastic items turned into public amenities,"Project Mumbai illustrates how creative upcycling can win residents over to responsible waste management

Its tagline — ‘Your plastic waste recycled for your city’ — leaves no one in any doubt about the collaborative nature of this not-for-profit initiative. Project Mumbai, as it is called, brings various stakeholders of the city, particularly its citizens, to give recyclable waste new character and purposes.

Recycled waste gets turned into benches — 60 of them have been parked in Mumbai’s public parks; pencil boxes — over 3,000 distributed to children who have been part of this drive called ‘Mumbai Plastic Recyclathon’.

Project Mumbai began in 2018 when Shishir Joshi came across patients in a government hospital who got lost searching for departments due to lack of signages. This incident prompted him to start looking for solutions to everyday challenges faced by citizens.

The recyclathon drive was first launched during Daan Utsav 2018 where people were asked to keep aside their plastic waste and the organisers would pick it up from their doorstep.

“I started in a small way but I had 85,000 people donating plastic during the week-long drive,” says Joshi, founder and chief executive officer of Project Mumbai. The annual drive was restarted in October 2019 but with many new volunteers pitching in.

“This time the number crossed a lakh, to be precise 1.25 lakh people donated plastic waste, and the drive was much more organised,” says Joshi.

Since then, the drive has been a monthly feature and has extended to cover Navi Mumbai and Thane.

How does it work?

Though it looks simple, it is a massive exercise in planning and coordination. The drives are notified well in advance on the website for people to register and they are offered a choice of pick-up dates. A route-wise Google map list is provided to the volunteers on board. An app called ‘I am here’ is enabled to locate the truck. Route-wise WhatsApp groups of participants are created to facilitate communication between donors and volunteers.

Joshi says the drives clicked because of the volunteer force that would take time out during weekends to conduct them.

“We have empanelled these volunteers to co-own these drives by making them local owners,” he says.

Increased frequency

As the registrations for pick-up of plastic waste increased, Project Mumbai stepped up its collection drive. It wheeled in new rules. Those giving more than five kilos of recyclable waste will get to see it picked up from their doorstep. Others would have to drop it at the nearest pick-up point.

“This month, we will be starting two drives-a-month routine,” says Joshi.

Once products based on recycled plastic see the light, the organisers display them at local events and got people to paint them. “There are citizens who have volunteered to be spokespersons for the drive,” he says.

Beyond making citizens take ownership of their plastic waste, the campaign sought to send across a message about behavioural changes.

“Once an individual registers for the pick-up, they have to take a pledge that they will segregate waste,” says Joshi.

Mumbai Plastic Recyclathon, which has entered the Limca Book of Records, is keen on moving to new cities.

“We are starting the drive soon in Pune, where the plan is to convert recyclable plastic into fuel to be used for public school buses and generators of the municipal corporation,” says Joshi.

In Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai, the campaign is looking for volunteers to own it.

TUCS (Triplicane Urban Cooperative Society) outlets functioning at Periyar Nagar Gandhi Salai and Saraswathi Nagar Fourth Street in Virugambakkam will have a new address soon.

They will be shifted to two new buildings, which belong to the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), at Varrier Street in Indra Nagar. According to a GCC official, the new buildings were constructed at cost of ₹.25 lakh allocated under MLA Local Area Development Scheme. In a week, the Virugambakkam MLA, Virugai V.N.

359,2020/03/07,A challenge out of the bin,"Following the #MasillaMarghazhi initiative, Namma Ooru Foundation has launched #TrashItRight hoping to find a viral route to promoting source segregation

#TrashItRight seeks to find a spot in the human heart that is hopefully three-fourths civic responsibility and the remaining one-fourth, vanity.

Buoyed by the success of #MasillaMarghazhi, Namma Ooru Foundation has launched this challenge to get individuals to pursue source-segregation and allied waste-management processes more as an act of volition than one of abidance.

In its essence, it is cut from the same cloth as most other challenges that seek to ride on social-media virality. Participants have to take a selfie of themselves with their source-segregation kit and post the photo on social media, tag five friends and challenge them to do the same. It also expects them to tag Namma Ooru Foundation on the post. The photo has to be accompanied by a personal waste-management note.

Basic kit will do

“We want them to pose with the basic waste-management kit — the two-bin one-bag kit. If people have a three-bin kit — green, blue and red — they can pose with it and take a selfie too. Though proper colour-coding of bins is important, as that is at the root of source-segregation and makes for easy understanding of the concept even among those who may not be able to understand the text, people can get started on the challenge without having properly colour-coded bins; however, along the way, we would emphasise the significance of colour coding. The procedure of the challenge is listed out at the Foundation’s website — nammaooru.org/resources.php,” explains P. Natarajan, founder of Namma Ooru Foundation.

He points out that they would be seeking to have a few celebrities on board to propel the initiative by being role models.

“Celebrity or otherwise, participants have to not only pose with the waste-management kit, but also practise source segregation before they start challenging others to do it. We will choose only such celebrities to be part of the campaign. Besides, we have noticed many IAS and IFS officers who take waste management seriously and practise it in their backyards, and we would like to rope them in for the campaign.”

During the music season, #MasiallaMarghazhi managed to reach a wide group of people because some musicians performing in the season supported it by posting their selifies with reusuable water bottles.

Why this campaign?

There is an inevitable question.

By getting participants to also tag Namma Ooru Foundation, a voluntary organisation that functions as a waste-management solutions provider, there is the uneasy question of branding that the entity is likely to derive from the exercise.

This is Natarjan’s response to this poser: “Let me put it this way. There are two things involved in this, and both are related: one, the rest of the world should know that so many people are participating in it, which would serve as a spur for them to get started too; and two, the efforts have to be channelised for it to become a powerful movement. If people engage in such exercises here and there, without any common focal point, it won’t be effective. By being the pivot, we will from time to time broadcast the progress of the exercise, and that will encourage more people to join it. Of course, the challenge will also provide branding for the organisation, but that is not the objective at all. Branding is just a byproduct of the exercise. If the brand got out to more people, ultimately, we would have served more people. There is the possibility of telling more people and engaging with them.”

A second attempt

Actually, #TrashItRight is a relaunched initiative, hoping to get it right the second time around.

“We launched this initiative last year, but it turned out to be a damp squib. The indifferent success of last year’s campaign stemmed from the fact that we asked residents to take videos of themselves with their source segregation kit and how they went about their daily waste-management routine went. Taking a video is too much work, as the lukewarm response to the campaign showed.

360,2020/03/07,Zero Waste Chennai: We are here now,"A whirlwind tour of Greater Chennai Corporation’s initiatives to deal with the city’s garbage burden

Waste can be a differentiator, sometimes providing unmistakable clues into essential features of a region, and these features may contrast sharply with those of other regions nearby.

“If viewed with a discerning eye, the waste you find in Sholinganallur will be different from what you find in Manali and the one in Alandur can throw up its own set of surprises. In some cases, the difference will be very obvious,” says Alby John, regional deputy commissioner — South, Greater Chennai Corporation.

This understanding seems to have permeated the think tank at GCC, as it is mirrored in recent exercises undertaken by the different zones to add value to the waste gathered in their micro-composting units and material recovery facilities.

Factoring in the differences in the kind of waste they may be dealing with — minor or major, subtle or obvious — Ripon Buildings is noticeably on guard against the danger of micro-managing its “Zero Waste Chennai” progamme at the zonal level down to the minutest fleck and gumming up any evolving mechanisms of innovation.

“Broad instructions are given to the zones and they are allowed to innovate as they go about adding value to certain types of waste,” explains Alby.

With a decentralised approach, a variety of recycling and value-addition narratives are coming out of different regions. While every zone has to deal with the whole gamut of waste generated within its limits, ranging from the basic wet and dry waste to hazardous waste, the potential for sharing less-common stories now seems built into the system.

So, there can be stories of one zone going big on refurbishing old bags and selling them. Another may be promoting the circular economy in other ways: It may be refurbished shoes being put on sale.

Larger initiatives

Besides, GCC is setting up value-from-waste projects across Chennai on a pilot basis, and which again provides unique examples from various regions to look for.

“Based on the success of these pilots, a call on extending them to other regions of Chennai will be taken,” says an official from the soild waste management (SWM) department of GCC.

“In Sholinganallur, Pallikaranai and Madhavaran, work is under way to set up bio CNG plants. In Kannagi Nagar, which is under Zone 15 (Sholinganallur), a unit to derive byproducts from plastic-waste has been established. Here, plastic sheets and table ‘clothes’ are made out of plastic waste. In Manali, a trial run of a plant where incinerated ash from dry waste will be used to create concrete blocks is under way. We are close to starting operations that would involve making of concrete blocks with ash derived in this manner. Five areas across Chennai have been earmarked for setting up five units that would derive by-products such as soft-wood blocks out of garden waste processing. The machinery for these five units have been imported. The units will come up at the Perungudi Dumping Ground, the Old Transfer Station at Nandambakkam, Old Central Asphalt Plant in Chetpet, Old General Workshop in Walltax Road and Kodingayur Dumping Ground,” says the Corporation official.

Three-R tourism

“Zero-Waste Chennai” does have the unmistakable tone of a catch-cry, and if the objective is to get the initiative to grip the consciousness of city residents, it would do well to start familiarisation programmes for residents’ groups and students.

By taking them through these exercises and facilities, the participants can be enabled to see how big a king-pin they are in the process of reducing waste generation, by applying the Three-R philosophy of waste management at source, which is their home.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9zk0j7/article31008788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08DCWASTEPROCESSINGCENTREMANALI5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/zero-waste-chennai-we-are-here-now/article31008792.ece
361,2020/03/07,Raptors through the eyes of a birder,"Though there are a few resident urban raptors like shikra, black kite and migrants like booted eagle and greater spotted eagle (which prefer wooded areas like IIT, GNP and Theosophical society) within the city limits, we need to in general move out of the city to see the other residents/ migrants as that is where their habitat is.

Since these are typically 20 km or more away from the city many birders refrain from making that trip due to lack of time or transport. In spite of this challenge, a few do wake up at an ungodly hour, carpool to get to these lake beds in Kanchipuram or Thiruvallur districts just to watch, photograph these majestic creatures. And also record these sightings as a conservation exercise.

Though the number of eyes that are looking out for these birds have increased now, the number of birds per se in each species visiting our lakebeds have considerably decreased. This is mainly due to habitat loss.

I have heard from few old-timers that in the early 2000s and prior to that, there used to be a minimum of 50 harriers communal-roosting in lakebeds in Thiruvallur area. This number has now dwindled to single digits thanks to loss of their habitat.

Apparently a breeding pair of white-bellied sea eagles used to nest in mangroves in the Adyar Estuary in the 80s and 90s regularly . These birds are now nowhere to be seen and you need to go to the Pulicat lake if you want to see them.

(Rama Neelamegam is a well-known birder among Chennai’s birding community)",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/through-the-eyes-of-a-birder/article31008773.ece
362,2020/03/07,The elusive raptors and why we have to talk about them,"MNS created a raptor map around five years ago; there is a need to start such exercises now

If a course is laid with many paver blocks of “ifs and buts”, it will most likely end up leading to a frustrating “nowhere”.

Every birder and conservationist would admit to having had a sense of treading that course while tracking raptor movements.

There is a basic script that birders operate on — “if” you head here, you will see these birds. Usually, there will be minor challenges to ford on reaching these spots. It is the same with raptors — only that, usually, the “ifs” as well as the challenges are one too many.

Raptors are the superheroes of the avian world, and as with superheroes, the lives of these birds require unravelling, which would mean travelling long, sometimes through unfriendly terrain, to spot a particular species of raptor, resident or migrant.

So, in many cases, there is usually a thin slice of citizen-inputs that is on offer to frame a conservation picture of these majestic birds — the exceptions being black kites which are found around urban habitations. Occasionally found on trees around neighbourhoods, the shikra, and on posts standing in open lands, the black-winged kite, are other examples.

Citizen data about raptors, as with any bird species, is vital to ascertain whether they are in need of any emergency interventionist-conservation methods.

Recently, the State of Indian Birds’ survey based on eBird data underlined the importance of citizen data in assessing the gravity of conservation situations.

Considering raptors control insanely huge territories, and can be scattered widely, thanks to urbanisation and loss of habitats, there is a need for up-to-date raptor maps that birder-conservationists can use. That will help in the generation of citizen-based data about raptors on a sustained basis.

There is one for Chennai and surrounding districts. It was prepared by the Madras Naturalists' Society through a massive exercise in 2015-2016. It can be accessed by at https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=10o5DWlan6uBophcj-pkHLc--in8&ll=12.772127343030553%2C79.8430538&z=9

It will be great to have an updated map.

“The survey was conducted keeping Chennai as the central point, and an arc was marked around it, with Pazhaverkadu to the north, Koonimedu near Pondy to the South and the Ammur Reserve Forest to the West forming the furthest points. The project emerged out of the following data: Out of the 69 diurnal raptor species identified in our sub-continent by a Zoological Survey of India study as many as 35 species have been recorded in Chennai historically. Of the 35, 20 have been sighted commonly. The main objectives of the project were to: one, record and monitor the status, distribution and richness of the raptor species in all three ecosystems — namely, grassland, wetland and woodland. Two, record, as comprehensively as possible, data relating to their habitats; and three, work with the local community to conserve these habitats. The exercise was anchored by K. Gnanaskandan from the MNS and renowned ornithologist C. Sashi Kumar from Kerala was steering it,” says G. Vijaya Kumar, honorary secretary, MNS.

Given the sombre findings of the State of Indian Birds on raptors, where the long-term trend is positive only for woodland raptors, as their population is expected to be stable. In sharp contrast, the other three species-categories, generalist, open and scavenger show varying, usually high degrees of decline in the long-term analysis.

Raptor lovers — which could literally mean the entire birding and bird-conservationist communities — should exchange notes, and start meetings and awareness programmes. There aren’t many raptor clubs around, and those that exist — which include the one started by T. Murugavel many years ago, and that has birder Seshan Elumalai as a key member and British falconer Walton Woollard Browne as advisor— are not anywhere near as active as when they started out.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gda7gd/article31009686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/birdjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-elusive-raptors-and-why-we-have-to-talk-about-them/article31008767.ece
363,2020/03/07,Bridge near Nungambakkam railway station faces identity crisis,"It is being misused as a parking lot; the problem gets out of hand during rush hour

Decades-old bridge across Coovum river near Nungambakkam railway station along Nelson Manickam Road is being misused as a parking lot. Cars and vans can be found parked on both sides of the carriageway on the bridge, which hinders traffic movement, especially during rush hour.

Built in March 2001, the two-lane bridge is 800 metres-long with a footpath and steel railings, LED street lights and a concrete median. The bridge also has inlets to discharge excess rainwater from the carriageway to the river.

“During rush hour, vehicle movement on the bridge is slow as vehicles are parked on both sides of the road. As the bridge is a shorter route to reach Poonamallee High Road (at Pachchaiyappa College) from Nungambakkam railway station, many people prefer to use this bridge,” says K. Swomiya, a resident of Nungambakkam.

On an average, more than 16,000 commuters use the railway station in Nungambakkam every day. The MTC bus stop (especially towards Valluvar Kottam direction) is extremely crowded due to parking of auto-rickshaws and cars round-the-clock. Several steps by the police such as placing of barricades at the bus-stop have failed to regulate traffic there.

To add to the chaos, for the past few months, auto-rickshaws are being parked on the bridge and obstructing traffic movement on Nelson Manickam Road. Interestingly, a new police booth was set up a few months ago to prevent chain- and mobile-phone snatching.

A section of motorists say that most of the vehicles that are parked on the bridge belong to owners of shops along Nelson Manickam Road.

In this regard, a police official says, “Steps will be taken to curb parking of vehicles on the road.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aeopd9/article31008760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08dctngrNungambakkam1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bridge-near-nungambakkam-railway-station-faces-identity-crisis/article31008761.ece
364,2020/03/07,Residents demand swift execution of work to build five more checkdams across Palar river,"These checkdams will help conserve floodwater that otherwise drains into the sea

After the successful execution of checkdams in Vayalur and Esoor-Vallipuram, the ambitious plan to build more checkdams across Palar river in the neighbouring districts is yet to take off, much to the dismay of residents.

Residents of Kancheepuram and Chengelpet districts have demanded that the five more checkdams proposed to be built this year to save floodwater that otherwise drains into the sea be completed. It may be recalled that the project was announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in 2017.

While the Water Resources Department had completed the project ahead of schedule in the tail-end of the river in Vayalur and Esoor Vallipuram in Madurantakam taluk, it is awaiting funds to begin work to build checkdams in five more places.

The department had planned to construct check dams in Vengadapuram, Vengudi, Ullavur, Alapakkam and Palur to retain flood water for better groundwater recharge. The project aimed at augmenting agricultural needs and improve drinking water supply to neighbouring areas.

For instance, the checkdam proposed in Vengadapuram would divert floodwater for irrigation needs of 1,211 hectares of lands and also provide 14 million litres a day for various water supply schemes. Despite two new checkdams, nearly 7,500 million cubic feet of water drained into the sea last monsoon, which could have been reduced, according to sources.

“The checkdams in Vayalur and Esoor-Vallipuram have retained water in Palar river for nearly four months now. The sites have also turned into tourist spots,” said P.Mani, a farmer in Kancheepuram district.

Residents noted that the check dams have improved groundwater table in the surrounding villages and helped cultivation of crops such as paddy, sugarcane and banana. The State government must step up measures to build other storage structures in a few months to reap benefits this year, they said.

R. Muralimohan, secretary, Madurantakam Co-operative Sugarmills Farmers Association said “groundwater table has improved by 40% in my Pulipurakoil village after Esur-Vallipuram checkdam. The water stored in Palar river would help agricultural needs for a year.”

Such checkdams must be built at an interval of every 5 km in Palar river. The height of the checkdams must be increased for better storage. The WRD must provide facilities like view point for tourists, he added.

Officials of the WRD said the project has been submitted to the government and funds were awaited to begin work.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-demand-swift-execution-of-work-to-build-five-more-checkdams-across-palar-river/article31008688.ece

366,2020/03/07,"At this Chennai NGO, the goal is empowering women through job skills","Since 1997, ANEW has trained hundreds of women in a range of skills for free, to help them find jobs

The premises of ANEW (Association for Non-traditional Employment for Women) are buzzing with activity on Saturday, as women training to be nurses are engaged in an intense discussion with their mentor, while another set of young women are readying to begin a computer class.

From 1997, this city based non-governmental organisation has trained and empowered hundreds of women from underprivileged backgrounds in a range of skills which facilitates their employment. “Our alumni range from ambulance drivers, forklift operators, school van drivers, IT workers to nurses and even a cemetery manager,” said Vinodini Sudhindran, a committee member of the association.

“We start by campaigning around the city telling young women that they can enrol in our skill training programmes free of cost. Our only criteria is that they should have studied in a government school or college,” Ms. Vinodini said. The association offers courses that women who have studied up to class 8 or more can pursue. These are either full-time or, in the case some students who are attending college, the courses are taken up after classes.

“We offer a range of courses through tie-ups with various organisations which specialize in them and give our students certifications. Some of our students enrol in these courses during their third year of college, as we have the option of offering evening classes which they can take up,” said Anu Chandran, another committee member.

The 23-year-old association has over 800 students enrolling in the courses offered every year and nearly 80 to 85% of the students get placed, she said.

K. Kanchana, a single mother who took the driving course in 2015, is now working with an IT firm as a cab driver. “I have done a whole range of jobs to support my family but after I learnt how to drive, there is a stable income,” she said.

At their building in Anna Nagar, ANEW has labs for computer classes, spoken English classes and even a car which students who take driving lessons can use to practice with. All the students have to take up compulsory self-defence classes as well once every week.

With the academic year coming to an end as well, the volunteers at ANEW are keen that young women from underprivileged backgrounds have the option to become skilled and employable even if they continue studying. “There is still some level of resistance from families of the women who join our courses or even want to take up a job after it. We get our alumni to speak to them about how important it is that their daughters or sisters can be financially empowered and support the family,” Ms Vinodini explained.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lfkw9b/article31007839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MARTH-Anewjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-this-chennai-ngo-the-goal-is-empowering-women-through-job-skills/article31007840.ece
367,2020/03/07,Theni MP denies his father misused govt. machinery to get him elected,"‘Petitioner suppressed the fact that he belongs to DMK’

Member of Parliament P. Raveendranath Kumar on Friday filed an application before the Madras High Court to reject an election petition preferred by a voter challenging his victory from the Theni constituency on May 23, 2019. He claimed that the petitioner suppressed the fact of “belonging to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.”

Justice M.S. Ramesh directed V. Arun, counsel for the election petitioner P. Milany, to file a counter affidavit, on or before March 20, to the MP’s plea for rejecting the election petition in toto and also to strike off certain crucial paragraphs in which he had been accused of indulging in corrupt practices to secure the victory.

In his petition, Mr. Milany identified himself as a 38-year-old mechanical engineer from Palanichettipatti in the Theni taluk. He filed the election petition accusing the MP as well as his father O. Panneerselvam, the incumbent Deputy Chief Minister, of having misused the government machinery during the election.

Refuting the allegations, Mr. Kumar said the petition should not be entertained at all since it was bereft of material facts and particulars regarding the alleged corrupt practices. The petitioner had failed to provide proof to substantiate the allegations and had filed the case based on assumptions and presumptions, he claimed.

“The election petitioner has also suppressed the material fact that he belongs to the opposing party DMK and has misrepresented to this honourable court as if he has filed the election petition as an honest and responsible voter. Per contra, the petition is politically motivated... Suppression proves the mala fides behind the petition,” he said.

Stating that the election petitioner had gone to the extent of accusing the Election Commission officials of connivance, the MP said: “These allegations are mala fide and nothing but an endeavour to slander me, my party AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and also the Election Commission of India.”

The MP also said that the aim of the Representation of the People Act of 1951 was to give primacy to the decision of the voters and to recognise the right of the returned candidate to carry on with his constitutional duties without being hindered by frivolous litigations filed solely on the basis of conjectures and surmises.

“The election petitioner has, in fact, insulted the intelligence of the electorate by calling them gullible and describing the constituency as a dangerous mixture of money and power. This itself is reflective of the petitioner’s open prejudice against the ruling party, the Election Commission and the people of Theni constituency,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/theni-mp-denies-his-father-misused-govt-machinery-to-get-him-elected/article31005292.ece

The Cosmopolitan Club on Anna Salai has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court challenging the building plan approval granted by Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to Tamil Nadu Golf Federation (TNGF) for constructing a new club house on a property leased out by the government jointly to the club as well as TNGF.

When the case was listed before Justice T.S. Sivagnanam on Friday, the judge adjourned it to Monday so that it could be heard by Justice N. Anand Venkatesh, the portfolio judge, who was on leave on Friday. In its affidavit, the club accused the CMDA of having granted the building plan approval “with undue haste” and without the joint lessee’s consent.

It said, the State government had allotted 65.09 acres of land at Nandanam in 1933 and another 12.61 acres in 1935 for developing a golf course. The club had developed barren land in to a golf course by investing huge amount of money. It stated that a full-fledged club house named Travancore House had been established several decades ago.

374,2020/03/07,A sharp dip in air traffic in February,"Data shows a near 10% fall last month when compared to Jan.

Fear of travelling has pushed thousands to call off their travel plans and data shows a nearly 10% fall in the number of people who took flights through Chennai airport last month.

This is more marked in the international sector, with a dip of 13.5% in passenger traffic in February, when compared to January. In the domestic sector, the number of people who travelled fell by 7.5%.

With the rapid spread of COVID-19, many flight operations have been stopped and there have been numerous cancellations as well, creating a large hole in aircraft movement last month. There were only 2,922 aircraft movements in the international sector in February, in comparison to 3,352 in January.

In the domestic sector too, there was a 10% decrease in aircraft movement in February, when compared to the previous month.

According to officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), people have refrained from travelling after reading about the number COVID-19 cases in India and across the world.

“Flight occupancy has come down drastically and the flight is half empty on numerous occasions. Even if you look at the airport, both the international and domestic terminals look a lot less crowded these days, even during peaks hours,” an official said.

Ironically, AAI officials said that when compared to the 18,21,283 passengers who travelled in February 2019, alone -18,21,283 , the passenger traffic for February 2020 was 18,83,154, showing a marginal increase of 3%.

Some passengers said that they wanted to take precautions and avoid even domestic travel. Balakumaran S., a resident of Adambakkam, said, “My company wants me to travel to Delhi for a workshop, but I have told them I cannot go. I want to be cautious and I have decided not to travel anywhere for the next few months. I don’t want to be travelling in an aircraft with several others who could possibly have some illness.” Many have also posted on Twitter about cancelling their travel plans.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-sharp-dip-in-air-traffic-in-february/article31005041.ece

377,2020/03/07,Gangster’s advocate seeks police protection,"He was driving the SUV at which bombs were hurled

The advocate of gangster CD Mani, at whose car country bombs were hurled on Anna Salai on Tuesday, has lodged a complaint with the Teynampet police, seeking action against the attackers and protection for him and his family.

In his complaint, Advocate S. Thangaraj claimed that his client P. Manikandan alias CD Mani, the gangster, had a case in the additional sessions court on Tuesday. According to him, after this, Manikandan met his friend Kakathoppu Balaji, who had come for a hearing.

Later, Mr. Thangaraj requested Manikandan to drop him at the Saidapet court. “My client requested me to drive the car. Around 4 p.m., near Spencer Plaza, I noticed some unknown persons following our vehicle. At this time, Balaji informed Manikandan that they were associates of Sambo Senthil, Pondicherry Presenna and Napolean,” the complaint stated.

He claimed that all of a sudden, near the Gemini bridge, the unknown persons hurled country bombs at the car. “Balaji instructed me to go to the Teynampet police station from Gemini bridge. Since we had to go far to take a U-turn, I took a right and went on the wrong route to reach the station and save our lives,” he said.

The advocate claimed that at this time too, they threw a country bomb. They then took a right onto the G.N. Chetty Link Road. “Some four persons followed our car and even fired at us. Persons on four motorcycles followed us and we finally managed to escape near Aalaiyamman Koil,” he claimed in the complaint.

The advocate has requested the police to take action against the attackers and extend protection to him and his family.

379,2020/03/07,Making the environment conducive for justice,"In riot situations requiring urgent action, proactive intervention by the judiciary can prevent a slide into chaos

Some of the areas affected by the recent riots in Delhi that I visited resemble a battlefield — burnt shops and buildings dot virtually every street in the area. It’s terrible, but property can eventually be restored. Can life be restored? More than 50 people have died in the riots, virtually for no reason at all, except generated hate. Children have been traumatised for what their parents believe — right or wrong. Is this justice or injustice? Is monetary compensation good enough to alleviate the pain and suffering that many children and parents have gone through? Is that all that can be offered? These are questions that went through my mind when I saw the carnage in Shiv Vihar and a couple of other areas.

A visit to the Idgah presented a depressing picture. It had doubled up as a relief camp and I was told of the presence of about a thousand persons residing there. Well-intentioned groups and individuals had donated matting and blankets, food, medicines and provided comfort to many. A ‘media section’ had several individuals recording the statement of riot victims. Hopefully, these statements will be used by investigators as soon as the establishment gets its act together, if at all. Whatever little assistance could be given to victims by way of rehabilitation was being provided by NGOs and well-meaning individuals, little by a welfare state.

Also Read Freedom in the World 2020 report ranks India among least free democracies

But, the blame game for the riots has already begun and will continue even after investigations are over or a commission of inquiry gives its report. One conclusion is inevitable – if someone in the executive had an idea of good governance and if the establishment had taken prompt action, many lives could have been saved and damage to property could have been avoided. The bureaucratic ineptitude of the authorities coupled with authoritarian ineptitude led to the bloodbath, which was not over in a day but went on for three days. It seems that the establishment consisting of the police and the Executive suffered a mild attack of ‘Kumbhkaranitis’, and at what cost. Whose job is it to wake up a sleeping guard?

No coherent response

As a lifelong student of law, I was appalled at the virtual absence of any coherent response from the justice system. The law entitles every victim of a mass disaster or ethnic violence to legal services for filing a case, such as one for compensation. Under a law enacted by Parliament, the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DLSA) ought to have swung into action to assist the victims, but where was it? Access to justice is an objective and not a mere slogan. DLSA did set up five ‘helpdesks’ about a week after the mayhem, but the lawyers at two ‘helpdesks’ that I visited themselves needed help and had no clue about their active responsibilities. I do not wish to belittle the efforts of these well-meaning lawyers, but I am sure the Annual Report of DLSA will highlight what it believes was a tremendous effort put in for the benefit of riot victims. Let’s be real.

However, the Delhi High Court acted immediately when approached for relief. It held a late night hearing and provided the necessary relief to victims and asked accountability questions of the establishment. However, the next day — remember, tomorrow is another day — the sentinel on the qui vive found the environment not conducive to registration of a First Information Report (FIR) and adjourned the case hearing by six weeks. Imagine a victim of domestic violence or of sexual assault going to a police station to lodge an FIR and being told by the Station House Officer (SHO) that the environment is not conducive since the victim might again face domestic violence or sexual assault. Amazing, isn’t it! It has taken the Supreme Court to request the Delhi High Court to show urgency in the hearing. How many can afford going to the Supreme Court?

The registration of an FIR results in investigations into the commission of an alleged offence. Conversely, if there is no FIR, there cannot be an investigation into anything. There are any number of decided cases where the courts have asked questions about the delay by the victim in lodging an FIR. In many cases, the delay has been adequately explained, but in many, it has not been, thereby leading to an acquittal; such is the importance given to an FIR. Perhaps the most important feature of an investigation is the collection of evidence, and if it is more than likely to be tampered with or if the witnesses to a crime are sought to be influenced, an accused person may even be arrested by the investigating officer. Therefore, if consideration for registering an FIR is delayed by four weeks, as per the Delhi High Court, a smart accused can manoeuvre to have the delayed investigation scuttled through destruction of crucial evidence and witnesses compromised through inducements or threats, eventually leading to the police filing a no offence report and closing the sordid chapter. Would this be classified as justice or injustice?

Judiciary’s moral authority

The role of the judiciary in riot situations is extremely important, in that it could prevent a slide into chaos. The judiciary does not wield a sword nor does it control the purse strings of the state. But it is possessed of a more powerful alloy — moral authority, public trust and confidence. What the judiciary says or does has tremendous influence and it should never forget that, regardless of who wields the sword or controls the purse strings. Therefore, in such situations requiring urgent action, the judiciary cannot be expected to grant adjournments on the asking and for what it believes is an environment that is not conducive. Intervention by the court can, more often than not, make the environment conducive on occasions where all wings of the state, particularly the police, need whatever muscle is given to them in the Constitution and the law. The colonial belief that courts should be reactive should be forgotten and substituted by the public interest belief that courts should be proactive. If that is not appreciated, the decision of the Supreme Court in ADM Jabalpur will resurface from ten fathoms deep and continue to haunt us.

Prosecutions form the last chapter of criminal justice. Recent events have clearly suggested that the police all over has completely mixed up and mangled freedom of speech and hate speech. Inflammatory statements and induced sloganeering by the powerful in Delhi, which may or may not be seditious but can certainly be categorised as ‘hate speech’, are left untouched. On the other hand, the weak are put behind bars for sedition for something that does not even cause a ripple, let alone ‘bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt, or excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the government established by law’, proving Bruce Lee’s famous “boards don’t hit back” jibe at O’Hara. So the question, blame games apart, is: will those guilty for the Delhi riots ever be identified and booked and, if they are, will they ever be punished? It took our justice delivery system 35 years to find Sajjan Kumar guilty of offences in the 1984 riots in Delhi. When will the system find and punish the guilty for the recent riots but who cares, by the way?

Final thoughts — let’s read the Preamble to our glorious Constitution and appreciate four crucial words — justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Are we making sense of all of them or some or none?

380,2020/03/07,"Letters to the Editor — March 7, 2020","Democracy in crisis

It is true that the shocking incidents which fanned communal flames in our country in the recent days have put our democracy to shame. As someone who teaches at a foreign university, I can say that the pride and confidence with which we used to carry ourselves as Indians (a land of pluralism, tolerance and dharma) has been punctured, thanks to the forces that are out to destroy the values that define our democracy. The examples I used to give in my classes to teach about the values of linguistic plurality and cultural transformation, citing from Indian contexts, are turning out to be outmoded and questionable. Unless the trinity that Dr. Manmohan Singh mentioned in his article is tackled with immediate effect, the peril is ours (Editorial page, “An unrest, a slowdown and a health epidemic, March 6). I can only quote what Jawaharlal Nehru said once: “Who lives if India dies, and who dies if India lives?”

The police’s masters

The police officers at the helm of affairs in a State, who are interested in career advancement and smooth professional sailing, are likely to abuse their powers to protect the interests of the ruling party at the cost of well being of the people. This has been the phenomenon in all States since Independence, regardless of the political party in power (Editorial, “Read them the riot act,” March 6). High handedness against anti-CAA protesters in Uttar Pradesh, deliberate inaction against perpetrators of violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and shooting of the accused in the Telangana gang-rape case are some of the many instances of infractions on the part of police departments across the nation. Obviously, no political party wants the police force to be freed from political interference. More disturbingly, even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, known much for his honesty and sincerity, has been found wanting in his words and actions while dealing with the recent communal riots in Delhi. Efficient policing does not appear to be on the horizon in the foreseeable future.

Partisan stance

The Delhi police failed miserably to contain the riots, and even took a partisan stance by joining in stone-pelting by one group. Just as their callous indifference to the violence in Jamia Millia Islamia, which happened in their presence, they did not respond to SOS calls made to them for help. Home Minister Amit Shah, to whom the Delhi police reports, did not have time either to visit the riot-affected areas or to convey condolences. Mr. Shah was busy in Ahmedabad for the Trump show, when riots were at their peak on Monday, which reminds one of Nero fiddling as Rome burnt. The most heartening thing amongst all this chaos was the humane approach of some residents, belonging to all religions, of the violence-affected localities.

Yes Bank in crisis

The customers of Yes Bank are facing agonising moments as they try to withdraw their own money(“Yes Bank placed under moratorium till April 3,” March 6). The bank has been reportedly showing distress signals for sometime, which eventually led to its inability to raise the needed capital to support the losses in the loan portfolio. It is really unpalatable as to how the deterioration in the bank’s financial status could not be captured at the right time by the regulatory supervisory surveillance mechanisms. New-age banks such as Yes Bank are expected to act as models in ensuring the delivery of modern services to customers across the spectrum. It is now important for the RBI to act and restore the dwindling confidence of the bank’s customers.

Strangely, Delhi University, where he served as a professor for decades, has reportedly been sitting over a bunch of files relating to his pension benefits. (Sport page, “Ailing Novy Kapadia awaits his long-delayed pension,” March 6). It is lamentable that Mr. Kapadia, whose services are unmatched in popularising football, is being treated so shabbily. Although the football fraternity has offered assistance, the Sports Ministry must bear Mr. Kapadia’s entire medical expenses for him to get back to his old self.

381,2020/03/07,Jugaad on the dining table,"Think of the many leaps culinary imagination must take to reproduce a native dish in a foreign land

I’m a great fan of Yotam Ottolenghi’s cookery writing. Ottolenghi moved to London from Israel in the late 90s and became really well known after he wrote a regular column in

The Guardian

presenting innovative vegetarian recipes. Since then Ottolenghi and his delis and restaurants have become an institution in the U.K. culinary scene, while his cookbooks — not all vegetarian — have become bestsellers. Though thoroughly knowledgeable about different cooking traditions and owing a lot to Middle Eastern cookery and the mind-boggling mix of food in his home city of Jerusalem, the special thing about Ottolenghi’s recipes is the startlingly unusual combinations of flavours and textures. The man once described his endeavours in a simple but evocative sentence ‘I want drama in the mouth’.

Now, it’s one thing if you happen to be living in London — widely regarded as the food capital of the world — when you try and execute a Yotam Ottolenghi recipe.

London is where you can find almost any ingredient from Polish to Brazilian, from Mozambican to Japanese, and that too without too much effort. Sourcing the raw materials for an Ottolenghi dish, therefore, is almost as pleasurable an adventure as cooking it.

Where’s the mushroom?

Things change, however, when you find yourself flipping through one of YO’s books in India.

Say you’re looking at the recipe for ‘marinated mushrooms with walnut and tahini yoghurt’, say you somehow access or make tahini and buy white wine vinegar and maple syrup in a supermarket, but where on earth will you find buna shimeji mushrooms?

For another recipe, where would you find the artichokes to go with the broad beans? Or merguez sausage, mirin wine or manouri cheese? YO is aware of this and sometimes sympathetic: ‘We always try to suggest alternatives for ingredients you have to work to find,’ he writes, but the next sentence goes: ‘Some things are so distinct, though, that their taste really is hard to replicate.’

The other day I found myself arguing with two young women, who are trained chefs. Discussing Ottolenghi recipes they said that so precise and subtle were his concoctions, it was impossible to really do justice to them without the exact ingredients. I realised that though all three of us were Calcuttans, none of us was a Bengali. With this came the realisation that my mother and my interlocutors’ Sindhi, Bihari and Marwari grandmothers would, 50-odd years ago, all have had to be inventive and flexible while reproducing recipes from their home cultures.

Big cities such as Bombay and Calcutta would have had a lot of stuff imported from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Punjab to support their cosmopolitan populations, but even so the variety and availability of goods was nothing like today.

Going further back in history, I tried to imagine what it must have been like to miss a specific taste from home, a dish, a fish, a fruit, and the leaps of culinary imagination it would have taken to put together something resembling a meal from one’s native culture.

Think of our migrant communities: Biharis in the Caribbean, Tamilians in South Africa, Gujaratis in Africa, Sikhs in Canada and California, with ships bringing in craved-for foodstuffs only intermittently. Before that remember that Calcutta in its first hundred years was a melting pot and a major laboratory of inauthentic culinary jugaad.

From around the world

Think of the British and French missing their food and the advent of Anglo-Indian cookery, picture the Portuguese and Malabaris creating Goan cuisine. Imagine poor Wajid Ali Shah in exile in Behala with only a hundred khansamas trying to reproduce Lucknow on his plate, and finally adding the hand-grenade from the New World, the profane potato into the sacred biryani — the biryani which had itself travelled, coalesced and mutated so much from its take-off point in Iran. Around the same period, the samosa travelled from Turkey to find a shore in Calcutta, where you can now find distinct versions of it — all vegetarian — from UP, Marwar and Gujarat, not to mention the classic Bangali shengara.

Among the different communities which made up Calcutta were also Armenians, Chinese and Baghdadi Jews. Which brings us full circle back to Yotam Ottolenghi.

Perhaps one reason why Ottolenghi is so brilliant in his fusions is because he and one of his main cooking partners Sami Tamimi, an Arab Palestinian, both grew up in Jerusalem. Like Calcutta but obviously much older, Jerusalem is also a city where many different cultures meet and mix.

Syncretic food culture

For millennia people have travelled from Palestine and settled all over the world, and then returned, bringing back rich and varied food cultures. Even though Jerusalem has been torn apart from time to time by communal tensions and clashes, its syncretic food culture knows few equals.

Replacing ingredients and making new collages is part of their hard-wiring and the world is the richer for it. Given all this, I’m sure YO wouldn’t mind if I replace the artichoke with lotus stem in the recipe with broad beans or use goat meat and one of the local shaaks for his lamb meatballs with warm yoghurt and Swiss chard.

The official website of the Maharashtra Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was hacked by unknown parties on Friday. It was later restored, and an inquiry has been initiated.

According to Cyber police officials, the incident came to light in the early hours of Friday, when the homepage of the CID website – mahacid.gov.in – was found defaced. The message left by the hackers on the home page referred to the recent violence against Muslims in Delhi and issued a “warning” to the Narendra Modi government.

A group identifying itself as 'Legion' claimed responsibility for the hacking. However, it is not clear whether this is the same group that had in 2016 hacked several Twitter accounts, including that of Congress party president Rahul Gandhi, and posted offensive content from his handle.

The defacement included a picture of a man on a horse bearing a flag with the caption, “The government of Imam Mahdi”.

The message under the picture said, “In India, families of Muslims killed by Hindu mobs. Hundreds of Muslim families lost their relatives say the Modi government is to blame for a rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric in India. The riots, which erupted on the day US President Donald Trump arrived in India for a state visit, lasted three days, killing more than 45 people , mostly Muslim, and injuring at least 150 others (sic).”

The message was followed by a warning to the government of India, which said, “We are warning you Indian police and Modi government, stop hurting people of Muslims. Muslims are everywhere. Feel the power of Muslim brotherhood. Imam Mahdi is coming soon.”

Officials said Imam Mahdi might refer to Muhammad Mahdi Akhef, a leader with Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, who died in September 2017. He was imprisoned following a coup in Egypt in 2013, and died in prison.

“This does not seem to be the handiwork of the same group that earlier hacked popular Indian Twitter accounts as in an earlier interview, the Legion had hinted that they were based in eastern Europe. They have also said that they have no particular political affiliation. The specific mention of Delhi violence gives rise to the suspicion that this is done by someone closer home. Efforts are under way to trace the hack,” a Cyber police officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/t8jdiv/article31005340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BM-hacked,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-cid-website-hacked-defaced/article31005341.ece

After this year’s civic budget, the State budget too saw a major allocation to tourism and environment, in the wake of Aaditya Thackeray’s entry into the State Cabinet with these portfolios. A good ₹1,400 crore has been set aside for the Tourism Department. Climate change has also found prominent mention in the budget with the setting up of a ‘green fund’.

Soon after becoming minister, Mr. Thackeray took forward projects he had been working on at the city-level for several years, such as the plastic ban, the Mumbai 24 hours project, and tourism development. A separate budgetary allocation was made in the recent District Planning and Development Corporation meeting with Finance Minister Ajit Pawar. The government announced that 22 public places will be developed in Mumbai through a tourism master plan. Island City Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh had also announced the development of Haji Ali and Mani Bhavan. All these projects found reflection in the annual budget.

The total allocation of ₹1,400 crore for tourism includes ₹1,000 crore for Aaditya Thackeray’s constituency Worli alone. An international-standard tourist complex is planned at the 14-acre Worli Dairy complex, including a world-class aquarium. Another ₹100 crore has been set aside for boosting Mumbai’s tourism. This amount will grow to ₹500 crore in the next five years, and will include a viability gap funding programme for promotion of coastal tourism, formulated on the lines of the Central scheme. Altogether ₹25 crore has been allotted to renovate the building and museum at Mani Bhavan as this is the year of Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary. Diploma and degree courses will be started in tourism.

Some of the other tourist places that will be developed include Murud-Janjira, Shivneri Fort, and the Ambabai temple in Kolhapur.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had met with the Tourism Minister and stakeholders in Mahabaleshwar for the tourist spot’s development, and ₹100 crore has been set aside in the budget for its development plan, which includes conservation.

The government will be drafting a policy to study climate change. Among the measures planned to address environmental concerns are projects of afforestation, urban forestry, promotion of non-conventional energy, conservation and maintenance of water resources, sewage disposal and solid waste management, and controlling river pollution.

The government requires a special dedicated fund for these projects. The increase in value added tax on petrol and diesel by ₹1 will add ₹1,800 crore to the State’s kitty. This money will be transferred to the government’s ‘green fund’, which will be utilised for environment conservation, particularly sewage disposal and waste management projects.

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has arrested two people allegedly involved in printing and circulating fake currency notes in the city. The accused are allegedly part of a gang that was earlier busted in Kerala, and those arrested at the time included a Malayalam television actor and her family members.

The two accused have been identified as Vishnu Vijayan (28) and Don Warki (26). Officers said they were caught on the basis of a tip-off received by police constable Amit Mahangade with the Crime Branch Unit IX.

“The tip-off was verified under the supervision of senior police inspector Mahesh Desai, after which teams led by police inspectors Asha Korke and Sanjeev Gawde laid a trap at Veera Desai Road in Andheri on Thursday. The two were intercepted in a white Santro and were found to be carrying counterfeit ₹500 notes with a face value of ₹2.94 lakh,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection I) Akbar Pathan said.

The accused were arrested and during interrogation, revealed they were printing the notes in a house they had recently rented in Navi Mumbai.

Acting on the information, Unit IX teams raided the house in Ulwe and seized equipment including plates, brass strips, cutters and foils of paper, which were being used for printing the notes, along with computers, tablets and printers.

“The two work for Leo George, the mastermind who was arrested in Kerala in 2018 for running a similar racket there. Malayalam actor Surya Sashikumar, along with her mother and sister, were also arrested for the offence at the time. We suspect that this is a separate module of a large network run by George, who is wanted in our case,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The police are finding out how long the accused have been active and how much fake currency they have printed and circulated during this time. Prima facie, the racket seems to have been running purely for profit and does not seem to have terror links. The accused have been charged for counterfeiting of currency under the Indian Penal Code, and efforts are under way to trace and arrest other members involved in the racket, officers said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4282gv/article31005330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BM-fake-currency,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-held-for-printing-circulating-fake-currency-in-mumbai/article31005331.ece
385,2020/03/07,"No handshake, greet with folded hands: archbishop","Circular listing steps to check spread of COVID-19 sent to all parish priests

In the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the Archbishop of Bombay has sent out a circular to all parish priests asking parishioners to offer peace with folded hands instead of a handshake.

Cardinal Oswald Gracias, in a circular dated March 5, has advised many other measures, including encouraging people to receive Holy Communion in the hands, and before its distribution, the priest or the minister should purify their hands in a bowl of water or use sanitiser.

“On Good Friday, at the Veneration of the Cross, discourage people from kissing the cross. The blessing with a raised cross would be adequate. Those who desire, could come in a queue, make reverence with a bow, and go back,” the Cardinal said, adding the holy water stoups may be kept dry.

He said these were temporary arrangements to be followed until Easter on April 12. “If there is any indication that an individual in the community is infected, parish priests can temporarily suspend meetings of cells, sodalities, associations etc.”

The Cardinal also advised people not to panic and said their first faith response should be to turn to god. While the advisories may be reviewed time to time, the Cardinal said he had sent the circular to all parishes and institutions in the Archdiocese of Bombay. “After appropriate consultation, we will send a similar note to the Church in India,” he said.

No biometric attendance

To curb the spread of the virus, University of Mumbai has asked all colleges and other educational institutions to stop biometric attendance.

386,2020/03/07,"Konkan division officials ask public not to panic, clear the air on masks","‘FDA told to pull up chemists selling masks at higher prices’

Shivaji Daund, divisional commissioner of Konkan division, on Friday said there is nothing to panic about novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as of now, and the administration is ready with isolation wards in hospitals.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Daund said mask is not a full-proof protection from the virus since it has a shelf life. “If anyone was found selling masks and sanitisers at higher prices, it should be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).”

Dr. Gauri Rathod, deputy director, health department, Konkan division, said on Thursday night, 13,000 people were screened. “Airports and ports are screening every individual travelling from other countries. There is a lot of misinformation being spread, and we would like to tell people that there is nothing to panic. As of today, there is not a single positive case in Maharashtra and hence the mask is not needed to be used. We are concentrating on preventative measures.”

Mr. Daund said every hospital under the corporation, zilla parishad, and even medical colleges had been instructed to set up isolation wards at their level.

“Every person coming from other countries is being screened. If a person is found to have no symptoms, they are quarantined at home for 14 days. Our team calls each quarantined person twice a day to check if they have got fever. If someone has fever, they are shifted to a hospital quarantine and a throat swab is sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for tests. If found positive, they will be shifted to an isolation ward,” Ms. Rathod said.

She also said if a person was detected with the slightest of symptoms during screening, they would directly be sent to a hospital quarantine, till the reports came in from NIV. “Even if the reports turn out to be negative, they are still kept at the hospital for observation.”

The officials have suggested to maintain personal hygiene by washing hands with plain water and soap. “There is no need to purchase masks and costly sanitisers. The masks instill fear in the people’s minds,” Mr. Daund said.

The three-layer mask available in market is only for people infected with cough whereas N95 mask is for swine flu, which is to be used by medical personnel while treating patients, Ms. Rathod said.

“Due to the panic, there are people selling masks at an exorbitant price. We have already informed the FDA to take action against medical stores selling masks at higher prices and people trying to sell any medicine in the name of prevention of coronavirus,” Mr. Daund said. Ms. Rathod also said the virus spreads from one human to another and not from any Chinese products or food.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bzblo0/article31005321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/konkan-division-officials-ask-public-not-to-panic-clear-the-air-on-masks/article31005320.ece
387,2020/03/07,Navi Mumbai police arrest three for man’s murder in Ghansoli,"Body dumped into creek; 1 accused had affair with deceased’s wife

Unit III of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch on Friday arrested three men for murdering a 45-year-old man from Rabale and dumping his body into the NRI creek.

On February 13, the unidentified body of a man was found in the creek. While the police was verifying the identity of the man, they came across a missing complaint registered with the Rabale police on February 10. The body was decomposed, but with the help of the belt the deceased was wearing, the wife identified her husband, Khadak Bahadur Singh.

“While trying to find the accused, we examined the victim’s call record data and listed everyone known to him. We also learnt of an affair his wife had with one of the accused,” Senior Police Inspector Vijay Kadbane from Unit III said.

The police arrested Kailash Shaligram Kharat (29) who ran a Chinese food stall. Mr. Kharat was in a relationship with Singh’s wife. Singh would suspect his wife and frequently fight with her, which Kharat did not like. He decided to eliminate Singh, and sought help from his friends Jay Shankar Chavan (25) and Vali Ahmed Mashaqali Sayyed (20).

On the night of February 9, the three caught hold of Singh near Ghansoli creek while he was on his way home and slit his throat. They also hit his head with a stone. Around 1.30 a.m. on February 10, they threw his body from Airoli bridge. The water carried the body into the NRI creek. Since Singh had not reached home, his wife asked around about him and later registered a missing complaint with the Rabale police. “Prima facie, Singh’s wife does not have any involvement in the murder,” Mr. Kadbane said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/navi-mumbai-police-arrest-three-for-mans-murder-in-ghansoli/article31005314.ece
388,2020/03/07,Security tightened at Yes Bank branches,"Security at Yes Bank headquarters, its branches, and ATM booths across Mumbai was tightened to avert any untoward incident, as hundreds of account holders of the crisis-hit private lender rushed to withdraw money, an official said on Friday. The RBI on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at ₹50,000 per account till April 3.

Long queues were seen outside branches. At the Ghatkopar (West), Chakala, and Andheri (East) branches, bank employees were at regular intervals heard telling the confused customers that the step was taken as a precautionary measure, and that it would bring no harm to the depositors’ hard-earned money.

Anil Bhagat, a driver, said he needed cash on an urgent basis as his family had arranged a puja at his residence. “My daughter’s salary was credited on Thursday but it was only after she got a call from her employer, we knew about the restrictions. At least the bank should update its customers on the situation so that they can keep themselves prepared for a tough situation.”

The Ghatkopar branch was out of cash by 1 p.m. and the authorities had to call for more cash. Seventy-five-year-old Suryakant Sethia, who visited the bank with his wife to withdraw money, said, “We use the interest from our fixed deposits for living. Fortunately, both of us are healthy but if any medical emergency comes up, we will be in trouble.”

Another depositor, who had visited the bank to withdraw her fixed deposit, was not allowed to do so as a bank employee said the internet on the system for withdrawing the FD was down.

Shekhar Pujari, a businessman, said he had deposited a cheque for over ₹50,000 on Thursday, but was yet to get clearances from the bank. “I had heard a month or two earlier that the shares of the bank had lost their value. On asking the bank about it, they had told me to not worry about it and therefore I continued with this bank on trust.”

According to the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre, the donor was declared brain dead at the S.R.V. Hospital in Tilak Nagar.

However, since the hospital was not a retrieval centre, the donor was shifted to Fortis Hospital in Mulund where the procedure was carried out.

The donor’s husband and sons consented to the organ donation, following which her liver, kidneys, pancreas and small bowel were harvested. The liver and one of the donated kidneys were transplanted to a 53-year-old man suffering from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and a 35-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease at Fortis Hospital. The pancreas and the small bowel were sent to a Pune hospital for transplant.

“It is a commendable gesture when the family agrees to donate the organs of their loved ones.

390,2020/03/07,"MVA’s first budget: Book of Jobs, the Thackeray version","Government bets on power tariff, stamp duty cuts to spur employment; VAT hike on fuel may hurt middle class

Presenting the Maha Vikas Aghadi’s first budget on Friday, Maharashtra’s Finance Minister Ajit Pawar sought to resuscitate the State’s flagging economy, with a clear focus on creating jobs for the youth and assuring distressed farmers that succour is on the way.

In a bid to spur industrial production at a time the State’s edge in manufacturing is on the ebb, Mr. Pawar decided to slash duties on electricity used for manufacturing purposes by nearly two percentage points. The electricity duty on industrial use too has been reduced from 9.3% to 7.5%.

Real estate boost

He also introduced a 1% concession on stamp duty and related charges for registering urban properties in major cities – with an eye on fixing the moribund real estate sector, one of the most critical engines of job creation in recent years. This will make it cheaper to register real estate transactions in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and areas of municipal corporation of Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur.

These sops, worth ₹2,500 crore, are expected to be offset by a hike in the value-added tax (VAT) levied on petrol and diesel by ₹1 per litre, which may have a slightly inflationary impact on prices in general and cramp middle class spending. However, the additional VAT collections are to be transferred to a green fund for spending on environment conservation projects, specifically those related to sewage disposal and waste management.

To pump prime the economy through infrastructure spending, the Budget has proposed an outlay of over ₹30,000 crore even as it separately seeks to expedite completion of long-drawn irrigation projects across the State.

Presenting his fifth budget so far (he presented four as part of the Congress-NCP government that was in power from 1999 to 2014), Mr. Pawar proposed an annual plan outlay of ₹1,15,000 crore for 2020-21, with a fiscal deficit of ₹54,618.38 crore and an estimated revenue deficit of ₹9,510.71 crore.

For youth and farmers

“The current economic downturn has been a large increase in unemployment. Under these circumstances, the government is striving to make the youth of the state employable and provide them jobs,” said Mr. Pawar, who is also the deputy chief minister in the 100-day old MVA regime.

A new Maharashtra Apprenticeship Scheme will be launched for educated unemployed in the age group 21 to 28 where they will be trained in government, semi-government and private establishments. The State will pay 100% stipend in first two categories.

Under a new Chief Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, grants of 15% to 35% of project cost will be given to new entrepreneurs. State-run industrial training institutes or ITIs will be transformed to modern skill centres at a cost of ₹1,500 crore over the next three years.

Taking forward the government’s flagship Mahatma Jyotirao Phule crop loan waiver scheme, under which loans up to ₹2 lakh have been waived off, Mr. Pawar allocated an additional ₹7,000 crore for 2020-21, taking the total to ₹22,000 crore. Farmers with arrears of more than ₹2 lakh will also benefit as the government will pay up after the outstandings above ₹2 lakh is paid by them. Mr. Pawar said farmers who took a crop loan in 2018-19 and regularly pay their dues will get ₹50,000 as incentive.

Mr. Pawar said five lakh solar agricultural pumps will be set up in the next five years with an outlay of ₹3,245 crore for agriculture and allied departments. Mr. Pawar said the Centre has approved only ₹956.13 crore of the ₹14,496 crore relief sought for farmers who suffered losses due to heavy rains. A sum of ₹2,034 crore has been earmarked for crop insurance scheme.

The government will give priority to 313 incomplete irrigation projects in a time-bound manner for which an outlay of ₹10,235 crore has been proposed.

More for MLAs

The decision to raise allowance for MLAs to develop their constituencies from ₹2 crore to ₹3 crore per year drew cheers from representatives across the benches.

Opposition leader and Mr. Thackeray’s predecessor Devendra Fadnavis slammed the budget saying the MVA government is hiding its failure under the garb of economic slowdown. “All announcements in the budget are based on Centre’s support. Common citizens have not gained anything from it, neither have farmers or already neglected regions such as Vidarbha, Marathwada and north Maharashtra,” he said.

In his reaction to the budget, Rustom Kerawalla, Chairman, Ampersand group, “The vision to upgrade Industrial Training Institutes and transform them into modern skilling centres will create a skilled workforce, enable them higher remuneration and empower them with future skills. We hope that the government will introduce virtual interactive classrooms in addition to the physical classrooms.”

Farshid Cooper, Managing Director of Spenta Corporation, welcoming the initiative to revive the real estate sector and said, “With the reduction of stamp duty by 1% for the next 2 years, we can expect to witness the revival of the sector and sale of the existing inventories. Huge unsold inventory and ready-to-move-in properties in Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur are likely to benefit from this announcement. The festivities like Holi and Gudi Padwa are also approaching and we are hopeful that the sales will see an uptick in the next couple of quarters.”

Populist measure

On the other hand, Dr. Renita D’Souza , Fellow, Observer Research Foundation, said populist measures like loan waivers only appear to help the farmer. “They probably might in the short run. But the broader perspective would require empowering farmers by investing in their capabilities” she said. “This will unnecessarily increase the level of borrowing irrespective of agricultural need and speculative investments would be undertaken and regular repayments made to acquire the profit of ₹50,000,” she added.

For Imaan Javan, Director of Operations at Suntuity Renewable Energy India, a prominent feature of the budget was the proposed installation of solar pumps for farmers. “We welcome this decision which reflects the government’s commitment and concern for renewable energy generation. Finance Minister Ajit Pawar has stated that in five years, five lakh solar pumps will be installed. This will enable farmers to set up grid-connected solar power generation capacity giving back the farmers their livelihood. We hope this will boost the agriculture sector, help generate employment in rural areas, and also mitigate climate change,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1ufew6/article31005262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMMAHARASHTRABUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mvas-first-budget-book-of-jobs-the-thackeray-version/article31005263.ece
391,2020/03/07,Packed with new schemes,"In maiden budget, MVA government unveils steps to boost employment, promote sports

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in its maiden budget on Friday announced a new ₹450-crore Chief Minister’s Water Conservation Scheme to replace the previous chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s pet project, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan.

The new scheme aims to rejuvenate 8,000 water conservation projects, create decentralised water reservoirs, increase ground water level and protect irrigation capacity.

While presenting the State budget for 2020-21, Finance Minister Ajit Pawar announced several new schemes to boost infrastructure, employment, transport and rural development. Some of the schemes were those promised in the MVA’s common minimum programme. Mr. Pawar said the government has decided to establish a “chair” at London School of Economics to honour Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who studied at the institution from 1916 to 1922.

To resolve the problem of unemployment over the next five years, the budget has unveiled the ₹6,000-crore Maharashtra Apprenticeship Scheme “to provide employment and self-employment opportunities and experience to all youths who have passed at least Class X.”

The scheme, which will begin on August 15, encourages establishments to hire apprentices and aims to train 10 lakh educated, unemployed youth in the 21 to 28 age-group to work in new sectors. The government will pay an amount equivalent to 75% of the monthly stipend or ₹5,000, whichever is less, to the private establishment per month for a candidate. For government establishments, 100% stipend will be covered. The Chief Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, which aims to promote employment and self-employment among the youth, was also announced in the budget. Under this ₹130-crore scheme, grants between 15% and 35% will be given to entrepreneurs for implementing self-employment projects. The government expects one lakh industries to be established over five years and generate up to two lakh jobs every year.

₹120-crore scholarship scheme

The government also aims to implement a ₹120-crore scholarship scheme for the foreign education of students from the poorer sections of minority communities. To promote sports, the budget has introduced three new proposals. The grant to build sports complexes has been hiked from ₹1 crore to ₹5 crore at the taluka level, from ₹8 crore to ₹25 crore at the district level and from ₹24 crore to ₹50 crore at the divisional level. An international sports university will be set up at Balewadi and an Olympic Bhavan in Pune. The government will also organise a mini Olympic competition to promote sports, including for the disabled.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hs1u3o/article31005129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Maha-BudgeGraphic,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/packed-with-new-schemes/article31005135.ece
392,2020/03/07,"Mumbai Bagh protesters allege police excess, block traffic demanding action","Several videos go viral; agitators see a senior Nagpada police station official’s hand behind the assault

Unrest prevailed at the site of the Mumbai Bagh protest in Mumbai Central, after several agitating women alleged that they had been manhandled by police personnel on Friday morning. Angry demonstrators blocked the busy Nagpada junction for several hours.

The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens, and National Population Register, which began on the night of January 26, entered its 39th day on Friday. The agitation is being conducted on a relay basis by women from all over the city.

According to protesters, some of them, who were leaving in the early hours, were erecting a tarpaulin shade for those who were staying back when the police allegedly stopped them. The women claimed that the shade was for those who had been suffering from heat stroke and other ailments.

Several videos which went viral on WhatsApp show women saying they had been assaulted and their modesty outraged by policemen in plain clothes. A video also shows a few women lying on the ground, apparently unconscious.

The protesters alleged that the outrage was carried out on an order by senior police inspector Shalini Sharma, Nagpada police station.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone III) Abhinash Kumar said, “We are assessing the footage of the incident. It appears that the women fell as a result of the argument, but if there are any excesses committed by the police, action will be taken.”

While there was no video of the actual assault, another video in which a man was heard inciting women to allege misconduct by male police personnel started doing the rounds.

Agitators have for several days been accusing Ms. Sharma of intimidating and making things difficult for them, and have now demanded her dismissal from service.

“They have taken our chairs and water supplies, and have been threatening us with severe consequences since we began.” Mariam, a regular protester, said.

Another woman, Aisha, said while the police claimed that the protest was causing inconvenience to residents, this was not the case. “The residents of the area have been helping us throughout. They have no problems with us and even bring us food and water, and offer help. So this is just another way to harass us.”

Eight protesters were taken to Nair Hospital for a check-up on Friday afternoon. A short while later, a large mob of demonstrators came out of the protest venue and gathered at the Nagpada junction, demanding action against the police personnel responsible.

Mr. Kumar and other police personnel had to reason with them for over an hour before they went back to the protest site.

“We are always in purdah, even at home. It is a matter of our faith, but there were male officers who did not have any badges and who were directly pushing us, pulling our scarves, and manhandling us,” claimed Aneesa Sarguru, a social worker who has been at the protest from the first day.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n7821j/article31005254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-bagh-protesters-allege-police-excess-block-traffic-demanding-action/article31005092.ece
393,2020/03/07,Debt continues to rise,"State bearing liability of infrastructure projects

As per the 2020-21 budget estimates, the State is reeling under debt of ₹5,20,717 crore, rising from ₹4,64,020 crore the previous fiscal. The debt percentage to the Gross State Domestic Product stands at 16.2% compared to 16.1% the previous fiscal.

Finance Minister Ajit Pawar said, “During the last five years, the State has raised loans of ₹2,82,448 crore. The amount of guarantees given by the government was ₹7,709 crore at the end of 2014. It has now increased to ₹46,891 crore.”

Meanwhile, infrastructure projects cost the government ₹2,78,271 crore. “The State government has to bear direct and indirect liability of these projects,” he said. While the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has claimed that the debt is within the limits prescribed by the 14th Finance Commission, leaders of the ruling coalition have said liabilities of infrastructure projects are also part of the total debt.

Mr. Pawar also pointed out the Centre’s delay in releasing the State’s share of funds. He said, “The share in the Central taxes that Maharashtra is expected to get in accordance with the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission has come down from ₹44,672 crore to ₹36,220 crore in the revised estimates of 2019-20. There is also a delay in getting the Goods and Services Tax compensation from the Centre. As a result, funding the expenditure on development works is becoming difficult.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/debt-continues-to-rise/article31005020.ece

While the Public Health and Medical Education Departments have been allotted ₹2,456 crore and ₹950 crore respectively, ₹2,110 crore has been proposed for the Women and Child Development Department. The budget has set aside ₹5 crore to set up a Transgender Rights Protection and Welfare Board to bring the community into the mainstream. A sum of ₹1,400 crore has been allocated to focus on health, education and employment generation, achieve the sustainable goals set by the United Nations and improve the State’s human development index.

There is a shortfall of 11 district hospitals, 21 women’s hospitals, 21 sub-district hospitals, 603 primary healthcare centres and 6,105 sub-centres. The government has decided to take up externally-aided projects worth ₹5,000 crore for primary health services and ₹2,500 crore for medical education. It will be tying up with a multi-national financial institution for a loan. The State has set aside ₹25 crore for purchasing 500 new ambulances and replace old ones. The government aims to set up 75 new dialysis centres so no patient has to travel over 50 km to seek treatment.

The budget also set aside ₹515 crore for the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, which covers 1,000 hospitals and offers 996 types of treatment. In a first, the government will be coming out with a palliative care policy by roping in NGOs and social service organisations. A new medical college will be started at Nandurbar this year and government medical colleges will be opened in Satara, Alibaug and Amravati next year.

As part of the gender budget, the State wants to give impetus to self-help groups for providing products or services up to ₹1,000 crore as part of government procurement. The government will have to amend its procurement policy.

The budget made significant mention of women’s safety, wherein an office of the State Women’s Commission will be set up in every division. An all-women’s police station in every district and special investigation teams will be constituted to investigate atrocities against women. Female government prosecutors will be appointed to represent the government in such cases.

395,2020/03/07,Major push for infrastructure,"Govt. sets its agenda by making no mention of bullet train, hyperloop projects

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government spelt out its priorities with regard to the State’s infrastructure projects by making no mention of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project and the much-hyped Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project in its maiden budget on Friday.

Finance Minister Ajit Pawar said an economic corridor of international standards would be developed in Satara district under the Bengaluru-Mumbai Economic Corridor project on the lines of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor. “Along with Satara, the adjoining Sangli and Solapur districts will benefit from the economic corridor,” he said, adding that the project’s estimated cost is ₹4,000 crore.

Mr. Pawar also allocated ₹3,500 crore to complete the Konkan Marine Highway in three years. The highway, whose Revas-Reddy stretch is under construction, will be concretised and bridges built over creeks at Bankot, Kelshi, Dabhol and Jaigad. He said, “Funds will be made available to complete the work through the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) in a time-bound manner.”

Mr. Pawar announced the construction of a 170-km-long ring road to divert traffic to Pune from Nashik, Aurangabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Around ₹15,000 crore is likely to be spent on the project, including land acquisition. MSRDC will start work on the project this year and complete it in four years. The government has earmarked ₹1,000 crore to implement a urban road scheme for upgrading, widening and beautifying main market streets in all cities under the jurisdiction of municipal corporations, councils and panchayats.

Mr. Pawar said ₹1,657 crore will be made available for Metro projects for 2020-21. “In addition to the Maan-Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar route under Pune Metro, two new lines — Shivajinagar-Shevalewadi and Maan-Pirangut — will also be started,” Mr. Pawar said.

The new Pune Metro line from Vanaz to Ramwadi will be expanded from Vanaz to Chandani Chowk and Ramwadi to Wagholi.

The length of the Metro line from Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate will be extended from Swargate to Katraj and from Pimpri-Chinchwad to Nigdi. “More funds will be provided this year than the amount earmarked in the last five years for Pune Metro,” Mr. Pawar said.

A sum of ₹1,501 crore has been proposed for a rural road development scheme, under which 40,000 km of roads will be constructed by 2025. Mr. Pawar said ‘in-principle’ approval has been given for spending ₹86 crore to start passenger transport from Mira Bhayander to Dombivli on Vasai-Thane-Kalyan route under the national waterways scheme.

A sum of of ₹50 crore has been allocated for the construction of a jetty at Radio Club in Colaba under the Sagarmala programme.

396,2020/03/07,"Better deal than previous budgets, say farmers’ leaders","‘Effort made to be agrarian-centric, bring relief to rural areas’

Farmers’ leaders have largely lauded the budget, stating that it was “more constructive” and offered a better deal for farmers as opposed to the budgets of the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.

Swabhimani Paksha chief Raju Shetti and Dr. Ajit Nawale, State general secretary of the CPI (M)-affiliated All Indian Kisan Sabha, have said the budget has made efforts to be agrarian-centric and bring some measure of relief to the rural hinterland. Mr. Shetti said, “This budget appears to have the farmer in its vision and is not a one-sided, corporate one as presented earlier. It certainly is better than the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government with Ajit Pawar announcing relief to farmers with loans of over ₹2 lakh, while providing an incentive of ₹50,000 for those who took crop loans in 2018-19 and had repaid their dues.”

However, Mr. Shetti said the State government ought to have increased the incentive amount for farmers repaying dues regularly from ₹25,000 to ₹75,000 instead of the ₹50,000 announced. He said the other notable aspect of the budget was the government’s efforts to resuscitate the powerloom industry, which has significant clusters in Malegaon, Solapur, Bhiwandi and Ichalkaranji.

Dr. Nawale welcomed Mr. Pawar’s announcements of a subsidy scheme of 80% to small and marginal farmers and 75% to multiple land holders for extending the drip irrigation scheme for crops to cover the whole State instead of a few talukas. He said, “While the budget is somewhat of a mixed bag, there are several positive aspects and the government has at least made efforts to give justice to farmers, notably in relief to those having a loan of more than ₹2 lakh. Particularly laudable is Mr. Pawar’s announcement of ₹10,035 crore for the Water Resources Department to increase the ground water level in the State.”

Dr. Nawale said the State government ought to have given more incentive money to farmers who had been repaying loans regularly. “This section [of farmers repaying dues regularly] constitutes around 45 lakh farmers and a significant proportion of them, too, were afflicted by natural calamity and inclement weather. So, giving them an incentive of only ₹50,000 feels like a bit of ‘punishment’ for not defaulting on their loans,” he said.

Likewise, both leaders welcomed the government’s announcement of launching a ₹10,000 crore scheme for the installation of five lakh solar pumps in next five years to supply power to farmers during the day. “The proposed solar pump scheme will depend a lot on its implementation. Furthermore, I would have appreciated if the government had taken some concrete measures to deal with bogus electricity bills,” Mr. Shetti said.

Dr. Nawale said he had hoped that the budget would make some mention of dealing with GST on farm equipment and seeds and fertilizers, even though it was a Central government issue.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1b58m5/article31004626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMRAJUSHETTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/better-deal-than-previous-budgets-say-farmers-leaders/article31004627.ece

Sivakami is 13-year-old U.S. daughter of U.S.-based daughter of Dr. Shankaramenon. Morning itself she came and said uncle can I spend few hours in the flat? Grandfather is going for clinic. I said oh my god, after decades and decades small children are coming in the house. It is a pleasure. Stay and enjoy like anything.

Do you want tea or coffee or cool drinks? She said coffee is best. Mrs. Mathrubootham came with coffee and special guest-only biscuit. Immediately, Sivakami is saying excuse me milk is there in coffee? Kamalam said yes of course, coffee without milk is like Mathrubootham without irritating behaviours. I laughed and laughed, but inside I put cyanide in Kamalam’s tea.

Sivakami is saying no, no, I am never touching milk. It is worst item. Milk is torture for cows. Never never I am taking anything from dairy industry. Kamalam said no problem, I am bringing other drink. Sivakami said thank you, Aunty. Kamalam heard word ‘Aunty’ and gave look at Sivakami as if Auto Shankar.

399,2020/03/07,"After 23 years, University College tops KU youth fete again","Clash at the festival venue among participating colleges over outcome

The University College, Thiruvananthapuram, finished on top of the points tally as the Kerala University Youth Festival 2020 drew to an acrimonious end.

It is after a hiatus of 23 years that the 154-year-old college has emerged the topper in the annual event.

Having secured 239 points at the end of all of the 108 items, the University College took the championship trophy from defending champions Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvananthapuram, which won 229 points. The Government College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram, occupied the third position with 180 points.

However, the cultural fete ended on a sour note with the organisers having to defer the valedictory function scheduled to be held on Saturday on account of clashes that took place among the participants over the last two days. It has now been tentatively scheduled to hold the programme on Tuesday.

The outcome after all the events got over was not along expected lines especially after the University College was behind the Mar Ivanios College in the points list for most part of the six-day event. The penultimate day ended with the city colleges heading towards a photo-finish having secured 224 points (University Colleges) and 223 points (Mar Ivanios College) respectively after 105 items. After all items were held and final tally was announced on Saturday, University College topped the chart.

Neeraj V.S. of St. Michael’s College, Cherthala, is set to bag the Kalaprathibha title for the best male performer with 26 points. Both Arya H. of University College, Thiruvananthapuram, and Malavika S. Gopan of NSS College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram, were the best performers among females with 25 points each, positioning them to emerge joint winners of the Kalathilakam title.

The event has been beset with numerous problems including frequent delays and difficulties faced by the participants with venues being shifted on short notice. Taking a turn for the worse, students clashed with one another late on Saturday, prompting a large police posse to intervene. There have also been several instances of contestants challenging the decision of judges and raising appeals.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/after-23-years-university-college-tops-ku-youth-fete-again/article31010838.ece

401,2020/03/07,Invoking of ESMA in KSRTC unlikely,"Notices to erring drivers to be issued only next week in view of Attukal Pongala

Invoking Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) in the KSRTC in the wake of Wednesday’s five-hour flash strike by the agitated employees in the capital seems remote with Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran stating that it is not the policy of the government.

The Minister was responding on Friday to a recommendation to this effect made by District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan, who was asked to probe into the stir and the death of a 60-year-old bus commuter at the East Fort bus station.

Talks held

Mr. Saseendran, who held interactions with K.R. Jyothilal, Principal Secretary, Transport; District Collector; Transport Commissioner R. Sreelekha; Joint Transport Commissioner Rajeev Puthalath; KSRTC chairman and managing director M.P. Dinesh; and other officials, said action against the erring KSRTC staff responsible for the stir and the traffic snarls would be taken after getting the final report.

The District Collector had also recommended a three-pronged mode of punishment against the crew of the buses that were abandoned on the road for hours. It is learnt that the MVD has decided to go ahead with the decision to book the erring drivers under the Motor Vehicles Act and 21 of them had been identified already. The delay in issuing the notices to these drivers is in view of the forthcoming Attukal Pongala and to prevent any protest during the festive season by KSRTC personnel and trade unions.

Notices will be served next week and the drivers will be asked to appear before the Regional Transport Officer to state their views on why their driving licences should not be cancelled, sources said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/invoking-of-esma-in-ksrtc-unlikely/article31007121.ece
402,2020/03/07,66 portable aerobic bins ahead of Attukal Pongala,"They were used for Onam fete and proved successful

The city Corporation has begun promoting the usage of portable aerobic bins for events and festivals, to tackle the waste management headaches that large-scale events throw up.

On Friday, Mayor K. Sreekumar launched 66 new portable aerobic bins ahead of the Attukal Pongala, for which these are expected to be widely used.

According to officials of the city Corporation’s health wing, the portable aerobic bins were developed first for a different aim altogether.

“When we began setting up aerobic bins widely, there was resistance from the local population in some places. Many of them did not want a permanent structure for waste processing to come up near the residences, as they assumed it would create problems in the future. So, the Corporation developed the portable bins that have a roof and need not be fixed on the ground, allowing it to be moved at will.

This model gained acceptance so much so that in some wards, the portable bins almost became permanent structures, as people realised they would not face any problems owing to these bins,” a health official said.

While the fixed aerobic bins are made of ferrocement, the initial models of portable bins were made of galvanised iron. However, with wet biodegradable waste being filled in these, corrosion became an issue. The new lot are being made of stainless steel.

Efficient design

“We tried out the effectiveness of portable bins during the Onam celebrations at Kanakakkunnu. Its success prompted us to push it widely for events and festivals. For instance, if an exhibition is happening for seven days, a few portable bins can be set up at the venue for that specific period, which could address a lot of waste-related issues.

Ahead of Pongala, instructions have been issued to make it available in places where waste dumping can be an issue. Owing to its design, it saves on a lot of space, compared to the permanent structures,” the official said.

As part of the Corporation’s annual plan, an amount of ₹1 crore was allocated for the 66 portable bins. The civic body already has 154 portable aerobic bins, in addition to the 414 bins set up in 54 different centres. In the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Corporation has proposed 200 more portable aerobic bins, as well as 144 more permanent aerobic bins in the material recovery facilities set up in different parts of the city.

410,2020/03/07,Help special students write exams: panel,"Education Department’s demand for medical board certificate in a new format found impractical

The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has asked the government to provide special help to children who have certificates from the district medical board for physical and learning disabilities to appear for examinations this academic year.

The commission’s recommendation comes in the wake of its finding that the Education Department’s demand for the medical board certificate in a new format and a certificate showing 40% learning disability even as the examinations were set to begin on March 10 was impractical.

Commission chairperson P. Suresh said that many differently abled students and those with learning disabilities who were to appear for the SSLC and Plus Two examinations this year were unable to do so owing to technical reasons.

Children whose IQ was above 84 were categorised as those with specific learning disability, while those students whose IQ was below 70 were categorised as mentally retarded. No consideration was given to slow learners (whose IQ was between 70 and 84) or borderline intelligent children as having specific learning disability. The Commissionerate for Persons with Disabilities too has said that doctors should recommend scribe, reader, or lab assistant or provide extra time as required taking into account the abilities of children in this category.

Against this backdrop, the Health Department should take steps to provide certificates to this category of students too.

Necessary instructions should be given to the districts authorities and children who possess valid certificates of the medical board should be allowed to sit for the examinations, the commission said.

Percentage of disability

An order issued by the Director of General Education on the basis of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act says that only students with 40% or more disability can be given special help. However, medical boards are not ready to specify the percentage of learning disability.

Taking this into account, the State Commissionerate for Persons with Disabilities has issued an order that even if the medical board certificate given to children with learning disability in State schools does not record the percentage of disability, it should be considered benchmark disability.

The commission said that students with many learning disabilities who were set to appear for the SSLC examinations this year were apprehensive about the notification issues by the General Education Department this year. So even if the medical board certificate did not mention the percentage of disability, they should be included in the category requiring special help and given consideration.

The District Education Officers should give a direction in this regard to schools, the commission said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/help-special-students-write-exams-panel/article31004653.ece
411,2020/03/07,Areas for all-night commercial activity to be finalised today,"Suggestions received by Mayor over two weeks to be presented at council

The city Corporation council will on Saturday zero in on the areas within the city where commercial establishments, including restaurants, will be accorded permission to function round the clock.

As soon as the State Cabinet announced the decision last month, Corporation Mayor K. Sreekumar had shared a post on his Facebook page, calling for suggestions from the public on the areas that should be designated as open for commercial activity round the clock.

The suggestions the Mayor received over the past two weeks will be presented at the council, where a decision will be taken. Several people have suggested areas like the cultural corridor of Manaveeyam Veethi; the areas around the Technopark at Kazhakuttam; Kowdiar-Vellayambalam Road; Palayam-East Fort area; and Shanghumughom and Kovalam beaches. Another suggestion was to turn the area around the Chakka junction into a night-active zone, as it is the first place that the visitors from outside see on getting out of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport.

Faulty street lights

One person even came up with a cheeky suggestion for a few places, saying that he would prefer these areas of night activity away from his house, as he wants to sleep peacefully.

Quite a few have expressed their concerns regarding the implementation while putting up their suggestions. A group of women posted that they have been finding it difficult to walk early morning in the Putharikkandam maidan owing to faulty street lighting. Ensuring proper street lighting in the areas chosen for the round-the-clock commercial activity is important, they said. Some others expressed concern regarding stray dog attacks at night, which, they said could dissuade them from coming out late at night.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/areas-for-all-night-commercial-activity-to-be-finalised-today/article31004645.ece
412,2020/03/07,Modern fish market to be opened soon,"It has been constructed at a cost of ₹3.32 crore

A fish market being constructed by the Tiruchi corporation at Kasivilangi in Woraiyur will open soon. Vendors at Puthur Market will be shifted to it.

The modern market spread over 1.5 acre has been constructed at a cost of ₹3.32 crore, funded jointly by the National Fisheries Development Board and the civic body. The civic body has constructed 32 retail outlets, seven for wholesale vendors and an area of 20,000 square feet has been allocated for auctions. The facility will also include a restroom, a bathroom and parking facilities for two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Space has also been earmarked for an ATM kiosk.

The project was mooted in 2016, but following protests by local fish vendors and opposition from residents on Kuzhumani Road, it did not take off. Now it is almost complete and will soon be inaugurated, Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian said.

The fish market is three km away from Puthur fish market near Thennur. Residents and nearby private clinics and hospitals had raised many complaints regarding lack of hygiene there. “Meat and fish markets are usually located on the outskirts, away from residential areas. This new market is located at a suitable location,” an official said.

Mr. Sivasubramanian said the fish vendors would be relocated to the Kasivilangi market within 10 days. “Work has been delayed for a long time. We will ensure that this time it will go according to plan. The vendors will be shifted within a week and demolition of the Puthur market will start within 10 days. The vendors at the vegetable market too will be relocated,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/xtnetb/article31007083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TYCITY-FISHMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/modern-fish-market-to-be-opened-soon/article31007084.ece
413,2020/03/07,Antique structure of old temple restored,"The temple had structures such as Mahamandapam and Agaramandapam linked to various periods.

A 1,200-year-old Sivan Temple at Thiruthalaiyur, associated with staunch devotee of Lord Siva, Rudra Pasupathy, one of the 63 Nayanars, has been restored by ardent devotees by retaining the antiquity of the 18,000 sq. ft. structure at a whopping cost of ₹3.8 crore.

Rudra Pasupathy Nayanar is said to have attained liberation by chanting Krishna Rajurveda Rudra Suktha daily, standing in neck-deep water in the temple tank, as per Periyapuranam, one of the Tamil literary masterpieces.

As many as 400 devotees led by D. Chandrasekar, 72, a distinguished alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology - Madras, floated Thiruthalaiyur Heritage Trust to carry out the renovation over the last four years and restore the glory of the once-prosperous temple, after securing the consent of the Archaeological Survey of India and Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department.

The work was carried out based on a conservation note prepared in 2009 by the National Centre for Safety of Heritage Structures functioning out of IIT-Madras.

The temple had structures such as Mahamandapam and Agaramandapam linked to various periods. The mandapams, built later, were made to rest on the earlier temple structure, exerting pressure on the inter-linked beams, and ceiling slabs.

In the past, additional roof courses were added, increasing the dead weight over the ceiling and causing disintegration of lime and mortar.

Due to this, there was constant leakage all over the mandapams and the incessant dampness precipitated the impact of the dead weight, according to the conservation note prepared by the experts.

In 2016, the Trust identified a Coimbatore-based Stapathi, Mariappan, and started the work by indexing all floors and columns. The restoration work involved reinforcing five feet concrete beneath each of the 16 granite columns and linking all of them.

The concrete roofs that were causing burden on the structure were replaced with lime and mortar. Ultimately, the structure has been restored without use of cement, steel or concrete.

The structure took about 20,000 man days for restoration, Mr. Chandrasekar said. “We are certain the temple will start attracting devotees in large numbers henceforth after the kumbabishekam slated for March 12,” Mr. Chandrasekar said.

In a fine gesture to the villagers, the Trust has also decided to renovate the mandapam of the Kali Temple in Thiruthalaiyur, Mr. Chandrasekar said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/9jq5c4/article31007071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TYCITY-TEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/antique-structure-of-old-temple-restored/article31007072.ece
414,2020/03/07,CM lays foundation stone for renovation of Kattalai canal,"It will be modernised at a cost of ₹335.50 crore

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, through video conference on Friday, laid the foundation stone for renovation and modernisation of Kattalai High-Level Canal (KHLC), a major irrigation source, at an estimate of ₹335.50 crore.

The major initiative is aimed at improving the irrigation infrastructure in Karur and Tiruchi districts. The project was sanctioned following persistent demands from farmers dependent on the canal, especially those in the tail-end areas, for removal of accumulated silt and modernisation of the KHLC as they had been facing problems in getting water for irrigation every season over the past several years. The demand has been repeatedly highlighted at the monthly farmers’ grievance redressal meetings in Tiruchi and Karur over the past few years.

The KHLC, a contour canal, carries water from the Cauvery river at Mayanur in Karur district to Thayanur in Tiruchi district, a distance of about 62 km, and irrigates 23,774 acres in Karur and Tiruchi districts. Of this, 20,185 acres are in Karur district and the rest are in Tiruchi district. The designed discharge at the head regulator of the canal is 411 cusecs.

The water distribution system was very old and needed repair and replacement at many places. Irrigation efficiency and agricultural productivity was affected due to wastage of water following erosion of bunds. The bed level of the canal has also gone down. Due to dilapidated condition of the regulatory structures such as shutters and sluices, equitable distribution of water to tail-end areas could not be achieved, Public Works Department officials said. Of the 174 such regulatory structures, 124 will be modernised and 25 rehabilitated.

Concrete lining would be provided for the entire length of the canal, except in leading canals. Some of the distributories of the canal and drainages at vulnerable stretches would also be modernised. Once the project was completed, the system efficiency would improve to 60% from the current 40.43%, officials said.

“We express our gratitude to the government for sanctioning the project acting on our demand pending since 2013,” said ‘Koundampatti’ R. Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, who had long lobbied for the cause. Karur Collector T.Anbalagan and farmers representatives were present at the Krishnarayapuram panchayat union office during the foundation laying ceremony.

ITI building

The Chief Minister also declared open a Government Industrial Training Institute building at Manikandam panchayat union in Tiruchi district. It was constructed at a cost of ₹4.83 crore. As many as 210 students from 22 surrounding villages are studying at the ITI. Collector S.Sivarasu and other officials were present.

Tangedco office

An office of the Assistant Executive Engineer, Tangedco, in Ariyalur district was also declared open by the Chief Minister. The office at the Jayamkondam panchayat union was built at a cost of ₹19.2 lakh. Collector D.Rathna and other officials were present at the office during the inaugural ceremony.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/zf1mwz/article31007063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TYCITY-KATTALAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cm-lays-foundation-stone-for-renovation-of-kattalai-canal/article31007064.ece
415,2020/03/07,ISL | Chennaiyin FC has the final say,"Despite losing the second leg 4-2 against Goa, it reaches the final with a better aggregate (6-5)

FC Goa gave it its all in the dying minutes and even came close to taking the match away from Chennaiyin FC (CFC). In the end, however, it was the visiting team that had the last laugh.

Despite the 2-4 defeat to Goa in the second leg semifinal of an entertaining Indian Super League (ISL) contest at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday, CFC progressed on better aggregate (6-5). With that, it reached its third final in six seasons.

Down 0-2 in the first half and completely outplayed by the host, Chennaiyin regrouped to equalise in the second session.

Goa made it a nervy finish with two quick goals from substitute Edu Bedia and Mourtada Fall in the 81st and 83rd minutes. With 11 minutes, including injury time, remaining for the final whistle, the home team still needed two goals to emerge triumphant on aggregate.

Goa applied immense pressure and had quite a few shots at goal, but Chennaiyin stood strong.

In command

The hosts had the bulk of the ball possession in the first half and ran circles around the visitor. Be it the long passes from Ahmed Jahouh or Brandon Fernandes from midfield, Goa created plenty of chances and came close a few times.

Goa went ahead through an own goal from Chennaiyin. A cross from the right from Brandon saw defender Lucian Goian head it into his own net.

In the 21st minute, the host doubled the lead with a doughty header by Fall off a free kick by Brandon.

Chennaiyin reduced the margin, seven minutes into the second period, through Lallianzuala Chhangte, who turned in a rebound from the ‘keeper after a left-footed strike by Rafael Crivellaro.

Crivellaro was in the thick of things again as his corner kick saw striker Nerijus Valskis powerfully head home. With that header, Valskis swelled his tally to 14 goals.

Failing again

Goa continued to fail under pressure in the climactic phase. This is the fifth time it has lost in the playoffs in six editions, including in two finals.

CFC retained its team while Hugo Boumous and Brandon Fernandes returned for Goa. Boumous, however, had to be replaced in the 21st minute after he sustained an injury.

Prior to kick off, Goa skipper Mandar Dessai received the league winner’s shield from Martin Bain, CEO of FSDL, for topping the league stages.

The result: FC Goa 4 (Lucian Gioan 10 (og), Mourtada Fall 21 & 83, Edu Bedia 81) bt CFC 2 (Lallianzuala Chhangte 52, Nerijus Valskis 59).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/k4hm4r/article31011213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08CFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-chennaiyin-fc-has-the-final-say/article31011214.ece
416,2020/03/07,Liverpool back to winning ways,"Posts a come-from-behind act against Bournemouth

Liverpool recovered from back-to-back defeats and conceding the opening goal on Saturday with a 2-1 win over Bournemouth to move to within three wins of ending a 30-year wait for the Premier League title.

Callum Wilson’s controversial early opener sent shockwaves around Anfield after a run of three defeats in four games in all competitions.

However, the prolific duo of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane quickly turned the game around and a heroic goal-line clearance from James Milner in the second half secured the win to open a 25-point lead at the top of the table.

Jurgen Klopp’s decision to make seven changes for Tuesday’s 2-0 defeat at Chelsea in the FA Cup had been questioned as Liverpool lost the chance to build some momentum heading into a big week.

Atletico Madrid visits Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday hoping to defend a 1-0 first leg lead and despite the enormity of that clash, Klopp only rested Andy Robertson although first-choice goalkeeper Alisson Becker was also sidelined by a hip injury.

Only disruption

The spread of coronavirus could have a big impact on the Reds’ title celebrations in the weeks to come with the possibility of games being played behind closed doors. But the abandonment of the normal pre-match ritual of handshakes was the only disruption to the Premier League calendar this weekend.

Liverpool’s dip in form has coincided with a lack of clean sheets for Klopp’s men after a run of 10 in 11 league games between early December and mid-February.

Defeat leaves the Cherries still in the bottom three.

The results: Premier League: Liverpool 2 (Salah 25, Mane 33) bt Bournemouth 1 (Wilson 9).

La Liga: Eibar 1 (Bigas 90+2) lost to Mallorca 2 (Dani Rodriguez 42, Kubo 78).

Friday: La Liga: Alaves 1 (Edgar 73) drew with Valencia 1 (Parejo 34).

Bundesliga: Paderborn 1 (Srbeny 73) lost to Cologne 2 (Mere 28, Hector 36).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fwhwur/article31010862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08LIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/liverpool-back-to-winning-ways/article31010863.ece
417,2020/03/07,ISL | ATK looks to turn things around,"Bengaluru will be keen to preserve the first leg’s advantage

Former champion ATK will look at history and hope as it prepares to meet the challenge of the defending champion Bengaluru FC in the second leg of the ISL semifinal at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Sunday.

Two-goal margin needed

Having lost the first leg by a solitary goal visiting Bengaluru the previous Sunday, ATK needs to win by a clear two-goal margin to secure its third final entry.

Bengaluru FC on the other hand just needs to ensure a clean sheet to make it to the title round for the second successive occasion. This will definitely spice up the contest between two of the most tactically sound teams of the tournament.

ATK head coach Antonio Lopez Habas does not have to look too far back for inspiration given that ATK’s rival had achieved it last year.

On way to securing its maiden ISL title, Bengaluru FC won the semifinal downing North East United FC 3-0 at home in the second leg, overturning a 1-2 loss it had suffered visiting the latter’s home in Guwahati in the first leg.

“There are instances in the past where the second leg result has determined the outcome. I have confidence in my players and hope they play to their potential,” Habas said.

“They (Bengaluru FC) are a much settled side having been there together for a few seasons.

“Ours has undergone some restructuring this season but still there are certain areas where we have proven our strength.

“We have to focus on what we can do best and get the result on our side,” said the ATK forward David Williams.

Concerns in defence

For Bengaluru FC head coach Carles Cuadrat there are some concerns in defence, the area where his team thus far has done the best conceding the least number (13) of goals among all sides. Left-Back Nishu Kumar is suspended while the doughty Spaniard at the centre of defence, Albert Serran, remains doubtful with an injury.

“We know we can go there and win the match. Even if we lose 2-1 or 3-2 we will be in the final so we will try to do our best there,” Cuadrat said putting faith on the likes of Sunil Chhetri, Erik Paartalu and Dimas Delgado, three names which have figured prominently in the team’s success so far.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/r5j36c/article31010852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08BROWN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-atk-looks-to-turn-things-around/article31010853.ece
418,2020/03/07,AIFF confirms postponement of India's World Cup qualifier against Qatar due to coronavirus threat,"A new date will be announced next week

Coronovirus continue to wreak havoc with sporting events as India’s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers match against Qatar scheduled for March 26 has now been postponed due to the spread of the deadly virus.

All India Football Federation (AIFF) General Secretary Kushal Das told PTI that the match against the Asian Champions in Bhubaneswar has been postponed and a new date will be known next week.

“India’s match against Qatar has been postponed. It will be played later this year but the new date is yet to be decided,” Mr. Das said.

Ask about the status of the match against Afghanistan on June 9, he said, “That match will also be postponed.”

Mr. Das said the new dates of India’s remaining World Cup qualifier matches will be known during a meeting between the AFC and AIFF officials in New Delhi on Tuesday.

“The meeting will discuss about the new dates of these matches, besides other matters,” he said.

World football governing body FIFA and the Asian body AFC had on Thursday proposed postponing all the upcoming 2022 World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup Cup qualifiers in view of the rising coronavirus threat.

“For both FIFA and the AFC, the well-being and health of all individuals involved in football matches remains the highest priority, and as such, a formal proposal to postpone upcoming matches in the Asian FIFA World Cup 2022 and AFC Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers will now be shared with the relevant member associations,” FIFA had said in a statement.

Already out of World Cup contention after failing to win a single game, India are also scheduled to play against Bangladesh (June 4 in Dhaka) and Afghanistan (June 9 in Kolkata).

The FIFA and the AFC had said that they will provide an update on these fixtures in the coming days.

The Indian team was to begin a camp under head coach Igor Stimac in Bhubaneswar from Monday but it has now been cancelled.

“The camp now stands cancelled. There is no point of having the camp as the match against Qatar has been postponed,” a source in the AIFF said.

Although the Blue Tigers lost their 2022 World Cup qualifier to Oman in Guwahati, they kept their chances alive after holding Asian champions Qatar to a goalless draw in Doha.

But last-minute draws against Bangladesh and Afghanistan followed by a narrow 0-1 away loss to Oman put them out of contention for a next round berth.

421,2020/03/07,"COVID-19: masks, hand sanitisers become scarce","Some schools issue unauthorised instructions making them mandatory for students

Even before coronavirus (COVID-19) has made its appearance “officially” in the State, a few items seem to have disappeared totally from the shelves of shops. Several departmental stores that earlier had whole racks of hand sanitisers don’t have the product now. The consumers who asked for the products were told that they were sold out.

The reason for this sort of artificial scarcity seems to be unauthorised instructions to schoolchildren to procure a mask and hand sanitiser. The children were told to secure the same as a precaution and to avoid last-minute rush.

“Two days ago shops were swamped by parents and schoolchildren asking for masks and hand sanitisers,” a medical shop owner told The Hindu.

Further enquiries revealed that there was no such directive from either the government or the Health Department. But some schools made it clear to children that they would not be allowed to attend classes if they did not have a mask and hand sanitiser. The prices of both products sky-rocketed with the sudden increase in demand.

The office of The Director of General, Drugs and Copyrights, in a press release, warned all medical shop owners not to sell masks at a premium.

Stock position

According to data released to the media, 1.37 lakh masks were available in 382 medical shops inspected by the department staff in the 13 districts of the State. The officials also recorded 3,492 hand sanitisers in the shops during the inspections.

Masks were sold at a premium only in Prakasam district. The shop owner purchased the face mask at 90 paise a piece and the product, “having an MRP” of ₹7.50 each, was sold was sold for ₹20.

Several consumers said that they had to pay up to ₹30 per mask so that their children could go to school.

General Drugs and Copyrights Directorate sources said that hand sanitisers were not in the drugs list and were “fancy shop” items.

While there are never enough masks and hand sanitisers for panic buying, there seems to be a scarcity in the market even before the onset of the epidemic, said a medical shop owner.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/9kta9k/article31004900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VJPAGEMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/covid-19-masks-hand-sanitisers-become-scarce/article31004901.ece

Post increase in number of suspected COVID-19 cases in the State, educational institutions are leaving no stone unturned to check health condition of their students.

Many private institutions are conducting awareness programmes for their students and the precautionary measures to be taken in the wake of suspected COVID-19 outbreak. A few school managements have sent messages to the parents WhatsApp groups to take precautionary measures and also tried to get face masks for their children.

On Friday, several private schools, especially play schools in the city, had conducted health screening for their students in which they checked body temperatures and if the children had cough or cold. If the body temperatures were found high, parents were informed. Engineering college managements also asked their students to take preventive measures while travelling in buses and auto-rickshaws.

Face masks

Students appearing Intermediate examinations have been seeking the officials to allow them to the examination hall with face masks and hand sanitisers, on the lines of Telangana government. Candidates say that the examination centre staff are not allowing masks to prevent copying.

“Hundreds of students attend the examination at every centre. Some are suffering from cold, cough. The government should allow us to take masks into the examination centre. I do not understand the problem here. They can thoroughly check the candidate before allowing them,” said N Rahul, an Intermediate student from the city. However, Regional Intermediate Officer B. Sujatha said that they have not received any instructions from Andhra Pradesh Intermediate Board officials. Unless and until we receive such instructions, we cannot allow students with face masks or sanitisers, she said.

Homoeo medicine distributed

Meanwhile, a preventive homoeopathic medicine was distributed by Dr. Umar Alisha Rural Development Trust, Pithapuram, to a large number of people, who took a holy dip at the confluence of the Gosthani River with the Bay of Bengal at Bheemunipatnam, in connection with Nrusimha Jayanthi, on Friday.

423,2020/03/07,People in a dilemma over celebrating festival of colours,"Majority of people are avoiding public gatherings

Increase in suspected COVID-19 cases in and around the district is likely to dampen holi spirit this year, in the city.

This festival to be celebrated on Tuesday. Though no positive cases are confirmed, most of the people are avoiding public gatherings to make sure they are not affected by any kind of flu.

It was learnt that several resident welfare associations have been planning to avoid holi celebrations and gatherings till the COVID-19 cases come under control, while a few have decided to carry on with their celebrations, as no case is confirmed yet.

“Though the situation is not as serious as in Telangana, but its better to avoid celebration for one year to avoid spread of virus, said P. Demudu, a resident of Murali Nagar.

One member of the AP Residents Welfare Association said that they are yet to take a decision on whether to celebrate holi or not. “However, we have stopped association meetings and gatherings,” he added

Shopkeepers selling holi merchandise at Seethammadhara, Poorna market, Akkayyapalem, Gajuwaka and a few others saw a very thin business on Friday evening.

However, they were optimistic that in the coming day or two, people would come forward to celebrate holi.

Chief Medical & Health Officer, GVMC, K.S.L.G Sastry said that public should take necessary precautions before venturing out to mass gatherings.

“It is better to avoid mass gatherings. Because in crowded places, the flu spreads faster. Moreover a person who has cold, upper respiratory issues should restrain himself from going to such mass gatherings to make sure that others do not get affected,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/rexb3e/article31004972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-VZ-HOLISHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/people-in-a-dilemma-over-celebrating-festival-of-colours/article31004973.ece

Similarly, the two cases from East Godavari district and one each from Vijayawada and Kakinada have reported negative, according to the State Nodal Officer for COVID-19, according to a statement issued by K. Rambabu, State Nodal Officer for COVID-19, here, on Friday.

The test reports of three suspected cases from Srikakulam district and one from Ongole are awaited, the release added.

District geared up

COVID-19, a disease caused by a family of viruses called coronavirus, is causing panic across the globe and India is no exception..

The reason – there is no specific treatment for the treatment – and those affected by it had to be given symptomatic treatment.

While social media has, no doubt, spread awareness on the disease and the precautionary measures to be taken, rumour mongers and ill-informed people started using the social media platform to spread panic.

The news of an Information Technology employee, in Hyderabad, testing positive for COVID-19, spread like wildfire and soon there was a scarcity of both normal and N 95 masks in Hyderabad.

The news had its ramifications not only in Telangana but also in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Parents of children, employed in IT companies in Hyderabad, grew jittery. They rushed to medical shops in the city to buy masks and hand sanitisers. The stocks ran out in no time and shopkeepers exploited the situation to cash in on the demand.

Inspections conducted

“Our Inspectors are already conducting inspections since yesterday (Thursday) and checking the availability of stocks of masks and sanitisers. We have warned drug dealers against charging higher price for the masks in view of the surge in demand.

“A leading pharmacy chain, which has 97 retail outlets in Visakhapatnam, has procured 10,000 masks today (Friday). The MRP of each mask is ₹7.50 and we directed them to sell them at MRP,” Assistant Director of Drugs Control Administration K. Rajitha told The Hindu.

“The purchase price of N 95 masks, which are imported, is ₹80 and they are being sold at prices ranging between ₹100 and ₹120.

“The inspections will be continued on Saturday also. Anyone having complaints on dealers of medical shops can call the Drugs Control Office in the city on the phone No. 0891-2552886,” she said.

Review meet

Meanwhile, Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V.Sudhakar and Superintendent of King George Hospital G.Arjuna held a review meet and apprised the various heads of the departments of the steps to handle the situation.

Additional Commissioner of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation Thameem Ansaria has said that observing personal hygiene and discipline will go a long way in keeping COVID-19 at bay.

Addressing a meeting to create awareness among the people here on Friday, Ms. Thameem spoke on the need to observe clean habits.

Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation Chief Medical Officer of Health K.S.L.G. Sastry said that anyone suffering from symptoms of cough and cold, flu and fever should report to doctors at the KGH or the Chest Diseases Hospital in the city.

425,2020/03/07,Love in the library: What books taught me about travelling,"You can explore the world by travelling. Or just by staying in a library, nose inside book

What I learnt about travelling, I learnt inside closed doors. I grew up in a small town in Rajasthan which didn’t have much to offer by way of entertainment. On school holidays, I would desperately search for ways to while away time. One summer afternoon, as I biked around idly, scouting for distractions, I noticed the pale-yellow building that flanked the town square, and recognised it for what it was — the town library. I went inside.

The library smelled of stale air and musky untouched paper. As I went around flicking off dust from the books lined in perfect order, a man’s voice interrupted: “What are you looking for?”

I kept quiet, feeling I had been caught prowling by the librarian. Noticing my trepidation, the voice mellowed: “Do you have a library card?” I shook my head. “Let’s make you one, then.” But I don’t have money, I said.

The man laughed, “It’s a public library. You can borrow the books for free.” He went to the desk and pulled out a box of yellow paper. Carefully, he filled out the details. There I had it, a yellow folded card with my name in neat handwriting on top. “Let’s show you where the children’s books are,” the man beckoned me to a corner of the library.

Faraway worlds

In this library, I first discovered Enid Blyton. I devoured her books over the summer, relishing the adventures from a world so different and far from mine. I wanted to travel to that world.

Just when the summer break was nearing its end, the librarian, perhaps impressed by the ferocity with which I was finishing books from the children’s section, offered a book. ‘It’s by Premchand. Read it. You won’t understand it now, but someday you will come back to read it again.” With that he handed me Godan.

Godan opened a world that felt as far from mine as Blyton’s; only, the characters of Premchand lived in a wretched world, struggling. I didn’t understand the story much and said so to the librarian while returning the book. “That’s okay,” he said, “as long as you become aware that this world also exists somewhere on this planet.”

School became intensive, and progressively the school breaks began to fill up — first, with preparations for the mighty board exams, and then for JEE. I stopped frequenting the library, promising myself I would return once I cleared JEE.

Across times and places

Years later, when I got into IIT Delhi, the first thing I did was search for the campus library. I couldn’t have been happier at finding this well-stocked haven. While filling my engineering credits, I picked Modern Fiction as well (a humanities course is a requirement at the IITs). When I look back at those years, what I remember the most is this course, which opened up the worlds of Joyce, Rushdie and Camus for me. Even as I struggled with my engineering papers, I was happily discovering and consuming their books. If my friends came looking for me, they knew exactly which table I would be sitting at.

In those four years, I read Marquez, Llosa, Naipaul and many others. Through their works, I travelled across times and places and philosophies.

It was with books from the library in my backpack that I first began to travel. I I started by exploring my surroundings. Every weekend, I would head out to Old Delhi, and learn about its overlapping histories. Then, I moved beyond the capital, exploring Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttaranchal — not just the famous destinations but also smaller places off the grid.

As I oscillated between the library and the road, my grades suffered. My batch mates were hitting GPAs of 8, while I was stuck at a lowly 6 — but I more than compensated the loss with the experiences I collected.

And when I moved to Sweden for work, one of the first trips I made was to Istanbul to explore the Bosporus that forms the backdrop of most of Pamuk’s novels.

These days I live in Malmö, Sweden. In my first week here, I found the modern glass-and-stone building of books with its floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the magnificent green stretches of Kungsgården, the royal garden. Now, after 10 years, I still spend weekends sitting next to these windows and reading from the vast English section of the library. And just over the Öresund strait is Copenhagen, with what’s perhaps one of Europe’s best known libraries — the Black Diamond.

Over the years, I have become a travel writer. When I ponder about what led to this, I realise that it’s all the books in all the libraries that gently pushed me to explore unfamiliar worlds.

426,2020/03/07,‘The stories had to be published so that I could clear my desk’: Upamanyu Chatterjee,"Upamanyu Chatterjee talks about his short story collection, ‘The Assassination of Indira Gandhi’, and possible future volumes, tongue firmly in cheek

The Assassination of Indira Gandhi: The Collected Stories of Upamanyu Chatterjee, Volume One, shortlisted for The Hindu Prize for Fiction, brings together 12 short stories from across the writer’s career, from the 1980s to the 2010s. The stories have varied themes — from the reflections of a Sikh boy on the futility of life in the wake of Indira Gandhi’s death to the farcical travails of a 17th-century English ambassador in the court of Jahangir. The collection is characterised by Chatterjee’s trademark black humour and acerbic wit, of course. It also provides a snapshot of Chatterjee’s development as a writer. In an email interview, he discusses the genesis of the collection and the research that went into the stories:

What’s the story behind this collection? What prompted you to bring it out now?

The publication of these stories was long overdue. As you can see, some of them date from 1985. I have been meaning to publish a collection for ages but each time a novel seemed to come in the way. Of course, many of the novels too began as stories that simply grew out of hand. So then I sat down after the publication of Fairy Tales at Fifty and looked up my notes and decided to write the stories that I had jotted down ideas for years and years ago. They had to be published so that I could clear my desk, as it were.

Some of the stories are set in distant eras. Can you tell us a little bit about the research you did, especially for ‘History Lesson’? The way different sources are used to contrast Thomas Roe’s view of himself with the implied reality is fascinating.

Thank you. Sir Thomas has stayed with me for years. Of course, the story is based almost entirely on his meticulously maintained journal, a priceless document, hilarious (though he himself would hardly have thought so). British historiographers don’t think so either. They always refer to him as the seasoned diplomat, accomplished ambassador, that sort of thing, though he himself devotes pages and pages of his diary to the importance of the governor of Surat calling on him first before he can get down to diplomacy. I have enjoyed looking at that famed journal from a different angle and giving it, whenever required, a twist or two.

The stories also span decades in terms of when they were written. How have your concerns and engagement with society changed over time, between ‘The Assassination of Indira Gandhi’ to later works like ‘Girl’ that deal with recent real-life issues?

Whatever real-life issues might mean! I write about what interests me and that isn’t always current affairs. In my case, it almost never is current affairs. One waits for the dust to settle down before one begins to sniff around a subject. And then again, one returns repeatedly to themes and subjects that one has dealt with before. That’s because they haven’t exhausted their interest for me yet. It happens to almost every writer. As for the rest, one can leave it to the reader to discern concerns in one’s work and the manner in which one engages with society.

The ‘Volume One’ in the title seems to be a promise for the future. What might we expect from Volume Two?

That is a closely-guarded secret! That is to say, I have absolutely no idea. Beyond the intention to publish Volume Two in the future, nothing is certain. To call the first book in the set Volume One is to remind myself that I have unfinished business at hand. I have notes jotted down but they don’t mean a thing until they are converted into something substantial. And if the question means, have I started work on Volume Two, the answer is, I don’t know! I don’t know whether what I am fooling around with right now will eventually be a novel, novella, short story or a reject.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/oh0l60/article30998428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08LRUPAMANYU2s,https://www.thehindu.com/books/the-stories-had-to-be-published-so-that-i-could-clear-my-desk-upamanyu-chatterjee/article30998429.ece
427,2020/03/07,The loneliness of long-distance runners: Jeanine Cummins’ ‘American Dirt’ reviewed,"Racy, yes; unputdownable, yes; but the new American classic it is not

First things first. Almost everything you’ve read about Jeanine Cummins’ American Dirt is wholly true, except that it’s the new American classic. This is a book you may merrily judge by the cover and in all likelihood you won’t go wrong. Fans of the book include Oprah Winfrey, who on January 21 declared it to be Oprah’s Book Club pick for the week, and Stephen King, who termed it “one hell of a novel”. On the front cover Ann Patchett declares she couldn’t put it down: “I’ll never stop thinking about it.” True, indeed.

This is inarguably the most unputdownable novel of recent times, thanks to a gripping narrative that reads in places like a Netflix thriller screenplay. Cummins is a gifted storyteller and the novel, spread spaciously over 465 pages, has one of the most unusual plots.

No punches

American Dirt is the story of Lydia Quixano Perez, who lives in Mexico’s Acapulco. She ends up paying a hefty price for her friendship with Javier Crespo Fuentes, an enchantingly enigmatic visitor to the bookshop she ran before she was displaced.

When there is a massacre at Lydia’s place, dutifully sponsored by the charming druglord, Fuentes, to maim her anti-narco journalist husband, Sebastian, Lydia runs away with her eight-year-old son Luca, leaving a pile of no less than 16 bodies behind her, only to be chased and tracked by the baddies. She plans to hoodwink them by trying to immigrate illegally to the U.S.

The book has already triggered heated debate in literary circles in North America and beyond for the theme it tries to address: (illegal) immigration, arguably the most political as well as personal issue to have hit humanity in recent history. Interestingly, as several critics have already pointed out, this is not a book about the psychology or philosophy of migration. Donald Trump can take it easy.

This novel is not going to make anti-immigration right-wingers undergo a change of mind and embrace incoming refugees. It packs no punches on that front. In fact, the blandest passages in the novel are those where Cummins places her protagonists in the immigration scenarios. The plot becomes predictable and the narrative trails, moving like a Ferris wheel short on power.

Frankly, if Cummins wanted to create a Grapes of Wrath on illegal immigration, she should have done a Steinbeck at the very outset — canoeing into the complex political layers of the problem by exploring the precarious and perilous personal journeys of the people in the story. Lydia seems way too weak to carry the weight of what’s happening to her.

The disconnect

She is described as rational, a voracious reader, and a philosophical person, but her actions don’t reflect all that. Quite surprisingly, Lydia seems like the creation of a male author, her thought processes and emotions male-imagined.

In certain places, Cummins’ prose reflects that confusion: “She thinks of going to Javier, wherever he is, meeting him outside the confines of the bookstore for the first time. She might embrace him, throw herself at his mercy, and demand an explanation. She might beg him just to get it over with. She might punch and kick him, pull the machete from her pant leg, slash his face, slash his throat.”

And Cummins doesn’t bother to explore the world of Luca — his traumas get overshadowed by stories of the cartel and of people trying to gain entry into the U.S.

That said, the novel is a racy read. It has the right formula for the age it’s written in — the heady cocktail of suspenseful prose, in-your-face narration, predictable yet curiosity-inducing characters, the jazzy non-linearity of events, the relentless cat-and-mouse game, a landscape where even the most mundane affair can be cocaine-tinged and smeared with thick, syrupy blood and the molten rivulets of human desire.

Cummins is a master at mixing all of them in the right doses, so much so that once you’ve finished reading the novel, you long for a Season Two, rather than wishing to ruminate over the catharsis you’ve just experienced. The disconnect is palpable. You know they are not you. Even if you are a migrant, an illegal one at that, this cannot be your story. You won’t have the luxury given to Lydia and Luca as they flee their home looking for a better world.

American Dirt stops with just being a good novel about a mother and son on the run. Netflix can grab the rights and create an exhilarating series in no time.

428,2020/03/07,"The man, the legend, the tash: Review of S. Hareesh’s ‘Moustache’","The novel is thought-provoking, if problematic. And it is slightly let down by an overly literal translation

I confess that I couldn’t quite finish S. Hareesh’s Moustache the first time I tried reading it in the original Malayalam. There was something a little off about the gender dynamics, and I don’t mean the ultimately innocuous throwaway comment about women going to temples, which whipped up such an outsized controversy that it instantly catapulted the book to fame.

I mean the way in which the rape of Seetha, quite early in the novel, is couched in the language of power and given to us as the protagonist’s perspective.

I mean the way in which the author’s avatar — a writer who, in a parallel narrative decades in the future, is telling his son stories about Moustache — at one point launches into a little eyeroll-worthy, woe-is-me aside about the unvalued existence of men. It’s evocative of a certain type of — moustache-twirling — Malayali masculinity that’s already fetishised far too much.

Mythic proportions

But this is all part and parcel of a story that revolves around the power relations embodied in the titular facial appendage. At a

time when we’ve been hearing about Dalit men being assaulted for having the temerity to ride a horse or wear a moustache, Hareesh tells the tale of a young Dalit man, Vavachan (aka Moustache), whose moustache assumes mythic proportions and becomes a character in its own right.

It makes its first appearance when Vavachan has a brief role as a policeman in a play, and it decides to stay with him. It/ he soon grows into a figure of power — and, for the upper-caste hierarchy, terror — as he becomes both hunted fugitive and living legend in the region of Kuttanad. Even his rape of Seetha plays, distastefully, into this caste conflict, as she is a woman of a higher caste who had earlier verbally abused Vavachan and his father. Increasingly fabulous local legends spring up in his footsteps, and at one point he tangles with the god of death.

It’s both as a story of caste and as the story of a land and its people that this book invites comparison with that other famed novel of Kuttanad — Kayar (Coir)by Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai. In many respects, Moustache is what Coir is not; the two complement each other. Thakazhi is all social realism; Hareesh’s fabulism knows little restraint. Coir goes into the evolution of the region’s human society in great depth, backed up by forbidding legal and agrarian research; Moustache makes the land, the living creatures and the waterways of Kuttanad come alive.

Coir is at its core an upper-caste tale of Nairs and Syrian Christians; it does have lower-caste narratives, but they are a little dissatisfying. Moustachehas well-developed Dalit characters in addition to the protagonist and narrates their struggles from their points of view, not through an upper-caste lens.

Jarring at places

The translation by Jayasree Kalathil is accurate but a tad turgid. In the translator’s note, she says that she hasn’t tried to imitate the lyrical rhythms of Hareesh’s writing; it might have been better had she done so. Some footnotes might also have been useful as there are a lot of untranslated Malayalam terms. The dialogue often lapses into a certain staid, formal English that’s at odds with the richly dialectal delivery you find in the Malayalam.

The literal translation of idioms is particularly jarring. For example, when the writer, accused of being a fascist, bursts out with, “His mother’s fascism!” — it’s an understood expression in Malayalam, but could have been rendered in a more idiomatic manner in English. And the very literal translation of Ponnuthamburan as ‘His Golden Majesty’ is a real howler; ponnu here is just a term of affection and loyalty towards the king, more ‘Dear’ than ‘Golden’.

In the Malayalam version of O.V. Vijayan’s classic, The Legends of Khasak, there’s a little exchange where a shopkeeper is asked for ice and replies that he doesn’t have any — but he does have water that’s even colder than ice! The humour of this comes through in a certain context, a certain dialect; Vijayan chose not to translate it literally when he rendered his novel into English.

429,2020/03/07,"Cows, cows, everywhere: An extract from ‘Love Jihadis: An Open-minded Journey into the Heart of Western Uttar Pradesh’","In Mathura, the cow’s legit grazing ground, a gau-rakshak explains what cow vigilantism has actually resulted in — a noticeable rise in the number of abandoned cows. An extract from ‘Love Jihadis: An Open-minded Journey into the Heart of Western Uttar Pradesh’, by Mihir Srivastava and Raul Irani

Sunil Singh’s car was following ours when he called me to find out where we were.

‘About to reach the ashram,’ I replied.

‘Are you in a black car?’

‘Yes,’ I said.

‘I’m in the car behind you.’

Raul and I pulled over and he joined us in our car.

We exchanged pleasantries. He couldn’t place me till he saw me. I had visited the ashram a couple of years earlier to do a story about how a certain segment of humanity is the cow’s biggest enemy. As we entered the ashram now, illuminated by warm sodium lights under the red sky of a dying day, our surroundings had an occult-like quality. I wondered, is this a temple to the cow? For sure, it’s a retreat or an old-age home for cows. In a state of general excitement, I began explaining to Sunil what science had to say, that cows and dogs, followed by perhaps the horse, were the earliest friends of mankind.

Sunil is a big guy with a stout, solid torso that supports an enormous round, balding head. He looks like he might have been a wrestler, though he has never wrestled. Sunil was barely five years old when he joined Ramesh Baba, the spiritual leader and founder of this ashram, in the late 1980s. Since then, he has been here, working day in and day out, and has risen through the ranks to become, for all practical purposes, the ashram’s chief executive officer. He shares some of his management responsibilities with two other influential men deputed by Ramesh Baba.

Sunil’s face glows in the fading light of the day. His menacing figure belies an affable disposition. He’s a vegetarian and does not consume any mind-altering substances, not even tobacco. He has a certain reputation in the region. People know him, and those who know him revere him. It’s the kind of reverence that’s laced with more fear than love.

Particularly in the Hindi heartland, with its patriarchal, feudalistic traditions, it is muscle power and grit that keep a set-up like this running. Sunil is capable of defending the ashram; he’s not dependent on the police like an ordinary citizen. The local cops treat him like a mafia man who can pull strings in the corridors of power. The chief minister of the day is eager to travel to the ashram to meet him and his guru, Ramesh Baba, who, Sunil informed us, was not well.

******

Sunil, it turned out, was not a diehard fan of Yogi Adityanath. It’s not that Yogi Adityanath’s cow vigilantism is not effective, he said. Gau-taskari or the smuggling of cows has come down. It is now 70 per cent of what it had been a year ago. But that means there are 30 per cent more cows on the streets in this region. Not that anyone notices it, for cows have always been around. You can’t miss them as they eat garbage and plastic bags in the suburban landscape, or stand listlessly in the middle of the road as if their journey had ended just there. The piles of garbage, the snake charmers and the revered cows on the streets of India have, in fact, fascinated visitors since the times of Rudyard Kipling.

Sunil was not happy about the rise in the number of abandoned cows. There’s a limit to how many cows he can accommodate in this ashram. They are abandoned like the widows of Vrindavan, left to fend for themselves when they are past their prime, just when they need to be cared for the most. They are sacred, mother-like, not to be killed for meat, but they are abandoned to starvation and disease. The inherent sacredness of a cow and the treatment it receives is typical of India, a country of glorious contradictions.

Sunil said that farmers are not happy with so many abandoned cows strolling around. They are everywhere, like pests, and they enter farms, trample on the crops and destroy them.

‘It’s a big problem here,’ he said. Some farmers, mostly Hindu, are then forced to bring in people who are part of the supply chain of the tanneries in the neighbouring areas. Mathura’s neighbouring district of Agra is a leather industry hub.

******

Two years ago, Sunil had told me that one or two cows are stolen every day. He carried out a bit of an investigation to learn who the culprits were. They were poor people, mostly Hindus. One of them, caught red-handed, was a Hindu boy in his late teens. He would sell the stolen cows across the border in Rajasthan for their hides. Each dead cow would fetch the locals at least a couple of thousand rupees — useful to run the household for a month or two.

This young boy was not handed over to the police. Instead, Sunil asked him, as reparation, to help in the construction of a local temple for a few months. Locals tend to carry out Sunil’s decree without protest.

Two years later, his version has changed a bit. ‘Both Hindus and Muslims steal cows,’ he said, more democratic now about the religious identity of those who commit this crime. Though, both Muslims and Hindus commit the crime, they have different roles. Muslims kill the cows and Hindus facilitate the killing. The economic benefits come to Hindus as well because they are the traders, while Muslims do the dirty work. ‘And of course, Hindus don’t eat beef. They kill those who eat beef,’ Sunil laughed. This was not funny.

He made some innovative suggestions that I’m sure he will communicate to Yogi Adityanath when he meets him next. One such idea is a subsidy on cow dung. Cow dung has been the main source of fuel for cooking in the Indian hinterland for centuries. Every part of a cow, alive or dead, is useful. Cow urine, for instance, has been found to be beneficial in a host of medical conditions such as diabetes, blood pressure, asthma, psoriasis and many more.

The father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, was categorical about cow protection. To him, ‘Mother cow’ was in many ways better than the ‘mother who gave us birth’, and therefore, he said, ‘Cow protection is the gift of Hinduism to the world’ and ‘Hinduism will live so long as there are Hindus to protect the cow’. Gandhi had a message which is now relevant for the lumpen cow vigilante groups, who don’t protect cows and kill humans. Gandhi had said: ‘I would not kill a human being for the protection of a cow, as I will not kill a cow to save a human life, be it ever so precious.’ In other words, the life of a cow is as valuable as that of a human being, but this should not lead to bloodshed.

‘No politician has done anything for the cow,’ Sunil said in Hindi. ‘They only do lip service, but there is nothing on the ground. Akhilesh Yadav did nothing, neither has Yogi.’ And then, he added after a long pause, ‘Ab tak (so far).’

Because there is no sincerity in the way cows are treated, there is a general decline in all spheres of life, Sunil pointed out, particularly the environment. The Yamuna is polluted. The natural systems are contaminated. People are dying early; hepatitis B is on the rise. Something is wrong, he said, sounding impassioned, as if something sinister were about to unfold in the land of Krishna. ‘Modi has not taken the time to do something for the river Yamuna,’ he said. The real gau-rakshak is not happy. ‘Yogi tries to be the thekedar of Hindus, but has only done lip service. Gau-raksha is only a political gimmick.’ Sunil was unrelenting in his criticism. ‘Nothing is happening on the ground.’

430,2020/03/07,Woody Allen loses publisher for memoir ‘Apropos of Nothing’ after backlash,"Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group (HBG), had acquired the memoir a year ago and was set to bring it out on April 7

Hachette Book Group has decided not to publish embattled filmmaker Woody Allen’s memoir Apropos of Nothing following a massive backlash.

Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group (HBG), acquired the memoir a year ago and will bring it out on April 7, the company said earlier this week.

Mr. Allen has become a subject of discussion over the resurfacing of the sexual assault allegations levelled against him by his step-daughter Dylan Farrow, journalist Ronan Farrow’s sister, which caught steam in the wake of the #MeToo uprising. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.

The company’s decision didn’t go down well with many, including both Mr. Ronan and Ms. Dylan as well as its own staff who staged a walkout in protest on Thursday.

In a statement, obtained by Deadline, a representative of the publishing house said the decision to cancel the book’s publication was a “difficult one.”

“We take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books. As publishers, we make sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard...,” the official said in a statement.

“Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others. After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG,” the official said.

It was reported last year that Mr. Allen was pitching his memoir to several publishers but but was rebuffed in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

Incidentally, Hachette’s division Little, Brown and Company published Catch and Kill, by Ronan Farrow in 2019, in which he wrote about his reporting during the #MeToo movement that led to the downfall of many powerful Hollywood executives, including Harvey Weinstein, over sexual abuse allegations.

Mr. Ronan, who had severed his ties with the publishing house after its decision, on Saturday thanked the company for listening to the voices of people who are opposing Mr. Allen’s book.

“I’m grateful to all the Hachette employees and authors who spoke up and to the company for listening,” Mr. Ronan tweeted.

Ms. Dylan posted a statement on Twitter and said she is in “awe and so very grateful” to Hachette Group’s employees for taking a stand.

“To each and every individual who, at great professional risk to themselves, stood in solidarity with my brother, myself, and with all victims of sexual assault yesterday: words will never describe the debt of gratitude I owe to you,” she said.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dw8t3m/article30972328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NYSPECIALSCREENINGOFIRRATIONALMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/books/woody-allen-loses-publisher-for-memoir-apropos-of-nothing-after-backlash/article31007460.ece
431,2020/03/07,"‘Irrfan Khan The Man, The Dreamer, The Star’ review: Kite runner to actor","A biography of actor Irrfan Khan by Aseem Chhabra harps on his love for challenges

A book about a person without a chance to interview the subject is a challenge that can be handled in many ways. Aseem Chhabra does it through interviews with directors, co-actors and by fleshing out synopses of prominent films starring Irrfan to take us through the actor’s journey thus far.

Chhabra, who spends time between Delhi and New York, met Irrfan in 2007 when the actor was part of a junket to promote A Mighty Heart.

While most of the press fluttered around Angelina Jolie who plays the lead, Chhabra was among the few to speak to Irrfan, who was a recognisable face in New York, as The Namesake was also in theatres at that time.

Chhabra’s interaction opened a window of communication with Irrfan that continued sporadically over telephone messages. Thus, though he realised he would not be able to get any interview sessions for the book due to the actor’s ongoing treatment, his tacit consent to it helped Chhabra get easy access to other interviewees.

‘Brahmin among the Pathans’

This is both a good and bad thing. We read with some surprise about the boy who preferred to fly kites than go hunting with his father, prompting his father to tell him he was a Brahmin born in the family of Pathans.

But the storyline that Chhabra embarks on ends abruptly. Much of this period is eked out from the actor’s television interviews.

The writer should have walked the extra mile to connect with members of Irrfan’s family to get a more nuanced idea of his early days. Especially because the segment about how his crooked elbow, broken during a fall while flying kites, affected his acting and his persona during his National School of Drama days, is such a valuable insight into the shaping of Irrfan, the actor.

Chhabra spends time delineating Irrfan’s key roles though his career — from roles in forgotten films to Haasil his first break, courtesy his NSD friend Tigmanshu Dhulia, who directed the film. Irrfan’s handling of this role would lead to Vishal Bharadwaj casting him in Maqbool. The rest, as the cliche goes, is history.

Mita Vashisht, Naseeruddin Shah, Mahesh Bhatt, Dhulia, Ritesh Batra (Lunchbox), Marc Webb ( The Amazing Spider-Man) are among those who talk about the actor and his work.

In fact this is where the book is weighed down with too much commentary and too little narrative. While cinema students may find much gold to mine, the Irrfan fan will find little about the man and his ways.

One aspect that does come through repeatedly is Irrfan’s constant and relentless search for new and challenging roles. This places him on a level all his own, as one of our finest actors who can deliver a character effortlessly, and also spring surprises in the adroit way he has avoided typecasting.

A word of praise for the cover. Much has been said of Irrfan’s brooding, hooded eyes in the book. The cover catches this spirit perfectly, giving us, much more clearly than the content, the man behind the actor. It’s a picture worth a thousand words.

432,2020/03/07,"‘Bombay Before Mumbai: Essays in Honour of Jim Masselos’ review: How the modern, cosmopolitan Bombay citizen came to be","A collection of essays inspired by Jim Masselos, whose work has done much to reshape the way historians think about Mumbai

There isn’t one Mumbai, there are several. Analysing how various classes and creeds have lived cheek by jowl, yet managed to preserve their identities, is important in understanding the city as an evolving organism and its role in a wider national context.

Many historians today are engaged in just this sort of activity, reflecting the so-called ‘urban turn’ in the study of modern South Asia. As Gyan Prakash has said, there’s a “growing recognition of the city as a spatial form of society itself – not simply as a place that contains social groups and relations, but the city itself as a structure of social forms and experience.” This is the task that Bombay Before Mumbai sets itself. It’s a collection of academic essays in honour of Jim Masselos, whose books, essays and pioneering research have done much to reshape the way historians think about Mumbai’s past.

For five decades, he’s written about the city’s hidden histories, coming up with new and valuable perspectives in the process.

The book is the outcome of a conference in Mumbai University’s Kalina campus in January 2017 devoted to using Masselos’s perspectives as tools of investigation into the past. Edited by Prashant Kidambi, Manjiri Kamat, and Rachel Dwyer, it explores the ambiguities, contradictions and tensions in the way Mumbai’s diverse groups negotiate shared spaces.

Divided into four themes, it reflects Masselos’s oeuvre. The book delves into how urban communities were historically reshaped in the modern city; the uniqueness of urban space and the ways in which it is perceived and experienced; how power shapes social relations; and how one form of power — that of nationalism — acquires dominance.

Thus, to take respective examples, Jesse Palsetia explores how Parsis in 19th century Bombay integrated into the broader urban fabric while retaining the weave of their unique interests, creating the template of the modern, cosmopolitan Bombay citizen. Abigail McGowan writes about how shops such as the Army and Navy Stores, Bombay Swadeshi, Kamdar, and Godrej and Boyce shaped an image of a desirable home in interwar Bombay.

Preeti Chopra delves into the contrasting nature of government and private charitable institutions. And Robert Rahman Raman investigates the shifting, sometimes tense, relationship between the Congress party and Bombay’s working class in the 1930s.

Diverse identities

Again and again these microhistories bring out the way in which the cores of diverse identities were preserved even as their external natures shifted. One sees this in Simin Patel’s essay on Parsi refugees and the making of Irani identity after the Great Persian Famine of 1871 — a side-effect of which was the establishment of the city’s famed Irani restaurants.

Other essays venture into less-known aspects of the city and its people. Ashwini Tambe shows how class and race brushed up against each other in his study of Kamathipura sex workers at the turn of the 19th century.

Vanessa Caru throws light on workers’ housing in interwar Mumbai, when there were significant interventions by the authorities as a result of the plague of 1896.

And Dinyar Patel focuses on the inventions and patents of the gifted Shankar Abaji Bhisey (including a ‘spirit typewriter’ for seances), exploring how he was funded by those such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Ratanji Jamsetji Tata. In an afterword, Jim Masselos writes about how, from his first visit to Mumbai in 1961, he began to develop ideas about the nature of urban space and its relationship with group identity. His wanderings around the city were matched by wanderings in the archives, and he also became ‘a student of the crowd’ in its secular and religious manifestations.

The templates and procedures he developed in the process, such as that of ‘integration and encapsulation’, inform much of the work in Bombay Before Mumbai. This makes it an entirely appropriate and welcomefestschrift.

433,2020/03/07,‘A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of V.K. Krishna Menon’ review: The politics of V.K. Krishna Menon,"An even-handed and balanced appraisal of Nehru’s envoy and defence minister, who was both an international phenomenon and a bundle of contradictions

When V.K. Krishna Menon died in 1974, among the possessions of this ‘evil genius’ of British imagination were 12,000 books, a ‘very large’ quantity of walking sticks, and a heap of toys. It is a passing line in Jairam Ramesh’s colossal new book, A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of V.K. Krishna Menon, and strangely doesn’t surprise the reader. For throughout its 700 pages, one encounters so many startling details about Menon — now remembered in connection to the 1962 China debacle chiefly — that even his eccentricities quickly become familiar. ‘Mercurial’ is a word often used for the man, and we discover in this meticulously constructed biography why this was never an exaggeration.

Voice of nationalism

While Menon’s eventful post-Independence career appears about 300 pages into the book and is of extraordinary interest, the preceding sections also hold much value. In our understanding of the freedom struggle we naturally learn of dynamics in India. But too little attention is paid to efforts by nationalists on foreign shores. In Britain, for instance, laws were more liberal than in British-ruled India, with the result that ideas could be expressed and published with greater freedom, rousing public empathy and holding a mirror to imperial claims of moral superiority. From the 1920s for two decades Menon served precisely this purpose, till he was confirmed as the voice of the Indian nationalism in the seat of the Raj.

Indeed, Menon’s pamphleteering in Britain caused the viceroy himself to complain in the 1940s about his attempts to ‘prejudice’ parliament and the press. “I do hope,” Lord Linlithgow wrote to his superiors, “you will seriously consider the expediency of seizing some favourable occasion to get him put out of the U.K.” The authorities agreed but noted that this ‘mischief-maker’ was ‘very clever’ and never said anything that ran him afoul of British law. In the 1930s, when with colleagues, Krishna Menon published a 554-page report on India, it was for the same reason that the British government could not proscribe the book at home, even though it was banned by Delhi.

Ramesh painstakingly chronicles this phase of Menon’s life, showing why by the time of his appointment as independent India’s envoy in London, there was already hostility against him abroad. We also learn, amusingly, that while he was under surveillance for years, partly because of suspected Communist sympathies (a suspicion several Congressmen shared), the British establishment was not always up to developing an accurate picture of their subject. A decade after he arrived in Britain, a report named him ‘Vrishna Krishnu Krishna Menon’ and as late as 1942 the Secretary of State believed he gave seditious speeches in Hindustani — a language Menon did not speak.

Mutual affection

Ramesh also reproduces exchanges between Jawaharlal Nehru and Menon, telling us not only about each man’s insecurities but also of their mutual affection. In 1940, Nehru wrote how Menon’s “nerves have never been his strong point,” and in 1949 he repeated the argument in defending Menon before Sardar Patel. Menon did often believe that the world was conspiring against him, and this tested everyone’s patience. “You do not need me... I must therefore bring things to an end,” he dramatically wrote to Nehru in another near-suicidal phase, despite the fact, as Ramesh notes, that he was a cabinet minister riding a wave of acclaim after handsomely winning an election. Nehru’s sister, herself no fan of Menon, thought him a ‘Victorian woman’ with moods.

Ramesh is even-handed and balanced in analysing Menon as well as acknowledging rivalries within the Union cabinet in the late 1950s and early ’60s, where the Defence Minister’s abrasive personality turned him also into an excuse to thwart Nehru. Menon’s ‘meanest and pettiest’ actions are frankly discussed, and there is no avoiding responsibility for his blunders. The sequence in the book on the liberation of Goa in 1961, which placed Menon at the height of esteem, and his near-immediate toppling in 1962 are fascinating, just as details of how the Finance Ministry’s intransigence weakened India’s defence position are most interesting.

What is somewhat disappointing, however, is that there is very little covering Menon’s family. His difficult relationship with his father is, for instance, unexplored, when this appears to have generated in him that lifelong feeling of inadequacy. In that sense A Chequered Brilliance is more Menon’s political life than a complete biography in the traditional sense. The absence of exact footnotes is another grievance. Still, the book is a massive achievement, on a man who was both an international phenomenon and a bundle of contradictions. As one of Menon’s distinguished contemporaries once wrote, “Even when he said nothing... he looked so superior.”

435,2020/03/07,The Sun brings out a fresh batch of sunspots,"The sunspots identified by researchers from IISER Kolkata herald the start of a new solar cycle

Sun spots are relatively cooler spots on the Sun’s surface. Their number waxes and wanes in cycles that last 11 years approximately. We are currently at the minimum of one such cycle. Amidst claims that the Sun would “go silent” and not give out sunspots for an extended period, a group from IISER Kolkata has shown that the next sunspot cycle has begun and the Sun has indeed spoken. Their results were published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.

From our safe distance of about 148 million km, the Sun appears to be sedate and constant. However, huge solar flares and coronal mass ejections spew material from its surface into outer space. They originate from sunspots, an important phenomenon that people have been following for hundreds of years.

Sunspots occur in pairs, with a leader and a follower. They originate deep within the Sun and become visible when they pop out. Their number is not constant but shows a minimum and then rises up to a maximum and then falls again in what is called the solar cycle. So far, astronomers have documented 24 such cycles, the last one ended in 2019.

Start of cycle 25

Following a weakening trend in activity over the last few cycles, there were predictions that the Sun would go silent into a grand minimum in activity, with the disappearance of cycles. However, a team from IISER Kolkata has shown that there are signs that cycle 25 has just begun. They used the data from the instrument Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard NASA’s space-based Solar Dynamics Observatory for their calculations.

“There has been a lot of controversy about solar cycle 25 stemming from observations of a weakening trend in solar activity over the past three sunspot cycles. This has led to speculation that the solar cycle is about to die and we are going to enter a grand minimum in solar activity lasting many decades. Some groups have claimed that this would give rise to a mini ice age and cooling of global climate,” says Dibyendu Nandi of IISER Kolkata who led the effort. “Our findings indicate that sunspot cycle 25 fields have already started appearing, implying that we are going to have a solar cycle. Speculation and predictions of a grand minimum are unfounded.”

Maunder minimum

Why is this so important to us on earth? After all the sunspots look small and are hardly even visible to us. Contrary to this, sunspot activity may be correlated with climate on earth. In the period between 1645 and 1715, sun spot activity had come to a halt on the Sun – a phenomenon referred to as the Maunder minimum. This coincided with extremely cold weather globally. So sunspots may have a relevance to climate on earth. Such links are tenuous, but definitely solar activity affects space weather, which can have an impact on space-based satellites, GPS, power grids and so on.

Solar dynamo

Given the high temperatures in the Sun, matter exists there in the form of plasma, where the electrons are stripped away from the nuclei. The Sun is made of hot ionised plasma whose motions generate magnetic fields in the solar interior by harnessing the energy of the plasma flows. This mechanism is known as the solar dynamo mechanism (or magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism). “Simply stated, it is a process by which kinetic energy of plasma motions is converted to magnetic energy, which generates the magnetised sunspots, giving rise to the solar cycle,” explains Prof. Nandi.

Because of the nature of the solar dynamo, the part of its magnetic field that gives rise to sunspots reverses direction when it moves from one solar cycle to another. This can be inferred by observing when the relative orientation of the sunspot pairs flip. Studying 74 such pairs of magnetic regions, the researchers find that in 41 the orientation corresponds to cycle 24, and in 33 the orientation corresponds to cycle 25. Thus they conclude that the Sunspot cycle 25 is brewing within the solar interior.

“Small magnetic regions and a few full grown sunspots with the magnetic polarity orientation that is expected of sunspot cycle 25 have already started appearing on the solar surface. This means that we have either already seen the start of sunspot cycle 25 or it is just about to start,” says Prof. Nandi.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fw62jb/article31010531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TH-SCISOLARFLARE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-sun-brings-out-a-fresh-batch-of-sunspots/article31010533.ece
436,2020/03/07,"Finally, India shares two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences","NIV deposits two genome sequences in public databases a day after The Hindu reported that India has not shared them

India has finally shared two whole genome sequence data of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

The two sequences were shared by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology. This news comes after The Hindu reported on March 4 that India has not shared any genome sequence data with the GISAID.

“We shared the two sequences with GISAID on March 5 evening,” said Priya Abraham, Director of NIV. “We had shared the sequences with GenBank [a public database] about two weeks ago.” However, the GenBank website mentions that whole genome sequences of two oronasopharynx (mouth, nose, throat) samples collected on January 27 and January 31 from two COVID-19 patients in Kerala were deposited in GenBank only on March 6.

The accession number of the two sequences is MT012098 (collected on January 27) and MT050493 (collected on January 31).

The two sequences were shared by Varsha Potdar and others from NIV. Dr. Potdar heads the Influenza Group and her “major interest is molecular epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory viruses”.

In a tweet on March 6 evening, Newstrain said it has “updated” the database with “two SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Kerala sampled at the end of January”. It added: “These sequences do not link very closely to other sequences in the tree.”

First cases

The three adults in Kerala who were found to be infected with the novel virus had returned from Wuhan. The first COVID-19 patient in India, a medical student who had returned from Wuhan, was laboratory confirmed by NIV on January 30. Two more adults from Kerala were laboratory confirmed by NIV within a couple of days.

Different from others

At this point, it is not clear why the sequences appear to differ from the rest in the phylogenetic tree. A virologist who did not want to be named said that it could possibly be due to sequencing errors.

“NIV should rule out sequencing errors or contact Chinese CDC to find out if these sequences are linked to other sequences in Wuhan and not deposited in GISAID,” says Shahid Jameel, CEO of the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.

Referring to the Indian genome sequences not closely linked to other sequences in the tree, Dr Chitra Pattabiraman from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru says: “There are at least two possibilities — sequences could reflect the variations of the virus in China or they could be errors in sequencing, which can be corrected over time. The former is more likely and this can be resolved by adding more sequences.”

Why study genomes

Studying viral genome sequences immensely helps in epidemiological investigations. “Sequencing the genome of novel coronavirus will help us to know where the virus came from and how the virus has spread. For instance, by sequencing the genome of the virus isolated from an Indian patient, it will become possible to know if the virus had come from China or any other country,” Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, Sonepat, Haryana, and the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences had earlier told The Hindu.

So far, 26 countries, including India, have shared 178 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with the GISAID. At 70, China has shared the highest number of sequences.

The other countries that have shared higher number of sequences are the U.S. (22), Australia and Japan (10 each), and Singapore and South Korea (eight each). Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia have also shared one sequence each.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/u2q9tb/article31010519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TH-SCINOVEL-CORONA2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/finally-india-shares-two-sars-cov-2-genome-sequences/article31010520.ece
437,2020/03/07,Imposing travel restrictions alone has ‘modest’ effect on virus spread,"Travel restrictions in areas that have been affected by novel coronavirus can only modestly reduce the spread of the outbreak, a new modelling study published in Science finds.

The spread of the virus can be reduced by cutting the transmission chain. This can be achieved through early detection and isolation of people found infected with the virus as well as by bringing about behavioural changes and raising awareness level in the community.

Even “sustained” restrictions on travel to and from mainland China by as much as 90% only can only “modestly affect the epidemic trajectory” unless combined with a 50% or higher cut in transmission in the community, the study found.

Shutting down Wuhan and imposing travel ban in the city on January 23 delayed the epidemic from spreading to other parts of mainland China by just three to five days.

Even when travel restrictions are as high as 90%, the epidemic in mainland China is delayed for no more than two weeks if concomitant steps to reduce virus transmissibility are not taken, the authors found.

One of the reasons is that by January 23 when travel ban was introduced in Wuhan, the virus had already spread to other parts of mainland China.

Travel restrictions to China introduced by several countries, including the U.S., and a reduction or suspension of flight to China by 59 airline companies have not achieved extraordinary results in reducing the spread of the virus outside China, the study finds.

There was an initial 10-fold reduction in the number of imported cases when travel restrictions from China were introduced. But according to the model, by March 1, the number of imported cases per day shot up to 170 and 35 for 40% and 90% travel restrictions, respectively.

The number of cases outside mainland China will “resume its growth” after two-three weeks from cases that had their origin elsewhere, the model suggests.

The reason: despite the travel restrictions to and from mainland China, a large number of people who were already infected by the virus have been travelling across national borders without being detected.

Of the several imported cases, a couple of cases could be “seeding multiple outbreaks” across the world, thus leading to an expansion of the epidemic. This was observed in the case of Iran, South Korea and Italy after mid-February.

“The concurrent presence of both travel and transmissibility reductions, however, produce a much larger synergistic effect visible by both delaying the epidemic activity in Mainland China and the number of internationally imported cases,” the authors write.

“Moving forward we expect that travel restrictions to COVID-19 affected areas will have modest effects, and that transmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic,” they note.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/imposing-travel-restrictions-alone-has-modest-effect-on-virus-spread/article31010490.ece
438,2020/03/07,"How wounded plants heal, survive","Creating injuries similar to what plants suffer took nearly a decade

It’s hard life being a plant! From pathogens and herbivores to unfavourable weather, they are constantly injured or wounded and their sessile lifestyle only adds to the trouble. Despite all this, they heal and survive. How did they evolve such a great repair mechanism? What are the molecules and proteins aiding it? These were some of the questions an international team of researchers set out to answer and have now found some interesting mechanisms.

Ability to repair

A paper recently published in Development shows that a protein named PLETHORA (PLT), which encodes stem cell promoting factors, helps in the regeneration of the vascular system at the site of injury. This protein binds to and activates the expression of another gene (CUC2). These two together increase the production of a plant growth hormone called auxin at the wound site. The combination of these proteins and hormones gives the plant the ability to repair wounds.

The corresponding author of the paper Kalika Prasad explains that the work spanned nearly a decade to create the right set of injuries mimicking those that plants encounter throughout their life and then hunt for the plant proteins that help in this essential quick fix. He is from the School of Biology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research at Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-Tvm).

“Though it was known that plants communicate within their different parts and with other plants during injury, not much was known about how they handle the injury. Though we carried out the initial studies on the roadside mustard plant, we noticed similar results when tested the using rice PLT protein too,” he adds.

Regenerating veins

It was seen that the injury healed not just at the surface but the veins regenerated too. “There was proliferation of the epithelial cells to seal the wounds and also functional restoration of tissue cells. The vein regeneration is very essential as transport of food, hormone, water, happens through it and any disruption may further hinder the plant growth,” explains Dhanya Radhakrishnan, PhD scholar and first author of the paper from IISER-Tvm.

Another interesting find was that these two proteins did not play any role in the general development of vascular system but stepped into action only during its injury.

“We were able to set up a mathematical model that gave us guidance that as the size of the wound changes the nature of the repair changes. The numerical simulations showed that after a particular size injury, the plant will be unable to regenerate or heal,” adds Anil Shaji from the Department of Physics at IISER-Tvm. He is one of the authors of the papers and has set out to uncover the physical processes like the flow of hormones that are involved in this healing process.

“We are now trying to find out all the different genes and pathways involved in the healing process and also the cellular reprogramming events. To decode if the day–night conditions affect this process would also be interesting,” adds Anju P.S., a research scholar and one of the first authors of the paper from the institute. The researchers hope that in the future these genes can be produced in surplus to create plants that can withstand insect attack and other injuries.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fosaat/article31010470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TH-SCIwoundrepairtif,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-wounded-plants-heal-survive/article31010471.ece
