0,2020/03/25,BWF should plan a timeline for resuming tournaments: Srikanth,"Says it’s challenging to re-set training schedule and goals

Former World No. 1 K. Srikanth, while welcoming the decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics, feels that the Badminton World Federation (BWF) should think of a timeline for starting its other tournaments which have been recently cancelled recently.

“It is a good decision as it is next to impossible to host the Games given the critical scenario across the world,” Srikanth told The Hindu.

Need for a re-think

“I personally feel that the BWF should have a serious re-think, once the situation improves and deemed fit for any sporting activity, about starting the tournaments which were cancelled in the wake of the coronavirus threat,” he said.

“I appeal to the organisers to wait before declaring the next possible dates of Olympics. There has to be a periodic, critical review of the situation before going ahead with the timeline,” he said.

Reflecting on the preparations, Srikanth admitted it will be a difficult phase in the run-up to the next schedule of the Games.

“For the last 12 months you have been tuning your physical and conditioning programme according to the original schedule. Now, you have to re-set the goal and plan these programmes accordingly. It is a huge task and a different kind of challenge for any athlete,” the champion shuttler, who once set a rare record of winning four Super Series titles in 2017 before scaling the summit of world rankings in April 2018.

“Right now, I am in Guntur with my family members and friends. But, definitely doing those minimum exercises to stay fit and appeal to all the citizens to adhere to the guidelines of the Government and stay indoors till situation improves,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/yrzsf8/article31167386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26BADMINTON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/bwf-should-plan-a-timeline-for-resuming-tournaments-srikanth/article31167387.ece
1,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | World chess body postpones Olympaid to 2021,"The Olympiad and the FIDE Congress, slated to be held in August in Moscow and Khanty-Mansiysk respectively, are rescheduled to the summer of 2021 at the same locations

The world governing body of chess, FIDE, has postponed the Olympiad, scheduled for August 5-17 in Moscow, to 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The global chess body issued a statement saying that the Olympiad and the FIDE Congress, slated to be held in August in Moscow and Khanty-Mansiysk respectively, are rescheduled to the summer of 2021 at the same locations.

“As you know, the Chess Olympiad is the most popular FIDE event, attended by thousands of people, including players, coaches, officials, and spectators,” the statement said.

“The mission of Chess Olympiads is not only to determine the sportive results but also to popularise our game and unite chess lovers around the world in this truly global sports festival.”

“At the same time, FIDE is deeply concerned about the growing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people’s lives,” FIDE said.

FIDE added that the decision was made after reading several World Health Organistaion (WHO) reports indicating the increase in the number of cases. The pandemic has caused over 18,000 deaths so far while infecting more than 400,000 people worldwide.

“Taking into account the reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO) indicating the constant increase in the number of cases worldwide, and given the IOC statement regarding the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games, FIDE has decided to postpone the 44th Chess Olympiad (including the competition for players with disabilities) and the FIDE Congress,” it said.

FIDE added that it will continue to work hard in order to support various chess activities, at the same time caring first and foremost about the health and well-being of the entire chess community.

Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy were scheduled to lead the Indian teams in the open and women’s categories respectively in the Olympiad.

2,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Indian among 100 patients in Sri Lanka,"3 Sri Lankan nationals tested positive on their return from India early this month

An Indian is among the nearly 100 COVID-19 positive patients undergoing treatment in Sri Lanka, The Hindu has learnt. Three other patients, who are Sri Lankan nationals, also tested positive on their return from India earlier this month, officials said.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

“All four of them are undergoing treatment and are stable,” Director-General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe told The Hindu on Wednesday. The Indian High Commission here confirmed that the Indian national had arrived in Colombo on March 12 on a tourist visa and tested positive upon arrival, but declined to share details of where the patient departed from.

As of Wednesday, Sri Lanka has reported 102 confirmed cases. Three of them have been discharged on recovery.

Based on the data published by the Epidemiology Unit of Sri Lanka’s Health Ministry, researchers at the Colombo-based Institute for Health Policy, a non-profit research institute focusing on public health systems and policy, have generated a graphic mapping the source of COVID-19 infections as of March 22, when 78 persons tested positive.

Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya, executive director of the Institute, said COVID-19 “remains still largely” an infection acquired outside Sri Lanka.

A majority of the infected persons are Sri Lankans who returned from Italy in recent weeks, followed by a few from the United Kingdom, Germany and India. This is apart from the first case declared by Sri Lanka in late January of a Chinese tourist who tested positive. She returned to China following her recovery. Only four out of the 100-plus cases reported in Sri Lanka are seen to be originating from India, but the information foretells a greater risk for India, the public health expert cautioned.

Noting that the cases originating from India, of one Indian national and three Sri Lankan returnees, were detected around mid-March, Dr. Rannan-Eliya, who specialises in health systems and policy both in Sri Lanka and globally, said: “During this same period, the total case count reported by India remained below 200. Such a high incidence in our arrivals from India simply does not fit the reported Indian case numbers.”

According to him, it “strongly suggests” there has been a “large undetected outbreak in India since at least early March, and the Indian authorities are failing to detect most of their cases”.

Further, he has recommended that Sri Lanka treat India as a “high risk” country when opening its airports to arrivals again. “Looking at how many of the arrivals from India were discovered to carry the virus, I fear that India has not detected over 80% of the cases,” Dr. Rannan-Eliya told The Hindu.

While being critical of Sri Lanka’s early responses — that didn’t include intensive screening of or an early ban on arrivals from Europe — he feels authorities subsequently realised the risk and took a series of useful measures. “I suspect we don’t have significant local transmission right now in Sri Lanka,” he said.

All the same, “the problem” in Sri Lanka too was that the rate of testing has been low and should be scaled up, in his view. The Medical Research Institute in Sri Lanka is the premier testing centre for COVID-19. “As of today [March 25], we have conducted 935 tests,” its director Jayaruwan Bandara told The Hindu. The rise in cases prompted authorities to set up six other centres, where about 400 tests have been performed, according to Dr. Bandara.

But to Sri Lanka’s advantage, it already has “sophisticated screening and tracing capacity” in place which has ensured that Sri Lanka remained Malaria-free, a status the WHO awarded the island nation in 2016, said Dr. Rannan-Eliya. “We are also hoping that in this curfew period any possible local transmission will get suppressed,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qgti37/article31093481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Lanka-Covid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-indian-among-100-patients-in-sri-lanka/article31168091.ece
3,2020/03/25,Netanyahu ally resigns as Speaker,"The resignation clears the way for a vote that could see him replaced by an opponent of the embattled premier.

Israel’s parliamentary Speaker, an ally of Benjamin Netanyahu, resigned on Wednesday, clearing the way for a vote that could see him replaced by an opponent of the embattled premier.

Yuli Edelstein, a member of Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, had refused to schedule a Speakership vote until a new government was formed, but stood down after the Supreme Court set a Wednesday deadline for the vote to take place.

“The court ruling constitutes crude and arrogant intervention of the judiciary in the matters of the elected legislature,” Mr. Edelstein said.

“I won’t allow Israel to descend into anarchy. I won’t lend a hand to civil war,” he said as the court’s deadline approached.

“I hereby resign from my position as Knesset Speaker.”

The announcement could pave the way for the opposition, led by the centrist Blue and White party, to take control of the legislative agenda.

5,2020/03/25,Sudan Defence Minister dies at Juba peace talks,"Mr. Omar had “suffered from a number of chronic illnesses,” armed forces spokesman Amer Mohamed al-Hassan said without elaborating.

Sudanese Defence Minister Lieutenant General Jamal al-Din Omar died of an unspecified illness on Wednesday while in neighbouring South Sudan for peace talks with his country’s main rebel groups, the military announced.

Mr. Omar had “suffered from a number of chronic illnesses,” armed forces spokesman Amer Mohamed al-Hassan said without elaborating.

The government delegation in the South Sudanese capital Juba said Mr. Omar died at 2:30 a.m. (2330 GMT on Tuesday) “after a sudden heart attack during the performance of his sacred duty”.

Born in 1960, Mr. Omar was named Defence Minister after the armed forces toppled veteran President Omar Bashir in a palace coup last April following months of nationwide protests.

6,2020/03/25,Istanbul prosecutor indicts Saudi suspects for Jamal Khashoggi killing,"List of 18 suspected killers includes team that flew to Turkey

Istanbul prosecutors said on Wednesday they had prepared an indictment against a close aide to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a former deputy head of general intelligence over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The prosecutor's office accused the two men of instigating Khashoggi's murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and named 18 suspects it said actually carried out the killing, which caused a global uproar.

Khashoggi was last seen entering the consulate on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. Turkish officials said his body was dismembered and removed from the building, but his remains have not been found.

Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing - an accusation Saudi officials have denied.

The indictment accuses former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence Ahmed al-Asiri and former royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani of having “instigated premeditated murder with monstrous intent”, the prosecutor's office said.

It says the others suffocated Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post who had grown increasingly critical of Prince Mohammed's actions, after agreeing in advance that he should be killed if he did not return to Saudi Arabia with them.

The list of 18 suspected killers includes a 15-strong team which flew to Turkey to carry out the operation, and three intelligence officials.

Saudi Arabia's media ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Suspects still free

Both Qahtani and Asiri were dismissed from their positions after Khashoggi's killing. Asiri was subsequently tried in Saudi Arabia but released due to insufficient evidence, a Saudi prosecutor said. Qahtani was investigated but was not charged. Sources have said he remained active in state matters.

In December a Saudi court sentenced five people to death and three to jail for Khashoggi's killing in a trial which a U.N. rapporteur described as a mockery of justice because it did not target those she described as the masterminds of the operation.

The court did not identify those sentenced to death.

Wednesday's indictment was based on analysis of suspects' phone records, their entry and exit into Turkey and presence at the consulate, witness statements and analysis of Khashoggi's phone and computers, the prosecutor's office said.

Khashoggi's killing, which Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said was ordered at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government, has strained ties between Ankara and Riyadh.

Turkey accused Saudi officials of obstructing investigations at the consulate, while the Saudis have repeatedly said the Istanbul prosecutor has not complied with their requests to share information.

Prince Mohammed has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdoms de facto leader. Saudi Arabia initially denied any involvement in or knowledge of Khashoggis death but later changed its position multiple times.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hc442m/article30380481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THLTJAMALKHASHOGGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/istanbul-prosecutor-indicts-saudi-suspects-for-jamal-khashoggi-killing/article31163649.ece

The spiralling number of deaths came as Spain entered the 11th day of an unprecedented lockdown to try and rein in the COVID-19 epidemic that has now infected 47,610 people, the health ministry said.

Across the world, only Italy now has a higher death toll than that of Spain. In China, where the virus emerged late last year, 3,281 people have died.

As the authorities stepped up testing, the number of cases showed a 20 % increase on the figures for Tuesday, while the death toll showed a 27% rise over the same period.

9,2020/03/25,Bangladesh releases Khaleda Zia from jail amid coronavirus outbreak,"The 74-year-old opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief is serving a 17-year prison term in two graft cases since February 8, 2018.

Bangladesh on Wednesday released jailed former Prime Minister and main Opposition leader Khaleda Zia for six months amid the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The 74-year-old opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief is serving a 17-year prison term in two graft cases since February 8, 2018.

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said Ms. Zia was freed conditionally on Wednesday afternoon on humanitarian grounds after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s approval.

Ms. Zia served thrice as the premier since 1991. Her party suffered a miserable defeat in the 2018 elections bagging only six seats in the 300-seat Parliament.

Her conviction on “moral turpitude” charges debarred her from contesting the polls.

She was sent to jail in February 2018 by a local court on charges of embezzling foreign donations meant for an orphanage, named after her slain husband and president Zia Ur Rehman, during her premiership between 2001 and 2006.

Rehman, a military ruler-turned-politician, was the founder of the BNP.

10,2020/03/25,Trump seeks S.Korea's help for medical equipment to tackle coronavirus,"In a 23 minute phone call, Trump told President Moon Jae-in he would help Korean producers obtain approval from the U.S. FDA for their equipment

South Korea said it will send medical equipment to the United States to fight the coronavirus if it has any spare after an urgent request from U.S. President Donald Trump in which he promised to help Korean firms gain U.S. government approval.

The news, which sent shares in South Korean manufacturers of test kits for the virus rocketing higher, highlights the diverging paths the two countries have taken since both discovered their first coronavirus cases on the same day.

After a big early outbreak, South Korea rolled out widespread testing within days, swiftly launching an aggressive programme to isolate confirmed cases and trace their contacts.

It won praise for slowing the spread of the disease with comparatively little disruption and just 125 deaths, and has brought the number of new infections per day to below 100 for the past 13 straight days.

The United States did little testing initially, and has been shutting parts of the country en masse, with fast-growing outbreaks in a number of states and thousands of new cases per day.

In a 23 minute phone call, Trump told President Moon Jae-in he would help Korean producers obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their equipment, South Korea's Blue House office said in a statement late on Tuesday.

Moon told Trump that South Korea “will provide as much support as possible, if there is spare medical equipment in Korea”.

11,2020/03/25,"Malaysia extends movement curbs, prepares economic stimulus as coronavirus cases surge","Malaysia has reported 172 new coronavirus cases, taking the total to 1,796, the highest in Southeast Asia

Malaysia will extend a two-week restriction of movement order and unveil a second economic stimulus package as the number of coronavirus cases continue to climb, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Wednesday.

The measures come as Malaysia reported 172 new coronavirus cases, taking the total to 1,796, the highest in Southeast Asia.

Also read | U.S. Senate, White House agree on $2 trillion Coronavirus rescue plan

Since last week, Malaysia has closed its borders to travellers, restricted internal movement, and ordered schools, universities and non-essential businesses to shut until March 31.

Muhyiddin said the curbs on movement would be extended another two weeks to April 14 as Malaysia had yet to see a decline in the number of new virus cases.

“I know you feel burdened but I don’t have a choice,” Muhyiddin told Malaysians in a televised address. “I have to extend the Movement Control Order for your own safety.”

The government will also unveil a “more comprehensive, people-oriented” economic stimulus package on Friday, Muhyiddin said.

The package is expected to be in addition to the 20 billion ringgit ($4.56 billion) stimulus announced last month to cushion the impact of the virus outbreak on tourism and other industries.

“Whether you are a taxi driver, a farmer, a restaurant owner... the government will ensure that you will all benefit,” Muhyiddin said, adding that food supply was “enough for everybody”.

The government also plans to carry out mass testing for the coronavirus in high-risk areas, Muhyiddin said.

Malaysia has recorded 17 virus deaths so far.

It has linked nearly two-thirds of its infections to a religious gathering last month near the capital, Kuala Lumpur, that the government says drew more than 16,000 people. The event is also linked to more than 100 cases across Southeast Asia.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ir6526/article31160624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKMALAYSIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysia-extends-movement-curbs-prepares-economic-stimulus-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/article31160625.ece
12,2020/03/25,"U.S. Senate, White House agree on $2 trillion Coronavirus rescue plan","The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits.

The White House and Senate leaders of both parties announced agreement early Wednesday on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.

The urgently needed pandemic response measure is the largest economic rescue measure in history and is intended as a weeks- or months-long patch for an economy spiraling into recession and a nation facing a potentially ghastly toll.

Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. It still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” Mr. Ueland said.

The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.

One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.

“After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,” said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a key negotiator. “It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation’s health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.”

At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public-health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month.

“We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought,” Mr. Trump told a Fox News town hall. He said he’d like to have the country “opened up and just raring to go” by Easter, April 12. But in a White House briefing later, Mr. Trump said that “our decision will be based on hard facts and data.”

Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections. At the White House briefing, the public-health authorities said it was particularly important for people in the hard-hit New York City metropolitan area to quarantine themselves for 14 days, and for those who have recently left the city to do the same.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said pointedly at the briefing, “No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.”

On Capitol Hill, five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress’ top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins.

Even before the deal was reached, news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday. The emerging rescue package would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined.

The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public.

A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency.

Democrats said the package would help replace the salary of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time.

“It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,” Mr. Schumer said.

Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies who retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax.

Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals, additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund, and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined.

To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue, officials said.

Mr. Trump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus’ march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the U.S. economy.

Even though Mr. Trump’s administration recommended Americans curtail activities for 15 days, starting just over a week ago, the president saids he may soon allow parts of the economy, in regions so far less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening.

On Tuesday, top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks, or longer. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July.

Mr. Trump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defense Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production. “We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,” said Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats.

Pakistan on Wednesday halted all domestic passenger flights to stop the spread of the COVID-19 after reporting nearly 1,000 cases in the country, just as Libya became the latest at-risk mideast nation to report its first infection.

The announcement by Libya’s U.N.-backed government leaves just war-torn Yemen as the last country in the mideast to not have a reported case of the new virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes. Already, health officials have warned of the danger of the virus spread in the Arab world’s poorest country, whose health care system has collapsed amid its yearslong war.

For most people, the COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

In Pakistan, the domestic flight ban will begin on Thursday, civil aviation spokesman Abdul Sattar Khokhar said. Islamabad previously cut train service and international flights.

Initially, most of those infected were Pakistani pilgrims returning from neighboring hard-hit Iran, which has seen the Mideast’s worst outbreak of the virus. Now, however, the virus is being reported in people who had no travel history, officials say.

Authorities in Iran reported another 122 deaths on Tuesday, bringing the total number of the country’s fatalities to more than 1,900 amid more than 24,800 confirmed cases. There are some 33,000 confirmed cases overall in the region.

In Libya, officials say a 73-year-old man who crossed into Libya from neighboring Tunisia on March 5 became the large North African country’s first recorded case. The Libyan patient had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia, according to the National Center for Disease Control, and was receiving medical treatment for his fever and cough in isolation at a Tripoli hospital.

The confirmation of Libya’s first case, three weeks after the patient’s arrival in the country, poses a test for its fragile medical system.

Attempts at a nationwide disease protection program have been undermined by the country’s division between two rival governments, in the east and west of the country, and a patchwork of armed groups supporting either administration. Even on Tuesday, Tripoli’s suburbs came under heavy fire as the United Nations appealed for a freeze in fighting so authorities could focus on preventing the spread of the coronavirus.

Meanwhile in Egypt, Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly told reporters that the 11-hour nationwide curfew from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. would go into effect Wednesday, during which public transportation would also come to a halt. Egypt has confirmed 402 cases and 22 fatalities, including two senior",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5beox2/article31140809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKPAKISTAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-pakistan-halts-domestic-passenger-flights/article31160217.ece
14,2020/03/25,25 dead as gunmen attack Sikh gurudwara in Afghanistan,"Within hours, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack

A lone Islamic State gunman rampaged through a Sikh house of worship in the heart of the Afghan capital, Kabul, on March 25, killing 25 worshippers and wounding eight, Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry said.

The gunman held many of the worshippers hostage for several hours as Afghan special forces, helped by international troops, tried to clear the building. At least one of the dead was a child.

Within hours, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack.

As the siege ended, the Afghan special forces rescued at least 80 worshippers who had been trapped inside the Sikh house of worship, known as Gurdwara, as the gunman lobbed grenades and fired his automatic rifle into the crowd, the Ministry said.

Earlier, Afghan lawmaker Narindra Singh Khalsa said he rushed over to help after receiving a call from a worshipper inside the Gurdwara telling him of the attack. There were about 150 worshippers inside the Gurdwara at the time, he added.

The SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks militant postings and groups, said IS had claimed responsibility for the attack on the group’s Aamaq media arm.

At a Kabul hospital, Mohan Singh, who was in the Gurdwara when the attack began, said he first heard the sound of gunshots and ducked for cover under a table. Later he heard the sounds of explosions, adding that he believes they were hand grenades. He was injured when parts of the ceiling fell on him.

In photographs shared by the Interior Ministry, about a dozen children were seen being rushed out of the Gurdwara by Afghan special forces, many of them barefoot and crying.

As the news of the attack first broke on Wednesday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed tweeted that the Taliban were not involved. Earlier this month, Afghanistan’s IS affiliate struck a gathering of minority Shiite Muslims in Kabul, killing 32 people.

Afghanistan’s National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib condemned the attack in a tweet while neighboring Pakistan and India both issued statements of condemnation. Pakistan described the attack as “heinous.”

""Such despicable acts have no political, religious or moral justification and must be rejected outright,” the Pakistani Foreign Ministry statement said.

India said the attack was particularly egregious coming as Afghanistan sought to deal with the growing coronavirus pandemic.

""Such cowardly attacks on the places of religious worship of the minority community,” India said, reflect the “diabolical mindset of the perpetrators and their backers.”

Sikhs have suffered widespread discrimination in the conservative Muslim country and have also been targeted by Islamic extremists. Under Taliban rule in the late 1990s, they were asked to identify themselves by wearing yellow armbands, but the rule was not enforced. In recent years, large numbers of Sikhs and Hindus have sought asylum in India, which has a Hindu majority and a large Sikh population.

In July 2018, a convoy of Sikhs and Hindus was attacked by an Islamic State suicide bomber as they were on their way to meet Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in the eastern city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province. Nineteen people were killed in that attack.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nzdvyn/article31159961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KABULATTACK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/11-dead-as-gunmen-attack-sikh-gurudwara-in-afghanistan/article31159962.ece

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said a tsunami watch was issued for the state of Hawaii, while another agency, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, said the quake had potential to generate a destructive tsunami.

“Tsunami waves are forecast to be less than 0.3 meters above the tide level,” the center said in its advisory about risks to the coasts of Hawaii, Japan, Russia and the Pacific islands of Midway, the Northern Marianas and Wake Island.

The height is equivalent to just under a foot.

The Japan Meteorological Association warned against slight tidal changes but said no warnings or even watch advisories had been issued.

20,2020/03/25,U.S. could become virus epicentre: WHO,"Trump says he wants to reopen the country for business in weeks, not months; U.K. enforces lockdown

The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday that the U.S. could become the global epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Britain joined the ranks of countries in lockdown to try to hold back the virus, and data showed business activity collapsing from Australia and Japan and Western Europe at a record pace in March, with the U.S. showing expected to be just as dire.

But amid the gathering gloom, the Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus was first identified in December, said it would lift travel restrictions on people leaving the region as the epidemic eases there.

Confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world exceeded 3,77,000 across 194 countries and territories as of early Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, more than 16,500 of them fatal.

‘Very large acceleration’

WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said there had been a “very large acceleration” in infections in the U.S.

Over the previous 24 hours, 85% of new cases were in Europe and the U.S., and of those, 40% were in the U.S. As of Monday, the virus had infected more than 42,000 people there, killing at least 559.

Asked whether the U.S. could become the new epicentre, Ms. Harris said: “We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the U.S. So it does have that potential.”

Some U.S. state and local officials have decried a lack of coordinated federal action, saying that having localities act on their own has put them in competition for supplies.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he was considering how to restart business life when a 15-day shutdown ends next week.

“America will again and soon be open for business,” Mr. Trump told a White House news conference on Monday. “We are not going to let it turn into a long-lasting financial problem.”

“We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems.”

Of the top 10 countries by case numbers, Italy has reported the highest fatality rate, at around 10%, which at least partly reflects its older population. The fatality rate globally is around 4.3%, though national figures can vary widely according to how much testing is done.

21,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | China to lift travel curbs on 50 million people in Hubei,"Healthy residents would be allowed to leave the province

China announced on Tuesday that a lockdown would be lifted on more than 50 million people in central Hubei province, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year.

But fears rose over a second wave of infections in the country fuelled by people arriving from overseas.

After two months living with draconian curbs on daily life, residents will be allowed to leave Hubei from midnight on Tuesday if healthy, said provincial authorities.

Restrictions till April 7

Wuhan city — the initial epicentre of the outbreak — will end restrictions from April 8.

Hubei ordered the shutdown in January but has been gradually easing rules and permitting people to move about within the province and return to work.

People who wish to travel in or out of Hubei or Wuhan will be able to as long as they have a “green” health code issued by authorities, but schools will remain closed.

Three airports in the province will resume flights from Wednesday, state broadcaster CCTV reported.

“I’m super happy,” Hubei native Zoe Wang told AFP. “I’m going to be able to go back and see my parents.”

From a mother unable to smell her baby’s nappy to a lawmaker who suddenly could not taste food, some COVID-19 patients have described a loss of olfactory senses — and experts say this might be a new way to detect the virus.

Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists in Britain, the U.S. and France have noted a growing number of patients in recent weeks with anosmia — the abrupt loss of smell — and have said this could be a sign of COVID-19 in people who otherwise appear well.

The World Health Organisation lists the most common signs of COVID-19 as fever, tiredness and dry cough.

In Britain, ENT doctors have urged health authorities to advise people with a sudden loss of smell or taste to self-isolate even if they have no other symptoms. “Anything we can do to delay transmission is absolutely vital,” Claire Hopkins, the president of the British Rhinological Society, told AFP.

Ms. Hopkins, who published an open letter on the issue on Friday with ENT U.K. chief Nirmal Kumar, said she was not surprised when she heard initial reports from Iran and France of COVID-19 patients reporting a loss of smell.

Musician Cy Tucker, 76, who previously played with The Beatles, has passed from coronavirus.

The Liverpool Echo reports that the rocker fell ill with COVID-19 symptoms a week ago before dying at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on Monday, reports dailymail.co.uk.

He is believed to be the first person to die of the fatal virus in Liverpool. It was confirmed that he had previously suffered with ill health, including diabetes and heart problems, and due to his age was considered to be at high risk.

Speaking to the portal, Tucker’s family said: “As a family we are devastated at the sudden loss of our husband, father-in-law, granddad, brother and friend who touched so many lives through music. To the city of Liverpool he was Cy Tucker, but to us he was our world. He forever doted on his family, especially his wife, children and grandchildren, who he always showered with affection...”

“Despite the pain and sadness, we have been comforted by the endless amount of messages we have received from those who watched him perform in many of Liverpool’s pubs and clubs for over 60 years,” they said.

“Performing on stage, be it big or small, was his great passion and he would never be afraid to get up and sing, even on family holidays,” they concluded.

Tucker was famously part of the “Merseybeat scene”, where he rubbed shoulders with a host of the most iconic stars to come out of the northern city.

24,2020/03/25,Poetry in the times of Covid-19,"The pandemic has inspired people to pause and reflect

Much is being written about this virus that “binds us, but holds us apart”. People have taken to verse to express their new realities and the internet abounds with poetry — on this new lifestyle that has taught us not to take anything for granted, this new quietude we are very unused to.

#coronapoetry and covid19 poetry are trending on social media. Instagram has poets’ communities from around the world versifying by the minute about the challenges the virus has thrown up — isolation, quarantine, sickness and loneliness. Many, however, also look at it as an opportunity to slow down and savour life, one day at a time.

Irish priest, Brother Richard Hendrick’s poem Lockdown is one such. It went viral, as the world resonated with it. He speaks of the birds that have begun to sing again and of skies that have turned blue again. He shared it as a FaceBook post on March 13 and it starts thus:

“Yes there is fear.

Yes there is isolation.

Yes there is panic buying.

Yes there is sickness.

Yes there is even death.

But,

They say that in Wuhan after so many years of noise

You can hear the birds again....”

The BBC Radio broadcast it as a plea to pause, listen and reflect.

“Humans have always had their own ways to cope with disaster and literature and poetry have always been born out of great suffering,” says Bhaskaran Bara, artist, writer and poet. “Now, we have the facility to air our haikus and verses instantly as they occur to us.”

British poet Simon Armitage in a poem, (also titled 'Lockdown') remembers the villagers of Eyam in Derbyshire, who locked themselves up during the 17th century outbreak of plague:

“And I couldn’t escape the waking dream

of infected fleas

In the warp and weft of soggy cloth

By the tailor’s hearth...”

Actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote a few lines in Hindi, urging people to stay safe.

“In times such as these, we all have our coping methods. Poetry is mine,” says Aditya Jadhav, who runs a digital marketing company and poet. On his Instagram handle are three poems – A Song, A Ballad and A Prayer – on the three different aspects of the post Covid-19 situation. While ‘A Song’ is hopeful, stating that it took a calamity to make us appreciate simple things about life, ‘A Ballad’ is an ode to the healthcare professionals who work tirelessly. The last in the series is an impassioned prayer to the universe to lend us strength to tide over these troubled times:

“He captured the world, every village

every city

Invincible and dangerous than

anybody has ever been

But little did he know of the secret

army

The army of heroes clad in white and green...”

Any art can help you tackle the gloom, says Meena Shaktivanam, who has been putting up stories, songs and limericks on Instagram for children who have to stay indoors this vacation. Her Kunjiamoomma stories have been made for “corona times”, she says.

Poet Jeena Mary Chacko from Bangalore writes in her poetic FB post that the “Great Isolation” has taught her a few things about life:

“That I long for things to go back to normal. I long for my workstation, my routine, the white board, my purple markers and the wooden duster I keep in my desk....That life is persistent and relentless ....That uncertainty is the only constant.”

Ultimately, it is about taking a re-look at your priorities, says Kristin Flyntz in her poem, “An imagined letter from Covid 19 to Humans,” which was shared over 27,000 times on social media and is still being passed around. In it, she writes:

“Despite what you might think or feel, we are not the enemy

We are messenger. We are Ally. We are a balancing force

We are asking you.

25,2020/03/25,"Acclaimed photographer Nemai Ghosh, who documented Satyajit Ray at work, passes away at 86","His photographs had a distinct style and those of the maestro reflected a rare intimacy

Widely acclaimed photographer Nemai Ghosh passed away in Kolkata on March 25. He was 86 and unwell after a recent surgery.

Ghosh, who was the official photographer of legendary film-maker Satyajit Ray, documented ordinary people, artist painters and musicians over the past five decades. His black and white photographs had a distinct style and those of the maestro reflected a rare intimacy.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed condolences over his demise and called it an irreparable loss for the world of photography. Recipient of the Padma Shri award in 2010, Ghosh had authored many books, such as Satyajit Ray at 70 (1991), Satyajit Ray: A Vision of Cinema (2005) and Manik-Da: Memories of Satyajit Ray (2011).

Ghosh was introduced to Ray by actor Robi Ghosh on the sets of his film Goope Gyne Baagha Byne in 1969. He documented the maestro at work till Ray passed away in 1992.

After Ray’s demise, he dedicated his energies to other areas, and the landscape of the city he lived was a recurrent theme in his photographs. The black and white images in his collection Nemai Ghosh Kolkata (2014) are a rich tribute to the city. He also documented tribal life in Bastar in Chattishgarh, Kutch in Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh.

His photographs have been exhibited at numerous galleries in Kolkata and beyond, including at a permanent exhibition at St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata. Recently, his collection of photographs on Ray was exhibited at the renovated Currency Building in the city. The exhibition at the monument that was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year was titled Satyajit Ray, The Man, His Films & The City.

Madhuja Mukherjee, professor of Film Studies at Jadavpur University, said Ghosh created or introduced a culture of “director-oriented documentation, which was a remarkable shift from the star-centric production stills of the earlier period”.

“He also recorded the process of film shooting, which is valuable for film history, and he was able to conjure a style particularly focussing on Ray,” Prof. Mukherjee added.

She pointed out that it was difficult to find directors at work from the same period, particularly the likes of Guru Duttor Mehboob Khan. “In most cases, they (Guru Dutta and Mehboob Khan) are seen posing, while Ray is principally seen in action,” she added.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gjgx9w/article31162185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEMAIGHOSH,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/acclaimed-photographer-nemai-ghosh-who-documented-satyajit-ray-at-work-passes-away-at-86/article31162186.ece
26,2020/03/25,How the small screen is working sans any regulation in Kerala,"Guidelines for television content is more honoured in the breach than in the observance in the case of Malayalam channels

Tragedy porns, soap sagas and reality shows have become the staple of Malayalam television. Viewer fatigue might have forced television channels to take a hiatus from certain kinds of reality shows and jaded themes. But that, for sure, is going to be a mini-break and the programmes are sure to return in glittering new formats. Meanwhile, programme heads are furiously reworking old favourites and remodelling some worn-out staples of international channels for Malayali audiences. Some of the serials have even been given titles of yesteryear hits of Malayalam cinema. Originality is perhaps a rare phenomenon on our small screen. The series, serials and programmes on the small screen have been cruising along sans any regulations or guidelines that are enforced on cinema.

However, recently, an episode in a reality show on a leading private channel, in which one of the participants had applied chilli paste on a fellow participant’s eyes, raised a hue and cry. Eventually, the sadistic participant was thrown out of the show and that created an uproar among a section of viewers. Moreover, to add insult to injury, while many in Kerala were trying to conform to the government’s directive to maintain social distancing to contain the coronavirus outbreak, a crowd that gathered at the Cochin International Airport to receive the unconscionable misogynist who had been evicted from the show shocked and angered many. The State government immediately took action against those assembled there and the contestant was arrested and so were some of his supporters.

The incident and the profusion of misogynistic sob sagas, serials promoting superstition, inappropriate content for children and talk shows involving children have raised questions about the need to take a closer look at what is being telecast on the idiot box.

“Actually, most of the channels seem to be in the dark about a broadcasting code that is universally followed. BBC has a regulatory authority called Office of Communications (Ofcom), the government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the broadcasting industry in the UK. There are very strict guidelines by Federal Communications Commission in the US, European Broadcasting Union and so on. In India, the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council looks into complaints about content telecast on TV channels. Programmes are supposed to adhere to the Indian Broadcasting Foundation’s Self Regulatory Guidelines as well as Programming Code. So, when these private television channels apply for licensing, all of them give an undertaking that they will follow the existing guidelines in the country, which includes a code for broadcasting, one for commercials on the channel and so on, which is all very detailed and they also pay a bank guarantee and undertake that the guidelines will be followed in letter and spirit. Unfortunately, none of the private channels do that. Either they are not aware of it or the guidelines are pretty loose,” explains K Kunhikrishnan, former Additional Director General of Doordarshan and the first director of Doordarsan in Kerala.

He adds that private channels “operate only for commercial gains and influence-peddling. So, normally, the government in power ignores it. But there is a limit to which the government can ignore this. There must be some mechanism to oversee what goes on in the name of entertainment, infotainment, news and news-based programmes on television screens. Television monitoring systems are expected to be followed at the State level but I am not aware of any such committee in Kerala. In 2017, the Supreme Court had directed that the media monitoring committees should be made operational. But nothing is followed here. One does not have unfettered freedom to say anything about anybody, and right now, there are many programmes that get away with murder,” he adds.

Asha Joseph, Dean of Cinema and Television Studies at Sacred Hearts College, Thevara, and a former TV producer, says the history of television can be divided into two: the Nehruvian and after. Till the nineties, television channels, even Asianet, the first one in Kerala to come up in the private sector, existed in the Nehruvian era and followed socialist ideals and a progressive, developmental agenda.

“But by the late nineties, all that vanished and now the only aim of every channel is to make money and win TRP ratings at any cost. Everything else has been thrown to the wind. There is no social responsibility or ethics followed and, unlike cinema, which is subject to several restrictions, television seems to be a free for all. There is not even an effort to encourage a scientific temper. The kind of violence that is shown on screen towards children and inappropriate content involving children are shocking. The less said about the so-called programmes for children and involving children, the better. By telecasting sob sagas, channels have steadily eroded our sensibilities and encouraged a kind of voyeurism that does not bode well for a good society. And remember, television comes into our homes,” she says.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that even the worst of revivalist content in soaps and programmes get sponsors, and channels go all out to promote it to win eyeballs. As Kunhikrishnan points out, such programmes are watched by viewers between the ages of two and 90, especially women.

Psychologist and actor Mala Parvathy says the government must undertake studies at the earliest to understand the damage caused by each show and programme, especially those that promote patriarchy, misogyny and negativity. “It is a celebration of mediocrity and sensationalism. By constantly beaming such unrealistic content, we are grooming a desensitised generation who might feel that the violence, physical and emotional, dysfunctional families and unrealistic women characters they see on screen are real. Some of the reality shows encourage body shaming, incredibly cut-throat competition and all the negative aspects that appeal to the basest characteristics in us. Instead of fostering positivity, sadly, the programmes encourage a narcissistic attitude,” she explains.

Parvathy says there must be some sort of mechanism to see that the content on television does not go against the laws of the land or promote voyeuristic and revivalist ideas.

Agreeing with her, veteran anchorperson Rekha Menon says: “As far as I’m concerned, such content is completely unacceptable and is to be flagged immediately. Nevertheless, calling for a ban on something, however regressive it may be, is not the answer. As it is, we are living in an age where freedom of expression is under threat. A ban will just open a Pandora’s box. However, it is important to call out misogynistic acts, and the fact that there is a backlash against this completely horrendous behaviour on the part of a participant in a popular show is a good sign. The only way such unacceptable behaviour can be countered is by putting pressure on the producers, channel and advertisers and send a strong message that this kind of content is not acceptable. Public opinion is a strong weapon and must be used. Nothing works better than flagging something as unpopular since that is what makers of popular content want their products to be. It is a good sign that there is a strong anti-current to this.”

She adds: “This misogyny is not surprising, considering the regressive stuff that our daily soaps are full of. There should be a backlash against that as well. We are fighting against a mindset here and the only way to do that is to voice your opinion strongly against all such content.”

Instead of a censor board on the lines of cinema, all of them agree that the need of the hour is a self-regulatory body in all television channels that keeps a close watch on what is telecast and evaluates them and then take necessary steps to flag and stop content that is not in keeping with the times we live in. “The kind of stuff that is being aired does not do us any credit as a creative people or as viewers of such sub-standard programmes,” sums up Parvathy.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/5j1edh/article31161811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvfbiggboss,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/how-television-channels-are-working-sans-any-regulations-or-guidelines/article31161816.ece
27,2020/03/25,"Four quarantine playlists to zone in and out to, during the coronavirus shutdown","We all have our favourite filmy playlists down to the tee, but here are some interesting picks to experiment with to get through social distancing

We have been in lockdown for a couple of weeks now, and our daily lifestyles have gone for a complete toss. Having said that, we are also doing the best we can to make the most of our time now, be it working from home, slow cooking, or finding new hobbies. A lot of us live alone or with a partner, self-isolating, away from families, so music is essential to get us through the day.

After 15-20 days of social distancing, we have gone through enough playlists to zone in on what we like: some nostalgia, some upbeat tunes, some downer ones and some desi stuff, all depending on the mood! We list our favourite ones on Spotify right now.

COVID-19 Quarantine Party

The most popular ‘quarantine playlist’ of them all: it’s got over four lakh followers now. It’s a great mix of new chart-topping artistes as well as some classic favourites such as Kanye West, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd, John Denver and so on; a great mix of genres to accompany any chore.

Workout

It’s essential to keep our creative juices — as well as our body — moving, and that can be difficult being cooped up in the bedroom. However, Spotify’s ‘Workout’ playlist has got some great pop music to really lift the mood and motivate you to do some yoga, go for a quick walk/run around the apartment or do some stretches. 5 Seconds of Summer, The Chainsmokers, Diplo... represent!

Sad Beats

Not to be a downer, but sometimes it’s okay to give in to the stress and anxiety, and wait for it to pass. With everything going on around us, it’d be surprising if we don’t feel those world-is-ending vibes. Music has a really therapeutic effect at such times to help us tide past it, and this playlist is perfect for it: Band of Horses, Halsey, Sam Fender are some of the stand-outs here. It’s indie rock at its finest.

South Indies

We have our lists of film music bookmarked already, but this is a genre that goes surprisingly looked past a lot: the independent music scene in South India has been bursting with talent over the last few years, and this has not just helped us discover some new artistes, but also inspired us to try creating some music! All you need is an iPad app. Thaikkudam Bridge, When Chai Met Toast, Agam, Shakthisree Gopalan, Dopeadelicz: there’s something for everyone here.

28,2020/03/25,Multiplayer video games to keep you social during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Whatever you comfort level in gaming is — novice, hardcore or just unsure — there is something on this list for everyone

Who says gaming is an anti-social sport? Sure, the stereotypical image of gamers sees them nestled into a couch with a day’s worth of snacks around them as neither their gaze never strays from the monitor in front of them nor their fingers budge from the controller or keyboard. We bet that’s changing now.

Honourable mentions League Of Legends, Dota, World Of Warcraft, Rocket League, Need For Speed, Team Fortress, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow 6 Seige, Genesis 6, Halo, Doom,Grand Theft Auto, Mario Kart, Borderlands

With the lockdown underway across the country, people yearn for the company of their friends and families. That said, the digital space compensates with the power of communication and entertainment, and nothing is quite as interactive as gaming. Plus, it shoves unnecessary small talk aside, sending you right into the centre of the action.

Here is MetroPlus’ pick of multiplayer games that will have you feeling a little less alone in these hard times:

Minecraft

We’ll start this off easy. Minecraft is one of the gaming industry’s best world-building games. Despite the simplicity of its pixellated design, the game offers countless possibilities of building a kingdom, playing virtual Hunger Games, or replicating your actual home. Kids, in particular, take a shining to the Education Edition as it gamifies learning and catalyses creativity on many levels.

Minecraft also appeals to the tech-savvy for its impressive scripting tools, and the massive player pools in Minecraft also make it ideal for those missing their friends and family. Yes, we know a digital environment is not a substitute, but in the lockdown we are in now, can we afford to be picky?

Minecraft is available on most mainstream gaming, mobile and PC platforms.

The Sims 4

Have you really gotten into gaming if you haven’t done a several-hour binge of The Sims? Electronic Arts have perfected the second-life game sub-culture over the years since the Windows-exclusive release in 2000. Yes, The Sims franchise is 20 years-old now. This game is ideal if you’re down ‘meet’ your friends at the virtual club you built and dashing away to the nearby castle for some romance... but we do ask you not to take break-ups on here too seriously.

That said, the Sims 4 escalates the experience with better persistent worlds, emotionally-driven activities and an improved Build Mode which will turn you into an architectural genius. What an apt game in the time of social distancing.

The Sims 4 is available on MacOS, Windows, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

FIFA 20

Is there a better multiplayer game to play during a lockdown? For generations, friends from across continents have bonded over the FIFA Ultimate Team feature of the game that continues to evolve with newer versions. Featuring over 30 official leagues, 700 clubs and 17,000 players, the licensing is the real win here over eternal rivals Pro Evolution Soccer.

While FIFA 20 comes with its fair share of detractors, there have been enough tweaks in the gameplay to keep players occupied for hours — and weeks — at a stretch. The much-criticised Career Mode (in which you manage a team over an entire season) could actually be a godsend for those in countries with slow/ regulated internet, and the new addition of VOLTA (inspired by street and Futsal games) makes for a lot of fun. The Journey Mode returns as well, and can be played offline, and offers the closest experience gamers get towards experiencing a real footballer’s life in its storyline mode, with all its drama and off the pitch decisions.

Ultimately, FIFA remains what it always has been: the perfect ‘outdoor’ social gaming experience.

FIFA 20 is available on Microsoft Windows, PS4, XBox One and Nintendo Switch

PUBG

Despite a tumultuous realtionship with the government, the allure of Unreal Engine 4’s PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s Battleground) is undeniable. Unlike most games of this scale, PUBG had a soft launch but made quite an impact in gaming regimes the world over, with its anti-cheating mechanisms, rating protection cards and HDR Mode. Plus, the game, singular in form, has updates which come in the form of seasons, so once you have PUBG, do stay up to date.

Players go head-to-head in shrinking mapped areas, leading up to a battle royale of sorts. The adrenalin rush of PUBG is incomparable, due to the simple framework of the game. So don’t expect a rivetting storyline here; it’s all about getting in and being the last one standing.

PUBG is available on PC, mobile, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Destiny 2: New Light

Richly detailed and brimming with purpose, Destiny 2 creates one of the richest atmospheres and storylines in gaming history. Bungie and Activision set players, as Guardians, on a mission to unite three former comrades in order secure peace across the universe. New Light is stunning, too; it takes the cake for impressive design of its persistent state world.

We recommend taking a crack at its predecessor, purely for the rivetting storyline. In an MMO (massive multiplayer online) realm, join other Guardians for challenging co-op missions, or compete against them in a variety of PvP (player-versus-player) modes.

Destiny 2 is available on Playstation 4, Xbox One and MacOS.

Call Of Duty: Warzone

No multiplayer listicle is complete without Call Of Duty, whatever the version. Latest addition Warzone features the classic Call Of Duty battle rezz staples such as weapon looting and a vast player pool so there’s no limits to the number of comrades you can team up with. If you’re not ready for Warzone just yet, we would recommend Modern Warfare — of which Warzone is a part, but does not require a purchase in order to play Warzone. Modern Warfare is known for being a landmark in the franchise, offering multiple reviving options, item-weapon combinations, and stunning graphics.

The franchise has some committed die-hard fans out there too; Warzone saw more than 30 million players in less than two weeks post-launch, so you could very well make some interesting friends during a gaming session.

29,2020/03/25,E-com players suspend services as lockdown starts,"Prioritise delivery of ‘critical goods’

E-commerce firm Flipkart has temporarily suspended its services as the 21-day country-wide lockdown began on Wednesday.

The move comes after rival Amazon India said it will halt orders for non-essential products and is looking at prioritising customers’ critical needs. Likewise, Gurugram-headquartered Snapdeal on Wednesday said it is working towards completing delivery of essential goods.

“Consequent to the order issued on March 24 by the Ministry of Home Affairs announcing a 21-day lockdown across India to contain the spread of COVID-19, we are temporarily suspending our services,” the Walmart-owned firm said in a blog.

It added, “Your needs have always been a priority, and our promise is that we will be back to serve you, as soon as possible.” A similar note was also visible to customers going to the Flipkart website.

A Snapdeal spokesperson said, “Snapdeal is working region-wise to complete as many deliveries of essential goods to our customers as possible as per local operating conditions. We are also actively supporting Central and State authorities to help streamline issues for e-commerce operations in order to effectively serve the needs of consumers.”

Meanwhile, Amazon India, in a blog on Tuesday, said a large number of districts/States are taking precautionary measures with extensive lockdowns and restricted movement of goods and people. At the same time, the platform is seeing an increased demand for priority products and important services.

“To serve customers’ most urgent needs while also ensuring safety of our employees, we are temporarily prioritising our available fulfilment and logistics capacity to serve products that are currently critical for our customers such as household staples, packaged food, healthcare, hygiene, personal safety and other high priority products,” it said.

It added, “This also means that we have to temporarily stop taking orders and disable shipments for lower-priority products.”

Amazon India said for all pending customer orders of lower-priority products, it is reaching out to customers and giving them a choice to cancel their orders, and receive a refund for prepaid items.

These changes, it said, are in effect from March 24, 2020.

“Amazon and our network of partners are helping communities around the world and in India to deliver much-needed supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them. We will remain focused on providing this vital service to people in India, especially to those most vulnerable, like the elderly or those without access,” it said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/e-com-players-suspend-services-as-lockdown-starts/article31167002.ece
30,2020/03/25,Neuberg labs get nod for COVID-19 tests,"Neuberg’s 4 facilities get ICMR nod to conduct tests

The decision of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to approve 26 private pathological labs on March 24 to conduct COVID-19 tests is likely to expedite the sample testing process and ease the burden on government-run labs.

Out of these, Chennai-based Neuberg Group’s four labs viz. Neuberg Anand Bengaluru, Neuberg Ehrlich Chennai, Neuberg Supratech Ahmedabad and Neuberg AG Diagnostics Pune have been declared as approved centres for COVID-19 testing.

“As are group we are scaling up to do around 2000 RT PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests per day to help ICMR increase the scale of testing soon,” said GSK Velu, chairman, Neuberg Diagnostics Ltd.

He said all pathological labs will have to follow the ICMR guidelines for sample collection, patient selection and reporting.

“Neuberg is the only pathological lab chain which got four of its facilities approved by the ICMR,” he said.

While the labs will follow the cap of ₹4,500 per test, Neuberg will to do the testing free-of-cost for deserving patients as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative.

“The results will be given within 24 hours in same cities where processing is done at Bengaluru, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Pune and within 48 hours if the samples are picked up from other cities,” he said.

Dr. Velu said samples will be collected at isolated collection facilities in many locations and through home collections by phlebotomists who will go with personal protection equipments. It is mandatory for a physician to recommend the test.

“As recommended by the ICMR, we will use approved RT PCR kits for conducting analysis in our BSL (Biosafety) 2 and 3 approved molecular testing facilities in these four cities,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/neuberg-labs-get-nod-for-covid-19-tests/article31166978.ece
31,2020/03/25,Indian Bank to give COVID-19 loans,"Individuals, MSMEs and SHGs among those who will benefit

Public sector lender Indian Bank has announced special emergency loans for various categories of customers such as individuals, corporates, MSMEs and self-help groups (SHGs), retail borrowers and pensioners.

32,2020/03/25,"Banks get ready for merger, albeit reluctantly","Process can wait, given the lockdown the country is under, say some bankers

Almost half of the Indian public sector lenders — 10 to be precise, which will be merged to create four banks — are getting ready to amalgamate themselves in an exercise that takes effect from April 1.

The mergers, announced in August last, will start amid an unprecedented nationwide lockdown to fight the rapid spread of COVID-19.

Banking services are exempt from the lockdown, but are operating with minimal staff at branches with curtailed business hours, primarily focussing on essential services such as withdrawals and deposits. Banks are encouraging customers to make use of their digital platforms for transactions.

“The entire focus right now is how to continue the essential services to customers with minimum staff,” said the chief executive of a public sector bank, who did not wish to be named.

“In such crisis times, customer service is the key. Merger can wait for a quarter, at least,” the executive added.

In August 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the merger of 10 public sector banks into four. Oriental Bank of India and United Bank of India will be merged with Punjab National Bank; Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will be merged with Union Bank of India; Allahabad Bank will be merged with Indian Bank; and Syndicate Bank will be merged with Canara Bank.

According to the plan, only the balance sheets of these banks will be merged on April 1. All the branches of the transferor banks will become branches of the transferee bank. The actual integration of systems and processes of these banks will take time (up to a year). For example, if a customer of Andhra Bank goes to a branch which belonged to Corporation Bank before the merger (and a branch of Union Bank post merger), then the entry would still be made in Andhra Bank’s system. All the branches of Union Bank will have to maintain three separate software systems in the branches. The same is the case with all other merger-bound banks.

‘Logistical nightmare’

Also, the branding of the branches will have to change. The branches of the transferor banks will have to don the brand of the transferee bank. “With limited staff that are operating now and also the lockdown that is in place, it is going to be logistical nightmare to change the branding,” said a banker with a public sector bank.

Some bankers said the issue of postponing the merger was discussed among them informally, but no formal requests have been made to the Finance Ministry.

There are also performance-related concerns of the merged entity since economic activity has almost come to a halt due to the crisis, which will inevitably have a bearing on the bank’s performance.

A section of bankers is also of the view that it is too late to postpone the merger at this point of time since only less than a week is left for the process.

“It will be business as usual after the merger as there is no impact on the customer since only the balance sheets are merged,” said the chief executive of another merger-bound public sector bank.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wnwqhr/article31166823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUPNB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/banks-get-ready-for-merger-albeit-reluctantly/article31166824.ece
33,2020/03/25,FinMin writes to RBI for relaxing farm loan NPA norms,"Cites stress in agriculture sector; relaxation a prerequisite to interest subvention

The Finance Ministry has asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to relax asset classification norms for farm loans extended by banks following the stress faced by the agriculture sector.

In a letter addressed to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, the Ministry said, “it is requested to consider making appropriate relaxation in asset classification norms in respect of short-term agricultural crop loans for a period up to 30th June 2020.”

The letter, reviewed by The Hindu, cited a communication from the Agriculture Ministry which is considering an extension of the interest subvention scheme for the farm sector which, in turn, would require relaxation of NPA norms. As per the RBI’s asset classification norms, a loan is classified as non-performing by banks if repayment is due for more than 90 days.

“The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India, has [said that] in view of the unprecedented situation prevailing in the country on account of increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection and consequent lockdown across the country, they are actively considering the possibility of extending the benefit of interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive to short-term crop agriculture loans falling due between 29th March 2020 and 30th June 2020, if the loans are repaid by 30th June 2020,” the letter said.

“They have further stated the extension of the repayment date would require relaxation in asset qualification by RBI,” it added.

The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a lockdown across the country with economic and other activities coming to a grinding halt. As a result, industry and bankers have demanded a relaxation in bad loan norms, apart from economic stimulus from the government. A task force headed by finance minister Nirmala Sithararam has been formed to finalise an economic relied package.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jgelhq/article31166819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/finmin-writes-to-rbi-for-relaxing-farm-loan-npa-norms/article31166820.ece

Speaking about the Delhi death registered on Tuesday night allegedly due to COVID-19, Mr. Agarwal said the subsequent sample testing gave a negative report, which led the Ministry to revise its numbers.

Home delivery

Punya Salila Srivastava, Joint Secretary, Home Ministry, noted that all measures are being taken to allow adherence by public of the Prime Minister’s call for 21-day lockdown to fight the spread of COVID-19.

“We are working with various agencies to ensure that essential supplies reach the general public. We are also encouraging e-commerce companies and State governments on home delivery.”

Watch | What is contact tracing?

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday highlighted the critical importance of social distancing, home quarantine protocols and supporting medical staff in combating COVID-19, after the Group of Ministers held a meeting at Nirman Bhavan.

He said around 64,000 persons have arrived from other countries to India since March 21, 2020 of which 8,000 had been put in various quarantine facilities and 56,000 were in home isolation.

‘Follow protocols’

“We are fighting an infectious disease. In order to protect ourselves and others, it is highly important that we follow all the protocols, guidelines and directions issued by the government, failing which may lead to legal actions under Section 188 of IPC,” said the Minister.

He urged that medical staff should not be ostracised and that the public should avoid spreading rumours or unauthenticated information

Giving information about the GoM meeting, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said the Ministers discussed about strengthening the capacity of States, which need to devote adequate resources for creating dedicated COVID-19 hospitals, equipping the medical institutes with PPEs, ventilators and other essential equipment etc.

“States have been asked to ensure that essential services and supplies remain open. These include hospitals, medical shops and establishments engaged in manufacturing of medicines, vaccines, sanitisers, masks and medical devices,” he said.

Dedicated hospitals

He said Gujarat, Assam, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Goa, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir were setting up hospitals dedicated for the management of COVID-19.

The Cabinet Secretary had also written letters and conducted videoconference with Chief Secretaries, Health Secretaries and Directors-General of Police and instructed them to enforce implementation of lockdown measures, said Dr. Harsh Vardhan.

Distribution issues

Meanwhile, pharma and medical device manufacturers on Wednesday said they were facing distribution issues as some of the district administrations in various States / UTs had incorrectly given directions to close the manufacturing operations also in the pharmaceutical / medical device industry as part of various measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus and there were reports of officials unwilling to listen until orders reach them.

“We on behalf of the Indian medical device industry appeal to local administration and police to recognise that medicines, raw materials, components to make masks, sanitisers and other equipment are most essential healthcare delivery products at this critical hour of crisis, so we request them to extend their support and give free passage to the people in the supply chain of essential commodities to reach factories, manufacturing plants and there on the distribution and logistics chain to reach hospitals and clinics etc,” said a statement issued by Rajiv Nath, forum co-ordinator of Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).

‘Make tests free’

Organisations working in the area of healthcare access for all, including Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) and All India Peoples Science Network (AIPSN), have asked the government to make COVID-19 tests in private laboratories free of charge and make necessary arrangements to extend free treatment even in private healthcare institutions.

Replying to this Mr. Agarwal said: “The test and treatment is free at government hospitals and the pricing capping for testing facility was offered after discussion with the private sector.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mx52vs/article31167414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THLT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-no-community-transmission-yet-says-health-ministry/article31167415.ece

36,2020/03/25,Coronavirus outbreak | Rahul Gandhi calls for two-pronged strategy,"‘Expand testing, give financial aid to prevent job losses and reassure businesses’

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday suggested a two-pronged strategy to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, while his party demanded the implementation of the minimum income guarantee scheme for the poor.

“The question is how can we minimise casualties in this war. I believe our strategy should have 2 components. The govt should give financial support to prevent massive job losses and reassure business owners,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

“Isolate the virus and block its escape routes. Massively expand testing facilities to identify and treat those who are infected. Create massive emergency field hospitals, particularly in urban areas, with full ICU capability to provide care to patients,” said the Congress leader who had raised an alarm about COVID-19 as early as February 12. Mr. Gandhi said the daily wage earners must be extended immediate help through direct cash transfers and free rations. “Delaying this will cause widespread devastation & chaos,” he said.

Tax breaks

He said many industries were struggling and they should be helped through tax breaks and financial support to prevent massive job losses, and the government must reassure business owners of all support to tide over the crisis.

The Congress urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to implement the Nyunatam Aay Yojana (Nyay) or the minimum income guarantee scheme it had promised in its 2019 election manifesto. The Nyay had promised to transfer ₹72,000 annually to the 20% of the poorest families in the country.

“Dear PM, need of the hour is to implement forthwith Minimum Income Guarantee Scheme (Nyay), mooted by Rahulji & Congress. Please transfer Rs 7,500 to every Jan Dhan A/C, PM Kisan A/C & every Pension A/C to tide over nutrition needs of 21 days and give free PDS ration,” tweeted Congress communication chief Randeep Singh Surjewala.

‘Lacks strategy’

In a series of tweets, Mr. Surjewala said that though the party supported the lockdown, it is “deeply disappointed” by a lack of a coherent strategy on the part of the Modi government.

“Please remember, Trying times are true test of leadership. Is government ready to rise up & deliver,” he asked and added, “The Congress demands a comprehensive package for daily wagers, MGNREGA workers, factory workers, unorganised workers, fishermen and farm labourers.”

“Certain offices have been given exemption from the lockdown. Keeping in view the exigencies that have arisen in various departments not exempted under the guidelines..., the following instructions are issued,” said the latest order.

Heads of the departments concerned have been asked to draw up a list of the staff “absolutely necessary” to carry out additional essential services within the departments. The list of such employees will be emailed to DCP (New Delhi) Eish Singal.

38,2020/03/25,Coronavirus outbreak | CJI urged to order release of detained declared foreigners,"NGO’s representation comes in the wake of coronavirus scare

A representation has been made to Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde to order the immediate release of declared foreigners detained at the six detention centres in Assam in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The representation made by the NGO, Justice and Liberty and Initiative, also urged the CJI to order that there should not be any fresh detention of declared foreigners till the health situation returns to normalcy.

The NGO appealed on humanitarian grounds, saying there are many old and ailing among the detainees who have been in these centres for over a decade.

“Being human beings, they [detainees] also have at least the basic right to live and to not die of COVID-19 in the precincts of a prison which has despicable living conditions,” the representation said.

The representation said the detainees were neither criminals nor a threat to the society. Their detention is akin to civil imprisonment.

The representation reminded the Supreme Court about its May 10, 2019 order to release detainees who have spent over three years behind the walls of the detention centres. But the NGO argued that the court, considering the precarious health situation and the fact that the detainees are financially feeble, should waive the three-year condition and that of payment of financial surety for their release.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9kmxdr/article31166858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26QuoteNGOcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-outbreak-cji-urged-to-order-release-of-detained-declared-foreigners/article31166860.ece
39,2020/03/25,Callous and cruel to continue to detain Mehbooba: Omar Abdullah,"He urges Modi, Shah to release PDP leader

National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah on Wednesday demanded the release of Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti.

He also vowed to fight for the revocation of the Public Safety Act (PSA), under which most political leaders have been arrested since August 5 last year.

Tagging the official handles of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Twitter, Mr. Abdullah, who was released on Tuesday after 232 days in detention, said, “It’s callous and cruel to continue to detain Ms. Mufti and others at a time like this. There was never much justification to detain everyone in the first place and none at all to keep them detained as the country enters a three-week lockdown. I hope PM Modi and Mr. Shah will release them.”

Ms. Mufti, the former Chief Minister, her aides Naeem Akhtar and Sartaj Madani, and NC senior leader Ali Muhammad Sagar remain in sub-jails in Srinagar under the PSA, which allows detention of a person for up to two years.

Mr. Abdullah, also a former Chief Minister, said he had talked about the repeal of the PSA in April 2019, months before it was invoked against him and his colleagues.

The Muftis in Srinagar were expecting Ms. Mehbooba Mufti to be freed. But no such order was issued until the evening. “My mother is hearing reports of her imminent release... But she is upset at thousands of boys jailed outside Jammu and Kashmir. The trauma their families feel because of COVID-19 is unimaginable,” said Iltija Mufti, Ms. Mehbooba’s daughter.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2aclbb/article31166754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THOMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/callous-and-cruel-to-continue-to-detain-mehbooba-omar-abdullah/article31166755.ece

“When governments all over are helping their people, why is the Bihar government not helping or arranging some immediate relief?... #shameonNitishKumar,” ” he said in a tweet. Mr. Kishor was a vice-president in the ruling Janata Dal (United) in Bihar, but was expelled after he fell out with the Chief Minister on NPR, NRC and CAA issues.

Earlier, in another tweet, Mr. Kishor said the decision to lock down India may be right, but 21 days was perhaps too long. “But then this is the price one pays for being behind the curve. With shaky preparedness to deal with the COVID crisis and very little being done to safeguard the poor, we could be staring at some tough days ahead,” he said.

Fourth case in Bihar

Meanwhile, Bihar reported the fourth positive COVID-19 case on Wednesday. The 39-year-old from the Patna city area had recently come from Gujarat. He has been admitted to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) which is notified by the government for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

42,2020/03/25,Coronavirus outbreak | Animal carcasses hung in Arunachal villages to fend off COVID-19,"Local administrations worried over possible health hazards, issue orders

Over fears of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Lower Dibang Valley district in east Arunachal Pradesh, and the East and West Siang districts in the central parts of the State are faced with a new problem. Many villages are hanging carcasses of dogs and animals to scare away evil forces. The districts’ administrations issued a strongly worded order on Wednesday.

“It has been observed that certain sections of people in different villages and localities…are practicing social taboo by erecting gates and hanging the carcass of dogs and other animals on National Highways, link roads etc. to ward off diseases…” noted the order by Mitali Namchoom, Deputy Commissioner, Lower Dibang Valley. She told The Hindu that this was a “traditional ritual” in the area.

Booking violators

Her order said that the killing and hanging of animals was a “nuisance” and may trigger “health hazards”. The order noted that the violators would be booked under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

On the other hand, the Galo Welfare Society (GWS), a registered citizens’ body for Galos, one of the State’s influential tribal communities, issued a statement saying “local rituals” had been performed in West Siang district on Wednesday. The Galo community mainly resides in West Siang and Lepa Rada districts. Such rituals are usually performed in the villages “to fend off epidemics or diseases and following such rituals, people are discouraged to go out of villages,” said a local resident. GWS has imposed restrictions on the movement of the villagers.

Anticipating large scale animal sacrifices in adjacent East Siang too, Deputy Commissioner Kinny Singh issued an order on similar lines as Lower Dibang, asking locals to refrain from the practice.

Time tables

In Lower Dibang Valley administration has introduced a localised arrangement to avoid the rush to buy daily consumables.

“We told people that every neighbourhood will pick up household consumables at a different time of the day, so that they do not rush, all together. A time table is drawn accordingly and distributed. Importantly, people are following it. Essential things are also available,” said Ms. Namchoom.

The situation is under control and outsiders are largely kept under house quarantine, she said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1ykwxq/article31166355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ARUNACHAL-CORONAVIRUS-KRDEEPAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-outbreak-animal-carcasses-hung-in-arunachal-villages-to-fend-off-covid-19/article31166356.ece

In a letter to the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry, the ECI wrote that it had taken the suo motu decision to allow the use of indelible ink with certain conditions. The ECI’s decision followed several State governments using different stamps to mark those who had been ordered to quarantine at home after returning from abroad.

Rule 49K

The ECI wrote that according to Rule 49K of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 an elector is supposed to be marked on the fore finger of their left hand before casting the vote at a polling station. In case the elector does not have a fore finger on the left hand, any other finger of the left hand can be marked and in case the elector does not have any fingers on the left hand, the fore finger of the right hand can be marked. The ECI said the authorities concerned should be directed not to use the indelible ink on any finger of the left hand.

“The Ministry may standardise the mark and the location on the body where the mark has to be applied so that it does not come in the way of conduct of elections anywhere in the country.

Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari went to Nagpur (his constituency) on Tuesday just before all domestic flights were suspended. He continues to remain indoors at his home there, said an aide and had been holding conference calls and meetings over videoconferencing from his residence. “We don’t know when he will be back in Delhi, what with flights cancelled, but with technology we have been able to get him all the files, and getting them signed etc,” said a close aide.

46,2020/03/25,Coronavirus outbreak | Forum seeks release of ‘declared foreigners’ from Assam detention centres,"Humanitarian consideration for Foreigners’ Tribunal detenus sought in view of COVID-19 pandemic

A forum for justice has written to the Supreme Court seeking the release of “declared foreigners” from six detention centres of Assam on humanitarian grounds in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

In its appeal on Wednesday, the Justice and Liberty Initiative (JLI) lauded the apex court for its effort to ensure the release of prisoners on parole and those awaiting trail for offences entailing maximum sentence of seven years so that the jails do not become breeding grounds for COVID-19.

This step should be extended to the declared foreigners, who on account of poor documentation or poor legal assistance and lack of resources, have not been able to prove they are Indian citizens, the forum of leading lawyers and academics said.

802 declared foreigners

According to a statement by Minister of State for Home, Nityananda Rai in the Rajya Sabha on March 11, there are a total of 802 declared foreigners in detention centres at Goalpara, Tezpur, Jorhat, Silchar and Dibrugarh.

The existing 100 Foreigners’ Tribunals declare such people foreigners after their cases are referred by the Assam Police’s Border wing, which is tasked with detecting “suspected non-citizens” or “Bangladeshis”. Some are either too poor to pursue their cases in higher courts or have their appeals turned down.

“As human beings, they [declared foreigners facing perpetual detention] also have at least the basic human right to live and not to die of COVID-19 in the precincts of a prison, which has despicable living conditions,” said advocate Aman Wadud on behalf of JLI.

The forum pointed to government records saying 29 declared foreigners have died in detention due to various ailments since 2016, with ten of them having died between March 1, 2019 and February 20 this year.

Conditional release

It also referred to the Supreme Court’s order on May 10, 2019, for conditional release of such people who have served more than three years in detention.

The conditions include execution of bond with two sureties of ₹1 lakh each, capturing of biometrics of the released person and storing it in a secured database, and quarterly report by the Border Police to the Foreigners’ Tribunal regarding appearance of the released person at the police station concerned.

The JLI requested the apex court to apply these conditions, except for the three-year detention clause, for releasing the declared foreigners.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-outbreak-forum-seeks-release-of-declared-foreigners-from-assam-detention-centres/article31163944.ece

The country is fighting a war against the novel coronavirus and the aim is to win it in 21 days, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday, a day after he announced a national lockdown of three weeks to combat the pandemic.

Interacting with people in his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi through videoconference, Mr. Modi said: “The Mahabharata war was won in 18 days, this war the whole country is fighting against coronavirus will take 21 days.”

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

As the total count of COVID-19 cases in India touched 606 on Wednesday, the Centre said there was still no proof of “community transmission”. With one more death on Wednesday, the virus has claimed 10 lives, according to the Union Health Ministry.

Data from the States, however, put the total number of positive cases at 624, with 568 active ones. Thirteen people have died so far.

The Prime Minister urged citizens to support healthcare professionals and others who are working through the lockdown. He said he was pained to hear of incidents of discrimination and harassment faced by airline staff who helped rescue COVID-19 patients, and doctors and nurses tending to such people.

The PM also announced that the Centre has tied up with WhatsApp to create a helpdesk for providing credible information on coronavirus. The number is 9013151515.

Strict action

Such acts would “prove costly” to the offenders, he warned, adding: “I have told the Home Ministry and DGPs to take strict action against those who are not supporting or not co-operating with doctors, nurses and other professionals who are serving us in this critical time.”

Advance salary

Meanwhile, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced that the State would pay salary until the month of July in advance to all its healthcare professionals in April.

‘Pained’ by harassment of doctors

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said he had instructed the police chiefs of different States to take strict action against those who ill-treat or don’t co-operate with doctors, nurses and other professionals who are providing vital services in the fight against COVID-19.

Mr. Modi was responding to a question by a Varanasi resident during a videoconference with people of his Lok Sabha constituency.

When asked about the incidents of discrimination and harassment faced by the staff members of airlines who helped to rescue COVID-19 patients and doctors and nurses tending to such people, the Prime Minister said he was pained by such reports. Such acts would “prove costly” to the offenders, he warned.

‘Form of god’

Mr. Modi said that if people noticed such incidents of ill-treatment of doctors, nurses or ‘safai karamcharis’, they should point it out and warn the offenders. Nurses and doctors working in white uniform against COVID-19 “are a form of god,” he said.

To another question on reports of people resorting to self-diagnosis, Mr. Modi warned the public not to try to get COVID-19 treated on their own. “Stay at home and act as per doctor’s advice,” he stressed. “First, consult your doctor,” he said.

If the Mahabharata war was won in 18 days, the battle against coronavirus that the whole country is fighting would take 21 days, the Prime Minister said. “Our attempt is to win it in 21 days,” he said. His constituency, Varanasi, could teach the country patience, coordination and sensitivity, support, peace and tolerance during the lockdown.

Mr. Modi also asked people, especially those capable, to take care of nine poor families for 21 days as part of Navratri, as well as the animals, that could not fend for themselves due to the shutdown of services and transport. This was his reply to a question on the crisis faced by migrant labourers and the poor who were stranded in various cities without any means of support.

“This will be a true Navratri,” he said, asking the people to adopt ‘karuna’ (compassion) as another step to defeat corona [virus].

The Prime Minister also refuted ideas that people in India were adept at battling COVID-19 owing to factors such as the hot and humid weather and lifestyle. “The biggest truth coming out of this illness is that it doesn’t discriminate against anyone and ruins both the rich and the poor,” he said.

He asked the people not to rely on misinformation and continue to maintain physical distancing.

48,2020/03/25,Journalist who attended Kamal Nath’s press meet tests COVID-19 positive,"Several journalists, govt. officials go into quarantine as he visited Vidhan Sabha and the Raj Bhavan too

Panic gripped officials and journalists in Bhopal on Wednesday as a senior journalist, who had attended a press conference of former Chief Minister Kamal Nath and visited the Vidhan Sabha and the Raj Bhavan, tested positive for COVID-19.

The journalist is the father of the woman, who was the first case in the city to test positive on March 22 after returning from London. He is the 15th positive case in the State.

As the news of the test result trickled in, several government Public Relations department (PRD) officials and journalists went into quarantine. Many journalists who had come in direct/indirect contact with the person demanded the government test them immediately. They prepared a list of those present at the press conference.

A journalist, who sat next to the infected person at the press conference, approached the administration to get tested but was refused as he was asymptomatic. “There are about 50 journalists who want to get tested,” he said.

“All the persons who came in contact with the infected person must immediately go into quarantine. We will issue an advisory soon,” Tarun Kumar Pithode, Bhopal district Collector, told The Hindu.

Chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Sudhir Dehariya said, “Every person who came in contact with him should go in home isolation at least for 14 days.” He said only the woman’s father of the 10 persons who had come in immediate contact with her had tested positive.

P. Narahari, Secretary, Public Relations Department, also asked the journalists who attended the press conference to immediately self-quarantine themselves and keep a safe distance from family members. “As per the health department, any check-up can be done only in case of symptoms relating to the virus,” he said.

Saying he had gone into quarantine, Vidhan Sabha Principal Secretary A.P. Singh requested Assembly officials to do the same and seek medical help if required.

The infected journalist’s brother is a State Congress spokesman.

On March 20, the day the Congress government was to take the Supreme Court-directed floor test, Mr. Kamal Nath called a press conference at his official residence at noon and announced his resignation.

More than 200 journalists, including locals and from other cities, several Congress MLAs and leaders, Cabinet Ministers and Mr. Nath were present at the open-air meeting hall.

Many PRD officials, who shook hands with the journalist, later distributed the press release to journalists. The person then went to the Raj Bhavan where Mr. Nath submitted his resignation to Governor Lalji Tandon. He later went to the Vidhan Sabha where the BJP MLAs had reached to attend the session scheduled for 2 p.m., which was postponed in light of Mr. Nath’s resignation. Later that night, he reportedly took part in a TV debate.

On March 18, the day his daughter reached Bhopal, the journalist visited the State BJP office too. Her brother, who accompanied her from New Delhi to Bhopal, tested negative.

Mr. Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said the former Chief Minister was taking all precautions. “He is following all instructions for protection from the disease. But the news of his going into isolation is false. He is meeting people as well as working in his office,” he said.

“No one knows who all came in contact with him,” said a local journalist. “Let’s remember, covering corona is not about courage. Your life is important for your family.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c0xvz2/article31163365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25KAMALNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/journalist-who-attended-kamal-naths-press-meet-tests-covid-19-positive/article31163366.ece

“The government has decided to provide 7 kg per person of foodgrains to 80 crore people under the Public Distribution System [PDS], which is the world’s largest food security system,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told media after the meeting.

He said the government provides wheat for ₹2 when it costs Food Corporation of India ₹27, and rice for ₹3 when it costs ₹37.

All States have been asked to take foodgrains from the Centre in advance for distribution through the PDS, he added.

Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), the government is supplying 5 kg of foodgrains per month to over 80 crore people at a highly subsidised price.

The decision to allocate additional foodgrains through the PDS has been taken as State-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) is saddled with wheat and rice stock. With some foodgrains stock kept in open space, the FCI is under pressure to clear stock before monsoon.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i5snin/article31163347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-RATIONSHOP-MVEDHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-cabinet-nod-for-supply-of-2-kg-extra-subsidised-foodgrains-via-ration-shops/article31163348.ece

With people continuing to step out for non-essential activities amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown, police across the country have come up with unique ways to highlight the importance of staying at home.

From making ‘COVIDIOTS’ (a term coined for those flouting restrictions) squat on the road and do sit-ups, to making them pose with pamphlets admitting their fault, police officials have pulled out all the stops from their kitty of creativity to drive home the message.

Think before you step out during lockdown in #AndhraPradesh. Vijayawada police are finding new ways to restrict traffic. The Chief Minister @ysjagan has allowed only one per family to purchase essentials, gathering more than 5 is strictly prohibited. #AndhraFightsCorona,” writes a user on microblogging site Twitter.

He accompanied the tweet with a 14 second-long video of the Andhra Pradesh police making defaulters do sit-ups with crossed hands.

A similar awareness tactics was used by the Maharastra police, which in a video posted on social media, is seen making at least nine people do sit-ups near a traffic signal, evoking both laughter and appreciation for the officials.

The Central government had last week announced a lockdown till March 31 in 80 districts across the country to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The restrictions were extended after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night declared a 21-day nationwide lockdown.

The virus has claimed nine lives and infected 562 people in the country.

The police forces in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand took their creative ways a notch higher to ensure that the public curfew is followed.

Uttar Pradesh Police punished unnecessary people wandering around in order to make ‘public curfew’ successful and maintain #Social_Distancing #Covid19India,” posted a Twitter user.

The accompanying video shows the police resorting to the age old ‘murga’ punishment to teach the defaulters a lesson. Murga punishment is a stress position used as a corporal punishment where sit-ups are done holding the ears.

While defaulters in Punjab were asked to either crawl on all fours, or lie down flat on the road; those in Uttarakhand were made to pose with pamphlets that said, I’m enemy of society; I won’t stay home .

Niti Aayog chief Amitabh Kant also took to Twitter to praise the Delhi police for its ways of encouraging social distancing.

Sharing a video of a few police personnel driving people out of a public park peacefully while telling them the importance of staying indoors, he wrote, Delhi Police at its best! As Gr8 Ambassadors of #SocialDistancing ! #StaySafeStayHome”

It was not all praise for the force as many netizens also shared instances of the police crossing the line.

In Guntur, Telangana, Sikar (Rajasthan), police is seen beating up those flouting the rules with lathis. In several cases, people who were out for essential activities were harassed by the security personnel. Many Twitter users posted videos of such instances.

51,2020/03/25,Coronavirus outbreak | Census-NPR postponed till further orders,"MHA cites outbreak of COVID-19 as the reason

Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the first phase of Census 2021 and updating of the National Population Register (NPR) that was to begin on April 1 has been “postponed until further orders”, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement on Wednesday.

“Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, high alert has been declared by the Government of India as well as the States/Union Territories.... Lockdown has also been declared by many State/UT governments,” the MHA said.

On April 1, the Census and the NPR exercise was to be rolled out in Meghalaya, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshwadeep and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area. President Ram Nath Kovind was to be the first one to be enumerated for the Census, followed by Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as all of them reside in the NDMC area that comprises Lutyens Delhi.

The Hindu first reported on March 21 that the Census-NPR exercise was all set to be postponed due to the outbreak.

Other States and UTs had notified different dates for the exercise that entailed door-to-door visit by enumerators and field representatives and was not possible under the ongoing 21-day lockdown, said a senior government official.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

The Census was scheduled to be conducted in two phases — House listing & Housing Census during April-September 2020 and Population Enumeration from February 9-28, 2021. The updating of the NPR was also proposed to be done along with the Phase I of the Census in all the States and UTs, except Assam.

As many as 13 States and UTs have opposed the updating of the NPR.

According to Citizenship Rules 2003, the NPR is the first step towards compilation of a National Register of Citizens (NRC). The modified NPR form is yet to be made public but is likely to include contentious questions on “date and place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence and mother tongue.” NPR was first collected in 2010 and then updated in 2015 without the additional questions.

Passage of CAA

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 passed by Parliament on December 11, allows citizenship on the basis of religion to six undocumented communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

The helplines have been activated at nearly a dozen places in both Kashmir and Jammu divisions and four places in Ladakh in order to help the ‘awaam’ (people) to manage stresses related to COVID-19 and to provide immediate relief to those seeking advice, the spokesman said.

He said the helplines would be active 24x7 to address general questions and concerns regarding the prevention of COVID-19.

With the spread of novel coronavirus, there is a sense of uncertainty among the population, as many are not sure what measures to take to safeguard themselves and their family. There have been a series of fake social media uploads creating panic among people, the spokesman said, highlighting the need for helplines.

To this effect, he said the Army has been undertaking intense awareness campaigns updating the public with all relevant information during this pandemic through various platforms.

These initiatives are meant to ensure that individuals do not become unwitting carriers of the virus and are well informed about various preventive measures to be adopted, he said.

He said these helplines are a critical resource for the ‘awaam’ and would ensure addressing the questions of concerned residents and providing the most up-to-date information resources.

54,2020/03/25,Coronavirus: how hostels and hotels can be turned into makeshift hospitals,"Nidhi Adlakha on how our hostels, hotels and convention centres can be put into action to tackle the Covid-19 crisis

In early February this year, as doctors in Wuhan were grappling with the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese engineers sprung into action to build a 1,000-bed hospital in all of ten days. The two-storey, 366,000-square-foot Huoshenshan Hospital was built in record time and soon, the Leishenshan Hospital was built in a parking lot in the same manner. The Wuhan Living Room Temporary Hospital, inspired by the prefab hospital built in Beijing during the 2003 SARS outbreak, was a former convention hall. Soon, exhibition venues and gymnasiums were converted to create 16 makeshift hospitals in Wuhan (now closed).

With hospitals running at full capacity, these much-talked about engineering feats are in the news. Taking a cue from China, cities across the globe are now looking at constructing makeshift hospitals to cope with the rising number of cases. New York is considering reusing convention centres and university campuses, and authorities in Moscow are rushing to complete the ‘Chinese-inspired’ hospital on the city’s outskirts in a month. Even Kolkata has converted a stadium in Dumurjola into a 150-bed quarantine area. So why not Chennai, known for its thriving medical tourism industry.

Untapped avenues

On March 24, the State government announced that the Omandurar Government Multispeciality Hospital on Mount Road would be converted into a special facility for COVID-19 patients. Bed capacity is being scaled up, and a task force of medical professionals is being organised. But we must now also look at untapped avenues such as hostels, five-star hotels, etc. “If initiated, it will be great; there are no two ways about it,” says an official of the Corporation of Chennai (CoC).

SN Subrahmanyan, CEO and MD, Larsen and Toubro, announced this week that the construction company could build a hospital from scratch in record time, and also convert existing structures such as warehouses, marriage halls, etc., into hospitals if needed. “We have sent out proposals to various State governments and appraised them of our capabilities,” says Subrahmanyan, adding, “The hall will first be enclosed using specific techniques and materials. We will then install air conditioners, then electrical and plumbing work will be done, and partitions will be built to create segregated areas.”

Time crunch

As the crisis deepens in India, several citizen groups have been discussing the idea of utilising existing infrastructure rather than construct new hospitals. “India’s [currently] vacant hostels that amount to over 2 lakh rooms can definitely be converted into recuperating rooms, as well as the 3- and 5-star hotels. Hostels are located in universities sprawled across acres, and are equipped with beds and bathrooms,” says a source. “It will take 10-15 days to get them running – far lesser time than building a hospital from scratch,” he adds.

The CoC official adds that as we have existing structures, we can save time on constructing a foundation, getting labour organised, etc. “These can be temporary structures as we have seen in China. If planned well, using the expertise of architects and spatial planners, many public places can be used as hospitals and quarantine centres,” he says. “Marriage halls, convention venues and other buildings can be upgraded into hospitals.”

Considering the urgency of the situation, facilities that are available and ready for emergency and medical purposes are the need of the hour, says Rajesh Gurumurthy, Senior Director, Head – Strategic Consulting, Tamil Nadu & Sri Lanka, at Jones Lang LaSalle. “Hotel rooms could make for ideal makeshift isolated hospital wards. In addition, certain government and public buildings such as auditoriums, exhibition and trade centres, and government-owned guest houses can be used. These structures can be isolated easily when compared to other public infrastructure,” he says, adding that private hospitals too could function under the direction of the government during this crisis.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j5xcsa/article31161795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEISHENSHANHOSPITAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/how-hostels-and-hotels-can-be-turned-into-makeshift-hospitals-in-india/article31161796.ece
55,2020/03/25,Exclusive | Not enough evidence to indicate Coronavirus has a separate Indian strain: NCBS chief,"NCBS studying information on the sequences ICMR has released, says Satyajit Mayor

There isn’t enough scientific evidence yet to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 or the Novel Coronavirus has a separate Indian strain and the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS) was working with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to better understand the virus, Director of the Bangalore-based NCBS Satyajit Mayor has said.

In an exclusive interview to The Hindu, he said: “There is reasonable evidence that this could be a zoonotic intrusion, the implications being that this has occurred because of random mutation where humans are more prone to get infected. I don’t think we know yet that this is a different strain from what we have seen in other countries like China, the U.S. and Italy.”

The NCBS was studying information on the sequences the ICMR had released. “Viruses mutate quickly, and there is a lot of research we can do here [on the strain in Indian]. You can’t bottle up a virus like this and so, while we can’t yet say this has spread in the community, we need to be aware of the impact in India,” he said.

“We cannot prevent the spread of a virus like this but what we can do is to slow it down. We can also learn from the experience from other countries in these 40 days and if we can flatten the curve, and slow its spread, then we will be able cope with,’’ he noted.

Last week, a U.S. advocacy group and a Texas company filed a $ 20 trillion lawsuit against the Chinese government and Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) Shi Zhengli in particular for the alleged “creation and the release of the novel coronavirus” that had been “prepared and stockpiled as a biological weapon.”

Shi Zhengli is also among the authors of a US Department of Defence funded study on Filovirus (of which Ebola is a member) in Nagaland. The study came under the scanner recently as two of the 12 researchers belonged to the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s (WIV) Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and it was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense’s Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and they would have required special permissions as foreign entities.

Nagaland study

Mr. Mayor maintained that the WIV was not directly involved in the Nagaland study and that they were listed co-authors only because they supplied reagents. “This is a standard practice for scientific authorship. Yes there was an inquiry and now we have an all-clear from the government, which stated that no laws were flouted.”

Mr. Mayor explained that study of bats was a vital link in understanding the SARS-family. “Bats are an interesting mammal to study because they carry so many viruses without getting sick. So the basic concept, idea and technology in their study remain the same.”

The U.S. lawsuit contends that COVID-19 is an extremely dangerous disease because it has an extremely aggressive nature, designed to mutate from person to person, spreads very quickly and easily and is about “ten times as deadly as the flu.’’

Reacting to this, Mr. Mayor said there was “little evidence thus far that this was a bioweapon of any kind.”

This, he stated, was also a partly man-made problem. “With human intrusion into forest habitat, climate change and global warming, unpredictable behaviour by nature is only understandable. We as a species are not innocent in this crisis,’’ he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xqql1r/article31161675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SATYAJITMAYOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-not-a-virus-you-can-bottle-up-but-unlikely-a-bioweapon-ncbs-chief/article31161676.ece
56,2020/03/25,India hints at Pakistan hand in Kabul gurdwara attack,"The Taliban, which is in a fragile peace negotiation with the government of President Ashraf Ghani, has denied any role in the attack.

India strongly condemned Wednesday’s terror strike on a Gurudwara in Kabul, and pledged to help the Sikh and Hindu communities of Afghanistan. The attack began at 7.45 in the morning and continued till midday which left at least 11 dead. The attackers temporarily took around 200 devotees hostage during this time.

“We convey our sincerest condolences to the immediate family members of the deceased and wish speedy recovery to the injured. India stands ready to extend all possible assistance to the affected families of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan,” said a press release from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).

The incident drew condemnation from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who conveyed his condolences to those who lost their lives in the attack. ""I am shocked by the news of a terror attack on a Gurdwara in Kabul, Afghanistan,"" said Mr Gandhi. One of those who died in the attack is Tian Singh, a 71-year old Indian citizen from Delhi. Family members of Mr Singh have demanded that his mortal remains should be brought to India.

The Taliban which is in a fragile peace negotiation with the government of President Ashraf Ghani has denied any role in the attack. The MEA hinted at Pakistan’s involvement in the act and said the attack, which was carried out as both Afghanistan and India are combating the COVID-19 pandemic, was“reflective of the diabolical mindset of the perpetrators and their backers”.

India praised the Afghan security forces which freed the hostages and eliminated the fighters.

Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Wednesday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationwide lockdown announcement a “watershed moment” in the country’s fight against Coronavirus and appealed to people to be the foot soldiers of Mr. Modi, whom he described as the ‘commander’ of the fight.

The former Finance Minister also offered a 10-point cash transfer plan for people to deal with the economic crisis that has arisen owing to the lockdown.

“We should put behind us the debates that took place before March 24 and look upon the nationwide lockdown as the beginning of a new battle in which the people are the foot soldiers and the PM is the Commander. We owe a duty to extend our total support to the Prime Minister and the Central and State governments,” Mr. Chidambaram said in a two- page statement.

To put cash and food in the hands of people, he urged the government to double the amount paid/payable under PM-KISAN (to ₹12,000) and transfer the additional amount immediately to the bank account of each beneficiary.

“Bring tenant farmers under PM-KISAN. Take the lists from the State governments and transfer ₹6000 + ₹6000 (in two instalments) to the bank account of each tenant farmer. Take the lists of registered MGNREGA workers and transfer a sum of ₹3000 into the bank account of each beneficiary,” he said.

For the urban poor, he suggested that the government transfer ₹6,000 and offer 10 kg of rice or wheat free through public distribution shops to every ration cardholder.

“Open a register in every ward or block and invite persons who have not received payment under any of the categories listed above to register their name, address and Aadhaar. Street people and destitutes will fall under this category. After minimal verification, open a bank account in each name [if there is not already one], seed it with Aadhaar and transfer Rs. 3000 into each bank account,” he said.

Other suggestions included offering wage subsidy to all registered employers who pay their employees during the lockdown period, asking banks to defer payment of EMIs until June 30, extend the deadline to pay taxes until June 30 and cut down goods and services tax (GST) on essential commodities.

“Cut GST rates by 5 per cent on all wage goods, essential goods and services, and all goods of mass consumption for the period 1 April to 30 June 2020,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dqnks5/article31161324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25CHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chidambaram-terms-pms-lockdown-announcement-a-watershed-moment/article31161325.ece

At least 45 crore Indians work on daily wages, with the ongoing lockdown owing to COVID-19 outbreak which has been extended to 21 days, without any concrete assurances from the government, they have been pushed into chaos, CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his Tuesday night address.

Mr. Yechury in his letter called the address very disappointing since once again Mr. Modi failed to provide any relief to the poor and the needy. He said that the government had so far not come up with any measure to assist the poor migrants who were most hurt by the lockdown.

Most of them were stranded en route without food or shelter, Mr. Yechury wrote.

“How will they reach safe spaces? How will they survive without money or food and with reports of police harassment too? They are running for safety, helter-skelter, as there appear to be no means of transport being made available to them nor any money being given to them to make basic ends meet,” Mr. Yechury added.

This was the opposite of social distancing that we needed at the moment to battle this pandemic.

‘₹15,000 cr. package too miniscule’

The ₹15,000 crore healthcare package announced by the Prime Minister was too less, Mr. Yechury wrote. Taunting Mr. Modi he said, it was surprising that the government that often talked of $5-trillon economy had only ₹15,000 crore to spare. It amounted to a meagre ₹112 per citizen, he pointed out.

“₹ 7.78 lakh crore bailouts to rich corporates or the ₹1.76 lakh crore of tax break announced for them surely means we can spare more than this for the health of our people who face such a grave danger. Why have you not taxed the super rich to save poor lives?”

In the 2020 Budget, the government announced a cut in health expenditure even when a global pandemic was in sight, Mr. Yechury said chiding the government. He pointed out that All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) got a paltry hike of 0.1 %. The biggest dip in allocation was for the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana — from ₹156 crore to ₹ 29 crore. The allocation to the Ayushman Bharat Yojana remained unchanged though it should have been increased. “Shockingly, the allocation towards schemes dealing with communicable diseases remained unchanged at ₹2,178 crore,” he added.

Criticising the government, Mr. Yechury said that these “criminal cuts” in the health budget made us vulnerable. India also lost the lead time of almost two and a half months to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of the world without doing much.

“You must give every Indian their due at this difficult time. This would mean that you announce clear steps, both for economic assistance at a time of this difficult lockdown and on the testing, tracing and public health measures we need to undertake right away. Both are important if we are to defeat this pandemic before it is too late,” Mr .Yechury added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vex90n/article31160667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN25LABOURER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/crackdown-has-pushed-daily-wagers-into-chaos-sitaram-yechury-writes-to-pm-modi/article31160670.ece

The Union Home Ministry has asked private security agencies not to lay off guards or deduct their salaries during the 21-day lockdown period announced to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

In a letter to the Central Association of Private Security Industry, CII, FICCI and ASSOCHAM and others, the Home Ministry said India was facing an unprecedented situation arising out of the COVID-19 outbreak.

This has also affected economic activity and it is possible that private security agencies may be impacted due to closure of shops, malls and other establishments.

“This is the time for the private security industry to adopt a humane approach and protect its workers and staff members from lay-offs and consequent decrease in earnings.

“I would, therefore, urge the industry for empathy with its workforce, vital to its functioning, and ensure that these workers continue to be treated on duty and paid accordingly,” the ministry said in its letter.

61,2020/03/25,COVID-19 | Five more cases detected in western Maharashtra,"While details are awaited, it is believed that the members of this family from Sangli’s Islampur tehsil either themselves had a history of travel to West Asia or were close contacts of previously diagnosed cases.

Maharashtra’s ‘sugar heartland’ witnessed a surge in COVID-19 cases after five members of a family in Sangli district in the western part of the State tested positive, said authorities on Wednesday. The State’s tally of positive cases rose to 112.

While details are awaited, it is believed that the members of this family from Sangli’s Islampur tehsil either themselves had a history of travel to West Asia or were close contacts of previously diagnosed cases.

On Monday, four members of a family from the same tehsil with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia tested positive, making them the first cases in the district.

With this, Sangli now has a total nine positive COVID-19 cases. Hitherto untouched by the scourge of the virus, Sangli and Satara districts have witnessed a spurt in positive cases in the last 72 hours.

On Tuesday, the Sangli district police lodged a complaint against a father-son duo of a family hailing from Nepal and living in the district’s Miraj tehsil for violating home quarantine orders.

According to authorities, the family of four, which had settled in Karnal in Miraj for some years, used to eke out a living by doing menial tasks and freelancing as labourers. Earlier this month, the father and the son had returned from Nepal and had been kept under strict quarantine, which they violated.

On Monday, Maharashtra's sugar-belt districts recorded their first positive cases after a 45-year woman from Satara with travel history to Dubai was tested. A second case in Satara emerged after a 63-year-old gentleman, who recently returned from California, tested positive for the virus.

While Ahmednagar district has recorded three cases thus far, the total number of positive cases in Pune district stands at 31. The number of patients in Pune is 19 while Pimpri-Chinchwad has recorded 12 positive cases. The third Ahmednagar patient who tested positive is said to have no history of foreign travel, which has caused concern among authorities.

Meanwhile, a Pune-based couple, who were the first COVID-19 positive cases in Maharashtra, are set to be discharged from Naidu Hospital after their samples following the 14-day isolation period, as well as their repeat samples taken 24 hours later, tested negative, said health officials.

The couple, who were admitted on March 9, would be taken home in a Pune Municipal Corporation ambulance on the occasion of ‘Gudi Padwa’ on March 25, said Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, expressing relief and happiness.

He said that the other immediate contacts of the couple who had tested positive were on the road to recovery as well. On March 10, three other family members of the Pune couple as well as the cab driver who ferried them from Mumbai airport to Pune on their return from Dubai on March 1 had tested positive.

The Pune couple had travelled to Dubai in the last week of February and were part of a 40-member tour group and returned to India on March 1.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/f3k8s8/article31160237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MAHARASHTRATALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-five-more-cases-detected-in-western-maharashtra/article31160238.ece

A batch of 277 people evacuated from the coronavirus-hit Iran arrived at the Jodhpur airport in Rajasthan on Wednesday early morning, a defence spokesperson said.

He said preliminary screening of the evacuees, mostly pilgrims, was conducted at the airport upon arrival and thereafter they were taken to the Army Wellness Facility set up at the Jodhpur Military Station.

The Army, in coordination with the Rajasthan state medical authorities and civil administration, has made adequate medical and administrative arrangements to ensure a comfortable stay for the evacuees and provide prophylactic medical support, he said.

The defence spokesperson said that the facility has a dedicated team of Army doctors, who will be constantly monitoring the health parameters of the evacuees for the duration of their stay.

Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Rohit Kumar Singh said that 273 of the evacuees are pilgrims.

63,2020/03/25,"COVID-19 | Govt gives power to zonal DCs to take strict action against landlords evicting docs, paramedics","The decision was taken after the resident doctors of AIIMS sought the government’s intervention.

The government on Wednesday gave power to zonal Deputy Commissioners to take “strict penal action” against landlords who have been forcing doctors and paramedical staff, engaged in fighting COVID-19, to vacate their rented premises.

According to a government notification, such behaviour “not only strikes at the root of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but also tantamount to obstruction of duty of essential services“.

Invoking the Delhi Epidemics Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, it said the district magistrates, zonal deputy commissioners of municipal corporations and the deputy commissioner of police are “directed to take strict penal action against such landlords and house owners under the relevant provisions of law“.

These officials have also been asked to submit their Action Taken Report on a daily basis.

The decision was taken after the resident doctors of India’s premier hospital AIIMS on Tuesday sought the government’s intervention saying their colleagues were facing eviction from their homes by their landlords, who fear the medical professionals at the forefront of the fight against the novel coronavirus could be infected.

In a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah, the Resident Doctors Association said many staffers were “stranded on roads” with all their luggage, and urged him to immediately release an order prohibiting landlords from evicting the health care professionals working tirelessly against the virus from their rented houses.

Mr. Shah has spoken to the Delhi police chief and asked him to take immediate action to ensure the security of doctors facing harassment.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had also said he was “deeply anguished” by the reports of medical staff being “ostracised”. He reminded the landlords that the whole country had applauded the selfless services of healthcare professionals in these critical times by beating utensils, ringing bells and blowing conch shells from self-quarantine.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/re06xx/article31151086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIAVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-govt-gives-power-to-zonal-dcs-to-take-strict-action-against-landlords-evicting-docs-paramedics/article31159342.ece
64,2020/03/25,Govt bans export of anti-malarial drug hydroxycloroquine,"Over the last few weeks, India has banned exports of host of medical devices including sanitisers, all types of ventilators and surgical masks.

Amid the coronavirus outbreak, the government on Wednesday banned export of anti-malarial drug hydroxycloroquine, with immediate effect to ensure sufficient availability of the medicine in the domestic market.

Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava had on Monday recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating healthcare workers handling suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases and also the asymptomatic household contacts of the lab-confirmed cases.

Watch | COVID-19: Masks and sanitisers are now essential commodities

The treatment protocol recommended by the ICMR-constituted National Task Force for COVID-19 has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) for restricted use in emergency situations.

In a notification issued on Wednesday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), an arm of the commerce ministry which deals with export and import-related matters, said, “The export of hydroxycloroquine and formulations made from hydroxycloroquine is prohibited with immediate effect“.

It, however, said the government will allow export of the medicine on humanitarian grounds on case-to-case basis on the Ministry of External Affairs’ recommendation.

It added, “Export will be allowed in case of shipments where irrevocable letter of credit has been issued before the date of this notification or in case where full advance payment has been received by the exporter in India against specific shipment, subject to submission of documentary evidence.”

65,2020/03/25,Airlines rush to get crew and aircraft to home bases,"Videos of cabin crew alleging discrimination go viral

As all domestic commercial flights were suspended from midnight Tuesday, the big headache for crew members on duty was to end their flights at their home bases instead of in other cities. There are many whose families are being harassed and ostracised in certain areas.

Knowing the problems being faced by the pilots, cabin crew and ground staff, airlines acted fast to get the crew and aircraft to their home bases where they can remain till April 14.

Videos of cabin crew members from two different airlines — one from Air India and the other from IndiGo — alleging discrimination by neighbours and vendors in local markets around their residences went viral.

In a statement, Air India said it was alarming to note that in many localities, vigilante resident welfare associations and neighbours started ostracising the crew, obstructing them from performing their duty or even calling in the police, because the crew travelled abroad in the line of duty.

On Tuesday, most flights on leading sectors such as Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Bengaluru went with near full loads, indicating that passengers headed to cities where they would have to spend the lockdown period. A Vistara spokesperson said, “We are operating today on a reduced network for our customers and to bring back the operating and layover crew back to their respective home bases within the deadline.”

A SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline had booked many of its crew on other airlines so that they could be at home with their loved ones and ensure social-distancing till the flying resumed on March 31. “We have ensured that all operating crew reach base stations tonight. Some crew will be travelling on other airlines to reach their home bases. All their tickets have been provided by the airline,” the spokesperson said.

A Mumbai crew member of Air India has been told by her housing society to look for alternative accommodation. “Is working for a national carrier and getting back our people safely back home a crime? My society called up my husband to inform me that we should move out and manage something elsewhere as a precautionary measure. I am very proud and fortunate that I am one of the many who are helping people in this pandemic,” she wrote to the airline.

An Air India spokesperson said the vigilantes had forgotten that many a spouse, parent, sibling and child had been brought home safe from affected countries, thanks to the efforts of the Air India crew.

66,2020/03/25,Railways exploring manufacture of medical items,"The Indian Railways is exploring the possibility of manufacturing select essential medical items such as hospital beds, medical trolleys and sanitizers at its various production units. In a communique to general managers at its production units, the Railway Board on Tuesday asked them to “assess the feasibility to manufacture these items in large quantities [as may be required] at short notice. Items identified thus may be communicated to the Board along with its likely production rate.”

Observing that the COVID-19 pandemic had gripped the country, the Railway Board said that in this dire situation the manufacturing capacities of the Indian Railways would likely be needed to be harnessed.

“Manufacturing facilities available in Indian Railways... can be utilised to manufacture items like simple hospital beds (without mattress), medical trolleys for hospitals and quarantine facilities, IV stands, stretchers, hospital footsteps, hospital bedside lockers, washbasins with stands, ventilators, and PPEs like masks, sanitizers, etc.”

It added that other items requiring sheet metal fabrication work, welding and machining could also be manufactured in various production units including Chittaranjan Loco Works, Chittaranjan; Integral Coach Factory, Chennai; Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala; Diesel Loco Works, Varanasi and Rail Wheel Factory, Yelahanka.

“The exact items to be manufactured may be decided in consultation with Principal Chief Medical directors in your Railway/ production units,” the Board said.

Separately, the Indian Railways has decided that contractual and outsourcing staff, who are engaged in providing services such as on-board housekeeping, sanitation, pantry cars, will be treated on duty and will be paid accordingly even as passenger train services remain suspended.

The move will benefit at least 50,000 workers.

In an order issued on Tuesday, the railways has said that due to the prevailing coronavirus situation in India and the stoppage of passenger trains, several contractual staff engaged in on-board housekeeping service, sanitation, pantry car and commercial activities have been stranded and have to compulsorily stay at other places, while others have to be in readiness to attend to duties at a short notice.

“In order to reduce the hardship being faced by these workers, Board has decided to treat the employees of private establishments (including temporary, contractual, outsourced) engaged in providing services in trains, stations and offices, directly affected with suspension of services and lockdown situations, as on duty and be paid accordingly till the expiry of suspension of services/lockdown or as advised by the central government in this regard,” the board said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nu4db6/article31157807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THLTHEALTH-CORONAVIRUSINDIA-ESTIMATES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railways-exploring-manufacture-of-medical-items/article31157808.ece

68,2020/03/25,Anxiety grips Bhopal gas tragedy survivors as hospital designated as COVID-19 facility,"Several patients including critical ones were discharged to make way for virus-affected

After the Madhya Pradesh government designated the ICMR-run Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) as the State-level COVID-19 treatment facility and stopped all other services there, anxiety gripped the Bhopal gas tragedy survivors who depend on it for super speciality care.

“Only patients suffering from the infection will be treated there now,” read an order issued by Pallavi Jain Govil, Principal Secretary, Public Health and Family Welfare Department, on Monday.

“I undergo dialysis three times a week there. Missing even one session could cost me my life,” said Aqueel Ahmad, undergoing the procedure for 10 years. “In such a condition where will I go now? Even in the OPD, they say no doctor will see us.”

On Tuesday, several patients including critical ones were discharged to make way for the special COVID-19 facility. Four patients were discharged from the gastro medicine ward, three from the cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CTVS), one from the CTVS ICU, 10 patients from gastro surgery, seven from urology, 28 from pulmonary, one patient from nephrology, two from neurology, 15 from psychiatry, 11 from neurosurgery and six from ophthalmology, according to BMHRC sources.

Giving the reassurance that alternative arrangements had been put in place for the patients, Ms. Govil told The Hindu, “The State government runs six dedicated hospitals for gas victims. They will cover all health care needs of the victims.”

So far, the State has recorded nine COVID-19 cases, with six in Jabalpur and one each in Bhopal, Shivpuri and Gwalior.

Rachna Dhingra of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action said, “Each day, around 4,000 survivors get their medicines from the hospitals. The government has taken away the only hospital that offers special services.”

According to an order dated March 24 and issued by Dr. Prabha Desikan, BMHRC Director, all other health services were stopped there with immediate effect till further orders.

Moreover, on March 21, rights groups including the Bhopal Group for Information and Action working for the welfare of the Bhopal gas tragedy survivors wrote to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan demanding adequate testing and critical facilities for them, in view of their heightened vulnerability to the pandemic.

According to the eight community health centres of the BMHRC, which cater to the survivors, wrote the groups, from 1998 to 2016, 50.4% of gas-affected patients suffered from cardiovascular problems, 59.6% from pulmonary problems and 15.6% from diabetes. Furthermore, 10,550 (1.84% of the survivors) had been given ex gratia compensation as cancer patients.

The groups pointed out that given the magnitude of the health hazard posed by the methyl isocyanate leak from a pesticide unit here in 1984, the Supreme Court had accorded the survivors’ right to healthcare the status of the Fundamental Right to Life under the Constitution.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anxiety-grips-bhopal-gas-tragedy-survivors-as-hospital-designated-as-covid-19-facility/article31157647.ece

70,2020/03/25,Central help sought to bail out Discoms,"With bill collections plummeting by nearly 80%, they are facing liquidity crunch

The COVID-19 containment measures have dealt such a severe blow to the Andhra Pradesh power distribution companies (Discoms) that Energy Department Secretary N. Srikant has written a letter to the Union Ministry of Power (MoP) requesting its supply chain support and help in mitigating liquidity crunch. This is intended to keep the ailing Discoms afloat as their losses have been piling up for many years due to multiple factors, including some extraneous ones.

Mr. Srikant has informed the Secretary of the MoP that there has been a drastic fall in electricity bill collections by up to 80% in the last few days though e-billing and online payments are available as people could not move out due to the lockdown. As a consequence, the Discoms’ revenue dipped suddenly.

Debt servicing

The Discoms use their daily collections for debt servicing and to pay to the power generators, who in turn make daily payments for coal suppliers, the Railways and lenders.

The inability of the Discoms to make prompt payments because of the steep fall in bill collections is affecting the coal payments and coal transport by the Railways, and also debt servicing to the banks and financial institutions, the Energy Secretary has stated.

Mr. Srikant has also said that the daily demand for electricity fell by 20% due to the shutdown of various commercial, business and industrial establishments, and that unless the Discoms meet their scheduled payment obligations, they will not only be unable to make coal procurement but also find it extremely difficult to maintain buffer stocks.

‘Make it essential service’

To help the Discoms in tiding over the crisis, Mr. Srikant has requested the MoP to declare coal mining activity, along with connected forward/ backward linkages such as coal transport, as essential service and ensure regular availability of coal, direct all suppliers and miners to deliver coal as per the existing fuel supply agreements without insisting on daily payments till the crisis ends, and to get the Railways to transport coal without asking for immediate payments.

Besides, Mr. Srikant has requested the Singareni Collieries Company Limited to supply coal to AP-Genco and A.P. Power Development Company Limited, irrespective of their outstanding payments.

Mr. Srikant has further suggested that the RBI be requested to instruct the banks to extend time to power generators and Discoms for repaying debts and interests due till March 31 without classifying their accounts as sub-standard /NPA, to direct banks, PFC, REC etc. to give short and medium term loans to the Discoms and power producers to enable them to raise working capital and to relax FRBM limits to facilitate government guarantees.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/m5cgj4/article30893805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22VJVRA2DharmaGAC75F1EU3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/central-help-sought-to-bail-out-discoms/article31168111.ece
71,2020/03/25,Medical colleges to be converted into exclusive zones to treat COVID-hit,"Experts seek Medical Council of India’s nod to adopt telemedicine for wider reachout

Moving beyond the isolation wards created in hospitals to treat the COVID-19 cases, the Medical and Health authorities are gearing up to scale up infrastructure by converting the medical colleges into exclusive zones to treat the patients.

Eight confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the State so far. To be able to treat a large number of patients, if the need arises, the authorities propose to create 500 to 800 beds exclusively for the coronavirus patients. The proposal is to vacate medical colleges affiliated to the Government General Hospitals and divert the general patients to other hospitals.

The Siddhartha Medical College in Vijayawada, the Government General Hospital in Nellore and the Visakhapatnam Institute of Medical Sciences will be converted into COVID hospitals.

It may be noted here that going by the rapidity of the spread of the virus and the size and density of the population at risk, experts have asked the Medical Council of India (MCI) to allow telemedicine for a wider reachout.

A challenge

Faced with the challenge of preventing community transmission by isolating potential transmitters, the health authorities are trying to do all they can to contain the spread.

The number of cases increase when the population gets exposed and a large number of patients will need respiratory care.

“We are trying to create 400 beds with ventilators and all facilities to provide effective treatment to around 1,000 virus-afflicted patients in intensive care units and another 2,000 beds for the virus-hit,” Director of Medical Education K. Venkatesh told The Hindu.

Creating a chain of secondary and tertiary level hospitals is among other steps being taken to address the issue.

Community transmission

Even as health experts across the country fear many more infections and deaths before the novel coronavirus runs its course, Dr. Venkatesh says the focus at the moment is on preventing community transmission as it can spell a serious problem.

“After the lockdown, we need to see how the situation develops,” he says, emphasising the need for the affected persons to strictly adhere to the quarantine period.

“In the States such as Maharashtra and Kerala, secondary transmission has become a reality. Our efforts are aimed at averting such a situation,” he says.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/medical-colleges-to-be-converted-into-exclusive-zones-to-treat-covid-hit/article31168096.ece

The company has put in place a corporate task force, comprising senior leadership and medical professionals, to scan the entire operating environment (internal as well as external), review the operating guidelines released by the Central and State governments, and formulate and execute an action plan to check the pandemic.

Awareness drive

Apart from promoting awareness, the company has released posters, FAQs, audio-visual, and hoardings within its manufacturing locations, sales offices and cafeterias.

Headquartered in the city, the group has put in place measures such as making available hand sanitizers at all entry / exit gates and personal protective equipment such as masks. Besides, it is disinfecting work areas, which include high touch points, toilets and transport vehicles, and ensuring social distancing.

After a COVID-19 case from Srikalahasti town turned positive, the municipal body got down to action by spraying disinfectant all over the temple town.

Drone sanitisers were employed to ensure that the entire town was covered within a short time. The drones sprayed the disinfectant on all the streets as well as the rooftops. Wearing mask, local legislator Biyyapu Madhusudhan Reddy walked all over the four mada streets following the drone and warned people against coming out.

“It is unfortunate that the first positive case emerged from our town, but there is no need for the public to panic. People will have to stay indoors and alert the government about people who recently returned from abroad,” he said.

Mr. Reddy also flayed the educated lot for exhibiting ‘utter carelessness’ and spreading the virus all over. He was particularly serious about those who had gone abroad for studies and returned home without getting themselves tested. He announced that he would bring one lakh lakh masks from Hyderabad.

The village and ward volunteers, who have come in handy for the State government to track down foreign returnees in the event of COVID-19 outbreak, are being hailed for their services by the people.

In addition to the list of over 7,000 foreign returnees sent by the Central government, volunteers traced about 7,000 returnees more by the end of the survey.

As of Wednesday, a majority of the returnees had been traced and the volunteers are once again making door-to-door visits following the orders of resurvey by the government.

“Volunteers along with Asha workers are enquiring about the health condition of the returnees and their close contacts at regular intervals. We upload the information on a special mobile application created for the purpose and it is reviewed by the higher officials,” B. Lavanya, a village volunteer, said.

Multiple visits

“Volunteers made multiple visits without us having to take the pain of informing health officials about the condition of our kin who have returned from abroad,” said a woman of Kanuru.

Also, volunteers have to follow up the health condition of suspected cases by visiting them once in two days. Some of the volunteers were also engaged in sanitisation works in rural areas.

Taking all precautions, girls plucked raw mangoes from the garden in the backyard to prepare the special ‘Ugadi Pachchadi’ with sweet, sour,salt, pungent, spice and bitter taste to imbibe the right attitude to face the rough and tumble of life with equanimity.

The customary almanac reading was done away with, in temples including Chennakesavaswamy temple and Ayyappa temple in Ongole, which closed down early in the day after performance of customary rituals by priests.

Astrological predictions for the new year, live-streaming on the social media and television channels, offered a solace to people. Vedic priest Matampalli Dakshinamurthy appealed to people to not visit any temple until the restrictions were eased.

Distance matters

“Precautions for maintaining social distancing have to be taken at every decentralised outlet. Only one person from a family has to come out for getting essentials and that too within a radius of 3 km,” he added.

80,2020/03/25,Sanitation worker bats for total lockdown in Chittoor,"Balakrishna ensures hygiene in his colony while juggling jobs

Despite facing several problems on the domestic and work front, R. Balakrishna aka Bala (28), an outsourced sanitation worker of Puttur municipality in Chittoor district, takes pride in working for the success of the COVID-19 lockdown, in addition to his regular work.

Mr. Balakrishna collects garbage door-to-from over 300 houses in Aretamma Colony of Puttur. Though he did his Intermediate, poverty forced him to join as an outsourced civic worker seven years ago. Waste collection, which started as a job, gradually turned into a habit. “When I embark on work each day, I feel that I form the first ring of protection for the people of my colony,” he said.

When viral fevers like dengue and typhoid gripped the western mandals in recent years, Mr. Bala was known for his concerted efforts to keep the colony clean. He was largely successful in making women to keep the waste basket on their compound walls before going to bed.

A couple of weeks ago, a family that returned from abroad arrived into the colony and was quarantined. Seeing them moving freely, Mr. Bala kept educating them to follow the norms of quarantine. He even urges people to avoid sending their children to play in the streets.

Mr. Bala say the sudden lockdown due to COVID-19 had depressed him. “But, I strongly support this. When this pandemic will die, the people would realise the importance and meaning of the lockdown. It will give them a strong sense of discipline, particularly to children,” he said.

The Puttur municipality is facing acute shortage of sanitary workers, with about 20% of them on leave on any given day. “My wife is going to give birth to a child next month. I earn ₹400 a day. In order to support my family, I hardly take leave,” he says.

Vijayalakshmi (70), a resident of the colony, said that during lockdown there is a possibility of garbage piling up and waste produced would also double due to increase in cooking. “A worker like Bala is an asset to our colony. We always stay assured that our area is free from all illnesses due to mosquitoes. At this critical time of lockdown, his urge to see people strictly inside homes is laudable,” she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sanitation-worker-bats-for-total-lockdown-in-chittoor/article31167609.ece
81,2020/03/25,Flippant attitude will harm the country: Tirupati MLA,"Bhumana takes out rally for third consecutive day urging residents to stay home

Member of the Legislative Assembly from Tirupati, Bhumana Karunakara Reddy, hit the streets for the third consecutive day on Wednesday to exhort residents not to venture out of their homes during the ongoing nationwide lockdown in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. Reddy, who hit the streets in the morning, criss-crossed the town urging the public to confine themselves to their homes and cooperate with the government to contain the spread of the disease.

The MLA greeted motorcyclists and advised them to remain at home unless absolutely necessary. On Tuesday, he visited the crowded Indira Priyadarshini vegetable market and Rythu Bazaar and appealed to the public to restrain from gathering in large numbers at a single place.

He also assured them that the groceries would be supplied at their doorstep from Wednesday, and that there was no need for panic.

Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Reddy lamented that residents did not seem to take seriously the lockdown measures being enforced by the Central and State governments to contain the spread of COVID-19.

“Though the public needs to be commended for staying indoors on March 22 paying heed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a ‘Janata Curfew’, it was disappointing to see thousands of motorists hitting the road the very next day unmindful of the fact that the country was facing a crisis,” he said.

“It is with a hope that the public will change its approach towards the pandemic that I have taken to the streets to spread this message,” the MLA said.

Later, he held discussions with corporation officials to explore the feasibility of shifting the venue of rythu bazaars to spacious grounds.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/flippant-attitude-will-harm-the-country-tirupati-mla/article31167517.ece

The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, was operating an AQF at Neelankarai, Chennai, through MPEDA’s R&D wing, Rajiv Gandhi Cente for Aquaculture (RGCA).

An old facility

MPEDA was quarantining imported brood stocks and Post Parental Larvae (PPL) of pacific while leg shrimp (L. Vannamei) and Tiger shrimp (P. Monodon) for the last 10 years. Brood stocks were imported by Indian hatcheries after obtaining Sanitary Import Permits (SIPs) from the Department of Fisheries. Later, the brood stocks will be used for producing seed.

The AQF has 20 cubicles for quarantine operations and the hatchery operators will book the cubicles in advance.

“Since 2009, we quarantined more than 15 lakh brood stocks imported from various countries mainly from USA with 94 per cent quarantine survival in the AQF. This has resulted in manifold increase in aquaculture production in the country. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at a press conference on Tuesday, announced several relaxations to the aqua sector to tide over the present situation arising due to Coronavirus,” said MPEDA Chairman K.S. Srinivas.

Three months extension

The minister extended SIPs for three months which were to expire on April 15, 2020. Import of any consignment during this period, if delayed for a month shall be overlooked.

Rebooking of quarantine cubicles at AQF for cancelled consignments in AQF, Chennai, will be allowed without any additional charges, which will he helpful for hatchery owners. Verification of documents and grant of No Objection Certificate (NOC) for quarantine would be relaxed, Ms. Sitharaman assured, the Chairman said.

A breather for all

RGCA all India Project Director S. Kandan said the cubicles in the AQF will be opened from April 15 to September end, 2020, for the first half of 2020-2021, to enable hatchery operators in the country to use the facility.

The Government of India’s decision will help some lakhs of aqua farmers, hatchery owners, seed producers and other stakeholders in the country in wake of the crisis which arose due to COVID-19, Mr. Srinivas said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-relaxes-import-at-aqf/article31162964.ece
92,2020/03/25,"Amid lockdown, door delivery of groceries likely to improve situation in Tirupati","Staff movement is still a roadblock, and uncertainty hangs over stock replenishment

In view of the lockdown implemented to curtail public movement, the measure announced by the Municipal Corporation of Tirupati (MCT) to allow door delivery of groceries to the doorsteps is expected to drastically bring down the number of people scrambling for procuring the same.

Departmental stores, shopping malls and super markets have been directed to completely shut down operations, in view of the high footfalls they normally register on any given day. However, smaller general stores and groceries located in lanes and market areas are allowed to be open in the early hours of the day.

Few stores permitted

MCT has issued orders permitting four super markets, having six outlets across the city, to door-deliver groceries to the denizens and prominently publicised their mobile numbers. The registration numbers of their cargo vehicles were also prominently mentioned in the order copy so as to facilitate their free movement on the city roads that are thoroughly guarded by lathi-wielding policemen. This way, the civic body aims to drastically bring down the number of people thronging the roads.

The super markets are learnt to be getting sufficient orders over telephone, which are being dispatched in phases. “We have pressed four cargo auto rickshaws into service to distribute the groceries and have received 200 orders before 10.30 am today,” said P. Balaji, partner at Pasuparthy Super Market, one of the four allowed by MCT. Our store will be able to supply groceries for the next four to five days, if the demand remains constant, Mr. Balaji added.

Identity issues

Though permission has been accorded for vehicular movement, staff of several super markets failed to reach the originating point on time. “Early in the day, policemen stopped us at various points and asked us to clear the spot, as we do not possess an identity card issued by an authorised agency indicating our role in the discharge of such emergency services,” said a delivery boy of another hyper market. The outlets also faced hiccups in the internal movement of stock between warehouses and points of sale.

With the shelves getting empty faster than ever and the stores running out of stock, replenishment could become a serious issue in the foreseeable future. As the roads leading into the city are completely locked down, supply of stock to the super markets appears to be a nightmare. Though no panic button has been pressed as of now, the State government has to take a quick decision to overcome this challenge in a day or two.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/o3cnqr/article31162372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th25tirupati-grocery,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/amid-lockdown-door-delivery-of-groceries-likely-to-improve-situation-in-tirupati/article31162373.ece

With the COVID-19 outbreak entering stage 2 in the State, the authorities are going to take up targeted testing of every person showing symptoms of the disease irrespective of travel history or proximity to foreign returnees and confirmed cases.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Additional Chief Secretary P.V. Ramesh appealed to people to report to the authorities concerned if they experience dry cough, shortness of breath and other symptoms of COVID-19 by calling the toll-free number 104.

“The healthcare personnel concerned will reach out to you and take you to isolation. People can also report about relatives and acquaintances showing symptoms of COVID-19 and necessary testing will be carried out,” Dr. Ramesh said.

High-risk persons with existing ailments such as diabetes, blood pressure, tuberculosis, asthma and smoking habit should be careful and report to the government even if they notice minor symptoms, he said. He said the government is ready to tackle the situation and people’s cooperation is paramount in fighting the virus.

200 ventilators ordered

The State has over 800 ventilators at present and orders for the purchase of 200 more have been placed.

The government has over one lakh N-95 masks for healthcare personnel and 10,000 patient protection equipment are available in the State, he added.

He said the government has identified retired and private doctors, nurses, voluntary organisations that can be roped in to serve in future if necessary. Dr. Ramesh said it is possible to contain the spread of the virus and staying at home during the lockdown is the key.

He said the government is contemplating relaxation of timings set for the purchase of essentials in the morning.

95,2020/03/25,Police resort to mild lathicharge in Chittoor,"Cases booked against 112 persons for defying lockdown

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar on Tuesday made a whirlwind inspection of the public places in Chittoor Municipal Corporation and surrounding mandals, enforcing the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Cases were booked against 112 violators under various sections of the IPC.

Following reports of non-cooperation from the public to the COVID-19 lockdown, the SP along with senior police officers manned both the arterial junctions and the narrow streets of Chittoor, urging the public to comply with the lockdown norms in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

Tension prevailed at Jyothi Talkies area in Tirupati when police resorted to a mild lathicharge to prevent the gathering of public on the roads, particularly youths who were triple-riding on motorcycles.

There were no signs of a lockdown till afternoon, when the police entered the scene and went about putting up barricades. From 2 p.m., all public places gradually became deserted.

Inspections were conducted at MSR Circle, Dargah junction, Santhapeta, Kongareddipalle, Church Street and other busy locations, apart from Gudipala and GD Nellore mandals.

Mr. Senthil Kumar said that residents have no option but to cooperate with the police and stay indoors till March 31. “Keeping in view the importance of essential commodities, we are allowing just one person from each family to fulfill their requirement within the stipulated time. Considering the public safety and guidelines of the lockdown exercise, the violators would be brought to book,” the SP said.

Police personnel at Satyavedu, Nagalapuram, Nagari, and Karveti Nagaram in the eastern mandals and at Bangarupalem, Palamaner and Kuppam circles had sealed the borders with Tamil Nadu and barred the entry and exit of the vehicles at the border checkposts, except for the essential commodities. The lockdown was complete on all national highways passing through the district. The border with Karnataka at Punganur, Palamaner, Shantipuram and B. Kothakota was also kept under strict surveillance.

Meanwhile, Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA) chairman and MLA Chevireddi Bhaskar Reddy arranged distribution of about 3.4 lakh sanitiser bottles for the families of Chandragiri assembly constituency.

101,2020/03/25,Health Minister urges people to stay home,"Alla Nani expresses concern over public disregarding lockdown regulations

Stressing that social distancing is the only way to tackle COVID-19, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Health Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Alla Nani) has appealed to the public to cooperate with the government by not coming out of houses during the lockdown period. He expressed displeasure over many people venturing out of their homes without any reason disregarding the prohibitory orders.

At a press conference here on Tuesday, he lauded the doctors, municipal staff, police and other government officials working for the safety of public. He said that public need to understand these efforts and stick to their homes with social responsibility.

7 positive cases

Mr. Srinivas said the State had reported seven COVID-19 cases, including three from Visakhapatnam. The government had identified 14,038 foreign returnees till date and 2,426 of them had completed 28 days of home isolation. As of now, 11,560 were undergoing home isolation and 52 were in hospital, he added.

Of the 181 samples tested as on date, seven were positive for coronavirus and 166 negative. Reports of eight samples were awaited, he said.

Alert in Vizag

Visakhapatnam had already entered the second stage of COVID-19 and the first case of direct transmission was reported a few days ago. “In the third stage, the virus spread would be rapid among public. Citizens should be under self-isolation in homes in order to prevent it,” the Miinster said.

He said that the district administration had formed 20 committees to tackle the COVID-19 threat in the district.

“The foreign returnees in the district are under constant watch. Till now, 1,470 have been identified. A new list of 2,400 foreign returnees has been given by the Central government and they will be tracked within 24 hours,” the Minister added.

Mr. Srinivas said he would discuss setting up of COVID-19 testing laboratory at Visakhapatnam with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The government would also ensure adequate ventilators at all hospitals having isolation wards, he added.

“From March 29, the State government will be giving free ration for the beneficiaries. The Chief Minister has also announced ₹1,000 for every BPL family,” he said.

The Minister said former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu “should stop politicising each and every situation”. The State government was ready to accept if Mr. Naidu gave any valuable suggestion, but would not tolerate if he created hurdles for every move of the government, he said.

102,2020/03/25,Govt. mulling ordinance route to meet expenses,"Assembly session scheduled for March 27 looks uncertain due to COVID-19 threat

The State government, in view of COVID-19 threat, is “keeping all options” open on conducting the Assembly session from March 27 as scheduled earlier. It is toying with the proposal to issue an ordinance to meet expenditure in the initial months of the next fiscal, 2020-21.

Incidentally, the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat Employees’ Association has also urged the State government to take the ordinance route to meet the governmental expenditure.

According to information, the State government is exploring the safe line that needs to be adopted. “We are also, in view of the COVID threat, looking at all safeguards that are required. We are looking at (the) safest line,” sources say, indicating that there is a possibility of an ordinance being issued.

Constitutional validity

The association’s demand triggered a debate in the corridors of the Secretariat on the “constitutional validity of such an ordinance.” Association president K. Venkatrami Reddy says that the ordinance route was taken in 2004 in combined Andhra Pradesh. The then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu dissolved the Assembly and went for early polls after the Alipiri incident.

A former TDP Minister, however, says that the present situation cannot be compared with that of 2004. It will be improper to issue an ordinance of this nature if the Assembly is in session. In 2004, the assembly was dissolved. Then the government had every right to issue the ordinance (all ordinances are issued in the name and by the order of the Governor) for expenditure like any other purpose. Under Article 213 of the Constitution, it is fully competent to issue an ordinance on the expenditure for the next financial year. The Article empowers the governments to issue ordinances before getting them approved by an elected house at a later date. But now both Assembly and Council are existing. So, the government cannot take the ordinance route, the former minister contends.

‘No explicit bar’

Constitutional expert Jandhyala Ravi Shankar, however, says, “The government can issue an ordinance in view of the prevailing circumstances, as both houses are not in session.”

He says Article 123(1) empowers the President to promulgate an ordinance when one or both houses are not in session. Article 110 speaks about the competence of the Parliament to legislate on such matters which include money bill. Article 123(3) does not preclude President from promulgating any such ordinance on a matter which Parliament is competent to legislate on. That means Article 110 explicitly does not bar the President from exercising the legislative power. However, once Parliament is in session, the government has to explain the reason to the house that necessitated immediate legislation. However, if the Bill is not passed within six weeks of the assembly of Parliament, all acts done and completed under the ordinance will lapse, he explains.

The government is likely to announce its decision in a day. It has to issue an ordinance or go for at least vote on account if it were to pay salaries to employees and meet day to day expenditure from April 1. The government cannot charge expenditure on the consolidated fund of India after March 31 as the budget 2019-20 ends, sources say.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-mulling-ordinance-route-to-meet-expenses/article31156943.ece

104,2020/03/25,Couple finally tested negative,"They were admitted to special isolation ward at MCH on March 8

In a major relief to the health authorities, the COVID-19-affected couple from Kottayam have been finally tested negative for the infection.

The couple, who hail from Chengalam, near Kottayam, was admitted to the special isolation ward at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) in Kottayam on March 8 after coming into contact with the COVID-19-affected family from Pathanamthitta.

While they had been tested positive for the virus during the examination of the first four samples, the samples tested on March 18 and 20 were tested negative.

Meanwhile, the four-and-a-half-year old daughter of the couple was exempted from isolation after she had been tested negative. The child, however, was permitted to live with her parents at the isolation ward here.

‘Great relief’

The 34-year-old husband termed the recovery as a great relief. “I never had any health issues other than mild cough while my wife did not develop any uneasiness. What we had to do was to quarantine ourselves, take rest, and have healthy food to strengthen our immune system,” he said.

As they required taking care of their daughter during the period, they had to be cautious. “We took utmost care and precautions all these days to avoid her getting infected from us.

The cases were filed for crowding and opening of shops and venturing out on vehicles in violation of the restrictions.

Five persons were arrested for erecting a pandal in front of an estate office at Kaliyar on Tuesday.

Authorities also distributed masks made at the district jail to the public and institutions in the district on Tuesday.

Masks distributed

The police also facilitated the return of students from Marayur and Munnar who were stranded at the check-post after the completion of Plus Two exams in Tamil Nadu schools. Their parents had sought police intervention for the safe journey of students. The police arranged the vehicle and the stranded students were brought home.

Dedicated hospital

The district hospital at Karikode, near Thodupuzha, was converted to a dedicated hospital for treating COVID-19 patients. Though the building had been completed, there were no electricity and water connections.

110,2020/03/25,Tough times for newspaper delivery agents,"Misinformation in social media leads to customers cancelling subscription

M. Rajendran, who has been delivering newspapers every morning in the city for over a decade, is facing a tough challenge.

While the country is battling against the coronavirus through a 21-day lockdown, the frontline warriors of the newspaper industry like him have to counter the fears of the citizens that the newspapers could spread the disease.

“We have been delivering the newspaper and periodicals overcoming the inclement climate, hartals and other work pressures, but this is an altogether different situation. I have lost 17 newspapers in three days solely due to this misinformation through social media that newspapers are carriers of the virus,” says Rajendran who has been delivering 320 newspapers daily for 11 years in the Kowdiar, Ambalamukku and Nanthencode localities.

From Kannur

Rajendan, who hails from Iritty in Kannur, says his friend Vijesh who delivers in adjoining Jawahar Nagar, one of the first residential colonies of the State capital, has lost 35 newspapers. It is the educated people who are stopping the newspapers and are not ready to listen, he points out.

In one apartment complex in Kowdiar, the security personnel prevented us from delivering the newspapers at the doorstep and it was handed over at the security checkpoint. “What is the guarantee that it will be delivered to the apartments by them? I fear that whether the other five apartments where I deliver will follow suit in the coming days,” he says.

“We are wearing face masks and gloves and using sanitisers as asked by those in the apartment complexes. We are telling them how newspapers are printed and handled without human intervention and precautions being taken. But, some are not ready to listen and are stopping the newspapers. Stoppage of a newspaper will result in loss of ₹40,” he says. As Section 144 has been imposed in the district, Rajendran says he came prepared with the declaration to be carried by those stepping out as usual at 3.45 a.m. from his home at Vettikonam.

As usual, Rajenderan completed his delivery of newspapers by 6.30 a.m. and was back home in his motorcycle for a quick shower to be at Kalpana Medicals at Peroorkada by 7 a.m. Till 8 p.m., he dons the role of a salesman in the shop and then rushes to be with his wife Revathi and seven-year-old son Varun.

“I don’t fear the virus and all preventive steps are being taken during the delivery of newspapers and while at the shop ,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tough-times-for-newspaper-delivery-agents/article31167608.ece
111,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Vegetable prices start inching up in Thiruvananthapuram,"Delayed arrivals, restrictions on inter-State movement of lorries to blame

As the curbs imposed in view of the nationwide lockdown tighten, vegetables prices are going up in the city.

Shallots which cost ₹75 on Monday had increased to ₹110 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, onions cost ₹40, while tomato prices had gone up by ₹10.

Vegetable vendors say prices of only a few vegetables have gone up. Fresh stocks arrived on Wednesday, and it will be adequate for a day or two. Beyond that, it will be difficult to say what the situation will be if fresh truckloads of vegetables do not arrive from other States, he said.

K. Chidambaram, a vegetable and fruit commission agent in the Chala market and also president of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi’s vegetable wing, too says there is approximately a 30% increase in prices. Onions cost ₹24 to ₹30, while tomatoes cost ₹35.There is enough stock in the market for a couple of days, he says. However, shutdown of markets in other States, combined with restrictions along the inter-State border that lead to vehicles being turned away, will likely drive prices up.

Cannot be stocked

Unlike rice or pulses, vegetables cannot be stocked. Hence, it is imperative that the State government along with the government of other States act to remove any hurdles in transport of vegetables, or the people will suffer, he said.

A wholesale trader at the Ambalathara market says the restrictions on supply of vegetables should be eased, especially as the State is very dependent on arrivals from outside. “Prices were lower on Wednesday than the day before. However, once the number of loads dips, prices will go north.”

Short

Horticorp managing director J. Sajeev says supply of vegetables is short owing to checks at the inter-State border but the situation is expected to stabilise in a few days in the wake of government intervention.

Horticorp, he says, is focussing on promoting the produce of local farmers and is procuring these. Vegetables such as brinjal, lady’s finger, and onions which come from other States are in short supply. Panic buying is not helping matters. However, prices will stabilise soon.

Horticorp’s prices, he says, are very competitive with shallots priced at ₹70 and tomatoes at ₹22. Shelves at its outlets were empty by afternoon, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wtyjj3/article31167604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV26COVIDSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vegetable-prices-start-inching-up/article31167598.ece
112,2020/03/25,Incident response system in district,"498 more people under surveillance

Given the grim COVID-19 scenario, the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday activated the Incident Response System (IRS) at the district and taluk level. On Wednesday health officials placed 498 more people under disease surveillance in the district.

The tahsildars will act as Incident Commanders in each taluk, District Collector and DDMA chairman K. Gopalakrishnan said.

“'The Incident Commanders will be responsible for the overall implementation of COVID-19 control activities and ensuring the maintenance of essential services and supplies, including health infrastructure,” an order activating the Incident Response System said.

The secretaries of local bodies have been directed to ensure proper surveillance of people in home quarantine, establish community kitchens and door-step delivery of food and medicines and provide packed food to people admitted at quarantine centres.

The IRS guidelines are issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) under Section 6 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 for ‘’effective, efficient and comprehensive management of disasters.’’

Meanwhile, 498 more people have come under COVID-19 surveillance in the district. At the last count, 6,315 people are in home quarantine, while 94 others are under hospital observation. While 16 people who displayed symptoms were admitted to hospitals on Wednesday, 12 persons have been discharged.

Smooth passage

Smooth passage will be ensured for cargo across the Kanyakumari-Thiruvananthapuram border, it was decided at a meeting of District Collectors of Thiruvananthapuram and Kanyakumari on Wednesday.

Only two persons including the driver will be allowed inside the trucks.

With the lockdown placing restrictions on movement, the City Police is introducing online options for filing complaints and applications for services including Police Clearance Certificate, the City Police Commissioner said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/incident-response-system-in-district/article31167572.ece
113,2020/03/25,Service with a smile,"Emergency workforce in action

Binu Babu reaches across the counter and drops three milk sachets into the bag held open by the elderly customer.

“That's ₹69,” he says, peering over the gray mask covering the lower half of his face. The man quickly hands over the money and leaves as the next customer, a woman wearing a white mask, steps up to the counter.

By then, it's 11.30 a.m. But, on Wednesday, Binu had been manning the Milma milk counter at Sasthamangalam since 4.30 a.m. with milk purchases by households going up.

“'Earlier, we used to sell around 720-750 sachets a day. Now it has shot up to around 2,000 covers with people taking home five to ten sachets where they used to take two or three,” Binu said.

As Kerala struggles to come to terms with the fact of a global pandemic-induced lockdown, it is people like Binu - part of an emergency workforce that includes the police, private security guards, newspaper delivery boys, drivers and grocery merchants - who provide a semblance of normalcy to an otherwise upended social life.

While milk and curd top the demand list, there are also many takers for Milma’s ‘Sambharam’ on account of the blazing summer heat, the youngster from Attukal said. Before the lockdown, the outlet used to open at 5 p.m. and close at 9 p.m. The lockdown has also introduced revised work schedules. “On Tuesday, the police asked us to down shutters at 5 p.m,” Binu said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/service-with-a-smile/article31167558.ece
114,2020/03/25,Online booking for milk up,"App-based service AM Needs says it has risen by 200%

Online booking for milk has registered a sharp increase with more and more people opting to shop from their homes on account of the COVID-19 lockdown.

According to AM Needs, an app-based service provider which supplies milk and other dairy products of the Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) to customers, advance online bookings for milk in the State capital has risen by 200% after the lockdown.

In fact, the demand shot up to such an extent on Wednesday that AM Needs closed bookings for the day around 3 p.m. in Thiruvananthapuram city, said its CEO Sujith Sudhakaran.

“Online bookings for milk has gone up by 200% in the capital, which is more than we can handle. In Kochi, where we offer a similar service, the demand is up by 100%,” Sujith said.

AM Needs supplies other commodities also including chapati, fruits, eggs and vegetables. Online demand for all the products have shot up, according to Sujith.

Milma officials confirmed that the advance online bookings for milma products have risen after the State went into lockdown. Milma counters across the capital city too have been recording brisk sales.

That said, Milma’s overall sales do not show an increase as bulk purchases by restaurants and other establishments have stopped due to the lockdown, Milma officials pointed out. In Thiruvananthapuram district, daily sales now average around two lakh litres.

Holiday

In the north Kerala districts, Milma had even declared a one-day holiday for milk collection on Tuesday following a sharp drop in sales.

Milma also is taking steps to ensure adequate supply to its outlets by 5 p.m., Milma officials said. As part of the COVID-19 preventive measures, Milma has also divided the workforce at its dairies into two shifts to further reduce the possibility of disease transmission.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/online-booking-for-milk-up/article31167535.ece
115,2020/03/25,"Income in ruins, fishers call for famine package","Selling the catch is a problem in the wake of restrictions imposed in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak

Representatives of over seven lakh people directly depending on fishing activities in the State have called for a “fish famine package” and more clarity on what should be done at a time when the country is under a lockdown to fight the spread of COVID-19.

Financially in dire straits, small-time traditional fishers venture out. But selling the catch is a problem because of the present restrictions. The Fisheries Department has told fishers to abandon the traditional auction system to prevent crowding at auction centres, says Antony Kurisinkal of the Kerala Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation.

The fishers have voluntarily given up the auction system already and shut fish landing hubs. Therefore, he suggested that the government frame a system, perhaps introduce a token system, to allow fishers to sell the catch by turn to avoid crowding at sale centres.

“The police and local authorities must help. This is a must considering the importance of fish in everyday diet, especially in coastal areas, as maintained by the government,” he adds.

Fishers’ unions have also expressed anguish over government reluctance to announce what they call a “fish famine package” despite repeated requests.

Oil sardines fishery is at one of its most difficult phases and the fate of about a lakh fishers is tied to oil sardine catch, says Charles George of the Matsya Thozhialali Aikya Vedhi.

Sardine catch

Sardine catch has dropped to around 77,000 tonnes in 2017 from 3.99 lakh tonnes in 2012, he says as he calls for an allowance of ₹5,000 to fishermen families in addition to monthly free rations provided during the famine months.

Survival package

“There are 50 inboard boats, 80 purseiners, and around 3,800 trawl boats operating out of Ernakulam harbours. They have shut down their business and a survival package is a must for thousands who depend on their operations,” he adds.

Meanwhile, fishers have urged the government to allow at least a few of them to travel to take care of engines of boats docked in places away from homes. Hundreds of boats from Alappuzha are harboured at centres such as Chellanam and Thoppumpady. Without constant maintenance the engines will be damaged, says Mr. Antony.

With the State under a lockdown, the police are allowing only essential travel. Fishers are aware of the circumstances but maintenance of the boats is a grave issue, he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cyiwcb/article31167645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvko--Shrimp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/income-in-ruins-fishers-call-for-famine-package/article31167528.ece
116,2020/03/25,16-hour ordeal for Keralites at border checkpoints,"Travellers from other States to be sent back from Wayanad

It was a nightmare that they would never forget in their life. Jaison and his wife Praveena, two IT professionals who work in Bengaluru, had to languish nearly16 hours at Madhur and Muthanga checkpoints on the Kerala-Karnataka border as they made a frantic attempt to reach their home State after the State and Central governments announced a lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19. And finally, they ended up at a COVID care centre at Sulthan Bathery for 21-day quarantine.

They were among the 300-odd Keralites, including students, from Bengaluru and Mysuru in Karnataka who had made a panic run to their home State in cars and bikes after the lockdown announcement, Mr. Jaison said.

“The uncertainty over the availability of provisions made us run to the home State,” he said.

“We learned from our friends that many supermarkets were on the verge of shutdown owing to the shortage of food items, including rice and vegetables. Drinking water supply was nearly stopped in suburbs such as K.R. Puram and Ramamurthy Nagar after the Karnataka government imposed a curfew-like lockdown three days ago,” he said. All Malayali paying guests, including students, in the areas were directed to leave their residences, worsening the situation further, he said.

“When we reached at the Madhur checkpoint in Karnataka around 1.30 a.m., there were more than 200 travellers awaiting the permission of Karnataka government officials to cross the border. As usual, we thought that officials would allow us to continue our journey after the night traffic ban period from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m,” he said. Though they waited there till 9 a.m., officials did not allow them to cross the border as prohibition orders had been clamped on both the States.

Another nightmare

Finally, officials granted permission around 9.45 a.m. and they continued their journey. When they reached the Muthanga checkpoint in the State around 10.15 a.m, after travelling 18 km through the Bandipur tiger reserve in Karnataka and the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, another ordeal was awaiting for them. “Though a few travellers among us could cross the checkpoint without any difficulty, latecomers got stranded for around seven hours there without food and basic facilities as officials took a rigid stance,” he said. Later, the district administration and the police provided them lunch and they were shifted to the care centre at Sulthan Bathery around 3.45 p.m.

Those who left the checkpoint earlier were also brought to the centres, District Collector Adeela Abdulla said. The district administration would be forced to send back travellers from other States from Thursday owing to the dearth of healthcare facilities in the district, she said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/16-hour-ordeal-for-keralites-at-border-checkpoints/article31167516.ece

Two more persons were confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 in Palakkad district on Wednesday, taking the total number of patients to three. The new cases belonged to Kottopadam and Karakkurissi. The first case was at Ottapalam.

Both the new cases had come from Dubai and were in observation at their respective homes. The person from Kottopadam reached Karipur Airport at 10 p.m. on March 21. His sample was collected from Government Taluk Hospital at Mannarkkad on March 23. The person from Karakurissi reached Karipur Airport on March 13. As many as 5,420 persons are under observation in the district. While 13 of them are at Government Taluk Hospital, Ottapalam, 20 are at District Hopsital, Palakkad, and three at Government Taluk Hospital, Mannarkkad. All others are in home quarantine.

Health officials said that there was nothing to worry about those under observation in hospital isolation wards. As many as 139 samples sent to National Virology Institute, Pune, had returned negative.

District Collector D. Balamurali exhorted the people not to venture out for reasons not so pressing. He said those under observation should never travel. They will be arrested and case slapped against them if they violated the order.

Quarantined

Meanwhile, 131 passengers who reached Palakkad Junction Railway Station on the Vivek Express from Dibrugar on Tuesday night were taken in buses and shifted to Government Victoria College here first, and to Kerala Medical College at Cherpulassery on Wednesday evening. They will have to spend 14 days in quarantine.

Among the passengers were nine women and a transgender.

Army men, Central government employees and people from other States comprised the group that got off at Palakkad Junction at 11.50 p.m. on Tuesday. They had returned to Kerala from different States on Vivek Express from Dibrugarh, the longest running passenger train in the country.

District Collector D. Balamurali said here on Wednesday that they would be sent home for quarantine only after four days’ observation.

A.K. Balan, Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes, said in a statement that many in the group had not obeyed the district authorities and asked them to cooperate.

He warned that if they did not cooperate, Palakkad too would have to witness outbreaks as in Pathanamthitta and Kasargod. “The government can provide facilities only. We will not be able to control the situation if people do not cooperate,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-new-covid-19-cases-in-palakkad/article31167478.ece
118,2020/03/25,"It’s long haul for TV shows, popular soaps","With lockdown in place, shooting and production of serials have come to a halt

Much to the disappointment of their avid audience, many popular soaps and TV shows are likely to take a hiatus from April.

Though production houses and channels were prepared for the lockdown till March 31 using reserve episodes, they can hardly pull through the three-week window now.

Vanambadi, one of the most popular serials that has completed over 900 episodes, can currently go on till April first week only, says producer M. Renjith. ""After April 3 there will not be any new content left for telecast. It's an unanticipated situation and for the first time in three years we won't be able to dish out a new episode,"" he adds.

Since serials often introduce new tracks based on target rating point (TRP) fluctuations, they usually can not afford to go on a shooting spree and keep a large reserve. Also, it will not be easy for the industry to start operations immediately after the lockdown. ""All schedules along with the dates of artists and technicians will change and we will need some time to re-establish the entire system. It will take at least a week to release a new episode after completing all works including dubbing,"" says Renjith.

Unexpected wait

“We were told that the shoots will resume by April, but then the entire scene changed last week with the nationwide lockdown. The majority of the ongoing shows will stop and all channels will be affected. It’s for the first time channels and production houses are facing such a crisis,” says Dinesh Panicker, general secretary, ATMA (Association of Television Media Artistes).

While many shows have extra footage, it is often not possible to air them without binding them together. “Depending on the availability of actors we shoot scenes every day, but they will not be in a chronological order. Having some random scenes doesn’t mean that we can air an episode without forming it. We first need to edit and match them filling the gaps and currently we don’t have the time for that. Since we weren't expecting a 21-day lockdown we had no back-up plan,” he says.

Uncertain future

A lot of people in the industry are currently staring at an uncertain future. “There are many actors and technicians who are completely dependent on the industry. They will be left with no income for nearly a month and soon fund-related issues are expected to crop up, deepening the crisis,” Mr. Panicker adds.

Meanwhile, entertainment channels are currently exploring all the possibilities to keep their viewers hooked. Continuing production is a challenge for even some in-house programmes as it is not possible without a minimum crew.

“We had to drop a number of Vishu and Easter specials and at present we are planning to manage with films. Reducing the episode duration from 23 minutes to 15 is also under consideration. Launching dubbed shows is another option before us,” says the programme head of a leading Malayalam channel.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nxmvor/article31167469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvvanambadi2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/its-long-haul-for-tv-shows-popular-soaps/article31167470.ece
119,2020/03/25,Posters to be affixed in front of quarantining houses,"To caution visitors against contacting them

The district administration has decided to stick posters in front of residential buildings that house quarantined persons, cautioning visitors against contacting them.

District Collector P.B. Noohu said here on Wednesday that the decision was part of the ongoing disease-prevention drive against COVID-19. The poster displays the name and address of the quarantined person, the quarantine period, number of family members, and the dos and don’ts to be followed. A signed affidavit stating their consent for remaining in quarantine till the date fixed by the Health Department would be obtained from them. Legal proceedings would be initiated against those who try to misuse the poster for defaming those in quarantine or their relatives through social media.

NoRKs cautioned

The Collector cautioned Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs) against violating the quarantine norms.

Seventeen cases have been registered in connection with COVID-19 surveillance in the district and these included those who have strayed out of their houses during the quarantine period. The Collector directed the police to register 24 cases on the basis of the reports received from Revenue Divisional Officers for violation of the quarantine norms in the district on Tuesday alone.

Eighteen of the quarantine violators are from Konni, four from Adoor, and two from Ranni, official sources said.

Two Italians and 66 other foreigners staying at the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, Kollam, have been shifted to a quarantine facility controlled by the Kollam district administration at the Math itself following suspicion of violations of quarantine and surveillance protocols.

“Prima facie, it appears that there has not been a complete compliance of quarantine and surveillance protocols at the Math,” B. Abdul Nasar, the Kollam District Collector told The Hindu.

The district administration has send throat swabs of foreigners for COVID-19 tests. It may take one or two days for results to arrive as the labs are flooded with samples. Till now, none in the visiting group has developed any symptoms of the disease, he said.

The first set of foreigners, including those from COVID-19-hit countries, arrived at the Math during the last week of February. The Italians came on March 4 and 5 and last batch arrived on March 7. Though they were staying at the Math during the last 20 days, the personal details and quarantine and surveillance protocols of the visitors were not fully shared by the Math with the authorities concerned. It was only on March 22 that the complete details were made available. Hence, they were shifted to the quarantine facility controlled by the district administration, reliable source said.

The administration took charge of the quarantine after summoning the Math authorities to the office of the District Collector and obtaining information from them. Incidentally, the Math had stopped the darshan of Mata Amritanandamayi to her devotees on March 6, after reports of the outbreak surfaced.

Going by the statements of the inmates and visitors, the foreigners had not gone out of the Math and established contacts with anyone. They confined themselves to the Math. These aspects need to be verified. The challenge before the administration is to carry out the contact tracing for the nearly 2,000 permanent inmates of the Math, the Collector said.

The District Medical Officer and the Kollam Revenue Divisional Officer have been asked to inquire into the reported lapses in the protocols. The details of the quarantine measures provided by the Math will also be reviewed. Legal measures, including the invocation of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, would be considered after obtaining the report, he said.

Math clarifies

The Math has been closely following the health instructions of the authorities, according to a communication issued by the Math.

The 58 foreigners, who reached the Math after February 25, have been put in home quarantine as instructed by the government. Though none of them has developed any signs of disease, they stayed indoors and avoided public interactions. They were also subjected to medical tests, the communication said.

All information related to those who have been quarantined at the Math and the precautions undertaken were communicated to the authorities, including the District Medical Officer. The reports that the Math has not followed the precautions were baseless, it said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/68-foreigners-quarantined-in-kollam/article31165239.ece
121,2020/03/25,"Unauthorised volunteers will be arrested, says Kasaragod Collector","Jan Jagratha Samithi to select people for preventive works

District Collector D. Sajith Babu on Wednesday said only volunteers under the Jan Jagratha Samithi should venture out to carry out preventive works being undertaken to control the spread of COVID-19 in the district.

Speaking to reporters, he said there were volunteers in all ward-level committees. “Those who take up voluntary work by themselves will be arrested and further action will be taken against them,” he said.

The Collector added that there was a need for volunteers and they would be selected by the Jan Jagratha Samithi. For various supportive activities, people having bikes would also be needed, he said, adding that they would be issued pass from the Collectorate.

Mr. Babu said the police had been instructed to arrest those who were engaged in voluntary works by themselves.

‘Rely on PHCs’

“It has been noticed that people are rushing to the General Hospital and the District Hospital for COVID-19 test. However, only those cases which are referred from PHCs (primary health centres) will be examined,” the Collector said. Doctors at PHCs would refer people with symptoms such as cough, fever, cold and sore throat. People within the PHC limits should rely solely on those PHCs. People in the municipality area could rely on district and general hospitals for treatment, he added.

Action was being taken to create more facilities in Kasaragod General Hospital and the new Superintendent had been entrusted with the coordination of activities. Necessary steps were being taken to install seven ventilators and one portable X-ray unit in the district, Mr. Babu said.

Law enforcement was progressing under the direction of IG Vijay Sakhare.

44 positive cases

District Medical Officer A.V. Ramdas told media that false messages were being circulated on social media regarding COVID-19 patients. There were now 44 COVID-19 patients in the district. A case is considered negative only after three tests turn negative. He appealed to people to ignore fake messages on social media.

He further said that of the 44 COVID-19 patients in the district, 40 were from abroad. Only four people were diagnosed with the disease after they came in contact with the patients. The four men were being monitored in their homes and they were not likely to spread the disease to more people.

The DMO said diagnosed and suspected cases were under surveillance. Those who were sick must undergo 28 more days of observation. If those under observation were diagnosed with the symptoms for the disease within 14 days, samples would be sent for testing, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/unauthorised-volunteers-will-be-arrested-says-kasaragod-collector/article31164411.ece
122,2020/03/25,DYFI offers emotional support at the time of COVID-19,"Free online counselling system to overcome post-COVID-19 trauma

With the COVID-19 outbreak bringing in its trail a trauma triggered by isolation, job loss, financial insecurity and the fear of contracting the infection, a free online counselling system put in place to offer emotional support to the quarantined has proved to be a great succour.

The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) State committee has empanelled three psychologists and a research associate in cognitive science and they are rendering free service to scores of callers reaching out for emotional support.

According to DYFI State secretary A.A. Rahim, “the idea ofr opening the counselling system germinated from the telephone calls that we received seeking clarifications about the impact of the virus spread and how it would endanger their life and career. Soon we elicited the support of three psychologists and a researcher in cognitive science and they started attending distress calls from their residences.”

Major fears

The system took off well and spurt in the number of quarantined has increased the number of calls too. According to one of the panellists, Baby Ziliya, a research associate in cognitive science at IIT, Gandhinagar, most of the callers are concerned about post-COVID-19 situation and whether they would be left unemployed and in abject penury.

She attends the calls from her residence in Kozhikode. “I suggest relaxation techniques that would ease their tension and motivate them to focus on today rather than brooding about the future. The best option to support the quarantined is to advice them to focus on their skills and pursue their hobbies, be it painting, music or reading,” says Ms. Baby.

Than remaining idle the callers are being persuaded to prepare a routine and apportion a day for various activities that would engage them till going to bed.

Information overload

She also warns against an information overload and recommends the quarantined to fix a time to watch new bulletins than monitoring them frequently. “Those on observation should consciously avoid an information overload and desist from fetching more from social media. The reliance on the social media should be only for entertainment and one should depend on the legacy media for all information regarding the virus outbreak and the disease,” she says.

Strict observance

Strict observance of the schedule has been recommended to all those in quarantine.

Mr. Rahim says the DYFI State centre is attending to requests for books and other essentials and it would continue till the State overcomes the crisis.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/aet200/article31167699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/counselling,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-helping-hand-to-offer-emotional-support/article31164173.ece
123,2020/03/25,Temples to replace bhajans with COVID-19 guidance,"Two-minute-long message by the district health wing will be played every morning and evening

In the midst of mass closure of religious establishments following the COVID-19 scare, these temples are guiding the faithful through a different route for solace.

Starting from Thursday, the people in and around the Kadapattur Mahadeva temple, a major stopover of Sabarimala pilgrims in Kottayam, and the Kavinpuram Umamaheswara temple in Ezhacherry will wake up to public announcements on the best practices for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The two-minute-long message, scripted and recorded by the district Health Department, will replace the devotional bhajans usually played out through the temples’ speakers during the opening and closing rituals every morning and evening.

The initiative is being implemented in association with the Kottayam district administration and the Mutholi panchayat, where the Mahadeva temple is located and command attention of large audiences.

According to the temple authorities, a decision to play the message instead of bhajans formed part of its duty to offer spiritual guidance to the public in times of crisis. “Rather than waiting for the government to act, we are taking it upon ourselves to be at the forefront of communication about the pandemic,” said T.N. Sukumaran Nair, president of the Uma Maheswara temple devaswom committee.

Saju Kadapattur, a member of the Kadapattur devaswom commitee and president of the Kadapattur NSS Karayogam said this response was emblematic of how temples in the region were handling the crisis. “During the mega-floods of 2018, our role was to offer relief to the flood victims. The situation this time, however, warrants a different course of action in which our duty is to disseminate Information,” he said.

N. Maya Devi, the local panchayat member who coordinates initiative, is of the opinion that the temples can get people to do things in an expedited manner. “We have been receiving inquiries from various other temple managements in the region on the initiative. There are about 300 temples in and around the Meenachil Taluk and it will be very helpful if we can get at least some of them together,” she said.

Commenting on the initiative, District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu said a direction with regard to promoting guidance on COVID-19 outbreak had been issued to all the local bodies in the district. “Since all public places including railway stations and bus stands have ceased to operate, this is a useful way to reach out to the public,” observed the official.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/temples-to-replace-bhajans-with-covid-19-guidance/article31164127.ece
124,2020/03/25,State imposes total prohibition,"Bevco outlets closed, but govt. weighs online sale of alcohol

The State government on Wednesday imposed total prohibition in the State to prevent people from queuing up in front of State-run liquor outlets during the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, it is weighing a proposal to allow the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) or currently shuttered bars to sell liquor online or as takeaways. At present, it is illegal for bars to allow customers to take away alcohol as parcels. Hence, the government will have to tweak the liquor rules to approve the proposed transaction.

The State has arguably the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of legal liquor is a significant source of State revenue. In 2018-19, Bevco raked in ₹14,504.67 crore from the sale of branded liquor, beer and wine, a rise of ₹1,567.8 crore compared to the previous financial year. Bevco operated around 280 outlets across the State.

The Excise Department had earlier cautioned the government that a total ban on the sale of legal liquor could open the door for the entry of bootleg and illicit spirit of dubious quality and suspicious provenance into Kerala. It had pointed out that the government had not reckoned excise enforcement as an essential service, hampering efforts to use more officers for field inspections and border checks.

The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition and the Indian Medical Association had flagged the need to shutter liquor shops to stop people from gathering publicly.

The police and Excise Department had told the government that tight lines in front of the Bevco outlets posed public health risk and they had struggled to persuade buyers to observe the social distance norm of at least 1.5 m between individuals.

Moreover, various trade unions had told the government that an increasing number of Bevco employees had expressed reluctance to report for duty out of fear that they could contract COVID-19 infection from customers.

Officials said the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday appeared to be the last straw that prompted the State to shut the liquor outlets.

127,2020/03/25,Alappuzha survivor says the lockdown will pay off,"Wuhan-returnee recounts his experience in China and the recovery back home

He had his first tryst with a lockdown in the Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero of the COVID-19 outbreak.

After receiving a text message in the early hours of January 23, he, along with his friends, scrambled to reach the Wuhan Tianhe international airport to catch a flight back home. With the lockdown already in place, the airport was closed by the time they reached there.

But the group was lucky enough to get into the last train heading to Kunming, some 1,800 km away. From there, they all boarded a flight first to Kolkata and landed in Kochi on January 24.

After reaching his house in Alappuzha, the 23-year-old medical student went straight into strict self-quarantine. The rest are known facts. He was tested positive for COVID-19 on February 2, the second such case in the country. But, in two weeks, the medical student became the first person in India to be cured of the disease.

After roaming around like a free bird for a couple of weeks after the end of the stipulated quarantine period, he has gone into self-confinement again in his house now, this time due to the Statewide lockdown.

A responsibility

He says it is the responsibility of every citizen to adhere to the restrictions announced by the government. “In my case, after reaching home from Wuhan, I strictly observed self-quarantine. Before I was admitted to the hospital on January 30, I went outside only once, and that too to consult a doctor at the nearest health centre. I followed all protocols related to quarantine, isolation and treatment. Now, I am following the lockdown norms for the good my family, relatives, friends and society,” he says.

On his battle with COVID-19, the student says that his concern was only about becoming a carrier.

“After the student in Thrissur, a classmate of mine, tested positive on January 30, I was immediately shifted to Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, with the help of A. Safeer, a doctor. My results came a couple of days later. The medical staff was very helpful. I was served food of my choice. Above all, I was happy I didn’t pass the disease to anyone,” he says.

Act of malice

While undergoing treatment, a few people acted with malice and revealed his identity on social media and accused him of spreading the virus by walking around in the days after his return from China, which he termed as smut in otherwise an episode full of positive vibes.

With restrictions in place, he continues his studies online from the comfort of his home.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fs1ruo/article31157754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tv-Lockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alappuzha-survivor-says-the-lockdown-will-pay-off/article31157749.ece
128,2020/03/25,Travellers should carry affidavit during journey,"Chief Minister defends further curbs on movement

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said people venturing outdoors during the lockdown should carry a signed affidavit testifying to the reason for their travel. They should produce the affidavit in the form prescribed by the government when the police challenge the reason for their presence in public places.

The Chief Minister said the outbreak situation had compelled the government to restrict further the freedom of movement to impose the social distance norms necessary for containing COVID-19. Keralites should temporarily give up social visits and leisurely travel.

He asked autorickshaw and taxi drivers to accept trips only in the event of a medical emergency or other equally pressing requirements. People should use private vehicles only if there were a dire necessity. Not more than two persons should travel in a car or van.

The Chief Minister indicated that the government would not clamp down on the sale of legal liquor through State-run outlets. However, Mr. Vijayan observed that the State did not consider “beverages” an essential item. His comment came against the backdrop of reports that the State might permit bars to allow liquor takeaways to ease the rush at Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets.

Traders warned

Mr. Vijayan warned traders against hoarding and hiking the prices of essential commodities. The government had sensed a few attempts to exploit the lockdown to wring profits.

There was no shortage of foodgrains, edible oil, pulses, sugar, fish, meat, vegetables, milk and fruit in the State.

The government was in touch with its counterparts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to ease to and fro movement of freight lorries.

He asked headload workers to help expedite the flow of perishables and provisions from wholesalers to retailers. Municipal authorities should move homeless people and those who sleep on pavements and shop verandahs to shelters and provide them with food and medication.

Mr. Vijayan asked elected office-bearers of local bodies to monitor the availability of essential services and goods at the panchayat and municipal ward levels. The government has strengthened its market monitoring mechanisms.

Efforts were on to bring back students marooned in other States. Courier and home delivery services should resume operations.

He reminded the public that any laxity to follow the social distancing regulations imposed by the government would tantamount to dishonouring the service of doctors, paramedics and health workers who are on the frontline in the battle against the pandemic.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/81igku/article31159697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvgad01-keralGR779JMT23jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/travellers-should-carryaffidavit-during-journey/article31157707.ece
129,2020/03/25,State makes a forceful attempt to enforce lockdown,"Police use batons to chase away citizens at several places in Kasaragod district

Kerala placed itself under a virtual lockdown on Tuesday in a forceful bid to slow down the COVID-19 outbreak.

The law enforcement went into overdrive on the first day of the State-wide shutdown to ensure that the people stayed indoors and maintained social distance. Uniformed officers wearing protective masks and wielding batons staged flag marches in several districts.

The enforcement of regulations was a notch harsher in Kasaragod, the epicentre of the outbreak in the State. The police swung batons to chase away citizens who came out in the open at several places in the northern district.

Crowding prohibited

Across the State, the police warned of gatherings of more than five people, made attempts to regulate queues in front of State-run liquor outlets, closed non-essential businesses, and allowed people to venture out only to buy groceries, milk or medicine.

They issued warnings to wayside tea stalls, hotels, eateries, convenience stores, and family-run neighbourhood utility shops to down shutters.

The State seemed yet to come to terms entirely with the new reality. In several places, senior police officers had to turn back citizens who appeared unconvinced of the need to restrict ordinary life. Most were pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. The police also detained private cars with passengers seated close together.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera said the police would further tighten the restrictions as the lockdown progressed. The police would issue passes to persons working in services deemed essential.

Close down factories

In Kannur, the police closed down a plywood factory. They shuttered a cashew processing unit in Kollam. The police took cases against persons who flouted the new regulations in Kasaragod, Pathanamthitta, Malappuram, Kottayam, and Wayanad. The law enforcement also started a COVID-19 control room at the police headquarters here to monitor the outbreak situation.

In Kozhikode, the police curtailed the mass movement of migrant workers. Plainclothesmen inspected migrant workers camps. The government has started moving outside State labourers from crammed camps to more spacious temporary shelters on nearby school campuses and auditoriums.

The State’s borders remained sealed. The police prevented the inter-district movement of private vehicles.

130,2020/03/25,IPC provisions enable enforcement of curbs,"Invocation of Sections 188, 269 by Ernakulam Collector

The invocation of Sections 188 and 269 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by Ernakulam District Collector S. Suhas will deter those flouting the restrictions, including home quarantine, imposed by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19, says a legal expert.

In an order issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Collector warns that offences under Sections 188 and 269 will be invoked against those defying the restrictions.

In fact, Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act empowers the State governments to prescribe measures and regulations to deal with the outbreak of any dangerous epidemic diseases, which include inspection of persons travelling on train or other modes of transport and segregating of persons in hospitals.

The Act makes the violation of any rules or regulations/ restrictions a punishable offence under Section 188, says A.Rajesh, Special Vigilance Prosecutor at the High Court.

As per this section, if anybody disobeys the restrictions or regulations issued by the government and such disobedience causes or tends to cause obstruction, annoyance or injury, or risk of obstruction to any person lawfully employed, he/she shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or with fine or both.

That apart, if such disobedience causes or trends to cause danger to human life, health or safety, or causes or tends to cause a riot or affray, the offenders shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to ₹1,000 or with both.

Section 269

Section 269 deals with those who commit a negligent act which is likely to spread an infectious disease dangerous to life. As per the section, a person charged with the offence shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.

Addressing mediapersons here on Tuesday, he said that although there was a shortage of workers for loading and unloading materials, it had been resolved. The services of the police would be utilised in places where there was no workforce, he said.

Shops in the district were allowed to remain open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. to sell essential commodities.

‘Do not congregate’

Bakeries could be opened. However, they would not be allowed to serve tea, coffee or other beverages.

He once again urged people not to congregate in shops.

“Those who shop for essential items must comply with police instructions and they should queue up at the shops,” Mr. Babu said. Fish and meat stalls were allowed to open. However, if crowding was found in front of the shop, it would be closed down, he warned.

Burial of the 54-year-old man who died after testing positive for COVID-19 was completed at 4.30 a.m. on Wednesday morning.

The funeral ceremony was attended only by four family members and four police personnel.

District Collector T.G. Vinay said that the family was directed to ensure that the funeral was completed in the early hours of the day, so that crowds could be avoided. “The patient was fairly popular in his community and was well known. The funeral had to be completed early on to ensure that we take adequate safety precautions,” he said.

The Collector added that the body was wrapped three times and taken within minutes after Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar tweeted about his death at around 2 a.m., to the burial ground in Melamadai.

Sources, however, said that the actual burial took place only at 3.30 a.m., as arrangements for digging the burial spot took an hour. The burial was completed at 4.30 a.m., and no family members were allowed to touch the body. Those handling the shifting of the body were provided personal protection equipment kits, consisting full body suits, to avoid transmission, the Collector said.

Basheer Ahmed, who belonged to the same Jamaat as the patient, said that as per their customs, the dead body is washed, perfumed and buried six ft underground.

“Everyone from the Jamaat pays their respects. In these extraordinary times, most people from our Jamaat have been asked to be quarantined at their homes. It is sad,” he said.

The patient was admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital on Saturday after consultation at a private clinic and a private hospital.

135,2020/03/25,‘People with chronic diseases at higher risk of infection’,"Expert says this is the right time to make full use of telemedicine for consultation

Clinical data on the impact of COVID-19 is not adequate. It is still evolving. However, there is evidence to suggest that people with chronic diseases like cancer have higher risk of infection than others. The infected cancer patients can also develop more serious complications.

Hence, global organisations of oncology professionals like American Society for Clinical Oncology have already issued guidelines to help cancer patients and oncology professionals to cope with the impact of COVID-19, while still continuing cancer management. But most of them relate to guidelines for infection control and prevention in the context of current pandemic.

Home is the new hospital

Patients should opt for home care when it is medically feasible, and logistically feasible for medical team and caregivers. Patients who are not on active cancer treatment do not have to visit doctors for routine follow-ups. Hospital visits for palliative therapy can be postponed, unless it is an emergency.

Even for patients with fever or other symptoms of infection, routine lab samples can be collected from home, instead of making them visit the clinic.

Embrace technology

This is also the right time to make full use of telemedicine for consultations and patient-doctor interactions. Patients who are on follow-up or oral drugs or on maintenance therapy in remission can consult their oncologists using phone, WhatsApp or email, and avoid unnecessary hospital visits.

Screen patients, donors and visitors

Doctors should screen patients for COVID-19 prior to the initiation of treatments that are scheduled and cannot be postponed. It is better to get the screening done one day in advance.

Screening is important for blood donors as well, though there is no evidence that the infection spreads with blood transfusions. As a general precaution, hospitals should make strict restrictions on visitors and visiting hours – and screen all visitors.

When to continue the treatment

Clinical care must be delivered to all serious or emergency cancer cases — including oncological emergencies for radiation, as done routinely. And any medication (involving prophylactic antibiotics) or procedures of preventing diseases should continue because they may be of potential value in maintaining the overall health of the patient and make them less vulnerable to potential COVID-19 complications.

When to postpone treatment

But with patients diagnosed with COVID-19, it would be better to postpone active anti-cancer treatments. Chemotherapy can be stopped altogether for the infected patients when cancer is in deep remission and when it is given only as maintenance therapy. All major elective cancer surgeries and procedures can be delayed.

Another option is modifying treatments. Some patients may be able to switch chemotherapy from IV to oral therapies, which would decrease the frequency of clinic visits.

But doctors should make decisions on a case-to-case basis. As there is no specific evidence or published guidance either to support or delay cancer treatments like chemotherapy. In some settings delays or modifications of treatments may pose a higher risk of compromised disease control. They may affect the long-term survival rate of patients. Hence, withholding critical anti-cancer treatments is not recommended.

However, if the absolute benefit of the treatments is small, the potential of exposure to COVID-19 is high, and if the situation is not an emergency, it is advisable to postpone the treatment.

Doctors should consider all the risks and benefits, and the factors like patient’s age, general medical condition, and the stage of the disease, before deciding whether to continue with the treatments as usual or postpone it during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4s56b3/article31167804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th26Pix,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/people-with-chronic-diseases-at-higher-risk-of-infection/article31167806.ece
136,2020/03/25,Stoically delivering news to your doorstep,"Newspaper delivery boys are facing several hurdles in the wake of COVID-19

It is close to half-past-six in the morning, and most doors are shut, with residents still curled up in their beds.

Armed with a mask and a hand sanitiser, 31-year-old M. Marimuthu stacks up newspapers and zips past every street of Arumbakkam, distributing newspapers in a jiffy.

“This has been my routine since I was 16. I don’t remember taking more than a few days’ leave in the last 15 years. I don’t view it as just a mundane profession but as a humble service that keeps residents informed of what is happening around them in the world. This is why I continue to work even now, during such a crisis,” he says.

At a time when people are reluctant to venture out of their homes, newspaper delivery boys quietly go about their routine, day after day, despite the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.

N. Karunanidhi, 52, a newspaper agent, says he ensures that his staff wear masks and travel with hand sanitisers.

Sixty-eight-year-old P. Chakaravarthy recollects that the only time he did not deliver the paper was when a flood hit the city in 2015. “My staff and I deliver newspapers in Anna Nagar. We are nervous. But we will continue to do our job. It is a small contribution to society in such difficult times,” he says.

But there are some residents who have been refusing to receive newspapers for fear of contracting the virus. R. Balaji, a newspaper vendor in T. Nagar, says at many apartment complexes, the owners are not permitting newspaper boys to enter the premises. “We are being told to leave the newspapers with the security at the gate. Those in individual houses are requesting us to wash our hands and legs, apply sanitisers and then enter. There were instances where people did not even want to touch the newspaper,” he says.

137,2020/03/25,Courts to stay closed for 3 weeks in view of shutdown,"Only urgent cases will be heard, either through video-conferencing or in person

The Administrative Committee of the Madras High Court, comprising its top seven judges, held an emergency meeting at the residence of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and decided to suspend operations in all courts across the State for three weeks, in view of the nation-wide lockdown to fight COVID-19.

Court work in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai, its Madurai Bench and all trial courts in the State would be suspended, and urgent cases alone would be taken up for hearing, either through video-conferencing or in person, after the lawyers and litigants make a mention to the court officials concerned.

“Entry to the High Court at Madras and Madurai Bench shall remain prohibited for three weeks from today or until further orders, whichever is earlier,” the latest circular stated, adding that Registrar General C. Kumarappan and Registrar (Judicial) M. Jothiraman could be reached through their e-mail IDs: regrgenl@tn.nic.in and m.jothiraman@aij.gov.in

Similarly, the Additional Registrar General and Registrar (Judicial) in the Madurai Bench could be reached through thamilj- 1968@gmail.com

Ordering that entry into all trial courts in the State shall be prohibited, the High Court directed the Principal District Judges to notify the e-mail IDs through which litigants and lawyers could contact them for the hearing of urgent cases.

As regards allocation of portfolios to the judges during the period of suspension, the Committee made it clear that the weekly seating arrangements it had made as part of its earlier decision to allow restricted hearings shall continue, and the judges named in that notification would continue to be available for urgent hearing of cases. The Chief Justice also made it clear that until the situation normalises, all anticipatory bail petitions should first be filed before the jurisdictional principal district and sessions courts. Only if such petitions are dismissed by the district courts should the lawyers and litigants approach the High Cour. Noting that public prosecutors in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai as well as its Madurai Bench would find it difficult to obtain instructions from police personnel spread across the State during the period of imposition of prohibitory orders, the Chief Justice said it would be far easier for prosecutors in district courts to obtain instructions from the local police.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/courts-to-stay-closed-for-3-weeks-in-view-of-shutdown/article31167752.ece
138,2020/03/25,The case for taking the DBT route for ration cardholders,"Tamil Nadu was among the first few States to adopt the idea of direct benefit transfer

With the State government having decided to provide cash support of ₹1,000 to all ration cardholders as part of measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the question then arises as to why the Civil Supplies authorities are not transferring the cash directly to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts.

As in the past, the authorities are planning to distribute the amount to beneficiaries on designated days after issuing tokens to them. But this may be at odds with the concept of social distancing, which is being encouraged and implemented to curb the spread of the disease.

Tamil Nadu was perhaps among the first few States to adopt the concept of direct benefit transfer (DBT) through bank accounts. For the last five to six years, it has been using DBT in respect of students’ scholarships, maternity benefits and social security pensions.

Observers of the State’s demographic profile point out that there should not be any major difficulty for the authorities in adopting DBT with respect to public distribution system (PDS) beneficiaries. Of the around 6.72 crore beneficiaries, Aadhaar-linking has been done for 6.68 crore, according to the official PDS website https://www.tnpds.gov.in/. Besides, at least a majority of the ration cardholders should either be Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) account holders or recipients of subsidy on cooking gas cylinders. In both cases, the account holders are getting financial assistance from government agencies through their bank accounts. There are around 1.05 crore PMJDY accounts in the State.

Moreover, once the Civil Supplies Department decides to collect the details of the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, it can do so either through the PDS mobile app or the website. For the rest, who will account for a negligible number of beneficiaries, the distribution of cash directly through PDS outlets could be considered. But this should be a last resort, observers say.

A senior official in the State government says the DBT option is being examined. What needs to be ascertained is the number of bank accounts that have been linked to the database of PDS beneficiaries. An official of the Civil Supplies Department says the matter needs to be elaborately discussed at different levels.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hi79wa/article31167739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THRATIONSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-case-for-taking-the-dbt-route-for-ration-cardholders/article31167740.ece
139,2020/03/25,‘Govt. relief package for the poor inadequate’,"T.N. should seek more funds from the Centre, says Stalin

DMK president and Opposition leader M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said the ₹3,280-crore relief package announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for the lockdown-hit poor was inadequate. He urged the State government to seek additional funds from the Centre to mitigate the crisis.

In a statement, he suggested a slew of measures, including deferment of loan repayments and allocation of funds to local bodies to help them tackle the situation.

Mr. Stalin also called upon his party’s MPs and MLAs to make adequate allocations from the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme and the MLA Local Area Development Fund for the procurement of masks, thermal scanners and other safety gear, in consultation with the respective District Collectors.

The Centre and the State governments should advise banks to defer the EMI payments of autorickshaw, Ola and Uber drivers by three months, he said. Similarly, no attempt should be made to recover the loans extended by banks to small and medium industries and the agricultural sector, Mr. Stalin said. He said repayment of loans provided by Tidco should be deferred and the interest and penalties should be waived for three months.

Mr. Stalin also said each local body should be allotted ₹3 lakh, as they play a key role in tackling COVID-19. He also called for financial assistance of ₹50,000 to all unorganised workers and family cardholders, which should be directly credited to their bank accounts.

He urged the Chief Minister to announce a special wage of ₹50,000 for doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary workers and police personnel, who were performing their duties in a difficult situation.

“The government should not think its duties are over once the lockdown is announced. It should take further measures without any delay,” the DMK leader said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dy68tn/article31167701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26PTI11-03-2020000181B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/govt-relief-package-for-the-poor-inadequate/article31167702.ece
140,2020/03/25,T.N. records first death of a patient with COVID-19,"Eight more test positive, take total number of cases to 26

On a day when Tamil Nadu recorded the first death of a patient with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a 54-year-old man at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai, eight more persons tested positive. Five of them are under treatment at the Government Medical College, Salem. With this, a total of 26 persons have tested positive for COVID-19 in the State so far.

The five persons — four Indonesian nationals and their travel guide from Chennai — tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said all five have been under quarantine since March 22.

An 18-year-old boy, a contact of the second patient, is at RGGGH, a 63-year-old man who returned from Dubai, is at Wallajah GH, and a 66-year-old, a contact of Thai nationals, is at IRT Perundurai.

The Minister, in a tweet at 2.02 a.m., announced the death of the patient admitted to GRH. He said that the patient had a history of illness along with steroid-dependent Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension. The patient did not respond to treatment. He had earlier clarified to reporters that the man had come in contact with a group of Thai nationals, who were on a tour of the State. Two of them had tested positive for COVID-19 and are undergoing treatment at IRT, Perundurai.

A 45-year-old resident of Kancheepuram was discharged after treatment at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. The State’s second patient, a 20-year-old youth who travelled from Delhi to Chennai and tested positive for COVID-19, was recovering well at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Subsequent tests had returned negative, and he would be discharged in two days, the Minister tweeted.

The four Indonesian nationals had travelled to Salem via Delhi. A total of 70 persons who had come in contact with them have been quarantined. Their travel guide, a 63-year-old man, a resident of Chennai, had travelled with them.

The department has traced a total of 77 contacts of the 65-year-old man from Kotturpuram who tested positive on March 24. He had travelled from New Zealand to Chennai. He has co-morbid conditions and was admitted to an isolation facility in a private hospital.

Eighteen persons have been traced and quarantined for coming in contact with the 55-year-old woman, a resident of Saidapet, who is currently at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. A total of 51 contacts were traced and quarantined for the 25-year-old man, a resident of Alandur, who had travelled from London to Bengaluru airport. He is under treatment at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.

The Minister said, until now, all persons who had tested positive for COVID-19 in the State, either had a history of travel to an affected country or had contact with a person who had travelled to an affected country.

“The daily requirement of masks for all government hospitals in the State is nearly 60,000. Starting tomorrow, we have ensured that the supply chain of Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation is able to address this requirement every day,” the Minister said.

He inspected the quarantine facility at the Institute of Public Health in Poonamallee where 93 persons were being quarantined, while Health Secretary Beela Rajesh inspected the quarantine centre for 300 persons at the headquarters of Dakshin Bharat Area (army office) at Tambaram.

Admissions rise

The number of persons admitted to isolation wards has been increasing in the last few days. As on Wednesday, a total of 211 persons were admitted to hospitals across the State; an increase from 116 on Tuesday. The number of samples lifted for testing now stands at 890, of which 110 were under process. The Health department has placed a total of 15,492 persons under home quarantine for 28 days in the State. In addition, 86,644 passengers listed by the Bureau of Immigration were being monitored.

Presently, 104 asymptomatic passengers, who had travelled from highly affected countries, were under quarantine in quarantine facilities near the airport, according to a bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.

More labs

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has approved one more testing facility for the State. The Government Rajaji Medical College, Madurai, will now test samples for COVID-19.

147,2020/03/25,COVID-19: Here’s what Tamil Nadu has been doing since January,"The State’s response revolves around three strategies: delaying the entry of the virus, preventing transmission and hospital/community preparedness

Tamil Nadu’s Directorate of Public Health set off measures to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-January. What has been the State’s strategy from then? Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine K. Kolandaswamy has the answers.

The State’s COVID-19 prevention and control measures revolve around three strategies.

“The first strategy was to prevent the entry or delay the entry of the virus in the State, region and district. This was done through thermal and clinical screening of passengers travelling from affected countries. Hand sanitisation immediately after disembarking from aircrafts followed by home quarantine for 28 days, which is double the infection period. Persons with symptoms are being admitted to isolation wards in hospitals,” he said.

The next strategy is to prevent the transmission of the infection. For this, the Directorate has been repeatedly insisting on respiratory hygiene: remaining at home if someone has a cough, sneezing and fever, and covering faces with handkerchiefs while coughing or sneezing, and washing hands with soap and water.

“Surface hygiene is something that we have been stressing for a long time. It is important to disinfect areas frequently touched by hands such as door handles, handrails of staircases, escalators, seats, arm rests, table surfaces, lifts and ticket counters with disinfectant such as hydrochlorite solution,” he said.

The third strategy is hospital and community preparedness. It is here that isolation rooms, personal protective equipment and protocol training for doctors and nurses comes in. “Each activity has its own value. Surface cleaning, respiratory hygiene practices and hand hygiene are the ultimate solution. Remember, complex problems have simple solutions,” he said.

Dr. Kolandaswamy said that the second strategy was crucial to prevent person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. “Only Japan, Singapore and Tamil Nadu have been following this from the start. Unfortunately, many other countries rely only on the first and third strategies,” he said.

Infection control, quarantine and treatment -- all three are crucial factors. “We have started massive disinfection measures using 1% hypochlorite solution. The Chennai Corporation, for instance, is engaging big vehicles to carry out infection-control measures in public places,” he said.

A senior health official said while the clampdown would help in delaying a further spread of the virus to new areas and help prevent community spread, other measures such as respiratory hygiene, hand hygiene and disinfection of public places, transport and hospitals should be followed vigorously.

“India has managed to delay the outbreak by more than two months. China did not curb COVID-19 with a clampdown alone. It took up massive disinfection from the third week of February that brought down the cases in March. So, a lockdown will help in delaying the spread. Japan and Singapore successfully controlled COVID-19 due to tracing of travel history and epidemiological links. They meticulously followed respiratory hygiene, handwashing and surface cleaning,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rt3vhz/article31161944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MARTH-DISINFECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-heres-what-tamil-nadu-has-been-doing-since-january/article31161945.ece

In the letter, they said that many among these migrant workers do not have proper ID or ration cards and may not be able to access the economic package extended by the State. They also asked the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration to set up shelters and community kitchen for stranded people as done by the Greater Chennai Corporation.

Considering the vulnerability of migrant workers, particularly those from the Northeast to social stigma and acts of racism, the signatories asked the government to take special measures to reassure migrant communities and discourage COVID -19 vigilantism.

“This is essential not merely to ensure the safety of workers from other parts of the country, but also to provide a fear-free atmosphere for workers to approach the health care institutions and prevent the spread of contagion. Measures targeting migrant workers are required urgently in manufacturing and construction hotspots like Chennai, Tirupur, Coimbatore, Madurai, Sivakasi, Thoothukudi, Sriperumbudur, Gummidipoondi and the industrial areas of Ponneri taluk,” they said in the letter.

The signatories to the letter also asked the State government to recruit trade unions to help identify ways of delivering social security benefits to migrant workers, and alerting them of the schemes by disseminating information in Odiya, Hindi, Telugu and Assamese.

They also sought strict enforcement of wage payments by employers and contractors, provision of basic food, water and healthcare products, and dedicated isolation facilities and identified hospitals and testing facilities for migrant workers to approach.

Mr. Palaniswami on Tuesday announced that all eligible ration cards are eligible for cash assistance of ₹1,000 and essential supplies such as rice, tur dal or Canadian yellow lentil, RBD palmolein oil and sugar, free during April.

The signatories include Jean Dreze, Right to Food activist and honorary professor, Ranchi University, Justice D. Hariparanthaman, Judge (retd), Madras High Court, professors from IIT-Madras, IIM Ahmedabad, MIDS, Centre for Development Studies, a number of labour and trade unions and citizen groups, among others.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ensure-social-security-for-migrant-workers-without-ration-cards-or-id-say-activists/article31160930.ece

Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit has appealed to people of the State to follow the instructions given by Prime Minister to observe lockdown across the country for three weeks, as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of Coronavirus.

“All essential services will be provided by the State Government. It is a very, very challenging situation. We can come victorious against the spread of Coronavirus by staying at home and breaking the chain. Tamil Nadu Government is taking all efforts to control the corona spread as well helping the vulnerable section of the society. I appreciate the State Government for taking many proactive steps,” a statement of the Governor released by Raj Bhavan stated.

“I have full trust in people of Tamil Nadu, let’s fight this challenge together. Humanity and India should win this fight and Tamil Nadu should lead the fight as a model state. Stay at home and stay safe,” the Governor said.

150,2020/03/25,Death toll rises to 4 in Theni forest fire tragedy,"The victims were part of a group of estate workers returning from Kerala

Two more people died in the forest fire at Rasingapuram in Theni district on Tuesday night, taking the death toll to four.

V. Manjula (46) and S. Maheswari (43) were climbing down from Pethotty in Kerala’s Idukki district to Rasingapuram in Bodinayakanur after completing their work at an estate. They were part of a group of 10 people -- six women, three men and a child -- who were walking through a dry canal when they a forest fire engulfed them at around 2.30 p.m. While a 43- year-old woman and her one-year-old granddaughter died on the spot, Ms. Manjula and Ms. Maheswari died on their stretchers while being rescued near the Rasingapuram foothills at around 10.30 p.m.

District Forest Officer (DFO) S. Gowtham said that the path that they used was a difficult trek -- both up and downhill. It stretched to around nine kilometres. “This path was frequented around 15 years ago. After motorised transport came in, most of the workers took jeeps sent by the estate into Kerala, thus rendering the path unused. Ever since the borders between Tamil Nadu and Kerala have closed due to COVID-19, there has been a spike in the number of illegal paths used,” he said.

The DFO added that Forest Department personnel had been stationed in paths frequently used by estate workers and locals two days ago on Monday to ensure that they could monitor the spread of cases. Guards were asked to patrol routes including Kurangani to Top Station, Kurangani to Mutton, Sakalathumettu and Ramakalmettu.

Only 15 days ago on March 10, residents of Kurangani paid tribute to 23 victims who lost their lives to a similar forest fire tragedy in 2018.

151,2020/03/25,COVID-19: 95 residents under home quarantine in Vellore district,"Notices have been placed outside their homes by district health officials

More than 95 persons have been placed under home quarantine in Vellore district. The Department of Public Health, which received data from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) on the travel history of people, has asked these residents to maintain home quarantine at least for the next 14 days.

A team of officials led by Vellore Tahsildar V. Saravanamuthu joined by health officials ensured home quarantine for 63 persons from Vellore block on Tuesday. The remaining persons were accounted for by the respective taluk revenue and health officials.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Saravanamuthu said the list sent by MOHFW has been completed and the houses were disinfected by health officials. A sticker with the name of the person quarantined and number of persons under home quarantine was pasted at the entrance of the house to ensure others did not enter. A stamp was put on the hands of the persons under home quarantine to identify them, he said.

There is no need for panic as of now, he said. With the Prime Minister announcing for a nation-wide shutdown for 21 days, it would help to prevent the virus spreading into the community, an official from the health department said. Residents in the city on home quarantine have to be advised to remain indoors for 28 days from now on, he said.

Meanwhile, the District Collector, A. Shanmuga Sundaram issued a stern warning against those wandering on the streets and asked them to remain indoors for the sake of their health and for others’ health.

152,2020/03/25,"Tamil Nadu sanctions ₹2,187 crore towards cash support, essential commodities","All eligible ration card holders can avail of cash assistance of ₹1,000 and essential supplies

The Tamil Nadu government has sanctioned funds to the tune of ₹2,187.8 crore, towards implementing the announcement made by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the State Legislative Assembly that cash support of ₹1,000 and essential commodities would be distributed to each of the eligible ration card holders across the State, as part of measures to mitigate the effect of the shut down on account of COVID-19.

According to a government order issued few hours after the CM’s announcement in the House on Tuesday, ₹2,014.69 crore has been earmarked towards distributing cash assistance and ₹173.1 crore has been allocated for supplying essential commodities through Public Distribution System (PDS) shops.

“To reduce overcrowding at fair price shop, the token system shall be adopted for the issue of cash support of ₹1,000 and the issue of essential commodities free of cost during April,” it stated.

All eligible ration cards are eligible for cash assistance of ₹1,000 and essential supplies such as rice, tur dal or Canadian yellow lentil, RBD palmolein oil and sugar, free during April. As per figures available with the Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, the total number of rice cards in circulation are 2,01,46,993, as on March 24.

“In case of beneficiaries who do not want to avail the cash support of ₹1,000 and commodities issued at free of cost, they can register their option on the website (www.tnads.pov.in) or mobile app (tnepds app) by indicating their card number, which will automatically lock PDS data systems in respect of benefits to the registered persons,” the order stated.

Family cardholders, who have not obtained PDS commodities for March may get their PDS commodities in April. The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation has been appointed a nodal agency for the distribution of cash support and commodities.

While District Collectors would be fully responsible for the implementation and distribution of the cash support to all rice cardholders well in advance, the Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department would be responsible for its implementation as well as for Chennai district.

153,2020/03/25,Coronavirus: Courts across Tamil Nadu to remain shut for three weeks following nationwide lockdown,"Only urgent cases will be taken up for hearing either through video conferencing or in person

The Administrative Committee comprising top seven judges of the Madras High Court held an emergency meeting at the residence of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi on Tuesday night and decided to suspend operations of all courts across the State for three weeks following a call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a nationwide lockdown to fight COVID-19.

It was notified that court work shall remain suspended in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai, its Madurai Bench as well as all trial courts in the State with immediate effect and that urgent cases alone would be taken up for hearing either through video conferencing or in person after the lawyers and litigants make a mention to the court officials concerned.

“Entry to the High Court at Madras and Madurai Bench shall remain prohibited for three weeks from today or until further orders, whichever is earlier,” the latest circular said Registrar General C. Kumarappan and Registrar (Judicial) M. Jothiraman could be reached through their e-mail IDs: regrgenl@tn.nic.in and m.jothiraman@aij.gov.in.

Similarly, the Additional Registrar General and Registrar (Judicial) in the Madurai Bench could be reached through thamilj1968@gmail.com. Further ordering that entry into all trial courts in the State shall also be prohibited, the High Court directed the Principal District Judges to notify the e-mails through which litigants and lawyers could contact them for hearing of urgent cases.

In so far as allocation of portfolios for the judges during the period of suspension was concerned, the Administrative Committee made it clear that the weekly seating arrangements made by it for its earlier decision of restricted hearing shall continue and the judges named in that notification would continue to be available for urgent hearing of cases during the suspension period.

The Chief Justice also made it clear that until the situation normalised, all anticipatory bail petitions should be filed first before the jurisdictional principal district and sessions courts. Only if such petitions get dismissed by the district courts, should the lawyers and litigants approach the High Court, a circular issued on his instructions read.

Pointing out that public prosecutors in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai as well as its Madurai Bench would find it difficult to obtain instructions from policemen spread across the State during imposition of prohibitory orders, the Chief Justice said, it would be far easier for prosecutors in district courts to obtain instructions from the local police.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coronavirus-courts-across-tamil-nadu-to-remain-shut-for-three-weeks-following-nationwide-lockdown/article31159590.ece

Tamil Nadu recorded its first death of a patient who had tested positive for COVID-19.

The 54-year-old man, who tested positive on March 23 and was undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, died.

At 2.02 a.m. on Wednesday, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar took to Twitter to declare the death.

“Despite our best efforts, the COVID-19 positive patient in Madurai Rajaji Hospital passed away a few minutes back. He had a medical history of prolonged illness with steroid dependent Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, uncontrolled diabetes with hypertension,” he said.

During a press meet on Tuesday night, the Minister clarified that though the patient did not have a travel history to an affected country, they had traced his contact history and found that he had come in contact with some Thailand nationals, who were on tour in the State.

155,2020/03/25,Man stabbed to death in Ooty market,"He had a quarrel over social distancing

A 35-year-old man was stabbed to death by a 23-year-old man following a quarrel allegedly over social distancing to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Police officials identified the deceased as R. Jothimani, 35, a resident of Nondimedu in Udhagamandalam. Jothimani, who was married and had two children, worked at the Ooty Municipal Market loading and unloading vegetables from trucks.

On Tuesday afternoon, he had come to have tea at a stall located just behind the market complex.

People who were at the tea stall, including the owner of the store, said Jothimani had asked N. Devdas, 23, a resident of Palakkad, to maintain safe distance from him as he was fearful of the spread of COVID-19, leading to a quarrel between the two.

When Jothimani tried to slap Devdas, he picked up a knife from the shop and stabbed Jothimani.

Jothimani died on the spot. The entire incident happened on a busy road in the heart of the town. A huge crowd gathered around the tea stall.

Police rushed to the spot and arrested Devdas. A case of murder has been registered.

Nilgiris District Superintendent of Police V. Sasi Mohan said the reason for the quarrel was unclear.

“Preliminary inquiry indicates that Jothimani had taken offence to Devdas standing too close to him at the tea shop resulting in the quarrel,” Mr. Sasi Mohan said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1p86e8/article31158013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25OOTYMURDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/man-stabbed-to-death-in-ooty-market/article31158014.ece
156,2020/03/25,To transplant or not: a COVID-19 question,"Non-urgent transplant surgeries such as kidney transplants in relatively stable patients on dialysis may be avoided in areas of high prevalence of coronavirus

The COVID-19 pandemic poses special challenges to patients with organ failure. Those waiting for transplant or who had received a transplant tend to have more severe disease due to weak immunity. Patients with severe heart, lung, or liver failure and waiting for transplant are at a high risk for dying if a transplant does not happen within a short period of time. But if there are clusters of COVID-19 disease in the region around the hospital or if there are COVID-19 patients already admitted in the hospital then, the course ahead becomes a quandry.

Performing a transplant surgery in such situation will increase the risk of exposure to the recipient during the surgery and in the recovery period. This exposure could happen from the donor or healthcare providers or other patients in the hospital. It is possible that the hospital resources could become limited due to COVID-19 cases and the care of the transplant recipients may get compromised.

Non-urgent transplant surgeries such as kidney transplants in relatively stable patients on dialysis may be avoided in areas of high prevalence of COVID-19. If the recipient is critically ill and the surgery is unavoidable then care must be taken to check both the donor and the recipient for COVID-19 prior to transplant.

Elective living donation transplants could continue in regions with low incidence and in hospitals with no infected patients. Deceased donation can continue in countries/regions with low incidence of COVID-19 but with stringent precautions.

Currently, there is no evidence to support blood-transfusion related transmission of the virus particles and no additional precautions need to be taken by the blood bank during transplant surgeries. But voluntary blood donation may decrease and hence available blood must be used judiciously.

All brain dead donors should be adequately screened for recent travel and potential exposure to virus. Deceased donation involves significant amount of interaction with the donor family, and increased human movement in hospital. Transplant coordinators should follow appropriate preventive measures to avoid exposure during evaluation. Donors with active infection or exposure to COVID-19 should not be considered for transplantation. Organ transportation throws additional challenges. Also deceased organ donation from hospitals with COVID-19 patients should be avoided due to risk of cross contamination.

Regular visits to the doctor should be limited during this period of virus spread. Physicians can use telemedicine to reduce visits but continue interacting with the patient. Routine investigations should be limited and any elective procedures must be postponed. Dialysis patients and their treating physician should identify another small volume unit for dialysis needs if the situation arises where the primary centre is overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.

The role of pre-emptive placement of AV fistula should be evaluated in patients with advanced renal failure to avoid the occurrence of emergent needs during COVID-19 epidemic. Transplant recipients with mild symptoms including runny nose, cough, throat pain and low-grade fever should be considered as suspected case of COVID- 19. They should be asked to self-quarantine themselves at home and consideration must be given to lower the immunosuppression.

A majority of mild illnesses resolve spontaneously, with time and rest. However, such patients should be asked to closely monitor their symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms such as breathing difficulty, high fever and lack of oxygen should be admitted to the hospital.

Immunosuppressive therapy should be discontinued or reduced in patients with severe illnesses. Currently, there are no proven therapies to cure coronavirus infection. The treatment in the hospital includes oxygen and organ supportive care until the lung injury resolves. Certain anti viral medication have been used on experimental basis with some reported benefits.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/byllvf/article31159476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/expert-speak,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/to-transplant-or-not-a-covid-19-question/article31157860.ece
157,2020/03/25,Two die in forest fire in Theni,"They were part of a group of workers returning from Kerala

A 43-year-old woman and a one-year-old child perished in a forest fire in Theni district’s Rasingapuram, a village in Bodinayakanur taluk, here on Tuesday.

K. Vijayamani and her granddaughter, T. Krithika Shri, were part of a group of 10 estate workers who were returning from Pethotty in Kerala’s Idukki district.

The group, including six women and a child, were walking through dry canals when a forest fire engulfed them, said a Forest department official.

One of the stranded workers called the 108, the emergency number, around 2.30 p.m., said an official from the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services, and informed them of their location.

Members from the Fire and Rescue, Police and Forest Departments began the rescue operation around 3 p.m.

District Forest Officer S. Gowtham said while one person suffered burns, the others escaped with injuries.

Three fire tenders from Theni, Bodinayakanur and Uthamapalayam were engaged for six hours to fight the blaze.

The Theni District Forest department had banned trekking in the Kurangani hills on February 15 till the end of summer season. Forest fires start in January, increase in February and peak during March.

158,2020/03/25,Organ transplants come to a halt across the State,"Experts feel determining COVID-19 status of donors not easy

Many hospitals across the State have suspended organ transplants in the wake of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

On a discussion forum of Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (TRANSTAN), a majority of transplant surgeons felt it was better to defer organ transplants for the time being as it would not be easy to determine the COVID-19 status of donors. The risk of transmission to recipients, other patients and staff would thus be minimised, a cross-section of them said.

Waiting list

Approximately, 8,000 persons are on the waiting list for various organs in Tamil Nadu. Officials said the World Health Organisation as well as American Society of Transplantation recommended COVID-19 screening for both recipients and donors.

“This is an unprecedented scenario, and we have to follow norms. There are areas of concern. A recipient on the waiting list is already immuno-compromised and whether we have to subject them to transplant is a question to be thought about,” an official said.

The number of healthcare personnel, who would be involved in retrieval and transplant of organs, was another area of concern.

Paul Ramesh, senior consultant Cardiothoracic and Heart-Lung Transplant Surgeon, Apollo Hospitals, said given the high infectivity and virulence of COVID-19, it was felt it would be prudent to avoid transplants in stable recipients. This was keeping in line with current guidelines.

“Patients who require lung transplants are at a very high risk if they contract the virus. We have recommended intense isolation at home for them. As the COVID status of a donor cannot be ascertained with 100% certainty within the time frame of a retrieval, a decision was made to stop transplants for all stable patients on the waiting list until we reach the tail of the epidemic. We will review the decision on March 31,” he said.

R. Surendran, director, Liver Transplant, MIOT Hospital, said it was important to keep ready the hospital services at a time of epidemic. “We need to save hospital resources. We need to ensure the safety of recipients. We have to be careful as recipients have to be put on immuno-suppressants, and this could have a serious impact if affected by COVID-19,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/organ-transplants-come-to-a-halt-across-the-state/article31157726.ece
159,2020/03/25,"Industrial growth has taken a hit, says Panneerselvam","‘Both exports and imports have been affected due to suspension of cargo movement’

Industrial growth has been adversely affected by the temporary closure of industrial units and commercial establishments following the outbreak of COVID-19, Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam informed the Assembly on Tuesday.

Speaking during the debate on the demands for grants to the Finance Department, Mr. Panneerselvam said major industrial hubs like Chennai, Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur, Salem, Madurai and Thoothukudi, among others, had been affected.

Exports in the manufacturing sector, including those of textile and knitwear products and machinery, had been hit, he said, pointing out that both exports and imports of goods had been affected due to the suspension of cargo movement to and from foreign countries. “Vehicular transport too has largely reduced,” Mr. Panneerselvam said.

“Due to these reasons, there has been a slump in the economy. No one could predict the economic loss resulting from the spread of a pandemic like COVID-19,” he said.

“The State government has a duty to implement people’s welfare schemes and make capital expenditure, despite the unusual circumstances. Funds for taking precautionary measures against the pandemic would be allocated from the State Disaster Response Fund,” Mr. Panneerselvam said.

The State government would take steps to overcome the dip in industrial growth and ensure growth by implementing all the schemes of various departments. IGST dues of about ₹7,517 crore were yet to be settled by the Centre, he said. Though the 15th Finance Commission had recommended a marginal increase in the funds allocated to Tamil Nadu, he said, “There are several problems facing the State, which require solutions. The Tamil Nadu government would present a revised note to the 15th Finance Commission.”

Around 500 tourists and students from Tamil Nadu, who were stranded abroad due to the COVID-19 outbreak, had been brought back to the State, Mr. Panneerselvam said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mhtfen/article30779251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/industrial-growth-has-taken-a-hit-says-panneerselvam/article31157706.ece

The law and order situation in Tamil Nadu under the ruling AIADMK is better than it was under the erstwhile DMK regime, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said in the Assembly on Tuesday.

In his reply during the debate on the demands for grants to the Police Department, Mr. Palaniswami said murder-for-gain cases at the end of 2010 was 1,868, but there were only 1,745 such cases during 2019-end.

""This means it rose by 5.9% every year during the DMK regime and has reduced by 0.7% over the past 9 years,"" the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Palaniswami also pointed out that the fund allocation for the Police Department was only ₹2,962 crore during 2010 under the erstwhile DMK regime, but had risen to ₹8,826 crore during the 2020-21 period.

Police recruitment

Referring to the proposed recruitment of over 2,500 police personnel, the CM said once they are recruited, the vacancies in the Police Department would be a mere 2%, as against 19.5% when the AIADMK came to power in 2011.

164,2020/03/25,Relocate desal plant project site away from Gulf of Mannar: MoEF,"No detailed marine environmental impact assessment was carried out, finds committee

The Ministry of Environment and Forests’ Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) has directed the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board (TWAD) to shift its project site for setting up a 60 MLD Sea and Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) plant in Ramanathapuram district away from the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park.

Alternatively, the EAC asked the Board to look at the possibility of 100% reuse of the brine water by giving it to authorised salt pan agencies, instead of discharging it into the sea, or set up a salt industry/allied facilities that could consume all the brine generated in case.

The TWAD proposal was to set up the 60 MLD SWRO desalination plant at Kuthiraimozhi village in Kadaladi taluk in Ramanathapuram district at a cost of ₹670 crore. Once the project is up and running, it would generate 94.52 MLD of brine that would be let out into the sea.

The Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority had recommended the project for clearance in January, 2017. The EAC noted that the project site is within the eco-sensitive zone of the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and approximately only about 25 metres from its boundary.

“The Committee desired to understand the compelling reason for location of the site in such a sensitive area and decided that the location should be shifted elsewhere. The Committee noted that the justification cited by the project proponent is unacceptable. It was observed that fishermen are dependent on the Gulf of Mannar for their livelihood and the release of brine certainly will impact not only the fish catch but also reefs, seaweeds, seagrass and the overall ecosystem of the area,” according to the minutes of the meeting that discussed the proposal.

The EAC also found that no detailed marine environmental impact assessment had been carried out for the project and the EIA report that was submitted before it had no information on the impact of the proposed project on the marine ecosystem, including flora, fauna, coral reefs among others. The project did not also have the brine dispersion model results, which are important to understand the fate and dispersion of the brine discharge from the desalination plant.

The EAC said the proposal was premature for consideration in its present form. The committee deferred the proposal for reconsideration to a later stage once TWAD submitted information, documents, and actions directed by it to be taken are submitted before it.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/relocate-desal-plant-project-site-away-from-gulf-of-mannar-moef/article31157553.ece

169,2020/03/25,"Manisha Koirala: 'I wish I could do any of Meryl Streep’s movies, that would be a dream come true for me'","The actor is happy with how her career has shaped up, but she’s now seeking opportunities to work with a new generation of filmmakers

Manisha Koirala believes that roles for women have become meatier and more substantial in recent years both for younger actresses as well as for those like her who are in their 40s. Naturally, this makes the actor very happy and she’s looking forward to the release of Dibakar Banerjee’s Freedom as well as an American project scheduled this year. Before that, though, she will star in director Neeraj Udhwani’s debut film, Maska. The actor plays Diana Rustom Irani, a proud Parsi owner of a café in Mumbai who is steeped in her culture and heritage. She’s keen for her son to accept and continue the legacy of the café he is about to inherit. But the conflict arises when his dreams clash with her own. “The essence of the story is [the need] to preserve one’s culture,” states Koirala who was holidaying in Nepal when she was first approached for Maska. The film was narrated to her soon after and she was immediately inclined to take it up.

Then and now

Koirala describes how the film holds on to the belief that while imbibing the modern is important, it should not come at the cost of one’s traditional values. “There is space for everything if we respect each other,” she states. To prepare for the role, Koirala visited Irani cafés, Parsi colonies, baugs and agiaries. “We couldn’t enter the agiary but we saw, sat and prayed from a distance,” she shares. The actress admits that this was not a character one could play without adequate preparation and hence watching documentaries and working with a Parsi diction coach were part of the research and training. “By the time I went on the floor, I was well-groomed,” she smiles adding that out that the role was incredibly well crafted which allowed her to slip into it with ease.

The actor, who was last seen in the anthology film Lust Stories, is enjoying a sort of second spring in films. While stating that the craft is what remains important, Koirala admits that she finds the digital space more professional and structured in its approach, especially with regard to its specified work hours and stringent contracts. She does emphasise that times have changed with storytelling becoming more nuanced allowing for experimentation. “I’m a little greedy in that… I wish I could do any of Meryl Streep’s movies, that would be a dream come true for me,” she reveals. While Koirala is happy devoting time to gardening, golfing and writing, she’s now dedicating time to also seek challenging work with a new generation of filmmakers.

Highs and lows

Her’s is a career studded with massive critical and commercial hits, full of memorable moments that she continues to cherish. “My beginning itself was a blessing,” she remarks. Subhash Ghai’s Saudagar not only proved to be a good start but also gave the actor the opportunity to work with legends like Dilip Kumar and Raaj Kumar. While Feroz Khan’s Yalgaar did not do well, her performance garnered appreciation and was among the films that helped her draw the early attention of directors like Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Mani Ratnam, Mansoor Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali who made widely acclaimed films with her in the 90s. Koirala also mentions the late cinematographer Ashok Mehta as being among the people who mentored her and guided her towards many of the prominent projects she ended up becoming a part of. While noting that there have been undeniably dark phases in her life, she asserts that overall, “it’s been a great ride”.

170,2020/03/25,The medical consultant for Steven Soderbergh’s ‘Contagion’ has now tested positive for coronavirus,"Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin had visited China in January during the coronavirus breakout there and had self-isolated himself for two weeks

Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin, who served as the medical consultant on Steven Soderbergh’s Hollywood drama Contagion, has tested positive for the coronavirus.

The movie, about the spread of a highly contagious and deadly virus, has come back in public consciousness as the world grapples with the coronavirus. The film, predictably, is enjoying a spike in popularity.

Lipkin, 68, revealed he had tested positive for the virus during an interview with Fox Business. He said he had an idea of where he contacted the virus but declined to elaborate further, reported IndieWire.

“I would like to say on this show tonight, this has become very personal to me, too. Because I have COVID as of yesterday. It’s miserable. If it can hit me, it can hit anybody. That’s the message I want to convey,” he said during the interview.

“It’s extraordinarily important that we harmonize whatever restrictions we have across the country. We have porous borders between states and cities and unless we’re consistent, we’re not gonna get ahead of this thing What New York, Chicago and Washington have done has been very, very helpful and I would like to see that implemented broadly across the United States,” he said.

Lipkin, who serves as the director of Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, was one of the leading figures in the scientific studies of the West Nile virus and the SARS coronavirus in the early 2000s.

He had also visited China in January during the coronavirus breakout there and had self-isolated himself for two weeks. Lipkin warned about the virus turning out to be a pandemic, which it has become, spreading to different countries around the globe.

Lipkin had agreed to work on Soderbergh’s movie because the filmmaker promised to accurately represent the science behind the spread of a virus.

Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan on Wednesday said that his former wife, interior designer Sussanne Khan, has temporarily moved out of her house to stay with the actor so that the duo can co-parent their children amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Hrithik and Sussanne, who have two sons, Hrehaan and Hridhaan, divorced in 2014.

The War star shared a picture of Sussanne on Instagram, writing, “It is unimaginable for me, as a parent, to think of having to be separated from my children at a time when the country is practising lockdown. It is heartwarming to see the world come together as one in this time of deep uncertainty and possibility of months of social distancing and potential lockdowns for several weeks perhaps.”

Hrithik said while the world talks about humanity coming together, he believes it represents more than an idea, “especially for parents sharing custody of their kids“.

“How to keep their kids close to them without infringing on the right of the other who also has an equal right to be with his/her children. This is a picture of dear Sussanne (my ex wife) who has graciously volunteered to temporarily move out of her home so that our children are not disconnected indefinitely from either one of us.”

“Thank you Sussanne for being so supportive and understanding in our journey of co-parenting. Our children will tell the story we create for them,” he wrote.

The actor added that he hopes and prays that in order to safeguard the health of ourselves and our loved ones, “we all find our way to express love, empathy, courage, strength with an open heart.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a complete lockdown across the country for 21 days from midnight, asserting that this is necessary for a decisive battle against the pandemic.

172,2020/03/25,"Amazon Prime Video introduces ‘Profiles’ option, similar to Netflix","With multiple members of the family logging in during this period of lockdown, streaming site debuts option to log in from different profiles

Amazon Prime Video has been one of the go-to OTT platforms in the recent times of quarantine and self-isolation, especially in India, where a lot of Hindi and other regional films immediately find presence, weeks after their release in theatres.

But one gripe users have always had with the platform is the lack of separate ‘profile’ options for different viewers: something that the likes of Netflix and the newly-introduced Disney Plus have offered to consumers.

Now, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and multiple members of the family binge-watching on the same account, Amazon Prime Video has finally decided to introduce the multiple profiles option that lets people have their own separate watch history, recommendations, progress on a show/ movie, as well as a watch list. The option can be seen on the top right-hand corner of the screen.

Upto six profiles can be created, compared to Netflix’s five, and the option of a kid’s profile is present as well. The new profiles can be deleted as well, and they have coloured avatars to identify between them.

Amazon has stated that Prime Video profiles are currently available in selected countries only. In India, Prime Video has been quite affordable at Rs 999 a year, but in other countries like the US where it costs around $120 a year, this comes as a welcome surprise for different members in a household to manage their watch profiles.

Amazon Prime Video profiles can be created and managed on select devices: Android and iOS devices, Fire tablets, Prime Video app on Fire TV (India-only), Chromecast, select Apple TVs, and in browsers everywhere. The option is not available on the Fire TV home screen, Alexa devices with a screen, and Fire Gen 9 or below tablets.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j4lg3a/article31163277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/prime,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/amazon-prime-video-introduces-profiles-option-similar-to-netflix/article31163278.ece
173,2020/03/25,"Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, other platforms suspend HD streaming on cellular networks in India","Digital players have also decided to lower the bitrates to 480p, to reduce less stress on telecom networks, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement for India to go under a 21-day lockdown

All the Indian OTT platforms, including the big players such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar and others have decided to act in the wake of the 21-day lockdown in the country, and restrict streaming on cellular networks to only SD (standard definition) content until April 14.

High definition (HD) as well as ultra-HD shall both be suspended effective immediately, and the bitrates shall also be lowered to 480p. This measure has been taken to counter the unprecedented surge in mobile internet consumption as India prepares to spend three weeks at home in self-isolation, to battle the coronavirus spread.

However, this move by the digital players is only for cellular networks and not for broadband.

According to a press release, the decision was taken during a virtual meeting organised by Uday Shankar, chairman, Star & Disney India, which was attended by top industry leaders: Sanjay Gupta (Google India), Ajit Mohan (Facebook India), Punit Goenka (Zee Entertainment Enterprises), NP Singh (Sony Pictures Networks), Sudhanshu Vats (Viacom18), Gaurav Gandhi (Amazon Prime Video), Nikhil Gandhi (Tiktok), Ambika Khurana (Netflix), Karan Bedi (MX Player) and Varun Narang (Hotstar).

“The government and the telecom operators are concerned about the total lockdown’s potential impact on the cellular network infrastructure. The digital industry is acutely aware of this challenge, and is committed to ensuring that all citizens are able to access mobile networks whenever and wherever they want,” read the statement.

Earlier last week, the Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI), that represents Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, had reached out to 12 video streaming platforms to implement measures such as reducing video quality. They had also written separately to the Department of Telecom on the same.

A lot of the streaming service providers, including YouTube, Netflix, MX Player, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Voot and ZEE5 have already announced that they have started taking steps to reduce strain on the Internet works.

Google-owned YouTube had also said in a statement earlier, that it is reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world.

“We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

The spokesperson added, “Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU.

Even in the midst of a break due to COVID-19, Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) and the Indian Adfilm Makers (IAM) switched on lights and camera for some action to shoot nine short films to create awareness about how to battle the Coronavirus as a society and practise social distancing to break the chain and stop the spread of the virus. The tag line of the films is ‘Nine superheroes and one villain, Corona’.

“The nine films are an initiative of FEFKA and IAM. The idea was planned and executed within two to three days just before the lockdown and the whole effort was led by teams of experienced and leading members of FEFKA and IAM. Directors Leo Thaddeus, Arun Gopy and Siddarth Siva were on location with the teams shooting the films. Sound, editing and music were all taken care of by our union members in charge of those departments. Three films have been released on YouTube on Wednesday. Five more will be released in the following days,” says film director B Unnikrishnan, general secretary of FEFKA, who heads the project along with Renji Panicker, scenarist, director and actor.

Wonder Woman Vanaja, featuring actors Muthumani and Sreeja Das, was the first to be released by Mohanlal on his Facebook page on Tuesday. It has been viewed by more than 40,000 viewers and counting. Featuring Manju Warrier’s voiceover, the less-than-one-minute film shows a lawyer, Vanaja, advising Sita, her domestic help, to stay at home and stay safe. Vanaja also gives Sita her salary to tide over the situation.

“As soon as the team got in touch with me, I agreed to be on board. The plot or the character did not matter. I liked the theme because the question of domestic workers and their livelihood is a grey area that is usually overlooked. The film focused on how important it was to ensure that they stayed at home without being forced to go without salary. The shoot was over in record time,” says Muthumani, a lawyer in real life who is working on her doctorate.

Directed by senior ad filmmaker Vinod A K, the film’s music has been composed by Rahul Raj. “We are working on a war footing. I did the music for Wonder Woman Vanaja and Superman Sadanandhan, which was released on Wednesday. Music director Ronnie Raphael is also working on some of the films. We are trying to work with a small team to ensure a common musical thread,” says Rahul.

Superman Sadanandhan features film director Johny Antony playing Sadhanandhan, an NRI who has come to Kerala for his niece’s wedding. However, instead of attending the wedding, he quarantines himself at home as a responsible citizen, thus becoming a ‘superman’.

Johny, who has made a name for himself as an actor, especially after his effortless act as a psychiatrist in Varane Avashyamundu, says he was happy to be part of such a campaign. “I enjoyed the theme and working with the team led by ad filmmaker Kumar Neelakantan. My only difficulty was that it was almost a solo act. So I found it a little embarrassing to do it all on my own. But these are situations all of us have faced and I managed to do it. However, I am relieved that the response has been good,” he says.

All the films were shot in Kochi and none of the actors or technicians took any remuneration for their efforts. “Each film has a common man who rises to the challenge to break the chain, thus becoming a superhero and every film touches on different aspects of social distancing and efforts to battle the pandemic,” explains Unnikrishnan.

Wonder Woman Sara, starring Rajisha Vijayan and Kunjan; Superhero Suni with Vishnu Unnikrishnan; Wonder Woman Vidya featuring Anna Reshma Rajan; Superman Shaji starring Siddartha Siva; Superman Subair with Sohan Seenulal and Superhero Anthony with Da Vinci Suresh will be released in the coming days.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ibmaqx/article31161470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVMMANJUWARRIER,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/stars-of-mollywood-show-how-ordinary-folks-can-turn-superstars-in-the-time-of-the-coronavirus/article31161471.ece

Director S S Rajamouli unveiled the title and first look motion poster of his forthcoming film, RRR, on Ugadi morning. The team had named the film RRR — referring to Rajamouli, actors Ram Charan and N T Rama Rao and had even asked film lovers to suggest suitable titles.

The Telugu title is Roudram Ranam Rudhiram and the motion poster shows Ram Charan as an embodiment of the element fire and NTR as water. What happens when these two forces with immense energy come together?

RRR is a fictional tale involving freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem. At a press conference last year, Rajamouli had stated that the inspiration came from Motorcycle Diaries. He had stated that RRR will be set in 1920s pre-independent India, and Ram Charan will play the younger version of Alluri Sitarama Raju while NTR will play the younger Komaram Bheem.

Prior to revealing the title, Rajamouli had tweeted on Wednesday: “It’s a time of global crisis. We wanted to do our bit in lifting up everyone’s spirits. We are launching the long overdue title logo with motion poster.” He added that his team members are working from their respective homes and urged everyone to stay home during lockdown.

In English, captioning RRR as Rise Roar Revolt, the team confirmed that the film’s release date is January 8, 2021.

177,2020/03/25,"Rescheduled Olympic Games need sacrifices, says IOC chief Bach","All options on the table, not just restricted to summer of 2021

International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said on Wednesday that the postponed Tokyo Games would require “sacrifices and compromises” from all sides to make them work.

“These postponed Olympic Games will need sacrifices, will need compromises by all of the stakeholders,” Bach told reporters in a conference call the day after the IOC decided to delay the 2020 Games because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The IOC’s role, Bach said, was “to make the Olympic dreams of athletes come true”.

He admitted that cancelling the Tokyo Games was “discussed and considered”, but said: “It was very clear from the beginning that cancellation was not something the IOC would in any way favour.”

Bach said the rescheduling of the Games in 2021 remained a “very challenging question”.

‘Here We Go’

A task-force, named ‘Here We Go’, had been created to examine the issue, Bach added, saying the first port of call would be with the 33 international federations, likely starting with a conference call on Thursday.

“The first step, we have to see with them, to see what the options are. We also have to take into account the sports calendar around the Olympic Games,” the German said.

The rescheduling, he added, “is not restricted just to the summer months. All the options are on the table, before and including the summer of 2021”.

Both World Athletics and the International Swimming Federation say they are prepared to move their 2021 world championships to accommodate the rescheduled Games.

One of the many logistical headaches caused by the historic postponement of the Tokyo Olympics has been the uncertainty around the Athletes’ Village overlooking Tokyo Bay. It was supposed to be re-purposed into condos for sale after the Games.

When asked about how a postponement might affect the Village and its conversion, Bach said: “I cannot tell you what the situation is. It’s one of the many thousand of questions the task-force has to address.

“It’s the Olympic Village (where) the heart of the Games is usually beating.”

Bach, who was part of West Germany’s gold medal-winning foil fencing team at the 1976 Olympics, added: “Of course, I’d be very, very delighted if we could have the Olympic Village in the traditional form.”

“Everybody who has once lived in an Olympic Village knows that this is the real Olympic experience, that this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”

“Living under one roof with the whole world, sharing your meals together, celebrating together, discussing together, and forming this unique Olympic unity.” Bach concluded by saying: “We are at an unprecedented situation and have an unprecedented challenge. We have to find the best possible situation under the circumstances that we are living in.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/de93kr/article31167265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26TOKYO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/rescheduled-olympic-games-need-sacrifices-says-ioc-chief-bach/article31167266.ece
178,2020/03/25,Tokyo Olympics | Athletes give thumbs up to postponement,"Say the decision was the right thing to do

Prospective Olympic competitors were quick out of the blocks on Tuesday after the Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021 and most gave the decision the thumbs up on social media.

“All in all a very wise decision,” tweeted Eliud Kipchoge, the Olympic marathon champion and the only man to run the distance in less than two hours. “I look forward to come back to Japan to defend my Olympic title next year and look forward to witness a wonderful event.”

Italian cyclist Elia Viviani, a track gold medallist in Rio in 2016, summed up much of the reaction when he tweeted: “Postponing the Olympics to 2021 is the best decision for me. Today we are all struggling with a much bigger problem.... So Olympics see you in 2021!”

More preparation

One of his sprint rivals, Britain’s Mark Cavendish said: “BIG news and it’s the right call,” before adding: “On a sporting side, there’s going to be a few nations thankful for 12 months more preparation!”

Also read: 2020 Olympic Games will be postponed, says IOC member Dick Pound

Belgian cyclist Victor Campenaerts was worried about his girlfriend, swimmer Fanny Lecluyse: “She has already been selected, will she be selected for next year’s Olympics? Does she have to qualify again? She was planning to retire after these Games.”

For some athletes, like Simone Biles who had said she planned to retire after Tokyo, it means another year of hard work. Her coach said the US gymnasts were ready.

Less happy

Russian gymnast Angelina Melnikova, was less happy with the decision.

“I’m very excited and now I’m very upset, we are all very upset. But now we have time,” she posted on Instagram.

“I’ll do my best gymnastics ever. Let’s go with me.”

At 25, British diver Tom Daley, who has won medals at the last two Olympics, said the extra year would take a toll.

“Yes, I’ll be another year older, and my body will feel that, but I promise to work my tail off.”

India’s Mary Kom tweeted: “Excellent and right decision.”

The 2012 women’s triathlon champion, Nicola Spirig, applauded the decision but hinted it could mark the end of her career.

But most expressed relief and optimism.

Dutch runner Dafne Schippers, who won silver in the 200 metres in Rio posted: “I was really looking forward... but for now we have to look at the bigger picture and do whatever it takes to beat the corona virus... let’s make sure we’ll celebrate even harder in 2021!”

US swimmer Lilly King, a double gold medallist in Rio, posted: “Just one more year to get better.”

“You gonna cry about it or boss up?” asked American wrestler Jordan Burroughs, a gold medalist in 2012, in a slangy tweet, “First of all imma do both.”

French double-Olympic judo champion Teddy Riner tweeted : “See you in 2021, Tokyo. First, we have a more important fight to win.”

British sprinter Dina Asher-Smith tweeted: “Tokyo2021. Same flame, new dates.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/49hova/article31167174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26KIP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tokyo-olympics-athletes-give-thumbs-up-to-postponement/article31167175.ece
179,2020/03/25,"Aboriginal customs have isolation, social distancing to avoid diseases","They draw from the experience of the innumerable epidemics that they faced over centuries

All religious customs of the aboriginal tribes in former composite Adilabad district focus mainly on the health and well being of the people, apparently drawing from the experience from the innumerable epidemics that the forest dwellers had faced over centuries.

The fact that the Raj Gonds even have a word for calamities, margad, indicates they had encountered several of those disasters which is why their invocations concentrates on seeking safety from the turn-of-the-season foul air which can bring death.

Protection from contagion by the method of isolation is also not new to the ethnic people here.

Their way of salutations and hugs are also an example which have come to grab attention in the wake of the COVID-19 scare and the protocol being enforced.

Former Labour Commissioner, H.K. Nagu, who is a Raj Gond hailing from Muthnur village in Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district, swears by the efficacy of isolation.

He recalls having been told by his grand father about the way his grand mother Lashimi with her two young sons went into isolation in her agriculture farm for 45 days and saved lives from the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.

The Adivasi salutation of Ram-Ram involves limiting the hand shake to barely the touch of finger tips immediately followed with the folded hand namaste. During special religious occasions, individuals go through the motions of a hug, called kallival in Gondi, without actual body touch as they do it maintaining a gap between bodies.

Another custom, which has almost been lost, pertains to maintaining personal hygiene evidently to keep contagious diseases at bay. Individuals coming home after a visit to some other village or place had to take a bath before entering home.

""We, the old men of Mandadi clan, still follow this custom of washing our bodies on coming back home,"" claimed Mandadi Ishru, the elder, as he attended prayers to Aki avval, the mother goddess at his remotely located village Shettihadapnur in Jainoor mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district on Tuesday.

She is a family member and primary contact of P34- a 49-year-old man from Kokapet, Rangareddy, who has travel history to London. He was confirmed positive on Tuesday. P40 is a case of local transmission.

P41 is a three-year-old boy with travel history to Saudi Arabia. Condition of both the patients is stable.

P40 is sixth case of local transmission in the State as the patient does not have any travel history, is a contact of a positive patient and tested positive for coronavirus. On Tuesday, three such cases were detected. On multiple occasions, officials have been urging foreign returnees or who has been in transit to be under quarantine for 14 days from the date of arrival in India.

Besides, quarantine was also recommended for people who have come in contact with a COVID-19 confirmed case. If any of them develop symptoms, they can contact nearest government hospital and for queries, dial health help line ‘104’.

Several people in the integrated old district have gone into self-isolation closing all roads leading to their villages by putting barricades, boulders, fencing and nets across roads ever since the Central and State governments have imposed total lockdown in their efforts to combat COVID-19. Gram Panchayats and Village Development Committees unanimously resolved not to allow any newcomer or those who are coming from abroad.

Some villages even went to the extent of imposing penalties on those who enter by violating the conditions. Rural people are implementing lockdown better than residents of towns. On the other hand, civil and police machineries which were shocked with a large number of people coming on to roads on Monday after the Janata Curfew on Sunday immediately were alerted and put a strict vigil.

People in Indalwai, Darpally, Dichpally and Sirikonda and in several other mandals are observing self-isolation by not coming out of homes. At Kothapet in Mosra mandal residents, including women, voluntarily kept a watch on roads holding sticks to prevent outsiders from coming into the village. In Akula Kondur youth clubs put up barricades on roads. Passage of vehicles through Indalawi toll plaza has completely stopped.

Youth in shifts are patrolling in villages not allowing villagers to go out of the village and allow newcomers into the village. All transport vehicles and autorikshaws were off the roads and trains stopped. Only private vehicles are seldom seen on roads. The doctors’ street, Khaleelwadi which is always busy with visiting patients and their attendants and ambulances wore a total deserted look. Except a few medical shops all remained closed.

The inter-State borders at Salabathpur in Kamareddy district and Salura in Nizamabad were sealed off.

182,2020/03/25,Demand for paid holiday to Singareni coal miners,"‘They work in groups and are exposed to COVID-19 virus’

The Singareni Coal Mines Karmika Sangh affiliated to BMS has demanded paid holidays for coal miners by the Singareni management to check the spread of COVID-19 in the coal belt region.

Talking to The Hindu on Tuesday, BMS state president Kengerla Mallaiah flayed the Singareni management for its ‘dual standards’ on controlling the deadly virus in the region.

On the one hand, the government has declared a lockdown to check the spread of the virus, and on the other hand, the management has forced the workers to come to the mines to achieve the target coal production by risking their lives.

“Unlike other sectors, coal miners are forced to work in groups and some jobs are linked with chain among miners. There is every possibility of miners touching each other,” he said, and added that the outsourcing staff were mostly migrants thus exposing others to the risk of virus spread.

Also, miners on their way to duty were being stopped by the police and their vehicles seized in spite of showing ID cards on the pretext of lockdown, he stated.

In the interest of coal miners’ health, he urged the State government to declare paid holidays to all the 48,000 coal miners working in various underground and open cast projects.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/demand-for-paid-holiday-to-singareni-coal-miners/article31157268.ece

The Karimnagar Municipal Corporation (KMC) in coordination with the district administration distributed vegetable packets to residents of three municipal divisions declared ‘red zones’ in the town on Tuesday.

The sanitation staff in special protection suites distributed vegetables in divisions 52, 53 and 60. Each bag contained cabbage, ridge gourd, chillies, tomatoes, bitter gourd, ladies’ finger, brinjal and other leafy vegetables, weighing around six kg.

Three sanitation staffers transported over 4,000 packets in an auto to respective localities and distributed one packet to each household. Earlier, Mayor Y. Sunil Rao visited the Rythu Bazaar area where the horticulture department had procured the vegetables and packed special bags to be handed over at Mukarampura and Kashmirgadda.

It may be recalled that the district administration has declared areas opposite the Collectorate in Mukarampura and Kashmirgadda, and localities near the mosques where the 10 Indonesian preachers, who were tested COVID-19 positive, had moved around, as ‘red zones’.

Police had completely sealed the localities by barricading the entry and exit points into the colonies where the Indonesians had toured. Policemen have been deployed at the barricades to stop people from coming out. The civic authorities had sanitised the areas by spraying disinfectants.

186,2020/03/25,Understanding remote working against the backdrop of a pandemic,"In these days of remote working, when it is more of an exigent need and hardly a considered choice, how does the average office-goer who has a certain ritual, a certain pattern to working bring that same ethos to the home?

A vast chunk of the workforce across the board is working from home today, and to call it a huge jump from earlier numbers of the remote-functioning workforce (largely constituted by gig economy workers and others requiring special working arrangements), would be a blatant under statements. This does beg the question: how do you deliver work from a new environment (it’s your home, but you never thought of it as your workplace). The first point is to accept the change. If we observe closely, our routines and patterns keep changing over a period of time. Change could be due to a new organisation, a new office facility or different work locations. Will we miss the old rituals? Of course. But, then, just the way we get used to new scenarios, we will automatically get used to new patterns and behaviours while we work from home. Today technology enables us to stay connected with colleagues on WhatsApp, Cliq, Google hangout, as also tools such as Zoom and Skype.

For those of us working from home for the first time, a few quick pointers: One, treat work from home (WFH) seriously, and this would mean following some of the norms that go with working in an office, such as a dress code and timings. Two, it is necessary to engage with your team. Three, communicate, communicate, communicate. Err on the side of plenty and communicate with your boss more than usual. And of course, there should be a frank conversation with all your stakeholders at home – children, parents, spouse, extended family about your new work arrangement and its demands. Four, motivate yourself frequently. This particular WFH scenario is hardly business-as-usual. Hence there might be a sense of dullness. Don’t assume that WFH has to always be under stressful situations. Listen to music, have a chat with a colleague, raise your spirits. Even if you miss your office and the camaraderie with colleagues, realise that this could well be the new normal.

Does the Covid experiment of remote working bode well for organisations that are yet to institutionalise this as a way of working? Will this experience prove an eye-opener for them?

A whole lot of organisations – both Indian and global – have rolled out work-from-home plans in the last few weeks. For a good number of these companies, it is not something new. But for a vast number of companies, it is. They include small and medium businesses which have until that day, never ever had employees working from home. To work effectively from home, we need the full spectrum of all enablers – great connectivity, the hardware, the software, a separate workspace, clarity in your tasks for the day, a workable schedule you can stick to, and ways to connect with others. Work from home / remote work is and has always been possible as a concept. Depending on the industry, it can vary from 25% to 100%. As a result of the COVID-19 situation, a number of organisations are alive to the advantages of flexibility. All that they have to do now is to draw up policies and protocols and reporting guidelines to integrate WFH organically and seamlessly into their work culture.

If WFH is successful now, will it mean good news for certain talent pools that seek flexibility as a key enabler?

Absolutely! For the longest time, seeking flexibility in working has been seen as a huge career impediment. In fact, young mothers and care givers resorted to work-from-home to grapple with life needs, and that was unfairly held against them. Talent scouts stayed clear of “those diversity profiles who require flexibility” because they found it difficult to convince operating managers that such diversity (and flexibility) built better organisational culture.

Around the world, there are eight popular strands of diversity that organisations focus on – Gender, Ability, Generation, Sexual Orientation, Culture & Language, Socio-Economic dimensions, Religion and Ethnicity. Of these, Gender, Ability, Generation & SED are those strands for which most companies have talent acquisition strategies. Research has time and again established that flexible working is one of the Top 3 enablers for these talent segments. However, remote work might not be viewed only as a “diversity or minority” prerogative. And having robust systems to support work from home and other modes of flexibility can prove to be critical for talent retention irrespective of the diversity strand, they represent. This will in turn enable talent pools of more than 15 lakh women second-career professionals, over 20 lakh persons with disability and close to 5 lakh trained veterans (India data 2016), to contribute a whopping INR 14 billion to the Indian economy.

187,2020/03/25,Visual artist uses Raja Ravi Varma paintings to spread awareness on hygiene practices related to Covid-19,"Rahul V Mathew uses Raja Ravi Varma paintings to create digital art to spread awareness on hygiene practices related to Novel Corona virus via art

‘Ahalya’, of Raja Ravi Varma’s eponymous painting, lounges in a supermarket, by a shelf. In her hand is a basket containing two bottles of Dettol. The digital collage, by Bengaluru-based artist Rahul V Mathew, is a message against panic buying. This is his way of spreading awareness – via art on his Instagram handle rahul_v_mathew – on issues and challenges related to the current pandemic, Covid-19.

In the original Ravi Varma painting, Ahalya is in a forest and her basket holds flowers. Rahul, a 23 year-old who belongs to Kochi, is a graduate of the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology (Bengaluru) and works as a junior designer with Swiggy. He has three other collages – ‘Krishna sitting with Yashoda and a female attendant’, ‘Menaka and Shakuntala’, and ‘Stolen Interview’ similarly placed in the contemporary, Covid-19 context. Explaining why he is using art to communicate, he says, “Visuals register more than text.”

Each of his posts has a note under it that expands on the idea. The text under ‘Krishna...’, for example, which shows the attendant using wet wipes on Krishna’s hands explains the importance of washing hands. ‘Menaka and Shakuntala’, which features two mythological characters on an airport walkway is about social distancing. And ‘Stolen Interview’ focuses on taking care of one’s mental health.

Rahul says he uses collage as a medium because it is liberating and gives him the freedom to create and express himself. He uses Ravi Varma characters as he feels they communicate and have an impact because Ravi Varma paintings are familiar and hence when reworked each becomes quirky and catches the eye.

This is not the first time Rahul has worked with Ravi Varma paintings. IN 2019, he created ‘Varma Printing Press in Mumbai’ (2019), a series of digital collages using the royal artist’s works. Best known for his depiction of Indian deities and episodes from the epics, Raja Ravi Varma is one of India’s celebrated artists. His works are one of the best examples of European techniques melding with the Indian sensibility. He made lithographs of his paintings available to the public increasing the involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic taste too.

He started a lithographic press in Mumbai in 1894 before moving it to Lonavala. It also placed the paintings and characters in Mumbai in present times, with a social message. Radha Bilas’ Radha and Krishna are placed in a photograph of a dhobi ghat in present day Mumbai, giving it a new context. In Rahul’s telling Krishna is ‘offering to help’ Radha wash rest of the clothes — “to share Radha’s workload. These were all about socially relevant issues,” he says of the last series.

Explaining why he chooses to work with Raja Ravi Varma’s art, Rahul says, “He gave faces to most Indian gods and goddesses and is a huge part of Kerala and Indian art.” And the idea of juxtaposing seemingly incompatible elements came from a visit to Hasta Shilpi village in Udupi, which restores artefacts from across the country. “Artefacts from Rajasthan and other places are restored here, there is an absence of context caused by the displacement. That gave me the idea of creating art by juxtaposing unlikely, unexpected elements.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/csb1jd/article31163553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25kimppotraitjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/rahul-v-mathew-uses-raja-ravi-varma-paintings-to-create-digital-art-to-spread-awareness-on-hygiene-practices-related-to-novel-corona-virus-via-art/article31163559.ece
188,2020/03/25,How practitioners of different art forms are coping as all cultural programmes have been cancelled due to the Coronavirus lockdown,"The artistes speak about how they have been affected and what they are doing during this period

It is a race against time to stop the spread of COVID-19. No efforts have been spared to try and maintain social distancing. Along with cinemas and other events in Kerala, several cultural programmes held in connection with temple festivals, big and small, and by cultural organisations have been cancelled all over the State. Those affected by this are hundreds of musicians, percussionists and performers of classical art forms such as Kathakali, Koodiyattam, Carnatic musicians and so on. While artistes on the rolls of training institutes, colleges and Devaswom Boards can be assured of their monthly salary, those affected by the cancellations are freelance artistes and those who depend on recitals for their livelihood. FridayReview speaks to practitioners of different art forms to find out how they have been affected by the steps to contain the virus. And what they are doing during this period when stages have fallen silent.

One of our recitals did get cancelled and that was in Pathanamthitta. One has been postponed. I am not sure if it will be rescheduled. I am a homemaker with a passion for Kathakali. So it is not a question of a livelihood for me. But for many artistes the lockdown and cancellation of programmes and temple festivals have come as a blow. My heart goes out to them. This was the season that helped them save up for a rainy day. Now, that has been thrown out of gear. In certain temples, Santhanagopalam is staged as an offering. For instance, at Maruthorvattom Sri Dhanwanthari Temple at Cherthala, near Alappuzha, there are 57 days of Kathakali. That meant work for Kathakali artistes, percussionists, vocalists, make-up artistes and so on. Since it is doubtful if it will go as per the plan, a whole lot of those involved in traditional art forms will be in dire straits. As it is, but for a handful of leading artistes, Kathakali artistes are paid a pittance for performances.

Moreover, many resorts stage truncated Kathakali recitals for their guests, a means of income for artistes staying away from big towns. The slump in tourism will deprive them of that and I wonder if any of them will pay these artistes at least a nominal amount to help them cope with this crisis. While many are keen on using Kathakali for ads and for videos such as the latest ones that advocate washing of hands with soap to prevent getting an infection, not many stop to think about the plight of many artistes who depend on stages to earn a living. So it would be wonderful if some of these ad agencies and others conduct Kathakali recitals to give them opportunities to make ends meet. As for me, I will continue practising at home!

My wife, Aswathy, a Carnatic vocalist and faculty member at NSS College for Women, and I had to cancel our trip to the US. I had a couple of solo performances and Aswathy had a few concerts. We were supposed to go for the visa interview in Chennai when the ban on travelling to the US was announced. So the entire concert schedule got cancelled. I am not sure if it can be rescheduled. Several of my concerts in the State have also been called off in adherence with the Government’s directive to avoid crowds and maintain social distancing. I have been practising and listening to music as I usually do when I am at home.

Since we are all at home, I have been learning some new kritis, listening to the masters and working on some projects I am involved with. I am a guest faculty at the Swathi Thirunal College of Music and we are in the process of choreographing some rare Swathi kritis in the Kerala Natanam dance format. The College perhaps has the only department in Kerala that is dedicated to Kerala Natanam. I will be taking care of the music and the department will take up the choreography. Another pet project is a musical drama I have been visualising for some time. It will be staged by my students and all the songs will be Carnatic compositions. The actors, like in the plays of yore, will be singing the pieces themselves. In the early days of theatre and cinema in India, the songs were sung by actors themselves and greats like MS Amma (MS Subbulakshmi) are pioneers on screen. I was extremely disappointed that a special concert dedicated to Swathi Thirunal organised by All India Radio for an invited audience had to be put on hold. Even a recording at AIR has been postponed.

My three sons [Udupi Srikanth, Udupi Srinath and Udupi Srijith], also artistes, have had their stage programmes cancelled, some of which were scheduled in Chennai and Mumbai. But this setback is nothing compared to the grave situation that we are in now. Every individual in society is affected. As for the artistes, I can totally empathise with those who solely depend on stage programmes for a living. But at present we can’t afford to take any risk and the only option is to be at home. None of us can predict how things will pan out. The only good thing that has come out of this is that, except for a few, people have come together, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, to follow the precautions and stop the spread.

Even though there is disappointment over the cancellation of my programmes, I prefer to stay optimistic. I have closed down my dance classes. However, a few of them are learning online. Even though I can teach only one or two students at a time, that is perfectly fine with me. This is a time to stay at home and prove that you are a responsible citizen.

I am a full-time artiste and don’t take tuitions or online classes. I had concerts in temples in different parts of Kerala and outside the state, besides a few recordings as well. At least 20 events till April 20 have been cancelled so far. It is a disheartening scenario. Many artistes don’t have savings and some of us are burdened by loans as well. An extension of deadlines for repayment of loans for traditional and classical artistes will bring a lot of relief. At the same time, I also feel that I am better off when compared to those people in the lowest strata of the society who eke out a living with their meagre income. The only silver lining is that I am spending more time with my family and children.

I was looking forward to some of the performances, especially one at Mussoorie and some workshops, besides programmes at my native place, Irinjalakkuda. Now I am confined to my home, reading books and doing some farming. I prefer to stay optimistic even when I don’t know what is going to happen next. I call up friends and fellow artistes to ensure that they also are at home. It is a tough time for all artistes. However, at least we can try to stay occupied by indulging in something creative related to our respective art forms. But I can’t stop thinking about the economically backward sections of our society who will have no work. Also, I wonder what those people with no artistic inclination will be doing at home.

I am taking each day as it comes. I have been working on several productions for the coming months and had set deadlines for each of them. But now everything is in a limbo. I am trying to use the free time to do something creative. I am also cleaning my flat, room by room, organising my wardrobe and trying out new recipes with minimal ingredients. However, at the back of mind I am stressed because there is apprehension and insecurity around. Things have gone beyond thinking about art or earning an income. This is a phase when we all have to understand that life is short and so we have to live in the moment. Since my dance classes have been cancelled, I have told my students to practise at home and send me videos so that I can suggest the corrections. Or, I give them assignments over phone.

Since I am a faculty at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit not many programmes were scheduled. However, now that the classes have been suspended, I am at home working on a production I have in mind. I had plans to do a documentary as well, but that has been postponed for the time being. I am concentrating on writing, besides organising my collection of books. I am not sure how my fellow artistes, especially those who depend solely on the festival season, are going to tide over the crisis. But there is no other go other than staying indoors. That is the way to stay united for a cause.

We were supposed to go to Israel for recitals and discussions at Hebrew University but I doubt if that will happen now. So we are now reading the texts and the Natyashastra, something that we rarely get time for during the season when there are programmes in many places. For now, it is practice, reading and discussions. It is a tough phase and we have to pull along.

For six weeks now, every Friday, I have had live sessions on Facebook, singing pieces of whatever genre I was in the mood for. I have also been recording and posting four- and five-minute video clips of different kinds of music: folk, film songs, poems, compositions of my father (the late Kavalam Narayana Panikker), Carnatic...I spend about four to five hours every day in my studio. I am using this period to compose, recite and record verses from the Bhagavatham that my father had interpreted in Malayalam. It is a work that he had completed just weeks before he passed away. Recently, I got a copy of it and I have been working on it. It is going to take time but I am enjoying it.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/mew5dj/article31162240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVFPARVATHY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/how-artistes-from-various-art-forms-are-coping-as-all-cultural-programmes-have-been-cancelled-due-to-the-coronavirus-lockdown/article31162263.ece
189,2020/03/25,How are museums and galleries catering to their patrons during lockdown?,"From printable stencils to doodle worksheets, museums and galleries across India aim to interact with art enthusiasts through digital intervention

Be it a Degas, replete with the fleeting beauty of an Impressionist painting dominated by the serenity of pastel shades or a Padamsee, narrating stories in bright tones, colours and abstract figures — it is imperative that visual arts take up the online space now more than ever, as the country’s cultural life inevitably heads towards a standstill. While the Met and MOMA are embracing this change by asking its connoisseurs to revisit popular attractions through virtual tours (in the former’s case, the magnificent Neo-Classical Grand Hall, the Gothic Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park and the more-than-2,000-years-old Temple of Dendur can be viewed through 360-degree videos), Indian galleries are introducing interactive digital interventions aimed at children and adults alike.

During these long, unexpected bouts of self-isolation, art continues to be a medium that a lot of people turn to. This does not come as a surprise. The therapeutic qualities of the arts — be it visual or performative — are time and again proven to be tools of self-expression in a possibly ‘lonely’ time. Digital galleries and physical ones that are under closure, are tapping into this aspect to make their presence felt online and are trying to be informative while doing so.

Imagine you are stuck within the four walls of your home and are magically gifted with stencils that you could fill colour into. What if these very stencils come with little nuggets of information that describe the genre of art it is done in? Mumbai-based Sarmaya, a digital museum with a diverse range of Indian art and artefacts, built from the private collection of Paul Abraham (founder), has introduced downloadable stencils of their folk and indigenous art collections — Gond art and thol bommalattam puppets, to be precise. “How do we create something that is fun and also has a learning opportunity and scope for reference? This was the idea behind creating the stencils,” says Avehi Menon, archive director at Sarmaya.

The reference pictures also give information about the philosophy behind these art forms, all of which is available on the website, she adds. This move was welcomed by children and their parents alike, the latter engaging in research following the activity. And it complemented the ‘museum without boundaries’ concept that Sarmaya had adopted since its inception. “While smaller, physical museums suffered more due to this unprecedented move, we have also had to replan our programming in terms of content,” adds Avehi. Art in some way provides hope and comfort and the act of engaging in something creative, while learning new things, is vital in times such as these.

At Mumbai’s Jehangir Nicholson Art Foundation (JNAF), which had been closed since March 14, specially curated content is being doled out on social media, as a response to the needs of the time. They recently initiated an interactive activity on Instagram aimed at those who worked from home. Titled ‘What’s on your lunch table’, the activity invited people to doodle on a line drawing of a table which was taken from an FN Souza painting, which was part of JNAF’s collection. The responses that they received, which were consequently put out as Instagram stories, were varied to say the least — while some had plated dishes on the tables, others portrayed laptops and work materials on their dining table, which currently doubles up as a work table; some even drew hand sanitisers as an integral part of their table. In addition to this, an online exhibition of Akbar Padamsee’s work, titled Akbar Padamsee: A Tribute, is also accompanied by impressively curated information which is consolidated as Instagram stories. “He had done these retro graphic works in the late 90s. We have made colour sheets inspired by them that can be downloaded and used in screens or otherwise,” Kamna Anand of JNAF, adds. A Women’s History Month (March) campaign is also underway — “Every weekend, since March 8, we put up a work by one of the women artists from our collection with relevant information,” adds Kamna.

In the following weeks, such creative interventions will undoubtedly be on the rise. As much as these exercises are therapeutic, they also encourage adults to minimise their screen time. So, now is the right time to dive in and seek respite in colours.

190,2020/03/25,Coping with a COVID-19 hotspot,"Bhilwara sees massive screening after outbreak in hospital

A curfew in force for the sixth consecutive day. A massive screening exercise involving 1,500 health workers. Four fresh cases, taking the total number of infected patients to 17. Bhilwara, considered the hub of textile manufacturing in Rajasthan, has grabbed national attention following a number of positive cases of COVID-19 being detected at a private hospital in the city.

The sheer number of people being screened in Bhilwara, after the administration sealed the district’s borders and imposed curfew much before a lockdown was announced in the entire State, has made it possibly the biggest exercise in the country.

The outbreak of COVID-19 in Bhilwara occurred last week from the private hospital where a doctor tested positive after he admitted a patient with pneumonia in the ICU earlier this month. The patient, who was allegedly carrying the virus, later died at a hospital in Jaipur.

Doctors, staff infected

Two medicos and several members of the hospital’s paramedical staff were subsequently found positive after multiple testing. The hospital was sealed and its 88 patients were shifted to other health facilities, while contact tracing was undertaken to find out hundreds of people who had come to the outpatient department for consultation.

The doctors and staff are among the 38 persons being kept in the isolation wards of Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital and a few other health facilities. Bhilwara Chief Medical and Health Officer Mushtaq Khan told The Hindu that the doctor who first tested positive and his wife, who was also infected, have been shifted to Jaipur.

As many as 5,392 persons in Bhilwara have been told to quarantine themselves at home. The rapid response teams, which were rushed from Udaipur, are assisting the local health workers in covering about half of the city’s 6 lakh population in the first phase.

After the lockdown in the city, the administration has turned its attention to the rural areas as three persons showing symptoms of the disease were found roaming in the villages. Nine villages in Mandal tehsil were placed under curfew as a precautionary measure after it was found that the villagers had earlier visited the hospital in Bhilwara.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coping-with-a-covid-19-hotspot/article31167888.ece
191,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Mumbai crematorium staff battle COVID-19 fears during final procedures,"The city recorded death of 4 patients who tested positive.

A 51-year-old staff member at the crematorium in Mumbai’s Shivaji Park hasn’t been to his Dombivali home since the past four days because of the lockdown, due to coronavirus (COVID-19). He sleeps at the crematorium worrying about one thing — that the virus from the two coronavirus (COVID-19) deceased who were cremated there could be lurking around. “We have followed all the infection control measures but there is so much news about the virus that it is difficult to shed the fear,” said Jawaharlal Rathod (36), a death registration karkun (DRK) at the crematorium.

“I am in charge of the paperwork and therefore I come in contact with the relatives, ambulance drivers,” said Mr. Rathod, who has been using sanitisers and washing his hands at a regular interval as advised by the medical officer.

First fatality

On March 17, when a 64-year-old man’s body wrapped in a leak-proof plastic and cloth arrived at the Shivaji Park crematorium, the other staff was tense. The deceased, who was Maharashtra’s first COVID-19 fatality, was brought in a special biohazard vehicle and an hour before it arrived, the medical health officer briefed the staff on infection control protocol. “I have handled many unclaimed bodies. I have also handled bodies of HIV and TB patients. But this time, we were asked to be extremely cautious as very little is known about the new virus,” said 47-year-old furnace operator Anil Thakur, who handled the first deceased along with two labourers on duty. It was a first for them to wear aprons, gloves, goggles and masks while handling a body. “Soon as the vehicle arrived, the body was taken to the furnace. We were told that there should be no delay anywhere,” said Mr. Thakur, adding that his wife became extremely paranoid when she learnt about it. “Since that day, she had been constantly reminding me to wear the protective gear properly and be careful,” he said.

‘Responsibility key’

Another furnace operator, Nitin Nagotkar who handled the second patient’s body said there was always a slight fear. “But we understand our responsibility is crucial,” he said.

The Centre’s guidelines on dead body management state that the ash does not pose any risk and can be collected to perform the last rites. But as a precautionary measure, the ash was also disposed by the crematorium staff in these cases.

Mumbai has recorded death of four patients who tested positive for COVID-19. While two bodies were cremated at Shivaji Park, the third was cremated at the Chandanwadi crematorium in south Mumbai. The fourth patient, a Philippines national, was an Islamic scholar who was visiting Indian mosques. Since the last two samples before his death were negative, his case has not been labelled as a COVID-19 death. A Muslim trust in the central suburbs that was first approached by the civic body turned down the request for his burial. “They feared that if the news got out, the community members will not turn up for the badi raat that is coming soon,” said an official, adding that the burial was then carried out in another location. “The staff there too was apprehensive. But we counselled them and convinced them that all the infection control measures were in place,” the civic official added.

The Centre’s guidelines state that there is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID-19 infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling the body. The guidelines, however, say that large gatherings should be avoided.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/erl03n/article31167694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1PNG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-mumbai-crematorium-staff-battle-covid-19-fears-during-final-procedures/article31166761.ece
192,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Goa to home deliver essential supplies through volunteers,"Shops can do only home delivery: Pramod Sawant

A day after it was criticised for not giving adequate time for citizens to stock up on groceries and vegetables, the Goa government on Wednesday said all essential groceries and medicinal supplies would be home delivered to the people by ‘volunteers’ as the movement of individuals and private vehicles remained prohibited across the coastal State.

Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, following a high-level committee meeting, said shops relating to the sale of food, groceries, fruits, vegetables, dairy and milk booths, meat, fish and animal fodder would be permitted to function only for the purpose of home delivery. “No public or customers will be permitted to enter the shops for purchase. District Collectors will invite applications from interested shops and establishments willing to do home delivery. A maximum of two persons will be permitted for delivery,” Dr. Sawant said.

Passes to volunteers

A notification said jurisdictional police inspectors would issue passes to volunteers who would carry out the home delivery of goods within a 1 km range. No delivery charges were to be charged, the government order said.

Food helpline

The government also announced the setting up of a food helpline. “Any person or organisation interested in arranging food for the homeless and needy as well those in need of food can contact this helpline. A medical helpline for medicines to senior citizens and divyangs was also established under the Food and Drugs Administration,” the government order said.

The order also gave exemptions to Central and State government employees, sanitation workers, those employed in banks, insurance, telecom, Internet, cable television, e-commerce and allied areas to move around subject to displaying of their identity cards.

Pramod Sawant

Opposition’s reaction

The Opposition said this was completely opposite to what other States were doing, where stores dealing with essential supplies like vegetables, milk, groceries etc were open to public with social distancing measures observed.

Goa Forward Party president and former Deputy Chief Minister, Vijai Sardesai, said, “National guidelines allow all shops selling essentials like grocery, milk, meat, fish, vegetables to be open. However, it does not apply to Goa. I am alarmed at the way this government is handling its response to COVID-19.” Mr. Sardesai said his party corporators, local leaders and self-help groups would ensure home delivery to residents.

An incident of lathi charge was reported from the capital Panaji on Wednesday. Officials said that despite being told repeatedly, a shopkeeper in Merces was selling items, which resulted in crowding around the shop.

Meanwhile, a Dornier aircraft of the Indian Navy, with a team of four doctors from the Goa State Health department, left for Pune on Wednesday. The medical team led by Dr. Savio Rodrigues, Head of Department, Microbiology, Goa Medical College, will undergo training to set up a COVID-19 test facility at Goa. A request to the Navy for providing air transport was received by Flag Officer Commanding, Goa Area, on March 24. The Navy immediately initiated necessary procedures for the aircraft take off. A few samples of COVID-19 suspects were also carried by the medical team for testing. The medical team is likely to return to Goa on March 27 after the training.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/osh7ip/article31166683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMGOA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-goa-to-home-deliver-essential-supplies-through-volunteers/article31166680.ece
193,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Rajasthan migrant workers return home on foot from Gujarat,"On their way home to Rajasthan.

In the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the 21-day nationwide lockdown, thousands of migrant workers from Rajasthan working in different parts of Gujarat have started walking back to their native places in the absence of transport facility.

Also read | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Gujarat Police have been trying to convince them to abide by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to avoid travelling. A Congress leader from Ahmedabad has asked the party-led government in Rajasthan to arrange some transportation after these workers reach the Gujarat-Rajasthan border near Shamlaji town of Arvalli district, also known as the Ratanpur border.

Radheshyam Patel, a native of Rajasthan’s Dungarpur district and working in Ahmedabad, said there is no point in staying in Gujarat without any income. He said, “Most of us work here at tea stalls or food joints. Since everything is shut, our employers have asked us to come back only after things get normal, as they don’t have money to pay us. Since buses and other modes of transport are not available, we have decided to walk to reach our homes.”

Watch | Your COVID-19 queries answered | Watch | What is contact tracing?

Question of survival

Mr. Patel was part of a 50-member group that started its journey on foot on Tuesday night from the city’s Naranpura area to reach the Ratanpur border, around 150 km from Ahmedabad.

“I know there is the threat of the virus, but we are helpless. How would we survive without any income for three weeks? We don’t have money to pay to our landlord. It’s better we move back to our native places,” said Mangi Lal, who belongs to Rajasthan’s Udaipur district. He was part of a group of 100 people who left from Gujarat’s Mehsana district to return to their homes.

Mayanksinh Chavda, Inspector General, Gandhinagar Range, said the police personnel are providing food packets and water to the migrant workers on humanitarian grounds.

He said, “We are trying our best to discourage these migrant workers from moving to Rajasthan. This will defeat the purpose of the lockdown. Since they are desperate to reach their homes, we are providing them food and water during their journey. We are also taking action against the factory owners who have not done enough to keep these workers here.”

Gujarat Migrant Workers’ Congress president Ashok Punjabi said over 50,000 workers left on foot from Ahmedabad alone for Rajasthan . He said, “I spoke to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday on this issue. I urged him to arrange bus service for migrants once they reach the Ratanpur border,” he said.

Many migrant labourers started their journey on foot from as far as Surat as they have been asked by their employers and landlords to leave, said Mr. Punjabi.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/j46m0t/article31166664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMHEALTH-CORONAVIRUSGUJARAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-migrant-workers-return-home-on-foot/article31166665.ece

“Imran, I am here only”, “I am Nuzhat, I am present here 24X7”, “Saad Abdullah, No NRC, No CAA no NPR” — these are among the placards left at the Park Circus Maidan in Kolkata, which has been central to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in West Bengal since January 7, 2020.

Besides placards, there are dozens of pairs of shoes, scarves and dupattas kept at the ground, with the names of the people who have left them behind. On Wednesday afternoon, there were only five to six people left at the ground, including two elderly women on the stage with face masks, sitting a few meters apart.

“About five to seven people are at the ground every hour, including during the night. The police has allowed only this kind of crowd here,” Abid Rana Karim, one of the protesters, told The Hindu. The youth, who was taking a selfie, explained that the protest at the ground was now “symbolic”.

‘Conscious decision’

A chair next to the stage has the name of Asmat Jamil, a driving force behind the anti-CAA movement since it began here. Ms. Jamil said that it was a conscious decision on the part of organisers to keep placards, shoes and clothes.

“What happened at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi will not happen in Kolkata. We are in full support of the lockdown but we will not allow the lockdown to bulldoze our protests. Once we are able to come out of the pandemic, we hope that we will resume the protests against the CAA,” said Nousheen Baba Khan, who has been associated with the protest from the start.

Ms. Khan said that it took several days and considerable persuasion on part of the organisers to convince people to leave the protest site. “It was the people themselves who decided to leave some of their belongings till they could come back and resume the protest,” she added.

Major venue

Over the past three months, the Park Circus ground has been a major venue for anti-CAA protests to which people from different parts of the city and suburbs came. Joining them were politicians and social activists from different parts of the country. “We are continuing what has been going on for the past 70 days with the same spirit. Only our physical presence at the protest site has been limited to prevent the spread of the virus,” Mohammed Imran, a resident of Kolkata, said.

As the temperature soared in the afternoon, one of elderly women sitting on the stage decided to take a break. Before she stepped away, she, with the help of others present, she left a placard with her name in her stead, till she could return to resume the protest later.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/agckts/article31166707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25IN-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kolkatas-anti-caa-protesters-leave-placards-shoes/article31165884.ece
195,2020/03/25,"Coronavirus lockdown | Farmers in Punjab, Haryana worried over wheat harvesting","Steps for procurement will be in place before the marketing season starts, say both governments

With harvesting of wheat crop about to commence in the next few days in the key grain growing States of Punjab and Haryana, farmers are a worried lot fearing loss due to delay in harvesting and procurement of amid the ongoing lockdown, due to coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | State Helpline numbers for COVID-19 | e-Book on COVID-19 | Coronavirus Live updates

The State governments, however, have said the farmers need not worry as arrangements for smooth operations of harvesting and procurement will be in place before the marketing season starts.

“My crop will be ready for harvesting in next 9-10 days, if the weather is clear. But I am nervous about how I will harvest it. If the lockdown continues, I don't know how anyone can employ combine harvesters or even manual labour in the field? Also, so far there has been no notification from the government about the procurement dates,” said Sarvan Singh of Pandher Kalan village in Amritsar, who has sown wheat in five acres.

Mr. Sarvan said farmers are willing to follow all precautions and regulations to curb the novel coronavirus but the government should also immediately address the fears.

“I can’t afford to lose my crop. Even if there’s a lockdown, I’ll go to harvest my crop and I am ready to face consequences,” he said.

Wheat — the main rabi (winter) crop which is sown between late October till December — is now nearing the ripening stage and harvesting of early sown varieties usually commences by the end of March. However, due to recent rains and inclement weather, the harvesting is likely to be delayed by 7-10 days. The wheat procurement season officially begins on April 1 in Punjab and Haryana.

Gurmeet Singh of Bhattiwal Khurd village in Sangrur told The Hindu that harvesting is mostly done by combine harvester, and if the curfew is continued then it will bring hardship for every farmer.

“The government needs to immediately come out with a plan otherwise it would be a chaotic situation when the harvesting starts,” said Mr. Gurmeet, who has sown wheat in nearly 17 acres.

In Haryana’s Shahbad, Rakesh Bains, who has sown wheat in his seven acres, said if the government procurement is delayed it will add to the farmers’ woes. “First, there’s no clarity on any mechanism or guidelines being adopted by the government for harvesting the crop. Secondly, if mandis [yards] are not open, where will farmers store the produce. It’s not easy for farmers like me to store the grain.”

“The government should issue guidelines and remove ambiguity over opening of mandis,” he said.

P. S. Rangi, an agriculture expert and former Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser, said he was hopeful that the two governments would soon come out with some mechanism to deal with the situation. “If harvesting is delayed, storage of grain will be the greatest challenge for farmers. Relaxation will be required for harvesting. Also there could a problem of shortage of labour as many have returned to their native places,” he said.

Punjab Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said farmers need not worry as the State government will allow harvesting and procurement will be done in an efficient manner. “We are on it and we will procure each and every grain from the market. Notification about the procurement season start date will also be issued soon,” said Mr. Pannu.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xozv00/article31165559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25IN-WEAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-lockdown-farmers-in-punjab-haryana-worried-over-wheat-harvesting/article31165560.ece
196,2020/03/25,CBI questions two prime accused in DHFL scam,"The agency questioned Pravin Kumar Gupta, former secretary of the Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees’ Trust; and Sudhanshu Dwivedi, former director (finance) of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited recently.

The CBI has questioned two prime accused in the ₹2,267 crore Employees’ Provident Fund scam in Uttar Pradesh wherein savings of power sector employees was invested in the Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, which is facing multiple probes of swindling funds worth ₹30,000 crore, officials said.

The agency questioned Pravin Kumar Gupta, former secretary of the Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees’ Trust; and Sudhanshu Dwivedi, former director (finance) of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) recently.

The duo is lodged in a Lucknow prison after their arrest by the Uttar Pradesh police in November last year, they said.

Gupta and Dwivedi were named as two accused in the CBI FIR, they said.

The CBI team from the anti-corruption branch, Lucknow, which is conducting the probe had sought permission from the special court to question the duo, they said.

The recent questioning spanned through several hours, the officials said, without elaborating on the line of questioning.

Besides, the agency has already questioned at least nine more suspects who are lodged in the prison in connection with the scam, they said.

The CBI took over the investigation into the scam on March 5 this year after taking over the FIR registered by Hazratganj Police station in Lucknow, they said.

The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) is facing multiple probes after a report suggested that the company, through layers of shell companies, allegedly siphoned off ₹31,000 crore out of the total bank loan of ₹97,000 crore.

It is also alleged that the officials of UPPCL conspired to get the provident funds deposited in schemes of DHFL circumventing the rules which did not encourage such investments. Gupta and Dwivedi were principal decision makers who cleared investments in the deposit schemes of DHFL despite knowing it was not a scheduled commercial bank and an ‘unsafe’ company.

A total of ₹4,122.70 crore was invested in the DHFL, out of which ₹2,267.90 crore is still outstanding, officials said.

Ninety-seven persons were quarantined in the last 24 hours and the total number of people in hospital isolation stood at 313.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has sought ₹1500 crore package from the Centre to deal with the outbreak. Speaking to journalists at the State secretariat during the day, she said she had not received any help from the Centre and the State was finding it difficult to manage with its “limited resources.” What was required was a “special financial package, a special health package and a special food package.”

The State, she said, had already announced a package of ₹200 crore, which was not sufficient. She said the State government had set up a State Emergency Relief Fund and urged corporates and individuals to contribute.

‘Distancing is not isolation’

The Chief Minister said markets would remain open and police personnel would be asked not to stop those bringing essential items like vegetables to the markets. “Physical distancing does not mean isolation of people. We have to ensure that we don’t isolate people.” The Chief Minister said action would be taken against policemen who stop those delivering essentials like food and vegetables.

She said no doctor or heath care professional would be targeted by landlords or other members of the community. In case of anyone facing a shortage of food they should contact the local Block Development Officer (BDO) or Inspector in Charge of the local police station. “There is no food scarcity. We are asking ration shops to open and rations under public distribution system will be released for a month,” she said.

A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator in Assam has started a free delivery service for the senior citizens of his constituency whose children are far away and were unable to return home before the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ashok Singhal, who represents the Dhekiajuli Assembly constituency in northern Assam, used social media platforms to reach out to people of his constituency stranded outside for supplying groceries and medicines to their parents back home.

“So far, 14 people staying elsewhere in India or abroad have messaged me through Twitter and other social media sites. I have assigned specific people in the localities concerned for delivering provisions after ensuring they themselves adhere to precautionary measures,” Mr. Singhal told The Hindu on Wednesday.

Fittest volunteers

He said the service was being provided at the micro-level and the fittest volunteers — party workers as well as the apolitical — have been assigned the responsibility.

“Our volunteers have also been asked to identify lonely senior citizens and the differently-abled for help. We expect the number of such people to increase once their rations start depleting,” said Mr. Singhal, also the Chairman of the Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority.

For now, medicines are being provided to whoever is able to pay. The MLA said he would also cater to the medical needs of people who are likely to run out of money during the lockdown period.

BTC chief's gesture

Hagrama Mohilary, Chief Executive Member of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) has also announced the formation of teams to provide free rations to people below the poverty line across the four districts under the council.

These districts are Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri.

“We intend to start providing rice, pulses, cooking oil, salt and other essentials from the remotest of corners that are most likely to be hit by any scarcity the lockdown might cause,” he said from BTC headquarters Kokrajhar.

There are 5.5 lakh BPL families across the BTC districts. Each will receive 25 kg of rice, 2 kg of pulses and 500 ml of mustard oil.

Mr. Mohilary also advised people to follow the 21-day lockdown for “your own good”.

Amid social distancing protocols and a nationwide lockdown, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath early on Wednesday participated in an event to shift the idol of an infant Lord Ram to a temporary structure in the Ram Janmabhoomi compound in Ayodhya till the construction of a Ram Temple.

Mr. Adityanath’s action stares in the face of his own appeal to the public to not participate in religious events as part of a social distancing protocol against the COVID-19 outbreak. The State had recorded 37 positive cases till Tuesday.

He also presented a cheque of ₹11 lakh to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra for the construction of the temple.

As per a video clip shared by a government spokesperson, Mr. Adityanath can be seen chanting mantras in front of the idol along with a group of priests.

While sharing pictures of the ritual on Twitter, Mr. Adityanath said “the first phase of the construction of a grand Ram Mandir concluded today, maryada purshottam (the most dignified man) lord Ram has moved from a tarpaulin tent to a new seat.”

The idol of ‘Ram Lalla’ was shifted to a temporary structure near the Manas Bhawan.

Many prominent seers from Ayodhya as well as the district magistrate, district police chief and Additional Home Secretary Awanish Awasthi attended the event, in which Mr. Adityanath walked out of the makeshift Ram temple carrying the idols to the temporary location.

201,2020/03/25,COVID-19 | Blood banks in West Bengal run dry due to lockdown,"During summers, blood collection dips by nearly 40% but the situation has worsened due to the coronavirus outbreak.

With various political parties, community clubs and NGOs having to stop organising blood donation camps due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, blood banks in West Bengal are facing an acute shortage of supply, officials said on Wednesday.

More than 80% of blood supply to 108 blood banks in the state, including 74 state run-facilities, are sourced from such camps, an official of Central Blood Bank said.

“The blood banks are facing a severe shortage of supply. Just imagine the condition of thalassemia patients and others who need a regular transfusion of blood. It is a very difficult situation,” Bratish Niyogi, managing director of People’s Blood Bank told PTI.

During summers, blood collection dips by nearly 40% but the situation has worsened due to the coronavirus outbreak, Mr. Niyogi said.

“If someone needs blood of a specific type, he or she has to find a donor himself or herself as community clubs and the youth wings of political parties have stopped organising blood donation camps due to the lockdown,” he said.

The shortage of blood supply has also affected surgeries.

“Major surgeries that can be postponed have been advised to do so to keep the requirement of blood in check for the time being. The state needs an average of 1 lakh units of blood every month,” A. Ganguly, director of Lifeline Blood Bank said.

D. Ashish, secretary of NGO Medical Bank, which has been involved in blood donation campaigns for over 40 years, said the situation is worse in the districts.

When contacted, Health Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said the State government is keeping a close watch on the situation and has come out with new guidelines regarding blood collection following the coronavirus outbreak.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/dthbsn/article31093311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOLKATAANDMASKSjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-blood-banks-in-west-bengal-run-dry-due-to-lockdown/article31160054.ece
202,2020/03/25,"Coronavirus | No newspapers in Manipur, new year celebrations lacklustre","Newspaper distributors and paper boys are on strike after a wholesaler was allegedly beaten up in Bishnupur district on Monday morning

The people in Manipur woke up on Wednesday morning to find that there were no newspapers, particularly when people need information following the report that a 23-year-old girl was the first person to have contracted COVID-19 in the Northeast region.

This despite the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, in a March 23 official letter, instructing all Chief Secretaries to ensure the operational continuity of electronic and print media in the face of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Manipuris celebrated the new year on Wednesday in a lacklustre manner. There were no green grocer, fish or meat seller and others with the result that no family could prepare five or six course lunch for the traditional lunches. They were also denied the traditional mountain climbing in the afternoon, with the health officials citing the possibility of infection from crowd.

Newspaper distributors and paper boys are on strike after a wholesaler was allegedly beaten up in Bishnupur district on Monday morning by a ranking police officer. It is alleged that the officer had seen the identity card of the distributor and ‘Press’ sticker in the van and yet he beat him up. Editors and publishers have reportedly started consulting one another and indications are that the publication of the newspapers may be suspended till an agreement is reached between the government and newspaper distributors.

The All India Radio, Imphal, has also suspended news in the FM frequency. The news broadcast in some local channels is also affected.

Officials said that absence of news could be one of the reasons why passengers of the March 21 Kolkata-Imphal Air Asia flight in which the Manipuri girl had travelled have not responded to the announcement by the health department to contact medical officials for testing.

Normal life continues to be disrupted in Manipur as a result of the total lockdown, with even pharmacies remaining closed and other essential service facilities being affected. On Wednesday a few pharmacies were open and there were long serpentine queues.

Biren said that curfew would continue for some time and urged the people to abide by the health advisories.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-no-newspapers-in-manipur-new-year-celebrations-lacklustre/article31160006.ece

205,2020/03/25,Coronavirus: Odisha CM urges people to stay at home,"100 of 3,861 foreign returnees showing symptoms of COVID-19

The Odisha government on Tuesday painted a gloomy scenario in the next two months with the State projected to have a minimum 2,345 novel coronavirus positive cases and a maximum 36,000 by May 31.

“We are here to scare you on COVID-19. The country reported the first positive case on January 30. The number suddenly jumped to six on March 3 and next day it shot up to 28. On March 10, the number doubled. The rate of doubling of the virus positive cases is likely to go up,” said Subroto Bagchi, Odisha's chief spokesperson on COVID-19.

Going by the experience in other countries, the situation in India will unexpectedly lead to an explosive situation, said Mr. Bagchi.

“It is estimated that if the virus spreads, India would have 58,643 positive cases, which is a conservative estimate, by March 31. But, if not checked, it could touch 10-lakh-figure. Going by Odisha’s population, the State is likely to have a minimum 2,345 and a maximum 36,000 cases during that time,” he said.

In Odisha, 110 samples were sent for COVID-19 test and only two were found to be positive. More than 100 of the 3,861 persons who had come from abroad were showing symptoms of COVID-19.

“There is no doubt that we are heading towards unspeakable economic crisis. But this is time to save our life. We must follow the lockdown restrictions which are in force in the entire State,” he said.

Ahead of Mr. Bagchi’s explosive prediction, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik appealed to people to take oath in the name of their parents for staying at home.

“Safety of your family members is in your hands. Entry of the virus into your home depends on your behaviour. If you are cautious, the virus cannot enter your home,” said Mr. Patnaik in his address to the State following the lockdown for all the 30 districts.

“Take daily oath in the name of your parents and children that you won’t venture out of home. The novel coronavirus might come with you to your home and harm family members. Take oath to undertake 20-second hand-washing before entering home,” said the Chief Minister.

211,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Former cricketer Sukhvinder Singh recounts his rescue mission to Italy,"‘Once-in-a-life-time chance to serve the country’

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi applauded the efforts of Capt. Swati Rawal and Capt. Raja Chauhan of Air India Boeing 777 that airlifted 263 Indians, mostly students stranded in Rome, it was an appreciation to cherish for the crew of that historic flight on March 22. Among those engaged in the operation was senior purser Sukhvinder Singh, former Delhi and Assam left-arm spinner.

Important assignment

The 20-member cabin crew reported at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on March 21 to perform, perhaps, the most important assignment of their careers. Flying to Rome with 120 Italian nationals and returning with Indian students, was the “call of the nation” for every crew member.

Having been employed with Air India (formerly Indian Airlines), for close to 30 years, Sukhvinder is among the few sportspersons who did not rest on the on-field laurels.

“When I was not playing, I was flying,” Sukhvinder told The Hindu. His First Class career, spanning from 1986 to 2004, saw him play 47 matches (148 wickets and 2076 runs with four centuries).

“Cricket was the driving force for me to take up challenges in life. This was a mission for us. We were going to bring back the youth, the future of India. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to serve the country,” said the 53-year-old.

Rising to the occasion

“Air India has been doing a fantastic job in these times of crisis. It flew our countrymen from Wuhan and Milan. We take pride in being a part of that family. Each crew member knew it was the need of the hour. We understood the gravity of the situation and grabbed the chance when it came our way,” said Sukhvinder, recalling the experience.

“Hahaha, somebody sent me this and told me it’s exactly been 1 year since this run out happened,” wrote Ashwin.

213,2020/03/25,Kohli & boys handed customised indoor workouts,"‘The routines have been created keeping in mind the demands of the players’

With the government calling for a lockdown to fight the coronavirus outbreak, the Indian cricketers are all home and spending time with their families. But strength and conditioning coach Nick Webb, in consultation with physio Nitin Patel, has customised routines for Virat Kohli and boys to ensure they stay in top shape despite the pandemic induced break.

To stay in shape

Sources in the team management said that the duo of Webb and Nitin have made player-specific routines for all the contracted players to ensure that they can continue to stay in shape even as the country fights the pandemic.

“All the players, irrespective of whether they play red-ball cricket or white-ball cricket or all formats have been given fitness routines which they are to follow and give updates to Webb and Nitin from time to time. The routines have been created keeping in mind the demands of the players.

“So, for example, a bowler has been given exercises which work to make his core and lower body strong. Similarly, a batsman has been given exercises which also work on his shoulders and wrists,” the source explained, which added that the routines have been made keeping in mind the workout patterns of the players.

“So, for example, someone like a Kohli loves to train with weights as well. So, his routine would have weights involved like the clean and jerk and deadlifts and other exercises. While another player might be more comfortable doing free-hand exercises, so in that case, he has been given more free weight functional training options,” it was stated.

In the balance

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a 21-day lockdown. This has put the fate of the Indian Premier League also hanging in the balance.

While the BCCI is confident that they can pull off the league even if it starts from the first week of May, an important area of concern will be the entry of the foreign players as visa restrictions need to be removed first. The Sports Ministry has made it clear that the fate of the 13th edition of the IPL can be decided only after the government comes out with a fresh advisory after April 15, keeping in mind the situation with regards to the coronavirus outbreak.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hr20eu/article31167060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kohli-boys-handed-customised-indoor-workouts/article31167062.ece

With the lockdown announced by the Central government coming into full effect on Wednesday to stop the spread of COVID-19, meagre movement of the public was observed in Coimbatore city.

One of the busiest stretches of roads in the city, the Tiruchi Road wore a largely deserted look, with mostly two-wheelers and a few four-wheelers plying. Except for pharmacies and groceries, all other outlets including restaurants, saloons, bakeries and places of worship remained shut in Ramanathapuram.

Shanmugam (name changed), a grocery shop owner in Ramanathapuram, said that the lack of transport services has led to a reduction to the amount to goods procured in the shop. “People are not also buying enough as they are not coming out,” he said.

Mr. Shanmugam alleged that the police forced him to take multiple diversions before reaching wholesale markets in Ukkadam and Town Hall. “We are cooperating with the law. The police must allow us to go to markets freely,” Mr. Shanmugam said.

Two police constables from Ramanathapuram were deployed on 80 Feet Road to monitor the implementation of prohibitory orders. “People are taking their two-wheelers to mostly visit their friends or relatives within this area,” one of the constables said. Only cases of emergencies were allowed during vehicle checks, as evident by a car stopped by the constables, where the car driver showed a box of medicines before being allowed.

Small groups of people were found chatting outside closed shops despite the governments asking citizens to strictly stay indoors. “I have been a driver for 40 years. How can I stay idle at home?” asked R. Baskar, a resident of Ramanathapuram. He was chatting with three of his friends on Wednesday afternoon. “For how long could we keep watching the TV?” asked one of the members in the group.

Murugan (name changed), a resident of Sundarapuram, said he observed groups of people coming to buy vegetables and groceries in his area as well as Aathupalam on Wednesday morning.

Karthiayani, a housewife from Ammankulam Road was worried about the increase in the price of vegetables since the lockdown was announced on Tuesday. “Though we have adequate stock of rice and legumes, vegetables cannot be stocked much. I am afraid that the prices of vegetables may skyrocket in the coming days,” she said.

A policeman on duty in the city on Wednesday said that presence of vehicles and people were minimal and the police did not have to intervene much as people themselves were cooperative to the prohibitory order.

An official from Coimbatore Division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) said that all bus services have been stopped in the four districts under the Division (Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode and the Nilgiris), with 1,090 TNSTC buses (town and mofussil buses) not plying in Coimbatore district alone.

229,2020/03/25,Lockdown near total in Erode district on Day 1,"It is business as usual for conservancy workers; 1,700 policemen posted for patrolling

All the arterial roads in the city wore a deserted look on Wednesday as vehicles kept off the roads while establishments downed shutters on the first day after Section 144 was clamped.

Except hospitals, pharmacies, uzhavar sandhai, Aavin outlets and fish market, all shops, including tea shops and bakeries, hotels, commercial establishments, Tasmac shops, departmental stores and provisional stores downed their shutters.

Minimum strength

The Central and State government organisations that provide essential services functioned with minimum staff strength.

Conservancy workers carried out their routine activities. In the absence of public transportation, the roads were deserted. A few, who were seen plying vehicles, were stopped by police personnel and questioned on the necessity of their travel.

While Nethaji Vegetable Daily Market functioned from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., farmers were allowed into the uzhavar sandhai at Sampath Nagar only after verifying their identity card.

“Normally 120 farmers bring their produce, but today only 55 were here,” said an official at the market.

Rural areas

In rural areas, provisional stores remained open.

A hotelier in Solar said that though they were allowed to sell food items in parcels, they closed down their operations as no customers would turn up due to the shutdown.

Petrol bunks saw very less number of motorists coming for refuelling throughout the day.

230,2020/03/25,Coimbatore goes into complete lockdown,"Workers head home; shops and factories close across district; vehicles keep off the roads

On Tuesday morning, Mani, a construction worker and Kaliappan, who was employed in a petrol bunk, were waiting outside the Gandhipuram bus stand to take a bus to their home towns near Dharmapuri.

As industries and shops closed down from Tuesday for the lockdown, workers from different parts of the State who were working in Coimbatore were trying to take buses and private vehicles to go back to their villages.

By evening, the city and mofussil bus stands were almost empty, even by 5.30 p.m. shops in Gandhipuram, one of the main commercial centres, were closed, and the streetside flower, fruit and vegetable vendors had returned home. The police were on patrol, asking all the shops to down shutters, helping the public take the last buses to reach home, and assuring the public that essential services will be available.

Vendors who sell tea and samosas on their two wheelers were hurrying back, and only a few vehicles were on the road.

Meena and 18 more people from Harur in Dharmapuru used to work in Kerala, breaking stones.

Though there was no transportation facility between Kerala and Coimbatore, all of them managed to reach the city on Tuesday evening, minutes before the lock down. They were looking for a private transport facility to reach their village.

“We usually work for two months a year in Kerala and and rest of the months at our agricultural lands in the village. We would have stayed back in Kerala for one more month. But, had to leave because of the Corona fever (COVID-19),” she said.

A retired postal department employee, who is currently working as a security at Kovaipudur, had reached the Gandhipuram bus stand from Koundampalayam. But he had no bus to reach his workplace.

Two vendors selling bananas on a push cart said they had no option but to dump the remaining fruits, losing nearly ₹2,000.

“What will do for food. We are from Karaikudi. We cant go back home as we have nothing to do there. So we decided to stay back in Coimbatore. If everything is closed, what will we do for food?” one of them asked.

All the main roads of the city saw vehicle movement dwindling and retail establishments closed well before 6 pm. The normally busy Avinashi Road was as good as deserted by 6 p.m.

As the police stepped up patrolling, urging people to stay indoors, and vehicles kept off the road, the city went into complete lock down.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/erx1k5/article31158789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Avinashilockdown,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-goes-into-complete-lockdown/article31157332.ece

Local residents said that they wanted to stock up on supplies in case shops remained shut across the district, despite the fact that the district administration has assured residents that all shops and businesses offering essential services will remain open.

The crowd led to Commercial Road in Udhagamandalam becoming gridlocked with traffic, even as people crowded the Ooty municipal market and the farmers’ market in Udhagamandalam to purchase vegetables.

Due to tourist locations being shutdown, the Tibetan market in Udhagamandalam was completely closed. A few Tibetan residents, who run shops in the Tibetan market, said that they hoped that the district would be opened to tourists after March 31, as they would not be covered by any government welfare schemes for being given provisions. “As we are refugees, we will not be given any benefits, so we have to rely on making money from our businesses to make ends meet. So this shutdown has been especially hard for us, and we hope that it will not continue for much longer,” said a local Tibetan resident.

The district administration also organised for vegetables and essential supplies to be dropped off to differently-abled families in Kagguchi and Keradamattam in Kotagiri.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uoo20s/article31157313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB25SANTHAIOOTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/people-throng-shops-markets-in-the-nilgiris-to-stock-up-supplies/article31157314.ece

233,2020/03/25,Precautionary measures scaled up in Tiruppur,"With Tiruppur seeing its first COVID-19 positive case on Monday, the district administration has scaled up precautionary measures in the district.

Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan said that five teams have been formed in the district to monitor home quarantine cases, hospital isolation cases, disinfection measures and procurement of face masks and additional hospital beds.

The 48-year-old patient from London arrived at the Chennai International Airport on March 15 and reached Tiruppur in his personal vehicle. After five days of home quarantine in Tiruppur, he got himself admitted to ESI Hospital, Coimbatore, on March 20. His swab samples were sent to King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, Chennai, Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan said. Health Minister C.

The patient's wife is in quarantine at ESI Hospital, while his daughter is under home quarantine in Tiruppur. The driver has been quarantined at Tiruppur Government Hospital, Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan said.

“He was all by himself and only close family members were near him during home quarantine,” the Collector said, adding that efforts were under way to ascertain whether he came into contact with any other persons. As of Tuesday, 172 patients were under home quarantine in Tiruppur district, he said.

234,2020/03/25,Corpn. sticks bills on houses of persons under quarantine,"The Coimbatore Corporation field staff on Tuesday began sticking bills in front of the houses of persons who have been kept under quarantine.

According to sources, teams led by the five zonal sanitary officers were sticking bills in front of 247 houses.

The bills in Tamil read COVID-19: do not enter; quarantined house on the first row and the date of quarantine on the second row.

The third row showed the name the person in isolation, his or her address and the number of persons in the house.

The last line showed contact numbers for further assistance including that of the district control room.

The sources said that the teams began the work around afternoon after the Corporation got the stickers from the Department of Public Health.

An officer said occupants of quarantined houses did not resist the Corporation sticking bills. They were aware of the need for quarantine and visitors being told.

Wash basins

The Corporation on Tuesday also started placing wash basins at various locations in the city.

Under the supervision of ward engineers, the Corporation, with support from non-government and volunteer organisations, had placed wash basins and hand sanitisers at bus stops, bus stands, railway station and government offices.

It also used the opportunity to demonstrate hand washing techniques to members of the public.

Tuesday also saw the Corporation domestic breeding checkers, diverted from dengue fighting task to battle the spread of COVID-19, using 40 sprayers to spray disinfectants on buses, bus stops and main thoroughfares.

The sources also said the Corporation sprayed on cars and two-wheelers parked in front of markets and on roads to intensify its drive against the spread of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the district administration’s move to close down farmers’ market (Uzhavar Sandhai) while allowing vegetable markets and retail shops came in for criticism.

Coimbatore Consumer Cause secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said at a time when people were panic-buying essential goods and price of such goods was skyrocketing, it was necessary that the administration opened the farmers’ market for consumers.

When big markets in Chennai and other parts of the State were open, why was it that farmers’ market were closed, he asked.

Crowd management

An Agriculture Marketing Department official said it was to control the crowd that the Department had taken such a step.

Besides, it did not have the required staff strength to regulate the crowd and had to depend on the police for the work.

Therefore, it thought it was better to shut down all the eight farmers’ markets in the district.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corpn-sticks-bills-on-houses-of-persons-under-quarantine/article31157253.ece
235,2020/03/25,"Focus is on ensuring supply chain is effective, says Gurugram Deputy Commissioner","We will be starting 10 decentralised mobile grocery stores, online pass system for residents, quarantine facilities at hotels: Gurugram official

Gurugram Deputy Commissioner Amit Khatri talks to Ashok Kumar about the challenges, priorities and preparations of the administration for COVID-19.

There have been issues with regards to the supply of essential items such as groceries, milk and medicines in the district. Many stores have run dry. Supply from manufactures/producers and wholesalers to the retailers has been hit. Delivery boys are being stopped and manhandled by the police. How are you going to resolve it?

We have adequate stocks of essential items and are comfortably placed on that front. The entire supply chain from the manufactures and warehouse to the retailers and customers has been studied. We sat with the police and the associations and key companies. The issues faced over the past couple of days have now been resolved. Passes will be supplied to the delivery boys by today (Wednesday) evening. We have told the e-commerce companies and other suppliers to keep the range of products to limited essential items and reduce the manpower to the bare minimum, even if it means increased delivery time. So with some compromises, we will keep the supply going. By tomorrow (Thursday), there should not be any issue with the supply.

How will you ensure social distancing at stores and shops?

Our efforts are to re-establish the online supply system which is app-based. Also, we will start ten de-centralised mobile grocery stores from today (Wednesday). These will be vehicles in tie-up with the big retailers. These will go to specified places at specified time to supply items of basic necessities. Based on response, the number will be increased further.

Gurugram has seen the maximum number of COVID-19 cases in Haryana. In fact, more than half of the cases are from Gurugram. How well prepared the district administration is to deal with the situation in the coming days?

We are the financial capital of the State and a large number of people here are frequent travellers to foreign countries and their relatives. So we have seen more cases than the rest of the State. But we are comfortably placed in terms of doctors, paramedical staff and ventilators. Based on our projections, we will be able to handle it. Also, 400 rooms are now available in various hotels for quarantine facilities for those willing to pay, besides free facility arranged by the government.

What is the mechanism in place if residents need to come out of their homes in case of medical or any other emergency?

We will put in place an online pass system for the residents by today (Wednesday) evening to allow movement in case of an emergency. They can take out a print and will be allowed to venture out. But it will be applicable only inside the boundaries of the district.

How is the compliance to the lockdown regulations? Is there a need for stricter measures?

I am, in fact, very thankful to the residents that they have adhered to the lockdown regulations satisfactorily. I believe that if the basic needs of the residents are taken care of, the compliance will be good. Our focus is on ensuring that the essential items supply chain is effective.

What about the large population of daily-wagers and slum-dwellers? What is administration doing to fulfil their basic needs.

This matter may come up as the period of lock down stretches on. Though the State government has announced a few measures, we are working in close co-ordination with the volunteers, philanthropic and social organisations to build a platform for this and arrange donations. The headquarters has also decided to release some funds for this, but the numbers are not final yet.

What about the availability of masks and sanitisers and their black-marketing?

We have the district chemist association on board. They are abiding by the prices fixed by the government. In case of any complaint, it is being dealt with strictly. We have sufficient stocks. But soaps can be used in place of sanitisers, and not everyone needs a mask. We have tied up with the local industry involved in the production of something else to produce masks and personal protective equipment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sg2nm/article31168102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26INTERVIEWd,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/focus-is-on-ensuring-supply-chain-is-effective/article31168103.ece
236,2020/03/25,Idgah camp emptied over COVID-19 fear,"‘Maintaining distance between people was tough’

The Idgah relief camp in north-east Delhi’s Mustafabad, which was set up by the Delhi Waqf Board for people displaced by riots that erupted in the city last month, was cleared out completely on Wednesday.

Mohammed Imran, media coordinator at the camp and nodal officer of the board, said the step had been taken in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. “The camp, where around 20-25 people were residing, was cleared out on Wednesday. Most had left by Tuesday night. We have helped the people find rented accommodation in the area,” he said.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Haji Yunus said that it was becoming difficult to maintain distance between people in the camp. “At least 50 people were staying in one tent and that was harmful for them. There was not enough space for them to stay 1 metres apart from each other,” he added.

Mr. Yunus said that many of the 260 families that were shifted over the past few days “were given money and assisted in finding rented accommodation”.

“Only some went to their relatives’ house. Some, whose houses were in a relatively better condition, were helped in making there places liveable. All of them were given one-month ration,” he added.

Imran Khan, a former resident of Shiv Vihar who left the camp on Wednesday and shifted to a rented accommodation, said that he had to leave “because there was no other option”.

After incidents of policemen allegedly beating up delivery boys or stopping vehicles engaged in movement of goods from markets to warehouse of e-commerce portals, the Delhi Police on Wednesday held a meeting with representatives of e-commerce companies to ensure smooth movement of essential goods, said a police officer.

In the meeting, e-commerce portals’ representatives shared the problems faced by them in movement of essential goods. “We have set up a platform for e-commerce websites where they can share with us difficulties faced by them, so we can solve them,” said Delhi Police PRO Mandeep Singh Randhawa.

Curfew passes have been issued to them and the police have assured the delivery agents of e-commerce portals of ensuring smooth movement of essential goods, he added.

Navaratri began on a sour note for the community of artisans who live along the road in Sahibabad, Ghaziabad. The Durga idols were the only bright spots on the deserted road on Wednesday. “We have not sold a single idol in the last two days,” Kavita said, adding: “Perhaps, people have lost faith in Her when they need Her the most.”

“We were expecting a low sales this year due to COVID-19 but this is unbelievable. We spend a month making the idols... now it seems all that effort and money will go to waste,” said Hansraj, one of the artisans. “We are ironsmiths who once made weapons for Maharana Pratap. Once he lost the Battle of Haldighati, we left Rajasthan,” Sachin Rajput said, adding: “We used to make 50-60 idols for Navratri, this year we made only 25 but we have not sold even one.”

‘No water supply’

“Nobody from the administration has come to take cognisance of our well being. The expect us to be hygienic but there is no water supply here,” said Manoj, standing outside one of the 25-odd slum-like structures.

In the neighbouring Shyam Park, a crowd surrounded a grocery shop despite the best efforts of the staff to maintain order. Many complained that flour was in short supply. The shopkeeper said the supplier was charging ₹30 extra per kg, something he would not agree to. “Somebody will complain about me to the police for overcharging,” he said. But one could see a side door opening and closing at regular intervals to cater to some patrons who were ready to pay extra. “What to do?” was the common refrain.

Circle Officer (Sahibabad) Rakesh Mishra told The Hindu, “In such an unprecedented situation, the police is expected to work with a combination of sensitivity and strictness. If we find a shop overcrowded, we will shut it down. But we will also ensure that essential supplies and vegetables are not stopped. People should also play their part by not indulging in panic buying.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lccx7c/article31171260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/durga-idoljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/we-have-not-sold-a-durga-idol-in-2-days/article31168083.ece

The workload of many have reduced since the outbreak of COVID-19 and people are working in the safety of homes. But for 21-year-old Pramod Kumar, who works as a caretaker at a government-run night shelter for the homeless, work and risk have only increased.

“My mother is worried and was asking me to come back home since the virus outbreak. But how can I go back? I just came back from home after Holi and I won’t get more leaves,” Kumar, who is from Bihar, said.

Kumar, who has been living in Delhi for the last four years with his brother and family, said that his workload has increased since the outbreak of virus. “I have to work overtime now as many staff who are coming from far off places are not able to reach for work,” said the 21-year-old, who earns ₹18,000 a month.

“I am not afraid, this is social service. Coronavirus is on my mind, but we have to serve people,” Kumar said.

Gouri is now trying to find resource persons to carry out online sessions Gouri Rajagopal, who works for Transforming Rural India (TRI), has been doing her job from home in Malviya Nagar for the last two weeks. Being an NGO worker, her job involves engaging in multiple roles, including carrying out training programmes, recruitment drives and communications.

On April 1, the organisation was getting ready to induct a new set of people with a week-long induction programme. “The programme is very intensive. It involves meeting government officials at various levels, and makes the freshers understand what a typical work day would be like. The personal interactions help invigorate those participating in the programme. In the wake of the pandemic, all of this has to be carried out online,” lamented Ms. Gouri.

Currently, she is involved in figuring out what the new structure of the programme would look like, and finding resource persons to carry out online sessions.

“Usually, if I were at office, I could just go talk to my boss or speak to my colleagues. I can’t do that now...brainstorming is impossible while you are alone,” she said. Working from home has been difficult and disorienting, she said. “I don’t want to mix work and home... now there is no such thing as office timings and as a result work has started to spread across the day and is “seemingly endless,” she said.

249,2020/03/25,India coronavirus lockdown | Grocers scramble to restock after night of panic buying,"Employees say there is enough supply and people need not worry about shortage

After witnessing a night of panic buying following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of a 21-day restriction on non-essential services, grocery stores and supermarkets across the city were busy restocking on Wednesday and tried to enforce social distancing between customers.

Despite appeals to not hoard essentials, large packets of rice and atta, bread and tetrapacks of milk and juice were out of stock at many stores. Some local vegetable and fruit vendors were found selling produce at inflated prices but admitted that there was no shortage at the wholesale market.

Social distancing

In Kalkaji, grocery and supply stores were busy restocking empty shelves in expectation of more panic buying. Employees at one supermarket were seen enforcing social distancing by limiting the number of customers inside the store. People standing in line at several markets were also asked to maintain distance between each other.

Following the Tuesday night announcement, there was confusion at Nizamuddin East after a grocery store shutdown believing that a full lockdown had been ordered. Long queues were seen at other stores with bread, eggs and butter flying off the shelves. The stores got a fresh supply on Wednesday and orderly queues were seen. Fruit vendor Mian Rahman said: “Phal toh mandi mein hai, par police ke dande se bach bach ke laa rahein hain [there is plenty of fruit at the wholesale market, but we have to dodge police lathis to bring the produce to customers].”

Long queues

In CR Park’s Market 1, store owners said that bread, eggs, curd, rice and flour were in high demand and disappeared off shelves within minutes of the PM’s speech. On Wednesday, only one of the three grocery shops was open and witnessed long queues. While the main vegetable market was closed, there were a couple of vans, which went around in the colonies selling produce.

Parul Chatterjee, a housewife said: “We had been stocking up in small quantities over the last one week. We did not realise that a 21-day lockdown would be announced. Even though authorities are saying that essential items will be supplied and that there is no reason to panic, it is difficult not to. We are just worried. Already items like bread and eggs are out of stock. There are senior citizens in our family, so we cannot take the risk of not buying items when they are available.”

Two departmental stores near the Yamuna Expressway Authority office in Greater Noida’s Omega 1 did brisk business while a larger store some distance away was shut.

Supply issue

“We are trying to stock up as much as we can given the duration of the lockdown. There have been no issues regarding supply so far as edibles are concerned,” said a store manager on condition of anonymity. He admitted that some customers were trying to purchase flour and milk in quantities that “seemed implausible for consumption” over three weeks.

“People are trying to buy 30 kg of atta and more than half-a-dozen packets of packed milk. We are requesting such customers not to do this, so that others who may be running out of the same items can buy them,” the manager added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rzr6us/article31167789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25DELPRIYAVEGETABLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/grocers-scramble-to-restock-after-night-of-panic-buying/article31167791.ece

NEW DELHIAs restrictions on non-essential services are imposed across the country to contain the pandemic, for some like Roshan Kumar, “working from home” was not an option.

The sole breadwinner in a family of four, the private security guard was seen posted outside a financial services office in Kalkaji, which is now shut.

Kumar, a resident of Tughlakabad, said that he makes an hour-long journey by foot now as public transport has also been stopped due to the restrictions.

Travel by foot

“Earlier, I would take shared rides or even buses. However, now there is no means for me to travel except by foot. I start from my house around 8 a.m. as my shift starts at 9 p.m. and again in the evening after the shift is over, I start walking around 6 p.m., only to reach home around 7 p.m.,” the 26-year-old said.

With the safety mask on, Kumar’s routine these days are simply to spend hours sitting on the stairs near the office.

Even as patrolling teams go past him and tries to disperse gatherings of any kind, especially outside departmental stores and ATMs, Kumar said, “I asked my supervisor if we [guards] could take leaves during this period. But he said that we have to report every day, even on Sundays. So I come each day. These days there are hardly any people on the roads too due to the virus. But I need work, so I have to be present. I have my mask and get home-cooked food. That is all the precaution I can take.”

While adding that he had returned from his home town in Bihar a month ago, he said: “I got married and returned to Delhi last month. My wife is also in the city and I need to work for the family. I get around ₹400-₹500 a day, so I cannot afford to miss work.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/working-from-home-is-not-an-option-for-this-private-security-guard/article31167733.ece

The Delhi High Court has upheld the life term awarded to a man by a trial court for raping his daughter, saying the offence was even more “horrendous and despicable” as it was committed by the one who is viewed as a “shield” or “protector” of her dignity and honour.

A Bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal said when sanctity of a father-daughter relationship is ravaged “in such a sordid manner,” it “shocks the human conscience” as the protector becomes the violator. The Bench also termed the act as “the gravest sin”.

“The father is considered to be the protector and refuge of his own daughter... No doubt that the offence of rape is grave by its very nature but it is more horrendous and despicable when the perpetrator of the crime is one’s own father. A daughter always looks up to her father as a shield of her dignity and honour...

“It shocks human conscience when the sanctity of father and daughter relationship is ravaged in such a sordid manner and the protector becomes the violator... It is the gravest sin, where the most pure relationship is shattered by an extreme pervert and shameful act,” the Bench said.

The high court dismissed the man’s appeal challenging his conviction and the sentence awarded to him for raping his the then 18-year-old daughter in 2017.

The convict had also sought reduction of the sentence to 10 years on the ground that he was 56 years old, belongs to an extremely poor strata of society and has the responsibility of two unmarried sons who are totally dependent on him.

The high court rejected his plea for reduction in sentence, saying it found no reasons to differ with the findings of the trial court.

It noted in its order that “rape is such a dark reality of the Indian society that devastates a woman’s soul, shatters her self-respect and for a few, purges their hope to live.

“It shakes the insight of a woman who once was a “happy person” and had no clue of being a victim of the said horrifying and terrifying encounter where the daughter had been raped by none else but her own father, the Bench said.

It further noted that offences, particularly sexual assaults, against women are on the rise and it was necessary for courts to “imbibe the legislative wisdom and to respect it because rape or an attempt to rape is a crime not against an individual but a crime, which destroys the basic equilibrium of the social atmosphere, as it not only lowers the dignity of a woman but also mars her reputation”.

“The torment on the victim has the potentiality to corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilised society. It has been rightly said that whereas a murderer destroys the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless female,” the high court said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dajei8/article31161797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-upholds-life-term-to-father-for-raping-daughter-calls-his-act-horrendous-despicable-gravest-sin/article31161798.ece
255,2020/03/25,HC asks AIIMS to provide free treatment to 18-month-old girl for rare disease,"The court noted that there appears to be no policy for dealing with persons with rare diseases and how treatment is to be provided to them

The Delhi High Court has asked the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to provide treatment to an 18-month-old girl who is suffering from a rare disease ‘Gaucher’, without charging anything from her father.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh noted that as on date, there is no policy for dealing with persons with rare diseases and how the treatment is to be provided to them.

The court directed the Centre to file an affidavit before the next date of hearing, April 17, on the current policy of the government on rare diseases.

The court, in its order passed on March 23, said a copy of this order be communicated to the Medical Superintendent and Director of AIIMS with the request to commence the treatment of the child immediately.

The court was hearing a petition filed by the child’s father seeking funds for her treatment and direction for treating her for the disease as repeated representations made to various government authorities had not been fruitful.

The counsel for the child’s father told the court that the monthly cost of treatment of the disease is about ₹3.5 lakh.

The court was informed that ‘Gaucher’ has been treated as an ‘orphan disease’ in the U.S. and the European Union. It is a genetic disorder where fat-laden Gaucher cells build up in areas like the spleen, liver and bone marrow.

The court noted that the expense for this treatment is quite steep which the family cannot afford.

“Considering the age of the child and given that the policy for rare diseases is yet to be finalised by the government, it is deemed appropriate to direct respondent no. 3 — AIIMS to start the treatment of the petitioner (child) without charging anything from her,” the court said.

“Further directions in respect of the expenses towards the said treatment would be passed after the Union of India enters appearance in the matter,” it said.

The court was informed that though the central government had come out with a National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases, in 2018, it was reportedly scrapped due to objections by certain state governments and a draft policy document for rare diseases was released on January 13, 2020.

“However, it has not yet come into effect. Owing to this, there appears to be no policy in place at this point for dealing with persons with rare diseases and how treatment is to be provided to them,” the court noted.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/e9bitm/article31161413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIIMSBUILDINGDELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-asks-aiims-to-provide-free-treatment-to-18-month-old-girl-for-rare-disease/article31161414.ece

259,2020/03/25,Many unaware of govt. scheme providing free food at shelters,"Caretakers say they have had to turn away people as there was insufficient food

Several homeless people are not aware of the Delhi government’s scheme which provides for free food at night shelters.

On Saturday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced the scheme in light of the COVID-19 outbreak so that anyone could get food from the 220 government-run night shelters across the city. A ground reality check by The Hindu at four night shelters, however, revealed many shortcomings.

While food was not delivered at the night shelter next to gate number 1 of AIIMS in the afternoon, the other three complained that food was delivered late. Inhabitants and caretakers of the four shelters admitted that the food was less and every day 10 to 30 people who came to the facility had to return without food.

Moreover, multiple homeless people said they were unaware of the scheme. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Kejriwal said that they have noticed that the number of people at night shelters has been increasing since the programme’s launch. “We will make arrangements for food to be distributed at more locations soon,” he added.

Eight-year-old Rani Kumar from Bihar, who sleeps near a lift outside gate number 1 of AIIMS, was surviving only on biscuits on Tuesday.“I have eaten only biscuits,” she said, standing outside night shelter number 584. “Yesterday there was dal chawal, but today they did not supply food here,” said Rani, who had come with her family to Delhi for her elder brother’s treatment.

Inside the shelter, Ajay Kumar, 35, and his wife, who has a kidney problem, is sharing chiwda mixed with water and sugar in a steel bowl. “They did not give us food today and even my son is eating this,” he said.

Sixty-year-old Ameena Khatun from Bihar, who stays in a shack opposite Sai Mandir on Lodi Road, had to make roti and eat it with salt. “I went there [night shelter], but they said the food was finished,” she said.

Earlier, people who visited the temple gave them food, but with the temple shut since last Wednesday due to the COVID-19 lockdown, there have been hardly any visitors.

She said that her two grandchildren only had biscuits since morning.

“Now I will go there [night shelter] at 8 p.m. and if we get subzi, then I will feed them,” she added.

Several families near her shack said that they were not informed that the night shelter, which is hardly 300 metres from their settlement, was distributing food for free. “I came to know about it just now,” Ms. Khatun said.

At the night shelter, Rukmini Devi, 42, who was washing utensils, said that many people went back hungry. “Everyone at the night shelter got food, but at least 15 from outside didn’t get food today. Yesterday [Monday] around 25 people came and left without eating as there was no food,” she said.

At the Safdarjung Airport Flyover night shelter too people said that about 20 people returned without food. “There was no oil, masala, or spice in the curry [soya bean and potato] and it was very watery. It was like the food you give to people who are ill,” said Muskaan, 15, who stays at the night shelter.

Bipin Rai, member of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, which runs the night shelters, told The Hindu that they had just launched the initiative and would take days to iron out all the glitches.

“We have just started delivering food and it is the third day. We are also figuring out how much food is needed and we are increasing the quantity so that nobody goes without food.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ey1xry/article31157140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25DEAIIMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/many-unaware-of-govt-scheme-providing-free-food-at-shelters/article31157141.ece
260,2020/03/25,Kirana store owners stay open to stop panic,"Many big chains are running out of stock

Scenes of empty shelves at walk-in grocery shops that were doing the rounds on social media due to panic buying in several European countries and the U.S. has started becoming a reality in the Capital with several grocery stores on Tuesday morning running out of stock.

It was the neighbourhood kirana store that people were flocking to purchase bread and other fresh products. Three shops of a popular grocery chain said that on Monday, customers had bought in bulk and they had not yet replenished the stock. Two of them were operating with their shutters half open as they did not want people to come in and see the empty shelves.

J.P. Gupta, who runs “Morning Store” in a south Delhi colony, said that he was keeping his shop open as he did not want to disappoint his customers but had stopped hiring help to provide home delivery.

“If I shut my shop, it will create panic. Since Saturday, people have bought in large quantities and several items are not in stock but we will get supply by evening. I am prepared to sit at my shop and risk catching the virus but I am providing an essential service,” Mr. Gupta said.

Employees divided

For self-owned stores, the restrictions imposed have given them the opportunity to continue business while all markets are shut. But for large grocery chains, employees are divided on whether they should expose themselves to the virus at their workplace or not.

“There are several people who walk into the shop and although we have a bottle of sanitiser with a guard ensuring that they spray their hands, it is not enough. We handle so many customers and then go back home putting our families at risk. We are not getting paid more. Most of us do not have bikes of our own to reach the shop,” said a cashier who preferred anonymity.

Some of his colleagues differ. Rajat, another employee said: “Like doctors are working to save lives, we are working to ensure that people get food. As long as they are sanitising their hands before entering, we should continue our job. Already we have a shortage of stock. Imagine the panic it would create if we close down.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kirana-store-owners-stay-open-to-stop-panic/article31157128.ece

262,2020/03/25,"Gurugram residents urged to show restraint, stay indoors","Number of positive cases in district increases to 10

Police Commissioner of Gurugram, Muhammad Akil, on Tuesday made an appeal to the residents to show greater restraint and stay indoors, adding that the administration would be forced to enforce curfew in case the co-operation was not complete. He said that 33 people were booked under the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, for plying unauthorised vehicles.

Meanwhile, the number of positive cases in Gurugram increased to 10 with two more cases confirmed on Tuesday. A total of 232 samples have been taken so far and the results for 50 are awaited. As many as 172 are negative.

Curtail movement

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Akil said the movement of vehicles on the highway was just 1% and around 2-3% on the internal roads, but made a request to the residents to further curtail their movement for their own safety. “If we found the cooperation is not complete we will be forced to order curfew under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The authorities don’t want any such step to be taken like in Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh. We want our people to have minimum sufferings,” said Mr. Akil.

He said the crime rate had also gone down drastically over the past few days and only 10%-15% cases were registered compared to earlier days. He said that he wanted it to reduce further.

Mr. Akil said that authorities had little difficulties in implementing the lockdown directions since in many cases, the industries required time for shut down and domestic helps were also allowed in some cases as the elderly needed a support system.

Gurugram Deputy Commissioner Amit Khatri has also decided to address the residents live through the Facebook account of the district administration at 8 p.m. everyday and also take the questions of the residents.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gw33pt/article31157047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-HELPLINE-newcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gurugram-residents-urged-to-show-restraint-stay-indoors/article31157048.ece
263,2020/03/25,Delhiites take to police’s Twitter handle for queries and clarifications,"Queries related to issuance of “curfew passes”, problems faced by delivery boys, and documents required for commuting were some of concerns raised by people on Twitter after Delhi Police on Tuesday said it will be responding to queries regarding the curbs in the Capital through social media.

“Hi! Delhi. If you have any question on the #Lockdown, tweet your query with the hashtag #LockdownQuery between 5-6 PM today and we will answer it for you. #StayAtHomeSaveLives,"" the Delhi Police tweeted using its official handle earlier in the day.

Following this, several people posted their queries on Twitter using #LockdownQuery and tagged Delhi Police. When people asked Delhi Police about food and medicine delivery boys being thrashed by policemen at barricades, a senior police officer said that any such issue will be taken care of in future and fresh instructions will be issued regarding it.

Most of the queries were related to the requirement of “curfew passes” and procedure for procuring the same. While those engaged in essential services associated with e-pharmacies and food delivery queried: “@DelhiPolice Details of Curfew Pass required: What is the process of acquiring curfew pass? How many curfew passes can be allotted to person or company? What is the validity of a curfew pass?What if the curfew pass is misused?#LockdownQuery,” Arusa Chikersal posted on Twitter.

The police immediately stated that movement passes are issued by respective district DCP office and all should carry copy of documents to show the essential nature of work. “Do not misuse it as the restrictions are for your own safety & for the safety of entire community. Passes are valid till March 31,” the police instructed.

To a query posted by Jeetesh Kapoor, a pharmaceutical company owner, regarding curfew passes, the police stated that vehicles transporting essential goods and commodities are allowed to ply within Delhi without any restrictions. To various queries posted by people working in bank and telecom sectors, the police stated “people involved in essential services like hospitals, banks, ATMs, e-commerce of essential items, milk delivery, kirana stores, take away from restaurants, print/electronic media are allowed to move within Delhi on the basis of their official duty ID cards.”

Another posed a clarification regarding medical assistance: “My father is a kidney failure patient and my parents therefore have to travel twice a week [Wednesday & Saturday] from Greater Noida to Delhi for dialysis.” The Delhi Police instructed to get the pass issued. The police also shared a helpline number +91-11-23469526 in case of assistance. To another query on private security agencies, police said they are part of the essential services and they are required to carry their ID cards and be in uniform.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhiites-take-to-polices-twitter-handle-for-queries-and-clarifications/article31157046.ece
264,2020/03/25,"Migrant labourers left in the lurch, bear the brunt of curbs","Several found stranded at bus, railway stations

Migrant labourers, who got stranded in Delhi-NCR amid the curbs, were seen running pillar to post in search of public transport to reach their native places in U.P., Bihar and other States. Many such labourers, who were seen wandering around the railway and bus stations in Anand Vihar, were inquiring about passenger trains, only to be told that the services are locked till April 15.

“By the time I came to know about the shut down of trains, it was already done. I am concerned about my family at my home in Madhubani in Bihar. I don’t know what to do. All I want is to go back home,” said Chotu Kumar, a labourer.

Small industries

Most of them used to work in the construction sector as masons or helpers and many other small industries. These labourers are stuck in the wake of curbs.

“I have been told to go a night shelter at Anand Vihar where I can stay. But I am worried about my family in Lucknow. I have walked for around 20 kilometres from New Delhi railway station to Anand Vihar but here I have been informed that no trains are available till March 31,” said Vijay Kumar.

On Tuesday, Delhi police have registered 299 FIRs for violation during restrictions. A total of 5,146 people were held and 1,018 vehicles were impounded.

“We issued 2,319 curfew passes to the vehicles involved in essential services. We again request people to remain indoors and do not come out unnecessary,” said a police officer.

To ensure smooth movement of vehicles in essential services, Delhi Police has made a separate lane on the Noida border in east Delhi for emergency vehicles to pass during the restrictions, officials said. They have placed a board where they have written that doctors, media, ambulances, police and other exempted vehicles should use this lane. “Separate lane is on Noida border to facilitate emergency services’ vehicles,” DCP (East) tweeted.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2s3ism/article31157002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DELPRIYALABOURER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/migrant-labourers-left-in-the-lurch-bear-the-brunt-of-curbs/article31157005.ece
265,2020/03/25,South body sets rules for waste collection,"Protection gear to be provided

The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will be implementing guidelines for proper collection and disposal of waste from quarantined homes in its jurisdiction, it said in a statement on Tuesday.

To this end, Personal Protection Kits (PPEs) have been provided to concessionaires to be distributed to staff engaged in garbage collection for their safety. These include sodium hypochlorite (disinfectant) solutions, liquid hand soaps and gloves.

Apart from this, knapsack sprayers have been arranged for to spray the disinfection solution on domestic hazardous waste before its disposal.

Route plans

The SDMC will be drawing up a list of all such quarantined houses which will be provided to the concessionaire to make route plans. The list will be updated daily for smooth functioning.

One specific tipper in each zone will be deployed for collection of waste from such houses, the SDMC said.

After collection, such waste will be transported to the Waste to Energy plant in Okhla for incineration.

Train gardeners

Currently, while nurses and DBC workers with the SDMC were engaged in surveillance of passengers, who visited Delhi from abroad via door-to-door surveys, the civic body is also planning to train about 400 gardeners employed by it in this work.

They will be trained to conduct household surveys and prepare a list mentioning the number of patients suffering from COVID-19-like symptoms.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/south-body-sets-rules-for-waste-collection/article31156995.ece
266,2020/03/25,"Delhi govt. to give construction workers ₹5,000 each, says CM","Kejriwal says step taken as their livelihood has been affected due to COVID-19

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced that under the Construction Workers Welfare Board Fund, the Delhi government will give ₹5,000 to each construction worker as their livelihood has been affected due the COVID-19 outbreak.

He also said that the number of night shelters in the city has been increased and more food is being distributed to the homeless.

No new case reported

The Chief Minister sought to reassure residents that Delhi did not record any new case of COVID-19 in the last 40 hours but plans needed to be put in place to confront the possible progression of the virus epidemic to Stage 3.

“Today, I want to tell you that in the last 40 hours there has been not a single new COVID-19 positive case in Delhi. Earlier, we had a total of 30 such positive cases and among them, many people are getting better and going home. Till now, five people have survived and gone home. Right now, we have only 23 positive cases in Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“But I want to tell you that though this is good news, there is no need to cheer yet because the number of cases can increase any time if we do not put proper restrictions in place or if you do not follow the restrictions. In Italy, in the last 24 hours, more than 600 people have died and in America, in the last 24 hours, more than 150 people have died,” he said.

It was to address this “alarming situation worldwide” that the Delhi government had imposed such tough restrictions like a lockdown and a curfew.

He said, these restrictions may have brought many difficulties in the lives of citizens, but this was something that was required because we want to save the average resident of Delhi, their families and neighbours.

“Yesterday, I requested the residents of Delhi to come together and help each other in this tough time. Today, I am very happy that many people are coming forward and helping each other. In Delhi, nobody should suffer of hunger and it is our collective responsibility to stand beside each other,” he said.

Night shelters

“We have already started distributing food in all the night shelters of Delhi where any person can come and eat. We have witnessed that the number of people is increasing, therefore, we have also decided to increase the number of such night shelters and we will also increase food distribution,” he said.

From Tuesday, he said, the Delhi government had started preparation to build a “foolproof health system” to combat the situation if the city ever got into stage three of this pandemic.

The Chief Minister said a doctors’ team had been constituted which will make all the preparations and submit a report within 24 hours. “We do not want to get into stage three but we have to be fully prepared in terms of medical support,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/invv6b/article31156983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DELPRIYAKEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-to-give-construction-workers-5000-each-says-cm/article31156984.ece
267,2020/03/25,Nosy neighbours track ‘infected persons’,"Delhi Police claims they received more than a thousand calls in the last two days

Sushant Sharma (name changed), who lives on the fifth floor of a society in south-west Delhi, was shocked to see health department officials and policemen at his door on Sunday. When asked what they were doing at his home, Mr. Sharma was told that they got a call from the housing society about “COVID-19 infected persons” in the building.

“My son had come back from London a few days ago and my neighbour knew about it. But he was allowed to come out of the airport only after the screening process and was declared fit. But some neighbours made the call. We showed the documents to the team and they went back,” said Mr. Sharma.

On Tuesday, Delhi Police said they have received more than a thousand calls giving “information” about “COVID-19 infected persons” living in their vicinity in the last two days. “We transfer all such calls to the health department for action. A police team is also sent to the location for any assistance. But most of these calls were found fake and made by some nosy neighbours,” said a senior police officer.

Several residents and resident welfare associations have taken on a vigilante role after the outbreak of the pandemic with reports on social media suggesting that doctors and airline staff are special targets in many areas.

Entry banned

“We have banned the entry of newspaper vendors, food-delivery boys, courier boys and any other person except the residents. It has been kind of a self-imposed family quarantine to prevent residents from getting infected. We communicate through WhatsApp groups and keep residents well informed about any new safety provision,” said Munna Kunar, an RWA member in east Delhi

Another RWA member said they are keeping watch on houses marked “home under quarantine’’ by the health department. Security guards have been ordered to keep watch if any person of the marked house comes out.

268,2020/03/25,‘Extend benefits of advocates’ welfare scheme’,"Lawyers move High Court against restrictions in Delhi govt.’s novel scheme

Several lawyers have moved the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the city government to extend the benefit of ‘Chief Minister’s Advocates’ Welfare Scheme’ to all lawyers enrolled with the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), irrespective of whether their names appear in the voters list of the Capital or not.

The plea said that in November 2019, the Delhi government had announced the scheme for the welfare of all practising advocates of the national capital who are on the rolls of BCD.

₹50-crore grant

A 13-member committee of advocates was set up to give recommendations for the utilisation of the ₹50-crore grant towards the scheme and the government had accepted the recommendations given by the panel, it said.

The petitioner advocates have challenged the Delhi government’s decision to restrict the scheme to only those members of BCD who are in the voters list of Delhi.

The petitioners said they are enrolled with the BCD and have membership of the Delhi High Court Bar Association and while they practice in courts here, they do not reside in the Capital and their exclusion from the scheme is arbitrary and not in conformity with the constitutional scheme and policy. Another plea on the issue has sought to quash the Delhi government’s circular on providing benefits to lawyers, on the ground that it was discriminatory and arbitrary and violates the provisions of the Constitution.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wohy8i/article31156972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DELPRIYALAWYERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/extend-benefits-of-advocates-welfare-scheme/article31156974.ece

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Tuesday welcomed various announcements for relief announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and was eagerly looking forward to the economic package to be introduced.

While appreciating the extension of various statutory compliances such as filing of income tax, GST and other Acts, the traders’ body said that it would help to withdraw interest for the extended period instead of lowering the rate of interest.

The traders’ body also called for the extension of the current financial year up till June 30, extension in repayment of bank loans, EMIs and other banking obligations till September 30, with a waiver on interest or penalty for the extended period. Apart from this, it also called for the deferring of payment on all government utility bills such as electricity, water, property tax. It also suggested that the government bear the employee’s share of the provident fund for six months, and extension of a corona cash loan at reduced rates of interest to ensure an uninterrupted supply chain.

It also demanded a subsidy to traders for paying wages to their workers for the duration of the lockdown. The CAIT also highlighted the risk of use of cash in transmitting the virus and appealed for the use of digital transactions with removal of bank charges.

270,2020/03/25,Chaos and confusion outside DCP office for travel passes,"Exemption seekers complain of complicated procedures

Hundreds of people gathered outside the Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) office to procure passes for movement in the Capital. They were a complaining lot, criticising everything from a lack of clarity of procedures and measures in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak to blasting the police for not having a system in place.

Moreover, they stood close to each other outside the office, apparently for several hours, unsure of whether they would get a pass or not. First, they had to register their names to officials who were sitting with a register kept on a desk outside the office, before they were called inside the office. By 2.30 p.m., nearly 300 people had registered and allegedly about 40-odd were called inside to submit documents.

Charan Singh, a 41-year-old resident of Patiala, who stood with Hari Nagar resident Gurpreet Singh, said he was returning from Nasik on Monday to his residence in Patiala but stopped in Delhi last evening because there were no transport services. “I don’t have any relatives in Delhi. I went to the Gurudwara Bangla Saheb but that was closed for people to stay. I met Gurpreet there who offered to help me and bring me to his house,” he said.

Mr. Gurpreet, a complete stranger for Mr. Charan, went to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital to get the COVID-19 test done before they returned to Mr. Gurpreet’s house.

“I need a pass to go home. I’ll take Gurpreet’s private vehicle with his driver. But we have been standing here for four hours and haven’t been called inside,” he complained.

Long wait

Prateek Baweja, a resident of Tilak Nagar who runs a retail vegetable shop in Noida, said that he had been standing for two hours. “They are not letting us inside and those officials at the gate are not telling whether I require the pass. They just say that we have to wait for our number,” he said.

Harish Harjai, who runs a milk dairy in Ratan Park, faced a similar problem. He claimed he had come at 10.30 a.m. and was standing outside till 2.30 p.m. “In the morning, a person in the same business called and told me that the police had stopped his worker’s bike when he was distributing milk. I know it comes under essential commodity but then why was the worker stopped? That’s why I have come for the pass,” he said.

Crowd outside office

People complained of absence of hand sanitisers and systematic queues. Baljeet Singh, who runs a sanitiser company in Noida, said: “There are no queues, people are standing so close to each other. They should have made this system online and eased it for everyone. Or they should call people once it’s their turn. What’s the point of people crowding outside offices?”

Police, on the other hand, complained that people are crowding outside despite officials asking them to stand away from each other and displaying the list of people and services allowed on the road outside the office. An official who didn’t wish to be identified said: “People like milk vendors, doctors and nurses are coming to get passes. We have told them not to come because they don’t need any passes; their identity cards are sufficient.”

A senior police officer of the district said that measures are being taken in the wake of COVID-19. “We are sanitising the office gates at regular intervals. Eight desks have been set up to clear for passes",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2nzoki/article31156969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL25-DCP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/chaos-and-confusion-outside-dcp-office-for-travel-passes/article31156970.ece
271,2020/03/25,"‘The protest ends, but movement lives on’","Twitter handle ‘Shaheen Bagh Official’ vows to keep the movement going

“The Shaheen Bagh Protest May have ended, but our movement lives on.” So goes the title of a two-page statement issued by the Twitter handle ‘Shaheen Bagh Official’.

While protesters had refused to stop demonstrations, they said they had taken various precautions keeping in mind the pandemic outbreak. They also observed the ‘people’s curfew’ announced by the Prime Minister earlier and were continuing the protest only symbolically with about three to five women at the site, they said.

Police personnel had allegedly arrived at the site on the intervening night of March 23 and 24, when they said they were going to evacuate the site but were met with a large gathering of locals who stopped them, the statement read. The situation was resolved at the time but a large police contingent cleared out the site on Tuesday morning.

“Although we understand the need for a stricter imposition of curfew and enforcement of pertinent restrictions, the ruthless dismantling and thoughtless destruction of the markers of our physical protest [especially the structures whose placement is in question is a matter that is sub-judice in the SC] reeks of strong vendetta and ill-feelings towards our innocent protesters, locals and sympathisers,” it read.

With regard to the future of the protest, the statement read, “While we acknowledge the need to tackle the looming threat of the transmission of COVID-19, it is important to ensure at all reasonable costs that the spirit and intent behind the Shaheen Bagh is not lost in the race against this pandemic.”

The twitter handle put out a charter of rights and demands, which it would present to the interlocutors appointed by the Supreme Court. Among the demands, the protesters sought protection from the courts through increased patrolling and additional deployment of police around the area, that no further retaliatory or coercive action be taken against the protesters, locals or sympathisers of the protest. It also called for withdrawing cases against Jamia Millia Islamia students and for a court-monitored inquiry into the crackdown at the university on December 15, besides requesting the court to take cognisance of alleged hate speech over social media directed at protesters, and which “contributed to the conflagration” in north-east Delhi.

The statement also highlighted the impracticality of ensuring ‘social distancing’ in the poorer localities of the country and urged the government to take measures to ensure the safety of citizens in such localities.

“We have come a long way in our fight against injustice. Our efforts have brought practical and tangible sources of dissent in the system itself. When we began, only four States had passed a resolution against CAA-NRC-NPR. Today, the number stands at 12. Although, the sit-in by the women of Shaheen Bagh was the fundamental form of the protest, its essence, however, far transcends its physical form.

272,2020/03/25,Medical staff treating COVID-19 patients told to vacate homes,"AIIMS doctors issue appeal to Health Ministry over harassment by landlords

Medical staff from across India working with COVID-19 patients appealed to the Union Health Ministry for help on Tuesday stating that they are being harassed, with several of them told to immediately vacate their rented accommodation by landlords because of the fear that they could spread the virus.

The Resident Doctors’ Association of All India Institute of Medical Sciences has written to the Ministry seeking urgent intervention.

“Doctors, nurses and other hospital staff involved in COVID-19 care are being asked to vacate their rented homes for the fear that they may spread the virus. Many doctors are now stranded on the road with their luggage with nowhere to go. This is happening across the country and we condemn such attitude and seek urgent intervention. Also with the lockdown in place, not enough public transport is available for hospital staff to travel from their residence to various hospitals,” said the letter.

Ministers react quickly

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted expressing deep anguish, saying he noticed such reports pouring in from Delhi, Noida, Warangal, Chennai, etc., and asked people not to panic. He said all precautions are being taken by doctors and staff on COVID-19 duty to ensure they are not carriers of infection in any way.

“Any harsh steps will demoralise them, derail the system. On Sunday, the nation applauded their selfless service. It’s our duty to keep their morale high,” Mr. Vardhan said.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also tweeted in support of the doctors. “The Centre must immediately step in to ensure protection of doctors and paramedics, who are putting their lives on the line for our sake, from such harassment. Necessary protective gear should also be provided for their safety,” he said.

AIIMS RDA general secretary Srinivas Rajkumar said Home Minister Amit Shah has assured that any such issue of ostracisation will be taken seriously and action taken immediately.

Help pours in

After AIIMS doctors issued an appeal for help in procuring personal protection gear for medical staff and released a list of equipment immediately required, help started pouring in on Tuesday itself. “After our communication with the Health Ministry, several people and companies have offered support through various possible means,” noted a statement issued by the RDA.

It added that to help the AIIMS administration fast-track COVID-19 preparedness, public sector unit Bharat Dynamics has come forward to help with manufacturing, funds and logistics. “We have secured the AIIMS administration a sum of Rs. 60 lakh from the CSR corpus of Bharat Dynamics (Rs.50 lakh) and POSCO India Pvt Ltd. (Rs.10 lakh). We also asked the chairman of Preventive Wear Manufacturers’ Association of India to show the samples and enable easy availability,” said Dr. Rajkumar. “We are extremely thankful to all those who extended support to battle the pandemic,” the AIIMS RDA general secretary added.

Waiving off charges?

Earlier, the canteens were serving lunch for a token charge of ₹5 per meal, which the Minister sought to waive, in view of the current lockdown.

He is reported to have asked officials to explore the possibility of serving free meals twice a day, instead of once.

275,2020/03/25,Ministers offer succour to lockdown-hit,"Several Ministers, MLAs take to city roads to talk to people and know their problems

After Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao asked people’s representatives to be on the field helping police during the lockdown, several Ministers and MLAs took to streets in their respective towns. However, the response was lukewarm in the districts.

Minister for IT and Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao responded positively to the CM’s call and visited night shelters in the city enquiring with the inmates about the facilities.

He asked Hyderabad District Collector Shweta Mohanty to ensure all facilities were provided to people who don’t have anywhere to go and end up at shelters.

He also interacted with people on roads and when a few people said they wanted to go to Uppal but were forced to walk, he arranged a vehicle for them. He asked officials to shift a man from Bihar, who said he had nowhere to go, to a night shelter.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao also travelled in the district asking people on problems faced by them even as they asked them to stay indoors. A vehicle with a video message of Mr. Harish Rao asking people to take care and to stay indoors and also explaining how dangerous the virus can be was seen at various places in the combined Medak district.

Similarly, Labour Minister M. Malla Reddy visited most of the mandals in his Medchal constituency and reviewed the situation with the police and revenue officials. He visited Jahawarnagar, Ghatkesar and Keesara mandals, and asked officials to ensure that the lockdown was complete but people in emergencies dealt with a humane approach.

In Khammam, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar held a review meeting with officials on the supply of essential commodities. Several elected representatives got active only after he landed at Khammam from Hyderabad on Wednesday.

In Mahabubnagar, Tourism Minister Srinivas Goud visited the new Rythu Bazaar and asked officials to make arrangements for farmers to sell vegetables. Jubilee Hills MLA Maganti Gopinath too visited the localities in his constituency.

Representatives scared

Reports from the districts said elected representatives were too scared to venture out though a few did their best visiting their areas. “We have not seen our corporator after the lockdown,” a resident of Karimnagar said, adding they too were scared to come out.

However, some of them claimed they were strictly following the lockdown by the government and officials were making all the arrangements. In Karimnagar, local corporators came out only after Minister Gangula Kamalakar arrived from Hyderabad and reviewed the situation. Wednesday being Ugadi also contributed to lesser participation of the elected representatives in towns and cities in the State.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ministers-offer-succour-to-lockdown-hit/article31167780.ece

277,2020/03/25,‘Power staff should not be harassed by police’,"Authorities urged to give proper instructions to policemen

Irrespective of repeated advocacy by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to the police enforcing lockdown in Telangana, the men in uniform appear to be unmindful of the clear instructions to allowing personnel of essential services such as civic administration, medical and health, media, water supply, power supply and others discharging their duties, without any obstruction and harassment.

After the bitter experience of media and medical and health personnel, including doctors, personnel of power utilities, who are required to maintain interruption-free power supply, have also been put to such harassment at different places across the State.

According to Chairman and MD of TS-Genco and TS-Transco D. Prabhakar Rao, it has come to their notice that personnel of power utilities were obstructed, harassed and even beaten up at several places across the State when they were on their way to attend to their duties. He requested the police to give proper and clear instructions to all their personnel to allow those engaged in essential services when they produce their ID card.

278,2020/03/25,Social distancing what? CP’s meeting at jam-packed conference hall,"Anjani Kumar meets representatives of all essential services

A hall packed with representatives of essential services for a meeting with Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar on Wednesday shows the extent to which social distancing is being ignored at this time of COVID-19 pandemic, with the top brass setting a wrong example.

What is worse is that these very people, who were seen sitting and standing close to each other at the meeting, already came in contact and will continue to do so with hordes of people as part of their essential supply chain.

Though each one of them was made to wash their hands with liquid soaps at the entry and later given hand sanitisers, social distancing was not maintained.

The meeting, which saw the presence of Principal Secretary (IT) Jayesh Ranjan and several senior police officers, lasted for close to three hours. Police personnel present in the meeting and staff at the CP office were worried seeing the large gathering. Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Kumar appeared terrified at the huge turnout and was seen wearing a premium mask.

The conference hall at Mr. Kumar’s office in Basheerbagh has a capacity to seat 180 to 200 people. Several representatives from hospitals, marketing, cable operators, pharmacies and groceries, had to stand because the hall was jam-packed. In his recent tweets, the Commissioner was requesting people to stay at home, avoid social gathering and maintain social distance, to break the COVID-19 chain. However, this meeting came as a surprise.

A message sent to journalists from Commissioner’s office read: CP Hyderabad Anjani Kumar has invited representatives of all essential services for a meeting at 12.30 p.m. at CP office. Joint CP (Special Branch) Tarun Joshi and Additional DCP Muthyam Reddy are the nodal officers in this regard.

279,2020/03/25,SBI to deliver basic services only with skeletal staff,"Customers appealed to minimise visit to branches

State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday said that it is providing essential and basic banking services with minimum number of staff at its branches in view of COVID-19.

The bank will deliver basic services only – cash deposits and withdrawal, remittances, clearing of cheques and government transactions – in the branches from March 23 onwards until further notification, a release from SBI said, citing guidelines to this effect.

Chief General Manager of SBI Hyderabad Circle O.P. Mishra appealed to all customers to minimise their visit to the branches.

He advised them to use digital and alternate channels like internet banking, YONO and ATM services to minimise the need to visit branches as most of the services are available on these platforms.

A release from SBI Hyderabad Circle said in view of the lockdown announced by the Telangana government, Mr. Mishra requested customers to cooperate and prevent spread of the virus. He requested all the customers and staff to maintain personal hygiene and avoid grouping/meeting in the branches to ensure social distancing.

SLBC advisory

Meanwhile, the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) on Monday shared with all the banks guidelines issued by Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) advising them to follow the same.

While listing that the branches will be kept open for rendering essential services, the guidelines laid stress on urging customers to avail alternative service delivery channels, screening of those who visit the branches and ensuring sufficient cash is available at ATMs.

Reduction in business hours, to a minimum of four hours, may be considered in discussion with the district administration.

If any area is declared as sensitive by the district authorities, then the bank branches located in such areas may be closed, the IBA guidelines shared by SLBC convenor U.N.N. Maiya said.

Some of the other guidelines include operating central processing centres, involved in clearance of cheques and pensions, with optimum staff members as well as fumigation or cleaning of the branches to be undertaken immediately after work hours.

Over the past few days, several banks, both private and public, had been sending text messages to customers encouraging them to use mobile or net banking since the branches will operate with reduced staff.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sbi-to-deliver-basic-services-only-with-skeletal-staff/article31167700.ece
280,2020/03/25,FTCCI seeks help of TS govt. for industry,"‘Difficult for units to pay wages by taking more loans while foregoing production’

The Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) has appealed to the State government for a number of support measures for industries such as waiver of penalties and interests and creation of a fund for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

Sharing the suggestions/recommendations made to the government, in the backdrop of COVID-19 outbreak, president Karunendra S. Jasti said FTCCI and industry understood the importance of social distancing and closure of non-essential shops. At the same time, as an industry body, FTCCI was “concerned for financial health of the all industrial units, large scale and MSMEs”, he said.

Pointing to how industrial units work on a precarious state of finances and any minor disruptions in their work flow was bound to upset production and cash flows, he said loss and difficulties of the workforce was predictable. “It is equally difficult for the units and businesses to pay salaries by taking additional loans while foregoing the production and revenues,” he said in a statement.

Figuring at the top of the list that FTCCI submitted to the State government was an appeal for waiver of penalties/interest on delayed payment of power bills, water bills, property taxes, license fee and any other statutory payments to be made by March 31 for three months. Extension of time for payment of GST without penalties and interests for three months — up to June 2020 — is another suggestion.

Mr. Jasti said a fund should be set up for MSMEs and from that, working capital loans disbursed at no or minimal 2-3% interest to the units. Likewise, to tide over financial crisis of the units, the government was urged to issue pending industrial incentives by April-end.

The umbrella body also wanted the government to utilise labour welfare fund for payment of wages to workers, thus compensating them for the loss of livelihood during the lockdown period. FTCCI wanted extension of time to claim industrial incentives for the first half of 2019-20 as well as the deadline for the units concerned to pay VAT.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ftcci-seeks-help-of-ts-govt-for-industry/article31167587.ece

283,2020/03/25,61 orphans stranded at Victoria Memorial Home,"Resident teachers have been given responsibility of 10 students each

Exams are over, school children are home and watched over 24x7 by cautious parents, more so in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Closure of schools, colleges and coaching centres has resulted in several students from outside Hyderabad vacating their hostels and going home. But for 61 students of the Victoria Memorial (VM) Home Residential School in Saroornagar, there is nowhere to go despite the havoc created by the virus and the subsequent lockdown.

Ranging between six and 16 years of age, the children are orphans and do not have a place to call home except the school. “There were 865 students in all, and a majority of them have gone back to their villages and to relatives’ places in view of the spread of the pandemic. These children left in the hostel do not have anybody, hence it is our responsibility to care for them,” says Lakshmi Parvathi, principal of the school with full additional charge.

About 44 of the stranded students were sent here by the Women and Child Development department from their State Home and juvenile rehabilitation home.

Paucity of infrastructure

“Usually during holidays, we send them back to the respective homes. But this time, the department has refused to take them back, owing to paucity of infrastructure to protect them against the virus. We, too, did not insist because ultimately, children’s safety is important,” says Ms. Parvathi, asserting that utmost care and caution are exercised to protect the children.

The sprawling grounds of the VM Home are regularly visited by hundreds of walkers in the morning and evening. After the lockdown, the school management has made it clear to the walkers to stay back.

“We faced stiff resistance from the walkers, but with the help of the police we could restrain them to prevent infections,” says Ms. Parvathi.

Resident teachers have been given the responsibility of 10 students each, and the importance of social distancing has been drilled into the children’s minds. “We have ensured hand wash bells every 90 minutes, and enough distance among students during lunch and playing hour. We are also getting the students bathed twice every day, and keeping their dormitories clean. Door knobs are being wiped every now and then,” she related.

Class X students were given masks to wear while going for exams. Workers who clean the dormitories too have been strictly warned against working anywhere else, and it has been ensured that they stay close by.

Even the vegetable vendor keeps his delivery outside and leaves. A cook’s family has stayed back to prepare meals for the children which are left outside the dormitories, to be taken inside by the teachers.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/61-orphans-stranded-at-victoria-memorial-home/article31167476.ece
284,2020/03/25,Lockdown triggers flurry of SOS messages on KTR’s Twitter page,"Minister gets his team to respond to and act on each request for help

Several requests for help popped up on Telangana IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s Twitter page minutes after Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced 21-day complete lockdown on Tuesday.

The appeals ranged from arranging transport to visit scanning centres and dialysis centres, transporting a body to Kerala, bringing back TS students stranded in Vizianagaram and even helping with a wedding ceremony scheduled for April 10.

Flooded with messages

The first plea came at 8.18 p.m. minutes after the Prime Minister began speaking about the lockdown. The requests for help and an occasional offer of help kept on pouring in till late in the night. Mr. Rao kept answering them, bringing his official team into play.

“I am a resident of Arvind Nagar colony, Hyderabad. I am 9 months pregnant and ED is 28 April plus minus 3 days. Doctor suggested weekly checkups. Now cabs not available and we don’t have a 4-wheeler to visit hospital. pls help (sic),” tweeted Nidhi Mishra.

“My uncle passed away yesterday and his body is kept in mortuary at Gandhi Hospital. His home and family is in Thodupuzha, near Cochin, Kerala. Would you please assist in allowing the ambulance carrying his body to travel to Kerala. Whom should I contact?” tweeted Gopi.

Within a few minutes, the Tweeple had a response and the staff of Mr. Rama Rao got in touch with the people who put out a message. “The Minister has a support staff that does the back-end work. The request for aid or grievance is shared on an internal messaging group and tracked on a spreadsheet as this is a temporary problem. Then officers contact the person making the request,” informed Dileep Konatham of Telangana government.

Local passes

“Right now we are getting requests for medical emergencies or healthcare issues where officials interact with the local police stations for arranging a local pass,” added Mr. Konatham.

For people who are stranded and want to go back home due to closure of hostels or boarding facility, Mr. Konatham said they are liaising with hostel officials to keep them functioning. “The very purpose of lockdown will be defeated if all the people travel back and forth,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8z5wk/article31167384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy25KTR-tweet,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lockdown-triggers-flurry-of-sos-messages-on-ktrs-twitter-page/article31167363.ece
285,2020/03/25,Govt. issues guidelines for telemedicine,"To realise full potential of advancements in technology for healthcare delivery

At a time when providing in-person healthcare is challenging, given the large distances and limited resources, telemedicine increases timely access to appropriate interventions, including access to services that may not be otherwise available. But there has been concern on the practice of telemedicine due to lack of clear guidelines. This has created ambiguity for registered medical professionals, raising doubts about the practice of telemedicine.

Allaying these concerns, telemedicine practice guidelines prepared by Medical Council of India in partnership with NITI Aayog were released by the government.

The guidelines will give practical advice to doctors so that all services and models of care used by doctors and health workers are encouraged to consider the use of telemedicine as part of normal practice.

These will also help realise the full potential of advancements in technology for healthcare delivery and provided norms and protocols relating to physician-patient relationship, issues of liability and negligence, evaluation, management and treatment, informed consent, referrals for emergency services, medical records, privacy and security of patient records etc.

The guidelines emphasise that the professional judgment of a Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) should be the guiding principle for all telemedicine consultations. He/she would decide whether a patient would require technology based consultation or in-person consultation. Telemedicine consultation should not be anonymous and both patient and the RMP need to know each other’s identity.

For issuing a prescription , the RMP should ask the age of patient and in case of doubt, seek age proof. Multiple technologies could be used to deliver telemedicine consultations — video, audio or text.

If physical examination is critical for consultation, then an RMP should not proceed until a physical examination could be arranged.

The guidelines were also given for technology platforms enabling telemedicine. The technology platforms — mobile apps, websites etc. — should ensure that the consumers were consulting with the RMPs duly registered with national medical councils or respective State medical council.

Technology platforms based on artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning are not allowed to counsel the patients or prescribe any medicineto them. Only an RMP is entitled to counsel or prescribe and has to directly communicate with the patient in this regard. New technologies like AI, IoT etc can assist or support an RMP on patient evaluation.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/govt-issues-guidelines-for-telemedicine/article31167340.ece
286,2020/03/25,Massive rush for travel passes,"Social distancing norms go for a toss as hundreds queue up at police stations

Hundreds of professionals, students, private employees and migrant workers queued up at various police stations in the city in an attempt to obtain a travel pass to head to their respective hometowns. The massive rush made a mockery of the social distancing norms.

Serpentine queues were witnessed at SR Nagar, Punjagutta, Jubilee Hills and Madhapur police stations. The Madhapur police station witnessed a queue running into a couple of hundred metres with scores of two-wheelers parked on the roads.

“I had to wait for nearly three hours to submit my application and get the pass. I was told the pass is valid for 24 hours. I have been living in Hyderabad for four years and have to go to Chittoor,” said Vijay Sai, a 26-year-old private company employee and a resident of Madhapur said.

Dozens of young men and women converged near police stations and were seen writing applications sitting on the footpaths, fuel tanks of two-wheelers and at the Madhapur bus stop before submitting it to the police. “I hail from a village near Warangal. It took me around one-and-a-half hours to get the pass. I will be going home on my two-wheeler,” said V. Kishore, who was at the Punjagutta police station.

According to sources, the Madhapur police station issued as many as 1,500 passes while SR Nagar police issued as many as 700 till 5 p.m. on Wednesday.

Police said that several migrants and professionals had decided to leave as hostels ordered them to vacate PG rooms, hostels and dorms.

DGP, Minister intervene

However, after Telangana DGP M. Mahender Reddy intervened and warned PG and hostel managements of strict action in case they force inmates out, several who wished to leave changed their mind. “Since lookdown is under implementation, no permission or no-objection certificate will be granted for any movement of people across the State till further orders, in the interest of public health and safety,” Mr. Reddy said.

Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao also intervened and dissuaded the managements from asking inmates to leave. “Request all Hostel/PG managements in Hyderabad city to NOT evict anyone & cause undesirable panic I have already asked @CommissionrGHMC @bonthurammohan and @CPHydCity @cpcybd to ensure that you receive all support to run the facilities without problems (sic),” he wrote on Twitter and requested public representatives to visit hostels to reassure students and speak to hostel managements.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5wcst8/article31167309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25-HUNDREDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/massive-rush-for-travel-passes/article31167292.ece
287,2020/03/25,Almanac reading a low-key affair,"Welcoming Telugu new year ‘Sarvari Nama’, almanac reader appeals people to be alert till May 22

The almanac reading at the official Ugadi celebrations here on Wednesday attributed the ongoing spell of coronavirus to the trail of harm left by the outgoing ‘Vikari Nama’ year in its final phase.

Welcoming the new Telugu year ‘Sarvari Nama’, almanac reader Bachampally Santosh Kumar Sastri appealed to the people to be alert till May 22 when the spillover of Vikari Nama will cease to be active. He regretted that the outgoing year passed on the baton to the new year, creating an alarming situation for people.

The celebrations were a low-key affair at the office of endowments at Boggulkunta due to the restrictions imposed by government.

Endowments Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy, Advisor (Culture) K.V. Ramanachary and Endowments Commissioner V. Anil Kumar were among the small gathering present in a hall.

Mr. Sastri asked people to heed to the advice of the State government to stay indoors and not move freely. They would invite trouble if they felt they were physically strong to weather the hazards of coronavirus. People should perform Chandi Yagam and recite Chandi slokas to stay free, he said.

As the new year will be under the influence of Sun God, he appealed to people not to eat non-vegetarian food on Sundays. There was no restriction on eating the same on other week days.

Good rains predicted

Mr. Sastri predicted good rains and a good harvest of crop this year but the State's financial position might not be strong as the government's income and expenditure will be in the ratio of 105 : 96 which is just 9 plus. It is with that meagre surplus of 9 points that the development of State had to take place.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao will face a challenging situation, he said.

The Central and State governments will work hand-in-hand as brothers as both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had good tidings this year.

Mr. Sastri expected subsidies for people to be cut this year under the impact of economic slowdown world over. People will also face increasing price rise. The prices of petrol and diesel will skyrocket. Some scandals will surface in education sector and the real estate will also take backseat, he added.

The police will deliver good results in meeting law and order problems but they must be watchful about cyber crimes. The media must tread cautiously. The State could experience tremors in June - July, he said.

288,2020/03/25,"P16, who tested voluntarily, lauds Gandhi quarantine","The staff is friendly and the ward is maintained with utmost hygiene, says youth

“We even have WFH here. Work from Hospital,” quips 24-year-old Nikhil (name changed) aka P16 from his hospital bed.

Diagnosed with COVID-19 a week ago, Nikhil, a law graduate pursuing higher education in the UK, is now assigned the name P16, based on the chronology of the coronavirus patients in the State. Nikhil’s opinion of the isolation ward in Gandhi Hospital, where he is admitted now, challenges the popular perception of the government-designated quarantine centres.

“The staff is really friendly. They greet us warmly from time to time. Their courage to work in these wards amid the widespread panic gives me goosebumps every time,” says Nikhil. He spends most of his day working on the project he got fellowship for, from the Clinton Foundation, and listening to online classes from the University Of Edinburgh through the hospital’s WiFi facility. Nikhil’s project on Human Rights activism won him enrolment into Clinton Global Initiative University (CGIU).

Yet to meet family

He is probably the rare foreign returnee, who chose to head directly to Gandhi Hospital upon arrival instead of going home to Warangal. He is yet to meet his family and friends. “I made it clear to my parents that I was not going to meet them until I get my tests clear, and also discouraged friends from receiving me at the airport,” Nikhil said.

After arriving in the wee hours of March 19, Nikhil approached the health desk at the RGIA with mild sore throat, but was told that quarantine was not mandatory for patients from UK. Nevertheless, he spent the next few hours at a hotel, and went to Gandhi Hospital.

By the next morning, the test results came positive. While in the hotel room, he avoided contact with the staff and asked the room boys not to come inside. Once he tested positive, he informed the Health authorities about his hotel stay and asked them to sanitise the place. “The ward is maintained with utmost hygiene. Rooms are cleaned and mopped every day. They disinfect all corners. Bathrooms are cleaned every day and repairs are attended to,” he says in praise of the Gandhi Hospital’s isolation ward.

Bedsheets used for COVID-19 patients and their hazmat suits are changed every day. The used sheets and suits are disposed of by burning. Nutritious diet is provided four times a day, which includes boiled egg and dry fruits and nuts.

Interestingly, Nikhil has not had fever so far, though respiratory congestion and exhaustion persist.

In fact, several harbouring the virus may not show up with fever, and it is in the best interest of the country and its population that the foreign returnees isolate themselves without being told so, Nikhil says.

“Pass wartime emergency laws to take control over the private hospitals. Turn them into isolation wards. When a country can build a whole new hospital in days, you can at least cause some displeasure to the affluent corporate owners of private hospitals,” he posted as suggestion to the government on his Facebook timeline, where he revealed his COVID-19 status.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/600h44/article31167229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25-GANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/p16-who-tested-voluntarily-lauds-gandhi-quarantine/article31167230.ece

292,2020/03/25,It’s community watch in Palamuru,"Teams formed in all the 474 villages of Mahabubnagar district

In what could be a first of its kind of initiative, the district administration of Mahabubnagar, identified as one of most backward districts in the country, has launched community watch programme by forming village-level teams to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Apart from creating awareness among people about safety measures to be following to prevent the spread of dreaded infectious disease, the village-level community watch teams are also keeping an eye on the families/persons whose home quarantine has been prescribed by the medical authorities after their return from other countries. To ensure functioning of the village-level teams, a supervisory monitoring system has also been put in place.

Explaining the concept, District Collector S. Venkata Rao told The Hindu that the administration has drawn inspiration for launching the programme from some communities which enforced social distancing as the news of coronavirus spread by preventing others entering their village by blocking the road entry.

Citing an example, he stated that the people of Managampet thanda in the district have started restricting entry of outsiders as the news of the dreaded virus infection spread.

Community strategy

Taking a cue from spontaneous reaction of a few habitations, the district administration has identified that there is a need for a micro-level strategy to contain the spread of coronavirus.

“Since it can’t be expected that all people will take necessary precautions themselves to prevent the spread of the virus as most of them are prone to be influenced by half-knowledge, blind faith and misinformation, we have decided adopt a multi-pronged strategy to combat the spread of coronavirus by evolving “Mahabubnagar Community Watch” programme with the District Rural Development Agency as the nodal authority,” Mr. Venkata Rao stated.

Teams in action

As part of the strategy, village-level watch teams have been formed with village administrative officer, grama sangham (village organisation of women self help groups) president, secretary and treasurer and an active villager as its members in association with the community coordinators and assistant project managers working for DRDA.

“The community watch teams will be in addition to other regular mechanisms such as village revenue office, village (panchayat) secretary, village revenue assistant in place,” the District Collector said.

Stating that 182 persons of the district have been prescribed home quarantine by the medical authorities after their return from other countries in the recent past, Mr. Narayana Rao said the community watch teams are monitoring their movements with the help of other people, including neighbours of such families. Besides, regular medical check-up, once in three days, is also being done for 1,289 persons who have returned to the district from other States by health workers.

The community watch teams would monitor whether the people quarantined were actually following the procedure or not and in case of any violation, they are alerting zonal development officer, tehsildar, medical officer and sub-inspector of police of the area concerned. There were only a couple of such breaches and the persons were counselled against their misadventure. Besides, the teams are also monitoring local news outlets and social media so that they could report to the local police about the spread of fake news or rumours, if any.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rp2m2z/article31167031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy24-Mangampet,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/its-community-watch-in-palamuru/article31167032.ece
293,2020/03/25,Crossing 3-km radius to attract challans,"Penalty may vary from ₹1,500 to ₹ 2,000

If you have violated the three-kilometre radius restriction imposed by the State government during the COVID-19 lockdown, be prepared to pay hefty challans issued on your vehicle.

The Artificial Intelligence-powered automatic number plate reading (ANPR) cameras will track the movements of the vehicles from a point close to location from where you began the trip. Once you cross the three-km radius, cameras at the next junction will read your registration plate and generate a challan for violating the government order.

“To curb unnecessary vehicular movement and strictly impose the 3-km rule, we are using ANPR cameras, AI-based analytics and video analytics to identify the vehicles and owners violating the rule. After identification, a case will be booked against lockdown violators,” a senior police officer told The Hindu.

For instance, if a car is caught on camera at Punjagutta junction, and the same vehicle’s movement is recorded 10 km away at Nalgonda crossroads, a challan will be generated.

On Wednesday alone over 1,000 challans were issued, and the penalty varies anywhere between ₹ 1,500 and ₹2,000. “This is being done to act as a deterrent against those who venture out on the roads for no reason,” he said.

According to the officer, there are at least 1,000 ANPR cameras at 250 junctions in Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates.

However, it is yet to be ascertained as to how those exempted under essential services, including doctors, nurses, government employees, journalists, will be identified. And if contactless challans are generated how they will be quashed.

When asked another officer said that at this moment it is highly impossible for them to identify the vehicles of those covered under essential services and not issue challans. “Though we have technology, we never faced such situation in the past. A team is working on it,” he added.

Spike in Dial 100 calls

Inquiries on emergency service Dial 100 shot up two-fold, post the lockdown on account of coronavirus scare. Earlier, the number of calls was around 36,000 to 38,000 per day, but after the Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s announcement on Tuesday that people in distress and urgent need for travel can call Dial 100, the number climbed to a whopping 70,000. “Many were asking how to reach their native place, as they are stuck in Hyderabad,” an officer said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/crossing-3-km-radius-to-attract-challans/article31166781.ece
294,2020/03/25,Policemen go beyond the call of their duties,"Migrant labourers making the long trek to their home town are provided lunch and transport

Coronavirus has had an indirect affect on families of Bimppa and Narayana from Kangti mandal of Narayanakhed, residing in the city.

About 15 families comprising 40 members from Narayanakhed constituency limits have been living at Hydernagar, Kukatpally and Kukatpally Housing Board (KPHB) Colony in the city as daily wage labourers and making a living.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced one-day Janata Curfew on March 22, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced that lockdown will be there till the end of this month. For the past three days, from Sunday onwards, they have no work to do. Like many others, they thought that the situation would improve and become normal from April 1.

But the announcement made by Mr. Modi that lockdown would continue for three weeks from midnight of Tuesday has dashed their hopes. They are sure that they would not get work till April 15 in the given circumstances. Already, the money they have saved is draining day by day. Waiting for three more weeks without any earning is a herculean task for them. Hence, they were forced to return back to their native villages.

As the transport was also closed they could not find any alternative to reach their homes. About 40 members, including 10 children and 10 women, started walking from Kukatpally. They started walking on Wednesday morning and reached Sangareddy by afternoon.

Moved by their plight, D. Venkatesh, Circle Inspector, Sangareddy (Town), has provided food and water to them and arranged even a vehicle to drop them at their native places.

“The companies we are working were closed and there was no work for us. Hence we were forced to return back,” Mr Bimappa said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hm6z4i/article31166746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26LUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/policemen-go-beyond-the-call-of-their-duties/article31166748.ece

Before lockdown the papers used to come by 3 a.m., but now it has been advanced by an hour. However, some boys have skipped their duties as parents are not allowing them to deliver newspapers due to rumours that papers also can carry coronavirus. Some subscribers are also calling the agent not to supply papers till further notice. They want to have papers only after carona is over.

In the past, the paper agents used to sell papers in counters and now they are completely closed, thereby piling up papers. Milkman M Raghu has a different experience.

296,2020/03/25,Karimnagar police go about their duties with a sense of pride,"They are putting in extra efforts to contain coronavirus in the town where 10 infected Indonesians roamed about freely

As COVID-19 spreads in the town with 10 Indonesian preachers testing positive and another local, who moved closely with them also testing positive, the district police are playing a crucial role in combating the pandemic by risking their lives.

It was the district police who first identified the Indonesian preachers roaming in the town and shifted them to Gandhi Hospital on March 17 where the doctors confirmed that all the 10 tested COVID-19 positive. Later on March 18, the police shifted around 10 others including a Special Branch constable to Gandhi Hospital for moving closely with the Indonesians.

Following the spurt in the virus-positive cases, the district launched a special drive to identify the persons who were closely associated and moved with the Indonesians during their stay in Karimnagar town, and started shifting them to the isolation ward. During the process, one of the persons who were moving with the Indonesians was tested positive.

Since then, it has become a herculean task for the police to identify the suspected persons and shift them to the isolation wards and quarantines. A total of 90 persons from the town, mostly from Mukarampura locality, have been quarantined by the police by nabbing them from their houses. Now, since Sunday almost the entire police force is on the roads to enforce curfew and lockdown to check the spread of virus without even the basic requirements such as water and food, following the total closure of the town.

“I am really very proud to work during the lockdown period to control the deadly COVID-19 virus which is reigning terror in the world,” said Ch Deva Reddy, Inspector Karimnagar Two Town police station. Incidentally, Mukarampura falls in his jurisdiction where the police had sealed off all the localities preventing the residents from coming out of the area to avoid the spread of virus.

“I had done several bandobust duties. But doing the lockdown duty was really patriotic,” he said and added, “However, my family members are worried about the spread of the disease as we are working 24 x 7 since Sunday.” Expressing similar views, SI Chandrashekhar said that we are working for the cause of society to check the spread of disease. But, the people are coming on to the roads risking their lives and violating the lockdown, he stated.

The constabulary staff said that they do not have masks or gloves, but are doing the duty as it was a health emergency. “We don’t have food and water.

297,2020/03/25,"In three languages, the ‘no entry’ message is clear","Villagers make evident their need for isolation

Often, adversities reveal the intellect of people hailing from the poor backward rural backgrounds, which is what happened at Samaka (Mathuraguda) village in Indervelli mandal. Like many other villages in the district, the residents also put up a sign board barring entry of outsiders in view of the COVID-19 scare and need for isolation but, this one drives home the point like no other.

The sign board is written in Telugu, Hindi and English in tune with the three-language formula in education in the State. Not all villagers are as conversant in English as they are in Telugu or Hindi.

“It was written in three languages so that the message gets across clearly even if someone who speaks English comes here. There are a few people in villages in this mandal and our relatives who work in foreign countries and are conversant in English who are likely to be our visitors,” observed Tagre Vijay, a youngster involved in the activity.

The credit of implementing the three-language formula, if one can call it so, goes to village sarpanch Madavi Sheku. “It was he who suggested that no one should remain ignorant of what is being said through the sign board,” Mr. Vijay added.

The self-imposed isolation is taking place in all the 17 rural mandals in Adilabad district.

298,2020/03/25,Telangana issues guidelines for COVID-19 lockdown,"People movement restricted to 3 km from their houses; prices of essential commodities to be monitored on a daily basis; violators will be booked under PD Act

After announcing curfew from 7 pm to 6 am till March 31, the State government has asked senior police officials to create awareness among people about complying with rules, failing which harsher conditions could follow.

Chief Secretary (CS) Somesh Kumar asked District Collectors, Commissioners/Superintendents of Police to hold joint press conferences in their respective jurisdictions to request citizens to cooperate so that the necessity of imposing harsher restrictions and enforcement measures did not arise. “We are a democratic state and generally believe in self-discipline. However, if the system of present lockdown fails, it will lead to 24 hours curfew,” the CS said in a memorandum outlining instructions to be followed during the curfew.

At the same time, sarpanches and counsellors/corporators were directed to inform about the arrival of anyone from abroad immediately. They should be sensitized about the fact that non-reporting of persons from abroad in the month of March would lead to endangering the lives of their own people.

Warning to shops and establishments

The memorandum had strict warning to shops and establishments that would be kept open after 6 pm in violation of the guidelines. Officials concerned had been directed to close them immediately and initiate legal action against violators. Movement of people had been restricted to 3 km from their houses in Hyderabad and Collectors could consider imposing lesser limits depending on the size of the city.

Further, officials should ensure that the list of persons put in home quarantine was made available on Collector’s table so that their home quarantine could be monitored strictly. The GHMC and collectors of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal should play a key role in monitoring as 75 per cent of the foreign returnees were from these districts. Directions had been issued to them to collect their passports under proper acknowledgement and return them once their quarantine period was over.

Escaping home quarantine

The direction assumes significance in the light of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s dissatisfaction that some persons were trying to escape from home quarantine. Officials were directed to ensure that supply chain of essential services was not disturbed and the price of all essential commodities should be monitored on a daily basis. “Wherever violators are found, they should be booked under the Preventive Detention Act,” the instructions said.

While permission was granted for continuing agricultural operations and irrigation works, the CS wanted officials concerned to ensure farmers did not throng market yards for selling their produce. Procurement Centres should be increased and the agriculture produce procured at the village itself by the Agriculture Extension Officers.

Avoid mass gatherings

The directions also said suitable locations should be identified to avoid mass congregations, and account details of farmers collected so that money could be directly transferred into their accounts.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9ejd5s/article31161903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-25-at-32303-PMjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/comply-with-lockdown-rules-to-avoid-24-hour-curfew/article31161412.ece
299,2020/03/25,Many apartment complexes in Hyderabad stop delivery of newspapers fearing COVID-19 spread,"The World Health Organisation says the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes coronavirus from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low

Despite online editions, a hard copy of a newspaper is still preferred by many along with their morning cuppa or brew for their day’s start.

Yet social distancing and lock down has seen many citizens, more so those living in apartment complexes and gated communities to do away with the delivery of newspapers at their door step, for the time being.

Milk and veggies washable

While there are no restrictions on the delivery of other essential goods like milk, vegetables, etc. because they say milk packets and vegetables can be washed thoroughly, thus there is no risk of the virus spreading.

In the wake of reports and rumours that coronavirus may stay on surface of paper, cardboard for several hours - though there is no concrete evidence - managing committees of several residential welfare associations have decided not to allow newspaper delivery men into their complexes and gated communities just to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus.

WHO says its safe

But here is a myth shatterer. On whether it was safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported, the World Health Organisation (WHO) answered: “The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.”

Mr. Dhruv , a resident of a gated community, says newspapers are part of essential service and they need to be be allowed. In the absence of newspapers, one will be forced to depend on social media from where all kinds of rumours too get forwarded creating confusion and to keep newspapers away is one such suggestion doing rounds in the social media. “The delivery boys could be asked to drop the papers at a designated place and leave without going to every door step in a residential complex as an alternative,” he says.

Doubting Thomases

But not every resident concurs. Mr. Raman, another resident says every newspaper has an online edition to get authentic news. In these extraordinary times, one should be prepared for some disruption in routine life.

“There is nothing wrong in being extra cautious and avoid physical newspapers that will be brought from outside by various persons who may or may not be carriers of virus. Let’s read newspapers online for the next few weeks,” Mr Raman says.

Delivery boys beaten up

Meanwhile, newspaper agents and vendors too are facing problems. “Our delivery boys are being stopped and beaten up by police for being on the roads,” he said. This, despite the government announcing that newspapers are modes of credible communication and information to reach the public.

Executives of newspaper organisations who were on the city’s roads to ensure distribution at key pick up points up too had to taste the high-handed behaviour of police, a news agent said. Another agent said they stopped delivery to some residential complexes as they were asked to suspend distribution by the representatives of residential welfare associations. “We are helpless,” he said.

Doctor’s advice

Precautions at a personal level are must, according to K.K. Aggarwal, past national president of the Indian Medical Association. “Newspapers are like any other item or material. Take clothes for instance or books. Viruses can stay on any surfaces. So what can you do? Wash your hands before and after reading newspapers or books,” he adviced.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gwsaqi/article31156434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-newspapers-news-papers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/many-city-apartment-complexes-and-gated-communities-suspend-newspaper-delivery/article31159976.ece
300,2020/03/25,TS power utilities want AP to toe one-man panel modalities,"They want to implement add-on report too, provided AP follows guidelines

In an effort to resolve the prolonging issue of division of the State-cadre employees that has been opened up again by the Justice Dharmadhikari Committee with the issuance of its supplementary report on March 11 amicably, the managements of four Telangana power utilities have decided to take all the 584 employees relieved by Andhra Pradesh utilities, provided they comply with the modalities.

Irrespective of the agitation launched by the Telanagana State Power Employees Joint Action Committee demanding the managements not to allow those relieved by the AP utilities join duties in Talangana, the managements have offered an olive branch to the AP managements purely with an aim to settle the matter as early as possible. However, they want the managements of AP utilities to work out the details of 584 relieved employees and send the list of those who comply with the modality number five of the guidelines issued by the one-man committee.

In response to clarification sought by the managements of Telangana power utilities on the supplementary report of March 11, the Dharmadhikari Committee issued clarification on March 14. The clarification clearly states that AP managements have to relieve employees to Telangana by following modality number five of the guidelines and after excluding 1,157 employees already allocated, 242 self-relieved employees from AP allowed to join in Telangana and 71 other special category staff out of 2,165.

Officials of the Telangana power utilities stated that fifth modality of the guidelines finalised by the Supreme Court appointed committee for allocation of the State-cadre employees between the two States last year clearly specify the criteria of home district and option exercised by the 2,165 employees should be taken into consideration while allocating the employees. The supplementary report of the Dharmadhikari Committee also comes with a rider to complete allocation following the modalities, they said.

“We have no objection whatsoever to allow the employees relieved by AP to join duties provided they comply with the modalities of the Dharmadhikari Committee. If all the 584 employees relieved by AP following the supplementary report comply with the modality number-five we will have no hesitation to allow them join the duties here,” Chairman and Managing Director of TSGenco and TSTransco D. Prabhakar Rao told The Hindu when contacted.

However, Mr. Rao adds that it is for the AP utilities to work out the details of the 584 employees by following the said modality. “They (AP managements) appear to have acted in haste by relieving the 584 employees without taking into consideration the one-man committee guidelines,” he felt.

“We want to implement the one-man committee report in toto as it’s as good as the judgement of the Supreme Court. But, the allocation/relieving of employees has to be done by following the modalities finalised and agreed upon by the two sides,” the CMD said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eqvkem/article31159747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25PEBAKARRAAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-power-utilities-want-ap-to-toe-one-man-panel-modalities/article31159748.ece

A 20-year-old foreign returnee was booked by Madhapur police of Cyberabad on Tuesday for violation of the mandatory home quarantine rule.

He returned from Australia five days ago and was prescribed self-quarantine by the health department officials.

According to police, he was caught with his parents during a vehicle check at Cyber Tower junction, after which they noticed a home quarantine stamp on his hand.

“As he was also found sick and coughing, suspecting it to be COVID-19 infection, we shifted him to Gandhi Hospital for further tests. Presently, he is in the isolation ward,” he said.

302,2020/03/25,Lockdown deals deadly blow to kidney patients,"Complaints of lack of transport, police brutality galore

Several patients of chronic illnesses from city and outside are stuck between the devil and the deep sea, owing to the current lockdown in the State to arrest COVID-19 spread.

By the very nature of their respective ailments, they need to visit the hospital often, but are unable to do so now owing to lack of transport and the overzealous police quick to strike with their batons.

Especially suffering in the current situation are kidney patients requiring dialysis on alternates day. Several on dialysis are bitterly complaining about the attitude of the police against them.

Ramu (name changed), whose both parents were on dialysis, took them to hospital on Monday around 3 p.m. After dropping them, he was returning when the police charged at him and thrashed him. “They did not wait for any explanation before beating. I could not muster courage to go back to the hospital to pick them up, and asked them to come by autorickshaw,” he said.

Even auto drivers were not spared. Manorama, another patient, related her horrific experience when her auto was accosted by the police. “I was travelling from Balanagar to my hospital in Ameerpet along with my mother when the police stopped us. Before I could explain, they started beating the auto driver. I tried to show my nodule-ridden hand, but they were very rude to me. One constable was demanding that I, a patient, stand up and pay respect before talking to his DSP,” she narrated.

Sudhakar (name changed), one more patient on dialysis, was stranded at the hospital along with his wife on Tuesday, as his regular auto driver was thrashed by the police after dropping them off, and never returned to pick them up.

Dialysis is a life-saving procedure for patients with acute, as well as chronic kidney disease (CKD), as it brings down the high creatinine levels in their bodies, say doctors.

“If not for dialysis, fluid accumulation in body parts such as hands and legs can cause distress, and the same in lungs will result in respiratory problems,” said a government doctor.

Apart from kidney patients, others who require regular visits to hospitals are those suffering from leukemia and lymphoma. “Patients suffering from Leukemia require supportive treatment like blood transfusion, antibiotics and therapy besides chemotherapy. Those with lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, need chemotherapy. Other cancer patients might suffer from health complications which may necessitate admission into hospitals. This could be decided after consulting doctors. But they might need to travel for the purpose,” said an oncologist at a government hospital.

Several patients from outside travel to Hyderabad for dialysis too, says another senior doctor from a government tertiary care hospital. “We have asked such patients to approach hospitals closer home. For people suffering from cardiac problems and diabetes, we are issuing medicines for a month,” the doctor said.

‘Transport required’

Mamatha, founder-president of the Welfare Association for Kidney Patients, has urged the government to make special transport arrangements for those in need of dialysis. While private transport is a problem owing to the lockdown, lack of public transport is affecting a large number of poor patients, she said.

“Of the 18,000 patients getting dialysis done at about 80 centres in the city, 10,000 are covered by Arogyasri scheme, which means that they all are below poverty line. Lack of public transport affects their health,” she noted.

‘Allowed from today’

Responding to the issues faced by dialysis patients, Special Chief Secretary to the Health and Family Welfare department A. Santhi Kumari said they will be allowed to visit hospitals without restrictions from Wednesday.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said that if someone has to travel from one place to another due to an unseen emergency, they can dial 100. Officials will make necessary arrangements, including vehicles, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lockdown-deals-deadly-blow-to-kidney-patients/article31157263.ece

Muslim scholars and faith leaders, cutting across schools of thought, met on Tuesday and issued a statement directing the devout to pray at home.

The collective met at Islamic seminary Jamia Nizamia, where leading doctors from Care Hospital, Nampally, Virinchi Hospital, Banjara Hills and Owaisi Hospital, informed them about the seriousness of COVID-19.

They then held deliberations on the next course of action with respect to congregation in mosques. In a collective statement issued to the media, the Jamia Nizamia, led by its chancellor Mufti Khaleel Ahmed, said, “Muslims are advised in the current circumstances and as a precautionary measure, to give priority to praying at home. God willing, they will not be considered as those who have missed prayers. If they pray at home it does not mean they have missed prayers. It will be considered as congregational prayers.”

On Monday, Islamic scholar and All India Muslim Personal Law Board office-bearer Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani issued a list of seven recommendations, one of which stated that Friday prayers should have a congregation of no more than five persons.

307,2020/03/25,Surgeons’ body seeks govt. directive to protect healthcare personnel,"The Association of Surgeons of India on Tuesday offered various suggestions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday to staying prepared to fight COVID-19.

The suggestions include the need to protect healthcare personnel and train them in using the Personal Protection Equipment. The association said the directive for implementing the suggestions given to fight COVID-19 should come for the government of India for their enforcement.

Association president P. Raghu Ram highlighted that since healthcare professionals were at the front lines in the war against COVID-19, training of all healthcare workers, irrespective of their specialty, in using the Personal Protection Equipment and ABCs in dealing with patients, must be undertaken in this week. He said a large number of healthcare workers were expected to be infected and some would even lose their lives while treating patients. In China, close to 4,000 healthcare professionals have been infected and a few have died.

He said there must be a directive from the government to protect the rights of doctors, nurses and ward boys working in small and medium hospitals and protecting their leave, pay and jobs as some hospitals were laying off staff due to a slump in number of patients. In some districts like Warangal, junior doctors living in rented homes were being asked to vacate by landlords over fears that they might be infected.

309,2020/03/25,COVID-19 | Lock down leads to lesser pollution in Hyderabad,"Current pollution values are way below Air Quality Index standards

A clearer and blue sky has been greeting citizens of Hyderabad over the past few days as the emergency lockdown due to COVID-19 is being enforced with rigour.

Perhaps for the first time in years, the pollution values observed in the five weather monitoring stations in the city were way below the Air Quality Index standards set by the government of India. As vehicles stayed off the road and workshops and factories were shut down, chemical pollution in the form of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone also showed low values.

The respirable suspended particulate matter pollution too dipped below the standard values. On Tuesday afternoon at the Bahadurpura monitoring station, the PM2.5 was 41.06 ug/m3 way below the standard 60 ug/m3 which was the value observed in March 2019. Sulphur dioxide, a major pollutant and byproduct of diesel combustion, was recorded at 1.86 ug/m3; way below the standard of 40 ug/m3.

A similar dip was noticed in the levels of ozone which was recorded at 28.41 ug/m3 much below the standard of 80, and was 33.2 ug/m3 for the same period in 2019.

At the Patancheru monitoring station, a similar dip in pollution is being noticed. The PM2.5 value is nearly half the standard at 30 ug/m3. NO2 levels dipped to 3.5 as against the standard of 80 and last year’s average in March of 27.2. However, sulphur dioxide levels remained elevated at 11.2 ug/m3 as against 9.6 ug/m3 in March 2019 and the standard of 40 ug/m3.

Ozone is 19 ug/m3 against the standard of 180ug/m3 and last year’s level of 27.2 ug/m3.

“With a drop in the pollution level due to the lockdown, it was amazing to finally see some stars in the sky tonight, especially the Orion Belt with its three stars Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka,” tweeted Mohammad Habib with photos as evidence.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8emf5m/article31156958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24-SKY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-lock-down-leads-to-lesser-pollution-in-hyderabad/article31156951.ece

312,2020/03/25,At home with music,"Sharing playlists, recommending albums, digging out old vinyl records and compact discs, and exploring online platforms have obviously increased around the world, with many people locked at home following the corona virus outbreak.

In India, like in many other regions, one also saw many musicians recording directly from home and streaming online.

Exploring the spectrum

The music community has been badly hit by the developments, with concerts being cancelled, recording schedules going haywire and organisers working from home. Still, a few attempts were made to transport music through the online medium. Exploring different genres, I found some interesting work in Hindustani classical music, Carnatic music, solo independent musicians and DJ sets. Since these styles require a minimum number of people, it was relatively easy, unlike a rock band or even a film music orchestra.

Artists United, an initiative by sarod player Abhishek Borkar and art lover Shripad Bhalerao, organised a daily festival of classical music and dance. The artistes would record from home, and though some were hindered because they couldn't get a tabla and harmonium player to travel for the recital, put up some fantastic performances, relayed live on Facebook.In the few days leading up to Tuesday March 24, one saw some good vocal performances by Gulamfarid Vohra, who sang raag Maru Bihag, Anuratn Rai on Ahir Bhairav and Nat Bhairav, Meenal Mategaonkar on Multani and Pooja Athavale Bakre on Sawani. Violinist Sunita Bhuyan was joined on keyboards by her son Ronojit Bhuyan, and Sachin Patwardhan played raag Shree on the Spanish veena, an adaptation of the electric guitar.

Closer connect

One hasn't seen many of these musicians and dancers at major music festivals. As such, this was a wonderful opportunity to reach out to their core audience. Besides this festival, other known musicians relayed live on Facebook and Instagram. These included ghazal singer Gayatri Asokan, Sufi singer Sonam Kalra and tabla exponent Anuradha Pal.

In Carnatic music, pianist Anil Srinivasan organised the Janatha Curfew Online Festival on March 22. Like the Artists United event, this one saw some enormous young talent. There were also some established names like veena exponent Jayanthi Kumaresh, vocalist Sikkil Gurucharan and flautist Shashank. I caught Shashank's appearance and he played snippets from various raags from Kirwani and Charukeshi to Dwijawanti and Salaga Bhairavi.

In total contrast to the classical streams, I tuned in to DJ Russell's live sets on Facebook and the app Streo. We're more used to hear him spin some retro pop, rock and Bollywood at Bandra's Door No 1, but on this show he played house music, hip-hop, reggae and smooth jazz, streamed straight from his residence. Really cool stuff.

When I wasn't checking out these live online streams, I went through some interesting new music on the digital platforms. Recommended are pop singer Mandy Moore’s comeback album Silver Landings, electronic producer Cerrone's latest release DNA, some numbers from A.R. Rahman's forthcoming 99 Songs, Bengaluru rock band Thermal And A Quarter's A World Gone Mad and independent singer Osho Jain's EP Wahaan.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/k1gtaj/article31167240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANILSRINIVASANANDPIANO,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/at-home-with-music/article31167241.ece
313,2020/03/25,When the drums fall silent: Percussionists finding it tough in the times of lockdown,"The virus outbreak has turned the lives of many of the artistes topsy-turvy

Melam, panchavadyam and thayambaka have long been associated with the rhythm of Kerala. However, except for a privileged few, artistes associated with the traditional temple arts have had it rough when compared to their fellow musicians in tinsel world or elsewhere. Once upon a time, even some of the best-known percussionists in the field used to lead a hand-to-mouth existence despite their busy schedules during the performance season that stretches from October to May.

However, in less than a quarter of a century, both career graphs and income of percussionists and artistes who play traditional musical instruments such as kuzhal, kompu and elathalam (cymbals) registered an upgrading thanks to a sizeable increase in the number of temple festivals. As they gained visibility, their stature grew as well. As collective ensembles, melam and panchavadyam ensure work and wages for a considerable number of artistes. Even for thayambaka, a highly individualised solo recital on the chenda, support from other musicians on the chenda and the elathalam are a must.

According to thayambaka maestro Kallekulangara Achuthankutty, playing the instruments is much more than just a way of life for many of his fellow musicians; it is a form of self-expression. And lesser-known percussionists put in just as much effort into their performance as that of their helmsmen. Although there is a noticeable difference in the degree of recognition they receive, unlike that of renowned drummers such as Mattannoor Sankarankutty Marar or Peruvanam Kuttan Marar, others do earn a consistent income to support their families during the festival season. Some kompu and elathalam players residing in rural areas, however, work as painters or autorickshaw drivers during the off-season to supplement their income.

Now, the Coronavirus outbreak has turned the lives of many of the artistes topsy-turvy. As annual temple festivals stand cancelled, a pall of gloom has descended upon them. A video-footage of a Coronavirus-infected tourist from Europe socialising with the gathering at this year’s Kuttanalloor Pooram has sent shock-waves through the community of artistes and rasikas.

“Due to the outbreak, Peruvanam and Aarattupuzha poorams, both in Thrissur district, which would have been held in April, will be confined to minimal rituals inside the temples. If this scenario continues, the Thrissur Pooram will most likely not be held,” says melam maestro Peruvanam Kuttan Marar.

Institutional training is almost unheard of for temple percussionists. Their training has always been informal, following the lines of the age-old guru-shishya parambara. Sans institutional or individual patronage, indigenous percussionists do not find it easy.

“Even some of the front-ranking percussionists are unable to cope with the new crisis. For instance, eminent thimila player Parakkad Thankappa Marar and his wife, Dhanalakshmi, are under medication for certain health issues. Their sons are well-known thimila players but the annulment of the temple festivities have put the family in a financial crisis,” says Kodakara Ramesh, secretary, Kerala KshetraVadya Kala Academy.

Mayannoor Gopalakrishnan has been a constant presence in most of the famed melams as a valamthala player for years. He says: “I don’t have any other source of income. I have no idea how to deal with this testing time.” Kombu player Pazhambalakode Ramakrishnan was looking forward to the melams in the months of April and May, so that he could save up for the monsoon. Puthukkad Vijayan, an elathalam player in melams and panchavadyam, has been struggling to reconstruct his house for several years. Now living in a rented apartment with his family, he has no words to express his disappointment.

Says Achuthankutty: “Perhaps, artistes attached to the temples under the Malabar Devaswom Board are the most affected. They have no steady income. Annual festival programmes held in these temples are the only major source of income for them. With the festivals called off, they have nothing to fall back on.”

With the looming economic crisis, the fate of such freelance artistes are grim. Kuttan Marar suggests that the government introduce special interest-free, long-term loans for the artistes. Even if the pandemic is contained in the near future, it is doubtful if the festivals will be held this year. Several talented melam artistes are staring at gloomy prospects till the flag goes up for festivals next year.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/j1mww6/article31161288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVFMELAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/percussionists-and-musicians-of-melams-are-finding-it-tough-to-sustain-their-livelihood-as-temples-cancel-all-festivities-to-stop-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus/article31161289.ece
314,2020/03/25,Future uncertain for women workforce in Kochi,"Livelihood of around 5 lakh domestic helps in jeopardy

The COVID-19 scare has shut the doors on the livelihood of nearly five lakh domestic helps in the State.

While some residents’ associations of apartment complexes in Kochi have formally asked the women workforce to stay away, the shutting down of the public transport system has further cut the job avenues of thousands of others.

Kochi is considered to be the largest employer of domestic helps in the State. It is estimated that around two lakh women earn their living by working as domestic helps in apartment complexes, houses, high-rises, and hospitals in the city. Besides housekeeping, they also engage themselves as cooks and care givers at homes and institutions.

Women from suburbs like Vypeen, Kadamakkudi, Pizhala, Panangad, Kalamassery, and Aluva used to commute to the city and back to earn a living. While most of them were paid between ₹250 and ₹350 for a day’s work, others engaged in shops and offices used to get up to ₹4,000 a month.

It is more than a week since Thankamany Prasad, 62, from Pizhala has gone for work as the shop that employed her has downed shutters. Besides the attendant’s job at the shop, she used to double up as part-time help at a home in the city. “With no bus services, how will I reach the city? No one has spoken about wages of days on which I could not turn up for work,” she lamented. The National Empress Garden Owners’ Association, Vennala, has asked its nearly 20 women helps not to come for work until further notice. The association took the decision as a precautionary measure in the wake of reports of the spread of the disease, said Boban George, its president.

At the same time, the association has permitted some families with aged members to engage workers at their own risk, he added.

Regarding wages, Mr. George said a decision was yet to be taken.

Half the women who used to work at Lotus Garden Apartments, Thripunithura, have not been reporting since Monday, though Lotus Garden Welfare Association has not asked anyone to abstain from work, said S. Krishnan Nair, its president. The association has decided to hire an autorickshaw to pick and drop the two workers to run its bio-waste management facility, he added.

While some families have graciously offered to give full pay for its helps, uncertainty looms over the lives of several others in the absence of any such assurances.

“Earlier,” said a woman who worked as cleaning staff at a city college, “the management used to deduct wages for the days on which we were absent. Since the outbreak, they have asked us not to come. Yet, they have not communicated on the salary for the days lost,” she added.

Sonia George, State secretary of Self-Employed Women’s Association, Kerala, urged employers and families to pay at least half the salary to workers during the time of crisis. With no job and income, women helps are heading for a crisis, said Ms. George.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/future-uncertain-for-women-workforce-in-kochi/article31168113.ece

317,2020/03/25,Budget passed in Opposition councillors’ absence,"LDF members skip meet citing restrictions due to COVID-19 spread

In a move that the Opposition termed “undemocratic”, the Kochi Corporation budget was passed on Wednesday in the absence of all Opposition councillors.

Left Democratic Front (LDF) councillors boycotted the council meeting on Wednesday citing COVID-19-related restrictions on large gatherings.

“The corporation budget was supposed to be discussed on Wednesday, and another council meeting was scheduled for Thursday to get it passed.

“But the budget, which does not have the Opposition’s approval, was passed undemocratically on Wednesday itself, taking advantage of the UDF’s majority,” said V.P. Chandran, LDF Parliamentary party secretary.

Leader of the Opposition K.J. Antony had asked Mayor Soumini Jain to postpone discussion on the budget in the light of the national lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. “But the request was not heeded, and the meeting was held anyway. People’s representatives themselves cannot violate restrictions on large gatherings. Besides, public transport is also not available,” Mr. Chandran said. The two BJP councillors also did not attend the meeting.

Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar, who presented the budget on Monday, said a quorum of one-third of the 74-member council’s strength was enough to hold a council meeting. Since all the 37 UDF councillors were present, the meeting went ahead, and the budget was passed without any changes. The budget had to be passed by March 31 in order to be able to use the civic body’s funds after the current financial year, he added.

After the budget was presented on Monday, Opposition councillors had alleged that it had merely repeated projects mooted over the years, and that little was proposed to augment the corporation’s dwindling finances. Sufficient funds had not been allotted to repair roads or resolve waterlogging issues, they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/budget-passed-in-opposition-councillors-absence/article31167400.ece
318,2020/03/25,A once-in-a-lifetime experience for cops who ran control room,"The 62-member police team served as the first line of assistance to inbound passengers till the closure of airport on Tuesday midnight

In his short career spanning just six years, M.S. Faizal, Nedumbassery Sub Inspector, was never assigned anything remotely similar to the task he and his colleagues were entrusted with in the last 10 days.

Along with the Health and medical teams, the 62-member police team that manned the special COVID-19 control room at the Cochin international airport soldiered on, serving as the first line of assistance to inbound passengers from across the country and abroad till the airport was completely shut down on Tuesday midnight.

“It was unlike any experience before. We had to deal with passengers from highly infected countries just hoping that a mask, a pair of gloves, and the frequent application of sanitisers will keep us safe. We might have interacted with over 50,000 passengers during that 10-day window considering that on an average 2,000 domestic passengers and 3,000 international passengers passed through the airport a day,” said Mr. Faizal.

The police set up the special control room at the airport on March 14 shortly after the second wave of infection was reported in the State. A pool of 30 personnel were drawn from the Muvattupuzha and Perumbavoor sub-divisions of the rural police, and they were split into two teams of 15 members each to run the control room round the clock. Mr. Faizal and Edathala Sub Inspector Aby George were put in charge of the control room. Reji Abraham, DySP, District Crime Records Bureau, and Madhu Babu, Anti-Narcotics DySP, monitored the functioning of the control room under the guidance of District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik.

Besides, 15 members from the Kerala Armed Forces First Battalion under the supervision of Commandant Vaibhav Saxena were roped in for collating data.

“The control room passed on the list of people to be put on home quarantine to the District Police Chiefs concerned who collated it and sent to the local police stations for monitoring compliance with quarantine,” said Mr. Faizal.

Police personnel used to line up along the terminal exits, guiding people on the dos and don’ts on their travel back home and the need for strictly complying with the home quarantine protocol.

“Initially, it was tough convincing people. For instance, some passengers insisted on occupying the front seat alongside the driver despite being advised to sit in the back seat,” recalled Mr. George.

Mr. Faizal said the three days leading up to the ban on international services on March 22 were the most challenging as the flow of passengers had really surged.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/8l7wce/article31167369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-KI-AIRPORTjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-once-in-a-lifetime-experience-for-cops-who-ran-control-room/article31167370.ece

320,2020/03/25,‘Lockdown hearts’ open up to police,"Overwhelming response to Kerala Police’s social media initiative

“Feeling lonely in the lockdown? We are with you 24/7... together we can share our thoughts, ideas, emotions, expressions, suggestions....”

No sooner had the Kerala Police put up such a flyer in their official Facebook page on Wednesday morning than their official FB messenger was literally flooded with messages.

“We posted the flyer around 9 a.m. and since then messages are just pouring in at the rate of hundreds in a single minute. So much so that all three of us on shift at the police social media cell could hardly cope with and respond to all the messages. We may have to think of putting up more systems if the flow of messages continue at this pace,” said P.S. Santhosh, a civil police officer manning the police social media cell.

The torrential flow of messages have prompted the three staff off the duty to support their colleagues from their homes.

Messages dripping with all kinds of emotions ranging from the anxious and humorous to outright funny are pouring in thick and fast.

“People are even sharing contact numbers of their family members who are itching to go out asking us to ‘threat’ them so that they stay put inside the home. We have made a few such ‘threatening’ calls as well. Another person was so bored sitting idle at home that he wanted to step out for a beer and we told him that it wasn’t such a bright idea,” said Mr. Santhosh.

A man who was frustrated on not being able to go to the library was so elated when the police shared with him an online link of 50-odd books. Some wanted to know whether they will get beaten up while there were others who wanted the police to suggest them good movies and even use their influence to make local cable network providers to telecast good films to amuse people forced indoors.

“We are also getting many messages from anxious Malayalis stranded in places like Bengaluru and Mumbai while a few expatriate Malayalis wanted us to check the wellbeing of their family. In some cases, we have even contacted the local police stations to make those checks. Panic-stricken people with symptoms similar to COVID-19 want to know whether they were infected and we shared with them a document detailing about the symptoms of the epidemic,” said Mr. Santhosh.

321,2020/03/25,More come up with freemeal offer to the destitute,"YMCA backs free lunch scheme of Kalamasserry Janamaithri Police

Impressed by the initiative of the Kalamasserry Janamaithri Police to serve free lunch to the destitute living in the street hit hard by the 21-day nationwide lockdown, YMCA Kalamasserry has come forward to support the programme by supplying free meals.

To begin with, the organisation has committed to deliver 50 meal packets on Thursday and further supplement it if need be.

“I found the report in The Hindu about the initiative and was really touched following which I straight away contacted the police station asking them what kind of support they need. They asked for 50 meals for Thursday, which I agreed to in consultations with the board members of YMCA,” said Johnson K. Paulose, president, Kalamasserry YMCA.

The organisation has given the order for the meals at a vegetarian hotel in the neighbourhood, from where the police will collect it. “We have committed to continue the support throughout the lockdown period and are confident that our 500-odd members will only be willing to support the initiative by providing even more food packets, if needed,” said Mr. Paulose.

The Kalamasserry police distributed over 100 meals for the second consecutive day on Wednesday as every police personnel on duty at the station continued to bring five meals each as part of the initiative.

Meanwhile, more police stations and voluntary organisations are coming forward with similar initiatives. “We helped an organisation that sought our help to distribute the meals since they were unable to move around owing to the restrictions in place in the wake of the lockdown,” said Kiran C. Nair, Station House Officer, Kadavanthra.

322,2020/03/25,Firemen join Corona battle,"They focus on disinfecting public places to ensure hygiene

The 500-odd firemen in Ernakulam are on their toes since the COVID-19 turned pandemic. They are busy disinfecting the public places to check the spread of Coronavirus in the district. Various local bodies are seeking their help to sanitise the sensitive areas under their jurisdiction.

“Maradu municipality authorities had approached us to carry out decontamination work of the public spots under the civic body. We have been receiving many such calls from various places. However, our main focus is disinfecting public places to ensure hygiene and cleanliness,” said G.S. Gogy, District Fire Officer.

The 536 firemen under 18 fire stations in Ernakulam are engaged in the cleaning work. “We sprayed disinfectant liquid at the District Jail in Kakkanad, railway stations, KSRTC bus stations, and hospitals as part of the initiative. Special attention has been given to public places like hospitals,” he said.

The firemen sprayed disinfectants at high pressure using hoses attached to the fire tender vehicles. The main objective was to disinfect visibly dirty surfaces in the public places selected for the cleaning up work. The firemen took adequate care to protect themselves by wearing masks and other protective gear. The department had procured disinfectants as part of the preparations to meet any emergency situation.

Care was taken to wipe their hands using sanitisers after the operation. Firemen involved in the process said that they had disposable gloves and surgical masks as a precautionary health measure while participating in the cleaning up process. “We are following the guidelines issued by the government for protecting oneself in such a health scenario,” they said.

The pandemic situation has forced the district fire wing to cancel the leave and leave requests of its personnel. All the firemen have been asked to be on duty, considering the gravity of the situation. The movement of the firemen, especially those who are staying in other districts, was found risky and hence they were asked to stay safe at the stations. The authorities had taken steps to provide the essential items to the firemen at the 18 stations in the district.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mkhivw/article31166535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-KI-RAILWAYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/firemen-join-corona-battle/article31166536.ece

The Thrissur Corporation and the district administration have jointly arranged food, medicine and shelter for the destitute in the wake of lockdown.

A shelter was arranged at the Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School in the city on Wednesday. Around 200 people were shifted to the shelter.

Mayor Ajitha Jayarajan, Deputy Mayor Rafi Jose, and District Collector S. Shanavas led the efforts to convert the school to a temporary shelter facility.

“Kudumbasree Mission workers and voluntary organisations will arrange food for them. Currently food has been served for them from Viyyur jail,” the Mayor said.

Results negative

There are 12,462 people under observation for COVID-19 in the district as on Wednesday. Results of the five samples received on Wednesday were negative. There are 37 people under observation in various hospitals with COVID symptoms.

Meanwhile, the police and various departments have strengthened checking to enforce lockdown norms.

Of the 199 people reached by Dibrugarh-Kanyakumari Vivek Express in Thrissur railway station on Tuesday, 182 were shifted to a care centre arranged at KILA (Kerala Institute of Local Administration), Mulangunnathukavu, for observation.

324,2020/03/25,Passenger arrested on charge of non-cooperation at airport,"He allegedly abused officials verbally and refused to fill forms

A 54-year-old man created ruckus at the domestic arrival terminal of Cochin International Airport on Monday night as he refused to cooperate with the health officials on duty and abused them verbally.

Released on bail

The Nedumbassery police arrested him on a complaint lodged by a doctor on duty and registered a case invoking IPC Sections 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Later, he was released on bail.

The man, a resident of Elamkulam, had come from Chennai by a Spice Jet flight at 9.25 p.m. “He was asked to fill and sign two forms undertaking to go on a 14-day mandatory home quarantine applicable to those coming from outside the State. He, however, flew off the handle saying that he was fed up off signing affidavits. He also declined to wear the face mask despite the terminal being crowded with arrival of multiple flights. In fact, he threw away the mask given to him and had a go at the health officials. We have no idea why he acted the way he did,” said a health official who was on duty at that time.

The passenger also declined to maintain the queue, creating quite a discomfort for the majority of passengers who were complying with all instructions.

“The team on duty at that time checked in at 2 p.m. and was relieved only today at 10 a.m. We are polite with all passengers despite the immense stress and risk under which we are working. Such incidents will affect the morale of health officials,” the official said.

The medical team then alerted the police who took him into custody by which time the passenger had calmed down and was even apologetic. He was released on station bail.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/onbiyt/article31073806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOCHIAIRPORTKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/passenger-arrested-on-charge-of-non-cooperation-at-airport/article31159430.ece

The last departure was at 8.55 p.m. to Bengaluru by the same flight operator, airport sources said.

Health workers in 12 squads had been deployed at the airport to check passengers at the airport. The international terminal was closed to flight operations earlier this week in the wake of COVID-19 spread. However, the cargo terminal will be operated at the airport.

CIAL has clarified that a short video being circulated on social media, of employees of what looked like an airport engaged in leisurely activities, was not that of the airport here.

326,2020/03/25,Kalamassery police play Good Samaritan for the destitute,"Everyone on duty brings five packets of meals from home for distribution to street dwellers

Compassion may not a virtue easily associated with the police force.

But, the Kalamassery Janamaithri Police have proved that the men in khaki can be as compassionate and benevolent as any other by sparing a thought for the destitute in the streets hit hard by the lockdown.

Left to fend for themselves, these famished souls living along streets were fed by the police personnel from the Kalamassery station on Tuesday afternoon.

“We distributed lunch to over 100 such destitute people within our limits and we plan to continue with this initiative through the entire length of the lockdown,” said P.S. Reghu, a civil police officer who came up with the idea on Monday evening.

The idea had the wholehearted support of his colleagues when shared over their WhatsApp group. Thus, everyone who reported for duty at the station brought with them five meals each, which were distributed in a police jeep around 11 a.m.

“Most of them were aged and frail and some of them even suffered from mental ailments. We have our homes stocked with the necessary supplies to see us through this difficult period but without our benevolence and kindness, many of these unfortunate people were unlikely to survive this crisis,” said Mr. Reghu. A similar initiative was held in the city led by Assistant Commissioner of Police K. Laljy.

The possibility of cooking food within the station premises is also being explored though for the time being, the police personnel will continue to fall back on the food packs brought from their homes.

Besides, the Kalamasserry police are also planning to distribute masks, gloves and sanitisers to their colleagues across the city using contributions raised among themselves. Mr. Reghu has donated the reward of ₹5,000 he received recently from the City Police Commissioner for coming to the aid of a French woman and her little child who were brought to the Government Medical College, Kalamassery for COVID-19-like symptoms. She had also lost her wallet and other valuables. He not only solicited help in consultation with the French consulate but also arranged for her flight to Delhi besides tracking down her valuables and restoring them to the woman.

“Every COVID-19 patient in the district is to be brought to the Government Medical College at Kalamasserry, making our police station the most vulnerable. So, it is in our own interest that we do our best to check the spread of this epidemic,” said Mr. Reghu.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qj354p/article31157582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200324-WA0073,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kalamassery-police-play-good-samaritan-for-the-destitute/article31157583.ece
327,2020/03/25,Special police teams use hi-tech to enforce quarantine,"Five SP-level officers deployed as officers on special duty to coordinate activities in five districts

The State police have been pulling out all stops to keep track of all in-bound international travellers to Kerala since early March and to also strictly enforce quarantine norms using technology, in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The Malabar area is sharply in focus for the drive launched on Monday night in view of the extent of travel undertaken by a Kasaragod resident who defied home quarantine following his arrival from Dubai and tested positive for the virus later.

Five Superintendent-level officers have been deployed as officers on special duty to coordinate the pandemic-related activities in five districts – Kasaragod, Kannur, Malappuram, Kollam rural, and Thiruvananthapuram rural. This apart, a special four-member team led by Inspector General of Police Vijay Sakhare has been deployed exclusively for Kasaragod, considering the fluid condition there.

There have been 1.3 lakh overseas returnees to the State since March 1, but the special teams would be focusing on returnees from countries categorised as at a high-risk for COVID-19.

The passenger list accessed by the teams from the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of the State police shows that over 25,000 in-bound passengers during this period were from Malappuram followed by Kozhikode (15,000), Kannur (6,400) and Kasaragod (just over 2,000).

“The goal is to keep tabs on passengers from high-risk countries and to check quarantine violations,” K. Sethuraman, DIG, who who is coordinating COVID-19 containment activities for the police in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts.

Ashok Yadav, IGP, is coordinating the activities in Kannur.

Manoj Abraham, ADGP, Headquarters, said that the primary focus was on high risk countries as listed out by the Central government guidelines and included countries such as Italy and Iran. “However, this list keeps on changing as per the threat perception. Besides, the list of people can also be sourced from the medical screening conducted at airports,” he said.

The tracking down is mainly done with the help of three basic technologies, including verifying mobile tower location. The location history of these people could also be sourced from Google, which has agreed to it considering the present situation.

Geo-fencing technology, a location-based service to trigger a pre-programmed boundary so as to track breaches, is also being used for the purpose.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/y7vikf/article31149994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thevara-checking,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/special-police-teams-use-hi-tech-to-enforce-quarantine/article31157518.ece
328,2020/03/25,One more tests positive in city,"57-year-old woman, a close relative of Gulf returnee, was in home quarantine

One more person tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday in Kochi. The 57-year-old woman is a close relative of the COVID-19 patient who had tested positive on Sunday after returning from Dubai.

She was continuing under quarantine at home when she tested positive. She has been shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kalamassery.

The total number of positive persons under treatment in the district is now 17. Of these, seven are from the U.K. tourist group, four from the district, five from Kannur and one from Malappuram.

On Tuesday, 468 more persons were added to the list of those under home surveillance for suspected COVID-19 while 322 persons were removed from the list, taking the total to 4,347 people under surveillance.

There were also four persons who were moved to the hospital isolation facility after showing symptoms of COVID-19, two of them to the medical college hospital, Ernakulam, and the other two to the Muvattupuzha general hospital. Those under hospital isolation has gone up to 33, with 26 in medical college and seven in Muvattupuzha.

The taxi driver whose vehicle was hired by the COVID-19 patient on Sunday, was also found to have developed fever. Further, three more persons who had travelled in the same taxi were also traced and alerted.

The Health department has also identified 49 persons who were co-passengers of the person. They have been directed to stay in home quarantine.

329,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Life at an apartment complex in the time of lockdown,"Residents’ association is pulling out all the stops to make people’s stay comfortable

With 1,268 apartments split into 15 blocks and spread over 26 acres, the DLF New Town Heights at Kakkanad is easily one of the biggest apartment complexes not just in Kochi but in the entire State.

The challenge of managing a prolonged lockdown, therefore, is big with the residents’ welfare association giving top priority to waste management.

“Many residents have gone to their hometowns while there are a large number of retirees who are staying back. We have drawn up extensive plans to make their stay smooth and comfortable without having to venture out for anything,” said S. Anish, secretary of the association.

Initially, the plan was to retain all 38 housekeeping staff by deploying a vehicle for their conveyance in two shifts. But that plan went out of the window as soon as the District Collector clamped Section 144 in the district and put severe restrictions on all forms of transportation. So, the association contacted the agency concerned, which agreed to allocate 15 workers within walkable distance from the property for waste disposal who, for the time being, will also undertake housekeeping work. All apartment owners have been asked to suspend the services of maids, except those staying with families, till March 31.

‘Police to be alerted’

“Those who had recently travelled will have to restrict themselves to room quarantine and their extended families in home quarantine. On completion of quarantine, all of them will have to get themselves tested and submit the reports to the association. Guests, even apartment owners staying elsewhere, will have to produce the medical certificate failing which the police would be alerted,” said Mr. Anish.

Cleaning staff will be kept away from floors where people are remaining in quarantine and cleaning will be restricted to the lifts and lobby.

Apart from making available sanitisers at all entry points to ‘break the chain’, the association has engaged a special team to clean all door bars and knobs thrice a day considering that touching vulnerable surface is one of the easiest routes to infection. Enough supplies of gloves, masks, sanitisers and cleaning solutions have been sourced through wholesale dealers for distribution among the staff, including the team of 45 security guards. “We have also reached an understanding with super markets in the immediate neighbourhood to deliver essential items at door steps sparing the aged of having to go out to secure provisions,” said Mr. Anish.

Bolstering this is an ever increasing cluster of young volunteers who have agreed to help out the aged who are now restricted to their apartments in the wake of the lockdown. Their numbers have been circulated on all online and offline forums.

Delivery boys will have to drop supplies at the entry of all 15 blocks manned by security guards round-the-clock. Parcels will be kept in stilt for 24 hours before being handed over to residents. Guards will collect the name and contact number of delivery boys and alert apartment owners concerned through intercom about the delivery.

With social distancing being the norm, the association brainstorming now takes place over Telegram, WhatsApp and a paid chat application. “Since this is an unprecedented situation, we will have to improvise as we go on in dealing with it,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mhxdah/article31157495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25kiIMG-20200324-WA0081jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/life-at-an-apartment-complex-in-the-time-of-lockdown/article31157496.ece

331,2020/03/25,Offenders to be sent into 14-day quarantine,"Rural police arrest 30 persons, register 75 cases on Tuesday

People who roam around needlessly in defiance of the lockdown in Ernakulam rural police limits may be in for a rude shock.

For, the police are planning to send the offenders straightaway into 14-day quarantine. “If people loitering are stopped on the tracks come up with lame excuses like they were on the way to a friend’s place, then they will be bluntly told that they can meet the friend after a fortnight and will be straightaway put into quarantine. Besides, their vehicles will be seized and they will be slapped with relevant charges,” said District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik who feels that there is no better deterrent.

He said that 30 persons were arrested and 75 cases were registered for violation of the lockdown on Tuesday with the cases likely to go up. “We will not seize the vehicles in cases involving violation of the lockdown unless the charges were grave as it will be counterproductive as the purpose is to send the people back to their homes. But they will not escape penal provisions. Instead, photographs of their vehicles will be taken and notices will be sent accordingly,” said Mr. Karthik. Among those arrested were seven who took out a protest march to a Bevco outlet near the Aluva private bus stand in violation of Section 144 declared by the District Collector.

The Kochi city police arrested 54 persons in 58 cases for lockdown-violations on Tuesday. The Fort Kochi police seized 25-odd vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, on charges including both violation of the lockdown and reckless driving.

Meanwhile, the police have started issuing passes authorising movement in an attempt to clamp down on needless roaming around by people in defiance of the lockdown.

“Those exempted from the lockdown as essential services can move around on producing their valid IDs. Others, including those running grocery stores or medical shops, will have to make a self-declaration before the Station House Officers concerned against which passes will be issued, which will be valid during the duration of the lockdown,” Mr. Karthik said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/offenders-to-be-sent-into-14-day-quarantine/article31157446.ece
332,2020/03/25,G H to treat only COVID-19 patients,"The Government General Hospital, Kozhikode, will soon exclusively deal with COVID-19 patients.

A decision to this effect was taken reportedly on Tuesday in view of the rising number of cases in Kozhikode district. According to sources, those with serious symptoms would be admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital and patients with minor symptoms would be transferred to the General Hospital.

Meanwhile, more wards at the medical college hospital are being converted to isolation wards to treat infected or suspected patients. Outpatient tickets would be available only between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. from Wednesday. There are already restrictions for bystanders and visitors.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/g-h-to-treat-only-covid-19-patients/article31157381.ece
333,2020/03/25,How Bengaluru artistes will celebrate World Theatre Day online,"Theatre digitized: Bengaluru artistes will celebrate World Theatre online and you can also watch teleplays by Zee Theatre

It is ironic that theatre is going to be celebrated online this World Theatre Day, considering it is a live art form. However, Bengaluru’s theatre artistes aren’t defeated by the lockdown and have found ways to celebrate on March 27. Abhishek Iyengar, founder of WeMove Theatre, will be hosting an event on Facebook. “People can share two minute videos reading out a line or a part from their favourite play. You can whatsapp the video to 9886062324.”

Shiva Pathak, co-founder of Sandbox Collective, says: “Times of the pandemic has made us realize that to liven our spirits, we should do the Great Galatta! It will of course be online, we are still figuring out the nitty-gritty of it all, so watch out for more information on our social media, Facebook and Twitter.”

Nisha Abdulla will be starting an online writing group for teenagers.

Zee brings theatre to your homes

You can watch Zee Theatres teleplays, which digitizes plays for both television and online audiences. Zee Theatre will archive and curate old and new plays, for a wider range of audience. Zee Theatre has partnered with personalities such as Swara Bhaskar, Divya Dutta, Sarita Joshi, Ira Dubey, Reema Lagoo, Samta Sagar, Sonali Kulkarni, Zeeshan Ayyub and directors such as Mahesh Dattani, Purva Naresh, Akash Khurana, and Usha Ganguly.

Independent creative curator/producer Shailja Kejriwal , who conceptualized Zee Theatre’s teleplays, says: “In most places it is difficult to watch live performances. Plays need to go out to more and more people because they have wonderful stories and most of the plays make powerful social statements. If people can’t come to watch plays, why don’t we take the plays to people’s homes so that they can watch it as per their convenience?

Shailja has united six Indian and six Pakistani executives under the venture name Zeal For Unity (in relationship with Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd). She used art to get the two nations together making her the very first Indian producer, in the history of cinema, to have produced films by Pakistani makers. Her other milestone was ‘Imagine TV’.

However considering that theatre is a live art form won’t digitizing run contrary to it? Shailja says: “My belief is that theatre is something that needs to be seen live. But theatre is also about great storytelling. For example National theatre Live, an initiative by Royal Theatre, London, which broadcasts their performances live, has done this successfully.”

Shailja says they also want to archive the works of theatre masters. Though, she agrees, that selecting plays has been a massive task. “There are some plays which we don’t select. Especially those plays that are a visual spectacle to be seen live, for example, Feroz Khan’s Mughal-e-Azam. There is no point me showing that play because it is a play that needs to be watched live and hopefully a lot of people will get to see live at some point. Lots of other plays are extremely interesting from the point of view of the narrative. We select plays that have a strong narrative and performances. We try to show stories that are powerful.”

Speaking about some powerful scripts, Shailja says: “Shireen Shah is about the loss of the identity of Muslim women during the Gujarat riots. We have a very interesting play called Ok, Tata Bye Bye, written by Purva Naresh, which is about sex workers. Swadesh Deepak’s Court Martial addressing caste biases within the Army is another interesting play. We take up plays which need to be discussed about.”

The theatre space is far more democratic than mainstream cinema and even television, will Zee Theatre’s Teleplay change the dynamics of that on screen? Shailja says: “It gives me great joy to have people who are hugely talented to be seen by so many people.”

The teleplays are available on Zee5, Dish TV Rangmanch Active Ch #356 and D2H Ch #214, Tata Sky Theatre Ch #316, Airtel Spotlight Ch #191 and Vodafone Play.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/q7guzy/article31163661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Abhishek-Iyengar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/theatre-digitized/article31163668.ece
334,2020/03/25,Street play ‘Sheher-e-Naqab’ brings awareness about Coronavirus,"The production, which was originally a street play, is titled ‘Sheher-e-Naqab’. It was put together by Pune-based group Swatantra Theatre

A scene shows a man with a mask reading news related to Coronavirus news in a newspaper... His son walks in excitedly to show the college letter informing him of scholarship from Barcelona University to study MS. The father is not happy though, because of the corona pandemic across the world. When the son says this is a lifetime opportunity, the father quips, “We only live once.”

In Pune-based Swatantra Theatre’s new play Sheher-e-Naqab (City Under Mask), COVID-19 is a character with a voice. It comes silently, begins destruction and says, “I have had many friends like swine flu, Ebola, Nipah and Dengue. I have captured cities, countries and now the world. You cannot take me lightly. There can be consequences if precautions are not taken seriously.”

Directed by Abhijeet Choudhary, the play unravels the connect between Nature and mankind. “Mankind has destroyed Nature from many centuries. It is about what we have been doing to the planet. If we had heard Nature’s signs, we would have been able to curb the disease before it caused thousands of deaths worldwide. We paid a big price for this ignorance,” says Abhijeet. The 17-minute play was originally planned as a street play but once travel restrictions were imposed, the group launched it digitally, bringing in elements of street and stage theatre.

The play blends both mediums by using a black backdrop in most scenes while keeping the street feeling intact with minimum musical instruments. “My team — Dhanashree Heblikar (creative director), producer Yuwaraj Shah — and a team of actors have created a different style of approach to perform. The voice was toned down to create a street form on the stage easily. The actors clapping and snapping fingers became the set, voice and music sung live with help of minimal instruments. Colourful dupattas have been used to create images. We had to create time and space through content and delivery.”

With eight actors wearing masks, the aim of Sheher... is to bring multi-fold awareness. The play deals with the virus, past pandemic situations, people’s casual attitude, rumours and how even virtual marriages can be done so that huge gatherings can be avoided. The play also talks about the blackmarketing of fake sanitisers and selling masks at an unreasonable price. “Many rumours are being spread on WhatsApp. We want to bring awareness on how fake sanitisers have become a business and if sanitisers are not available, cleaning hands with a good soap and water is also enough.”

Co-founded by Dhanashree Heblikar, Yuwaraj Shah and Abhijeet, Swatantra Theatre was launched in 2006 and now has 55 members. In its 14-year journey, the group working mostly in Hindi has done a lot of thought-provoking and experimental theatre. “We work mostly on social issues. Some of the themes were on swine flu, trafficking, water conservation and saving the tiger.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/2gortr/article31161977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym27play,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/pune-based-swatantra-theatres-new-play-sheher-e-naqab-brings-focus-on-coronavirus/article31161979.ece
335,2020/03/25,"4 test positive in Valley, 417 potential virus carriers in hiding","Four more persons tested positive for COVID-19 in Kashmir on Wednesday as the administration fears that 417 people are on the run because of their travel history and may be potential asymptomatic virus carriers in society.

“Doctors suggest actual cases in the community could probably be more than those tested positive. For heaven’s sake, stay at homes and report to designated hospitals if you have symptoms or travel history,” Srinagar district Magistrate Dr. Shahid Choudhary said.

The appeal comes on a day when J&K witnessed the highest single-day jump in COVID-19 cases, with four persons testing positive from north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, taking the toll to 11. The fresh cases came just a day after three, including a member of a religious group, tested positive.

“Preliminary findings suggest they were in close contact with the Srinagar patient who tested positive yesterday [Tuesday]. All five reported to have participated together in a religious event,” said government spokesman Rohit Kansal.

Amid the ongoing lockdown, a major drive is on in the Valley to make a list of the contacts of these fresh positive cases.

Official sources said 471 people, who have travel history, are hiding in Kashmir to escape screening and likely quarantine but “could be potential asymptomatic carries of the novel coronavirus”.

“Some 1,800 persons returning from abroad have been quarantined in 90 facilities set up so far; over 150 persons hiding travel histories traced and were put under quarantine in the past one week,” said Dr. Choudhary.

To encourage people with travel history to come forward, the Pulwama administration on Wednesday offered pick and drop facility for such persons.

Around 1,750 persons of more than 3,000, who recently travelled abroad, have been put under quarantine in 40 of the 90 facilities in Srinagar.

Mirwaiz’s group calls for voluntary disclosure

The Mutahida Majlis Ulema, an organisation headed by Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, appealed to people “to voluntarily self report and not conceal or lie about it”.

“Such people are doing a great disservice to themselves, their family, neighbourhood and the community at large which amounts to an act transgression before Allah,” said a spokesman of the organisation.

In its efforts to ensure complete lockdown across Jammu and Kashmir, the police have registered 218 FIRs against violators.

In central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, 14 violators were arrested, police said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/4-test-positive-in-valley-417-on-the-run/article31167775.ece
336,2020/03/25,"Anti-CAA protesters place shoes, placards to keep protest going","Park Circus ground in Kolkata had become epicentre of rallies

‘Imran, I am here only’, ‘ I am Nuzhat, I am present here 24X7’, ‘Saad Abdullah, Na NRC, NO CAA no NPR’. These are some of the placards kept at the Park Circus Maidan, Kolkata — the place which has become the epicentre of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in the State since the first week of January 2020.

Not only placards but also dozens of pairs of shoes, scarfs and dupattas have been kept at the ground with names of the people who have left these articles behind. On Wednesday afternoon, there were five to six people at the ground, including two elderly women on the stage with face masks, sitting a few metres apart.

“About five to seven people are at the ground every hour, including during the night. The police have allowed only this kind of crowd here,” Abid Rana Karim, one of the protesters, told The Hindu. He explained that what was going on at the ground was ‘symbolic protests’.

A chair next to the stage has the name of Asmat Jamil, one of the main organisers of the protest which started at the ground on January 7. Ms. Jamil said it was a conscious decision on the part of the organisers to keep placards, shoes and clothes so that the symbolic protest continues.

“We support the lockdown but we will not allow it to bulldoze our protests,” said Nousheen Baba Khan, who has been associated with the protest from the very beginning.

Ms. Khan said, “It was the people who decided to leave some of their belongings.”

337,2020/03/25,Howrah station turns into “hellhole” for hundreds of stranded passengers,"With no protective gear or timely meals, they want to be evacuated as soon as possible

Moumita Vishwanath Majumdar, a woman in her late twenties, is sitting with her face covered at the base of an iron pillar outside the main gate of Howrah station, the key railway station that connects West Bengal to the rest of the country. When asked what her name is, she breaks down.

“Please get me out of here, I cannot take this any more,” Ms. Majumdar says, weeping. Weeping turns to sobbing in a few seconds.

“I will die…I need to go back to my mother…I have never seen this before,” says Ms. Majumdar, who came from Nagpur early on Monday and is sitting at the station’s portico for two days. She can neither visit her brother in Nadia district nor return.

She has had one meal of rice and lentils in the last 48 hours, which came from the Howrah District Magistrate’s office. The policemen of Howrah Railway Station Traffic Guard, manning the station, do not have an idea when the next meal will arrive. However, hunger is only a secondary problem for many hundreds of people stranded in the Howrah station over last 40 to 96 hours.

“We have no toilet,” says Ruby Acharjee, a 42-year-old woman from Silchar.

Ms. Acharjee, worried about her five children, who “must be turning desperate” as her phone went out of charge, is travelling from Chennai, where she works at a cardboard box manufacturing company. She left Chennai immediately, reached Howrah in three days and got stranded. Once the platform was vacated, Ms. Acharjee was shifted to a temporary home at the passengers’ area, outside the platform where another group of about 500 people is waiting with her.

“There is one toilet outside for women, also used by men and it’s a hellhole,” she says. The men can relieve themselves anywhere, she says, and the space outside the station has turned into one giant toilet. The area is stinking. All women and men are sitting close to each other, tightly packed, “like in a match box, waiting to explode,” says Ms. Acharjee.

“Look at him…,” Ms. Acharjee points to a man sleeping on the edge of the shade. The man is covered head to toe in a white cloth, with flies swarming over him and he is profusely stinking.

“He has no flesh on his bones, he is rotting…decomposing slowly, everyone is scared to touch him. He is excreting in one place for last three days and no one is touching him,” Ms. Acharjee says, with her mouth covered with the end of her saree.

Hardly any of the men standing next to her has any protective gear. Many do not have soap, access to clean water, unless they visit Ganga next to the station, where the water is polluted, according to reports. Most of them have not heard the word “sanitiser.”

“We have not eaten for three nights…how do you expect us to have handwash,” asks Ukesh Kharia, a 26-year-old man, who works at the Mangalore port.

The agitated men, mostly from Assam, said “no Government cares for them.” | Photo Credit: Suvojit Bagchi

Mr. Kharia, a resident of Dimari Tea Estate in Alipurduar in north Bengal, is still to procure a proper mask, but his friend Krishna Mohli and the rest say they have a financial crisis.

“I have about ₹2,000 with me. Can I afford to spend ₹200 on a mask?,” asks Md. Azim Ansari of Tejpur in Assam. He reached Howrah station on March 22 and got stranded. “The buses are going from here to many parts of the country but not letting us in…why did they declare this curfew without giving us a chance to reach home?,” says Ansari.

“Bimari toh is tarah se jyada phaylega [COVID-19 will spread faster this way]”, says Mohli. Many have their mobile phones stolen, as petty theft in the open space is continuing.

The buses, however, “have their capacity and there has to be a route plan to evacuate”, says Sukanta Karmakar, the Inspector-in-Charge of Howrah Railway Station Traffic Guard. He says they can accommodate 130 men and women on a north Bengal-bound bus on Tuesday.

Aloke Kumar Roy, a 36-year-old Guwahati resident, a hotel manager in Pune, complains that the State Government is “dispatching only Bengal residents to districts”, an allegation that police refute.

“A group of 291 went to Odhisha via Midnapore in south Bengal, all in State transport buses,” Mr. Karmakar says.

Huge influx

But Mr. Karmakar is alarmed at the influx of workers from different parts of the country to Kolkata. “They are coming in hundreds and often the head count we make does not tally as some are coming or some are disappearing,” he says.

Many, who are using the Howrah station as a transit point, do not live in West Bengal. The majority stranded in Howrah on Tuesday night are from Assam, and a few are from Punjab, Chennai, Kerala and Bihar.

Government officials opined trafficking of women and children could be a cause of major alarm, as the largest redlight district Sonagachi in north Kolkata is about five kilometres away in north Kolkata.

“If some of these starving and poor workers end up in the redlight areas, they cannot be blamed, escalating the risk of virus spread,” a government official says.

The area, however, is cleaned by the Railways daily, says Assistant Sub-Inspector Srikanta Das.

“But the stench is increasing as beggars, mad men and vagabonds who stay in the platforms have been forced out,” says Mr. Das.

He says he does not have an answer on how to reduce the “stench that is spreading.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/phzfvf/article31161209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pic1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/howrah-station-turns-into-hellhole-for-hundreds-of-stranded-passengers/article31161213.ece
338,2020/03/25,"In Kolkata, enterprising citizens reach medicines, groceries to the elderly","Good samaritans use social media to supply essentials to senior citizens.

While most people are spending the lockdown by reading and sharing Covid-19-related WhatsApp forwards, a small number of people in Kolkata are utilising the time to reach medicines and essential supplies to the elderly confined to their homes.

Take Debayan Datta, for example. Even before the lockdown was announced in Kolkata, he put up a post on Facebook saying something should be done about the senior citizens living alone. He was motivated by the concerns raised by their children living in other cities or abroad. Within hours of putting up the post, he was anchoring a WhatsApp group of about 80 people called Let’s Help, each of the volunteering to help in some way or the other.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“On an average we are reaching medicines and groceries to five or six houses in a day. Volunteers are functioning in their respective neighbourhoods,” Mr. Datta, who works with the hospitality industry, told The Hindu. “The idea came to me because I too worry about my elderly mother when I am travelling — I can relate to the plight of those who are unable to visit their parents [because of the lockdown].”

On Tuesday, ex-banker Mohammad Nehal and his lawyer friend Syed Ehtisham Huda also began a similar service. “I have already received some 25 calls, they are all on behalf of the elderly who need life-saving drugs,” said Mr. Nehal, even as he shopped for medicines at a store in South City Mall. He also put up a Facebook post calling for volunteers for this “humanity-first initiative”.

During such as unprecedented lockdown, help, sometimes, is not just about reaching essentials to the needy. Luna Chatterjee, a brand strategist who is part of the Let’s Help group, has been assigned to stay in touch with an elderly couple, just to assure them that they are not alone.

“They are total strangers — they are the parents of a friend’s friend who lives abroad — but I call them every day to let them know we are around. Such people don’t just need essential supplies, they also need people to talk to,” said Ms. Chatterjee.

Sometimes, emergency situations are unprecedented in nature. “The other day we got to know of an elderly man living alone with four cats,” said Ms. Chatterjee. “His neighbours had poisoned the cats out of fear that they carried the virus. People instantly reached out to him and guided him to the veterinary hospital and even offered to accompany him if required. The vets, unfortunately, could save only two cats.”

Such private citizens apart, the Kolkata police and the municipal corporation too are circulating messages on social media, offering help to Kolkatans who live abroad but have already relatives back home.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/in-kolkata-enterprising-citizens-reach-medicines-groceries-to-the-elderly/article31156438.ece

340,2020/03/25,Manipur records first COVID-19 case,"Lockdown in Northeast; Assam MLAs to donate salary for anti-virus fund

Assam became the last of the eight northeastern States to go into lockdown mode on Tuesday after a 23-year-old woman from Manipur became the region’s first to test positive for COVID-19 pandemic.

The woman was found infected with the virus on Tuesday morning following a medical examination conducted at a laboratory in Imphal’s Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences. Her parents, both college lecturers, and other family members have been quarantined with the police cordoning off the house.

Officials in Manipur said the woman, a student of biomedicine at Bristol University in United Kingdom, had arrived in Kolkata via Delhi on March 19. Her brother joined her in Kolkata from Atlanta, U.S. Both stayed in a hotel in Kolkata and arrived in Imphal on March 21 by a flight via Agartala, Tripura.

Last week, the Manipur government had made a list of 99 people who had arrived from various COVID-19-hit countries. The woman’s name was not on the list.

Attended a wedding

“She fell sick on Monday and was admitted in the hospital. We have taken away 12 members of her family and others and kept them under close observation,” said K. Rajo, the State’s Director of Health. Reports suggest she had attended a wedding before she tested positive.

Later, Chief Minister N. Biren Singh took to social media requesting the people to shut themselves in for their own good. “I urge those who returned from foreign countries to honestly declare their travel history,” he said.

The authorities in southern Assam’s Hailakandi district filed an FIR against a man who had arrived from abroad on Monday but did not report at the nearest police station or health station as mandated. “Departmental action for immediate suspension is also being drawn against the father, a government employee, for concealing information,” Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli said.

Members of the family had misled the authorities by saying he would arrive after three days but an enquiry revealed he had already reached home.

Officials said 721 people, who had come from abroad and other parts of India, have been home quarantined.

All the 126 legislators in the Assam Assembly on Tuesday pledged a month’s pay for a fund set up by CM Sarbananda Sonowal to combat COVID-19.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday appealed to the people to take oath in the name of their parents for staying at home in the wake of pandemic COVID-19.

“Safety of your family members is in your hands. Entry of COVID-19 into your home depends on your behaviour. If you are cautious, the virus cannot enter your home,” said Mr. Patnaik in his address to the State following lockdown for all 30 districts.

‘Take oath’

“Take daily oath in the name of parents and children that you won’t venture out of home. COVID-19 might come with you to your home and harm family members. Take oath to undertake 20-second hand-washing before entering home,” said Odisha CM reminding people of the oath.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and government Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Odisha’s Berhampur joined hands to manufacture hand sanitisers.

ITI Berhampur staff with the support of chemistry department of IISER, Berhampur, has started making hand sanitisers and providing them for free to the administration.

“Realising the extreme scarcity of hand sanitisers in the local market and its importance for the employees and emergency service workers on duty, we decided to meet the demand by producing it locally,” said ITI Berhampur principal Rajat Kumar Panigrahy.

They have already made 350 bottles of 30 ml hand sanitiser that can be easily carried in the pocket. On Monday, the bottles were handed over to Berhampur Municipal Corporation commissioner and Ganjam Chief District Medical Officer. “The BeMC Commissioner told us that they will provide us necessary materials for production to cater to the rising demand,” said Mr. Panigrahy.

According to IISER, Berhampur, head of chemistry department, Rakesh Pathak, the hand sanitiser strictly adheres to the World Health Organisation guidelines. It was produced in the chemistry lab of IISER, Berhampur, by Mr. Panigrahy, three staff members of ITI, Berhampur, along with faculty members of the chemistry department of the IISER. “Our hand sanitiser is of better quality than the ones being sold in market at higher price,” said Mr. Panigrahy.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/khzawx/article31157061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25IISER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/iti-iiser-berhampur-join-forces-to-manufacture-hand-sanitisers/article31157062.ece

However, with two more cases, the total number of confirmed cases went up to nine in West Bengal.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee told the people that the State and the country are facing a calamity and thus the lockdown period was being extended from March 27 to March 31.

A 58-year-old male, who returned from Egypt, and one female, 55, who returned from the U.K. recently tested positive on Sunday, but no deaths were reported. The Egypt-returned patient had tested negative earlier. Both of them are in isolation at the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital in north Kolkata.

On Tuesday, ex-banker Mohammad Nehal and his lawyer friend Syed Ehtisham Huda also began a similar service. “I have already received some 25 calls, they are all on behalf of the elderly who need life-saving drugs,” said Mr. Nehal, even as he shopped for medicines at a store in South City Mall. He also put up a Facebook post calling for volunteers for this “humanity-first initiative”.

During such as unprecedented lockdown, help, sometimes, is not just about reaching essentials to the needy.

Luna Chatterjee, a brand strategist who is part of the Let’s Help group, has been assigned to stay in touch with an elderly couple, just to assure them that they are not alone.

“They are total strangers — they are the parents of a friend’s friend who lives abroad — but I call them every day to let them know we are around. Such people don’t just need essential supplies, they also need people to talk to,” said Ms. Chatterjee.

Sometimes, emergency situations are unprecedented in nature. “The other day we got to know of an elderly man living alone with four cats,” said Ms. Chatterjee. “His neighbours had poisoned the cats. People instantly reached out to him and guided him to the veterinary hospital. The vets, unfortunately, could save only two cats.”

345,2020/03/25,Police toughen stand against violators in Kozhikode,"Nearly 350 cases registered in Kozhikode city

On the second day of the Statewide lockdown on Wednesday, the district administration came up with stringent measures to tackle the menace of people defying orders of the government to remain indoors.

Nearly 350 cases were registered in Kozhikode city. However, the number of cases registered in rural areas that comprised Vadakara, Koyilandy and Thamarassery taluks were below 15, officials said.

The Collector had imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in the district from Monday to counter the spread of COVID-19. Kozhikode district has the highest number of people, nearly 10,000, under observation in the State.

As elsewhere in the State, residents were seen gathering in large numbers at supermarkets and department stores from 7 a.m. on Wednesday. People were rushing to stock provisions despite the government announcing that the State had enough stocks of commodities available to meet the needs during the entire 21-day lockdown period.

With more people pouring into the roads, the police began to cordon off areas at several junctions to stop them from freely roaming on the streets. Those who were unnecessarily seen on the roads were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.

The police said that many of those travelling in motorbikes and four-wheelers had declaration forms with them. However, police personnel found that some of these had frivolous reasons written on them.

Things began to improve by mid-noon with the proactive steps taken by the police. More restrictions would be put in place from Thursday.

Public transport, except autorickshaws and taxis, remained off the road. But their numbers were less compared to Tuesday. Provision stores, vegetable and fruits vendors, fish and chicken stalls were opened from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.

There were complaints that traders hiked the prices of vegetables and fruits to cash in on the huge demand. Onions, potatoes and tomatoes, which were selling at around ₹30 a kg till Tuesday, were sold at ₹40 and above on Wednesday. Some stores claiming to offer organic vegetables were selling onions even at ₹60 and carrots at ₹80 per kg. The prices of bananas, which were sold at ₹35 to ₹40 a kg, was steeply hiked to ₹65 a kg.

The closure of retail liquor outlets from Wednesday gave a huge relief to law enforcers. Managing the crowd at the outlets was a daunting task for officials and the police, they said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/uatp2y/article31167592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26ct26tvkzlockdown06jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/police-toughen-stand-against-violators-in-kozhikode/article31167593.ece

The enforcement squad of Kozhikode Corporation seized a cart on Tuesday for selling vegetables at exorbitant prices.

Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said three squads have been deployed in the city to ensure that the wholesale price list of fruits and vegetables was being displayed at every vegetable stall and that the retail prices were reasonable as well.

The squads will be in action for a week. The public can complain if they find any vendor violating the instructions.

The Corporation had intervened on Monday following complaints that fruits and vegetables were sold at prices 200% to 300% higher than that of the wholesale price. Hence, a meeting of vegetable and fruit vendors were convened in which it was decided that the vendors would display the wholesale prices and that the retailers would charge only up to 20% extra.

Arrangements at market

Meanwhile, significant changes have been made at the vegetable wholesale market in Palayam. Out of the 118 push carts, only 20 will be stationed at the market. The rest will be deployed in other parts of the city, especially residential areas, so that people need not venture far away from their homes to purchase vegetables. This will in turn reduce the rush at the market.

As for the retailers who take vegetables in bulk to be sold elsewhere in the district, the wholesalers will contact them and fix a time when they can collect the goods from the market. This is to avoid them all coming together to the market at dawn.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/47895y/article31147277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-KI-SUPERMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fleecing-vegetable-vendors-cart-seized/article31159568.ece

However, seeing the crowd, the officials, through public address system, instructed people to wind up their shopping. By 11 a.m., the shops had downed shutters. Until further orders, no tea shops shall remain open in the district, the Collector said.

The Collector checked the fumigation being carried out in some of the hospital premises. He also visited a few medical shops, where people had lined up to buy drugs. Interacting with them, he told to maintain adequate distance and avoid crowding.

The district police had seized 3,487 liquor bottles from across the district since March 22 and on a single day alone (March 25), seized 600 bottles from Rameswaram. SP V. Varun Kumar said in a press release that the police would register cases against those persons for illegal sale and hoarding. Discreet information had also revealed that TASMAC staff had connived with the vendors. Cases would be booked under the Disaster Management Act 2005, Epidemic Disease Act and under the IPC Sections, he warned.

After starting the lockdown on a sluggish note, the twin towns of Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai that witnessed truncated movement of people and the bikes in the morning, went indoors in the afternoon after the police assumed a tough posture.

Though the Prime Minister had announced about nationwide lockdown, it was ‘business as usual’ in many places of Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai on Wednesday morning. While almost all the business establishments had downed shutters, a good number of people, especially youths, could be seen zooming past in their bikes without any reason forcing the police posted at the barricades put across the arterial roads at several places to intercept them. When these youths cited some trivial reasons for roaming around along the roads, they were warned and asked to go home.

In Melapalayam, a good number of meat stalls remained open on Wednesday morning with huge number of people waiting in front of these shops to buy meat. Though the police appealed to the public to go home and remain indoors, none was in a mood to heed to the request.

Even as the police geared up to forcibly shut down the shops transacting business as usual, the Social Democratic Party of India cadre, who arrived at the spot, appealed to the public moving around through a public address system to go home immediately.

Over a 1,000 people had gathered in a temple festival organised at Naduvaikurichi on Palayamkottai outskirts on Tuesday night. When the officials of the Department of Public Health were alerted about this gathering which would provide conducive atmosphere for community transmission, a Medical Officer and his team rushed to the spot to persuade the public there to disperse immediately considering the gravity of the situation.

However, the Medical Officer was warned by the gathering to move away and the celebrations continued. When Assistant Collector (Training) Sivaguru Prabhakaran, who is coordinating the COVID – 19-related activities, was informed about the temple festival, he alerted Superintendent of Police Om Prakash Meena to send a police team to the temple to wind up the celebrations. Even then, the celebrations continued even after 2 a.m.

A youth from Xavier Colony on South Bypass Road, who had returned to his native place from Bengaluru, was admitted to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital’s isolation ward with COVID – 19 symptoms on Tuesday night. His family members complained that he was sent back home when he went to the TVMCH on Tuesday morning for screening.

“As he was sent back, we contacted the control room at the Collectorate to register the complaint that my son was sent back instead of being admitted to the isolation ward. However, the people manning the control room at the Collectorate refused to help us. When we went to the TVMCH again in the night, he was admitted,” said the youth’s mother.

Sources in the Government Medical College Hospital said the patient, who was undergoing treatment for cancer, was admitted to the hospital with cold and breathing problems on Tuesday night in the isolation ward after being discharged from a private hospital at Kulasekaram.

Even as he was undergoing treatment at Kulasekaram hospital, his son, who is working in Singapore, came to Nagercoil to be with his father and shifted him to the Government Medical College Hospital. Since the asymptomatic youth had come from Singapore, the old man, who was suffering from cold and breathing problems, was admitted to the isolation ward, where he died on Wednesday even as his blood and swab samples had been sent for an analysis.

Even before the results of these samples are received, the old man died.

Stating that his rural clinic did not have any modern facility, he said he closed down the clinic as he could not ensure minimum safety for himself, his hospital staff and the visiting patients.

“I am not able to identify people falling under category B among the patients coming to my hospital. These are the people who could have come into contact with people who have got coronavirus infection. Besides, some people with infection could be asymptomatic of COVID-19. And some infected with the virus would not have any symptoms in initial stage,” Dr. Dawood said.

Stating that his clinic gets around 40 to 60 patients everyday, he said the patients come with all kinds of minor ailments like cough, cold and fever.

“My hospital does not have the space for such a big crowd to maintain social distancing. This could put everyone’s health at risk. Besides, masks and sanitisers are also not available freely in the market. N95 masks are very important to safeguard myself and my staff in the present situation,” he said.

369,2020/03/25,"As petro demand declines, IOC cuts refinery throughput","Firm to raise LPG output; no need for panic-booking, it says

India’s largest fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has cut down the throughput from its refineries across the country by almost 30% as the demand for petroleum products such as petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), fuel oil and bitumen, has reduced substantially following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country.

“Keeping this (falling demand) in view, Indian Oil has regulated crude oil throughput at most of its refineries by 25% to 30%,” said IOC in a statement.

“Offtake of finished products from refiners in the last one week has helped upcountry bulk storage locations of the Corporation build up their stocks for future-readiness once the countrywide lockdown is lifted and the demand picks up again.

“The Corporation is keeping a close watch on global cues and the changing market scenario and initiating action accordingly, IOC said.

In the midst of a reduction in demand for major petroleum products, there has been an increase in demand for LPG cooking gas.

Optimising operations

“To meet the rising demand for LPG, Indian Oil is taking steps to increase LPG production at its major refineries by optimising operations, improving LPG yield in LPG-producing units like FCC/Indmax, etc. Bottling plant operations and LPG refill deliveries are being streamlined accordingly,” said IOC, adding adequate stocks were available and there was no need for panic-booking by customers.

In these trying times, Indian Oil also said it was committed to ensuring emergency fuelling across all permitted modes.

The Corporation’s bulk storage installations, LPG bottling plants, fuel stations and LPG distributorships have been advised to operate under the advisory of their respective State governments/local administrations to maintain essential services in their geographies. The fuel stations are operating with skeletal staff to ensure personal hygiene and social distancing norms.

The Corporation has taken several precautionary measures with special emphasis on the health and safety of its employees, service-providers, contract work-force, petrol pump dealers and customer attendants, LPG distributors and delivery boys, etc.

A high-level committee has been formed to deal with all matters related to COVID-19, which has streamlined the working at the Corporation’s non-critical locations with work-from-home norms to ensure proper social distancing norms. However, adequate work-force is being deployed at critical refining, supply & distribution locations, with all health, hygiene and safety measures in place. Manning has also been rationalised in round-the-clock shift operations, fire and safety, medical and other essential services.

In the wake of the countrywide lockdown, the Corporation is addressing several issues related to movement and turnaround time of POL tank-trucks; restricted mobility and attendance of work-force at LPG distributorships and fuel stations; and restricted business hours of fuel stations at a few places.

Despite the many constraints, Indian Oil remains committed to ensuring fuel availability for its customers and emergency services while taking all the necessary precautionary measures.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/67f3y5/article31166890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUIOC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/as-petro-demand-declines-ioc-cuts-refinery-throughput/article31166891.ece
370,2020/03/25,Aviation firms may suffer losses of up to $3.6 bn: CAPA,"‘First quarter of FY21 already looks like a washout‘

Indian aviation companies, including airlines, airport operators and related services, are estimated to incur a loss of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion (₹24,750 crore to ₹27,000 crore) in the April to June 2020 quarter on account of COVID-19 spread in India and the resultant lockdown, aviation consulting firm CAPA Advisory has said.

As per CAPA India preliminary estimates, while airlines will incur a loss of $1.75 billion in first quarter of the 2021 fiscal, airport and concessionaires will see a loss of $1.50-1.75 billion and ground handlers $80-90 million.

“India’s airline system is certainly not prepared for such a severe systemic shock, and this will have an impact on the entire aviation value chain, including airport operators, duty free, retail, food and beverage, and other airport concessionaires; ground handlers; MROs, inflight catering companies, not to mention travel distribution,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO and Director, CAPA Advisory. “The entire sector is now in a state of crisis which will certainly impact FY2021 and quite possibly well beyond,” he said.

“India’s aviation sector could incur losses of $3.3-3.6 billion in Q1 of FY2021,” CAPA said, adding that this preliminary estimate assumes that all domestic and international operations remain grounded till June 30, 2020.

“Even with some partial resumption of services in May and June, the financial outcomes may not change significantly,” it said.

“The shutdown of aviation until at least April 15 means that Q1 of FY2021 is looking increasingly like a washout,” CAPA Advisory said in a report.

The groundings in the April-June quarter, traditionally one of the stronger quarters of the year, will have consequent implications for Q2 (usually the weakest quarter) and for the rest of FY2021, it said.

The severity of the impact could possibly lead to a structural reset of the airline sector in India, with a strategic shift in terms of traffic growth, fleet expansion, pricing, costs and business models, the firm added.

The Centre has approved a ₹1,340-crore recapitalisation plan for regional rural banks (RRBs) to improve their capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), strengthening these institutions that are critical to the provision of credit in rural areas.

On Wednesday, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs gave its nod for an outlay of ₹670 crore as the central share for the scheme on the condition that the release of the funds will be contingent upon the release of the proportionate share by the sponsor banks, an official statement said.

This would provide minimum regulatory capital for one more year viz. up to 2020-21 for those RRBs that are unable to maintain the minimum CRAR of 9%. This has been an ongoing scheme since 2011.

The RRBs are required to provide 75% of their total credit as priority sector lending with primary focus on agricultural credit, including small and marginal farmers, as well as micro entrepreneurs and rural artisans.

Asserting that Microsoft is financially strong despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, its India-born CEO Satya Nadella has voiced confidence that the company will come out of the crisis “pretty strong”.

In an interview to CNBC on Tuesday, Mr. Nadella, however, said the big question would be whether the demand holds up in the U.S. and Europe and other developed markets badly hit by the pandemic.

“We feel good about how we are able to meet the demands of work from home kits. On the supply side we are getting back on rails,” Mr. Nadella said when asked whether Microsoft would be able to deliver later this year certain products, like the new Surface devices and a revamped Xbox gaming console, it had promised before the COVID-19 outbreak.

“The question now would be getting the products done and the launch. We are mostly going to focus on quality as well the situation in terms of demand and more importantly safety for the people,” he said.

“It is a healthy company in terms of financial strength. We have a great balance sheet, we are a very diverse business, we have a mix of annuity, non-annuity, that is also stronger than even the last time we even went into the financial crisis,” he said.

Air India’s total earnings per day are around ₹60-65 crore and 90% of this comes from passenger revenue, he said adding, “the expenses too are in the same range. So we are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) positive or in a way meeting our all expenses.”

Air India’s salary bill stands at around ₹250 crore per month while the aircraft lease rentals outgo is around $30 million per month as per the source.

The airline has 21 Boeing B787-800s on lease in addition to 27 Airbus A320Neo planes. The lease rental for each Boeing 787 is $1 million per months and $400 per month for an A20Neo, as per the source.

377,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | GoAir says all employees will have pay cut in March,"During the last few weeks, GoAir has already taken a slew of cost cutting measures.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the revenues of the aviation sector, GoAir CEO Vinay Dube announced on Wednesday that all employees will be taking a pay cut in March.

During the last few weeks, GoAir has already taken some cost cutting measures — it has laid off its expat pilots, asked its employees to go on leave without pay on a rotational basis, and announced that its top leadership would be taking a pay cut of up to 50%.

Mr. Dube told employees in an official communication: “Under the current conditions we find ourselves in we are left with no choice but to extend salary cuts for all of us for the month of March. We will ensure that the lowest pay grades suffer the least.”

India has banned international commercial passenger flights for a period of one week from Sunday. Moreover, domestic flights have also been suspended from Tuesday midnight.

Last week, IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta stated that the senior employees of the low-cost carrier will have a pay cut of up to 25%. Air India also announced that the pandemic has caused “insurmountable dip” in revenues and therefore, it is reducing the allowances of all employees — except cabin crew — by 10% for the next three months.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1d0vna/article31101979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THLTGOAIRAIRCRAFT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/coronavirus-goair-says-all-employees-will-have-pay-cut-in-march/article31160548.ece

Online travel firm MakeMyTrip’s top executives Deep Kalra and Rajesh Magow have decided to draw ‘zero salary’ from April 2020, while the rest of its leadership team will take a reduction of around 50% in their compensation amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

Group Executive Chairman Deep Kalra and its Group CEO Rajesh Magow have decided to take ‘zero salary’ from April 2020 as the company plans to undertake multiple “tough measures” to keep overall expenses at a minimum amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

“On people costs front, both of us will take the lead and take zero salary effective April 2020, while the rest of our leadership team have also offered to take a reduction of approximately 50% in their compensation,” Kalra and Magow said in a message to company’s employees.

The group is reviewing operating costs and plans to undertake multiple tough measures to keep overall expenses at a minimum.

Being an online company, the majority of the costs are variable, however the situation demands that it takes a hard look at all the fixed costs including people costs, the message said.

“The last few weeks have been very tough for all of us with the sudden and sharp spread of COVID-19 in India. Our stellar performance in Q3 2020 was sadly short-lived as the travel and tourism sector is one of the worst sectors that have been hit by this pandemic,” Kalra and Magow said.

There has been sharp drop in bookings with spiralling cancellations and the latest restrictions on domestic air/ rail/bus travel has brought the industry to a virtual standstill.

These are incredibly tough times that we need to navigate through together!... Economic experts across the world are predicting it to be a global economic tsunami that will have far reaching implications for the global economy, the message said.

“Therefore, we need to focus on two critical areas (i) safety and well-being of our staff, customers and the society at large, and (ii) minimising the impact to our business from these disruptions,” it added.

This means the group will continue to sharply reduce variable costs like advertising, sales promotions and payment gateway costs, along with optimising IT infrastructure and expenses relating to the functioning of our offices and other establishments, they added.

“We will immediately cancel all discretionary spends such as events, trainings, etc. and also suspend brand building expenses during the following quarter,” the message said.

They expressed confidence that with all these steps the group would together be able to weather this storm and come out stronger.

380,2020/03/25,COVID-19 lockdown | Flipkart suspends services,"Our promise is that we will be back to serve you, as soon as possible, the e-commerce firm said

E-commerce firm Flipkart has temporarily suspended its services as the 21-day country-wide lockdown began on Wednesday in order to curtail the spread of COVID-19.

Coronavirus lockdown day 1 live updates

The move comes after rival Amazon India on Tuesday said it was giving halt orders for non-essential products and was looking at prioritising customers’ critical needs.

“Consequent to the order issued on March 24 by the Ministry of Home Affairs announcing a 21-day lockdown across India to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, we are temporarily suspending our services,” the Walmart owned firm said in a blog.

It added, “Your needs have always been a priority, and our promise is that we will be back to serve you, as soon as possible.” A similar note is also on the Flipkart website.

Amazon India in a blog on Tuesday said a large number of districts/States are taking precautionary measures with extensive lockdown and restricted movement of goods and people. At the same time, the platform is seeing an increased demand for priority products and important services.

“To serve customers’ most urgent needs, while also ensuring safety of our employees, we are temporarily prioritising our available fulfilment and logistics capacity to serve products that are currently critical for our customers such as household staples, packaged food, health care, hygiene, personal safety and other high priority products,” it said.

“This also means that we have to temporarily stop taking orders and disable shipments for lower-priority products.”

Amazon India said that regarding all pending customer orders on lower-priority products, it was reaching out to customers and giving them a choice to cancel their orders, and receive a refund for prepaid items.

These changes, it said, were in effect from March 24, 2020.

“Amazon and our network of partners are helping communities around the world and in India to deliver much-needed supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them. We will remain focused on providing this vital service to people in India, especially to those most vulnerable, like the elderly or those without access,” it said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/30s8xa/article31159727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN25FLIPKART,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/covid-19-lockdown-flipkart-suspends-operations/article31159715.ece
381,2020/03/25,SEBI writes to States on broking staff safety,"Missive comes amid clamour for closure markets and cases of staff manhandling

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has written to all State governments to ensure the safety of individuals working with capital market intermediaries to enable the smooth functioning of the markets.

This comes on the back of a huge clamour for closure of capital markets with both, equity and commodity market participants, knocking at the regulator’s doors to seek a review of its decision to keep the markets open even as the whole country has gone into lockdown mode.

“[The] stock market operations are to be in line with the orders of Government of India and State governments and SEBI notifications. Today, SEBI has written to chief secretaries/administrators of all states/UTs, requesting them to facilitate the functioning and movement of personnel of entities notified by SEBI for the smooth operation of the capital markets,” said SEBI in a statement issued on Wednesday.

Incidentally, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, on March 23, wrote a similar letter to all States to ensure that essential staffers of capital market intermediaries were allowed to commute amid the lockdown.

Meanwhile, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI), the umbrella body representing around 900 brokers, has said that local authorities on the ground have made it difficult for the staff to reach office with some staffers even complaining about manhandling by the police.

Yet to be sensitised

“We would like to point out that the law enforcement agencies at grassroots level are still not sensitised about the SEBI directive. This has led to several instances of manhandling the staff of broking firms while travelling to offices,” said Vijay Bhushan, president, ANMI.

“We have received several requests to suspend broking services on humanitarian grounds considering the growing instances of spreading COVID-19,” said Mr. Bhushan.

Commodity market participants also feel that if market closure is not an option then, at least, trading hours should be curtailed as the commodity derivatives segment has much longer trading hours compared with equity.

“These are exceptional and unprecedented circumstances when the regulators need to take into consideration the safety of the people engaged in these services and their families and take bold and unprecedented steps to at least curtail time of market,” said Narinder Wadhwa, president, Commodity Participants Association of India (CPAI).

“In view of the apprehensions expressed by members at large on account of health and safety concerns, ANMI appeals to your good offices to allow a systematic closure till the nation-wide lockdown remains in force,” stated ANMI in a letter sent to SEBI, stock exchanges and depositories on Wednesday.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hqcnm0/article31166945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sebi-writes-to-states-on-broking-staff-safety/article31166946.ece
382,2020/03/25,Sensex gains amid hopes of stimulus,"Reliance Industries was the top gainer in the Sensex pack.

Equity benchmarks registered their third biggest single-day gain on Wednesday on expectations that the government will soon announce an economic stimulus package even as a global rally acted as a catalyst.

The 30-share Sensex gained 1,861.75 points, or 6.98%, to close at 28,535.78.

The rally was primarily on the back of massive gains in index heavyweights Reliance Industries, HDFC twins — HDFC and HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank.

The broader Nifty ended the day at 8,317.85, up 516.80 points or 6.62%. Incidentally, the India VIX index dipped nearly 8%.

“The recent positive announcements from the U.S. Fed and rising hopes of a stimulus package from the Indian government have lifted sentiments,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president (Research), Religare Broking.

“We expect that volatility would remain high in the near term and any sustainable rally would largely depend upon how effectively we can contain the spread of coronavirus now with a 21-day nationwide lockdown in place,” said Mr. Mishra.

The U.S. government has approved a stimulus package worth a whopping $2 trillion that led to most markets witnessing strong gains on Wednesday.

In Asia, Nikkei gained over 8% while Hang Seng was up nearly 4%.

Back in India, the market breadth comprised almost equal number of gainers and declines as many side counters continued to experience weakness. On BSE, 1,186 stocks gained ground as against 1,023 declines. Most of the broader indices underperformed the benchmarks.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

As we put distance between ourselves socially, we may often find ourselves out of earshot and at a loss. But that’s no reason to feel all at sea. In fact, people at sea (sailors, coast guards, mermaids, etc.) have a means of communication involving only hand gestures and flags. Arden, once again, points to this word in THC #12892 with this homely clue.

The Hindu Cryptic #12892 | Arden | (6 Down) Clue surface : Communicate as per home design (9) Answer : SEMAPHORE Definition: Communicate Clue type : Anagram Annotation : Jumble (as indicated by ‘design’) the letters of AS PER HOME

Semaphores are signals used to telegraphically convey simple messages using hand-held flags or pivoted rods. While the simpler form involves basic binary indication (like an on/off switch), more sophisticated versions can spell things out in alphanumeric code that’s based on the angle or position of each flag.

They have been in use since the era of the Roman empire — you can imagine that the sentinels would hold a rod in each hand and tell the man at the tower yonder how many fatigues they still have left or what they had for dinner. Napoleon and Tsar Nicolas are known to have highly valued their manned semaphore lines.

Semaphore telegraph towers are also known as Chappe telegraphs or Napoleonic semaphores. The word entered the English language in the early 1800s.

semaphore sounds like: sem -uh-four noun — a signalling device, consisting of a pole with arms that can be set at different positions. — a system of signalling in which flags, or simply the arms, are held in positions that represent individual letters and numbers verb — to signal using semaphores Etymology: Greek sema (‘sign’) + phore (‘holder of’) eg: “When the discussion broke down, the MPs began communicating using wild semaphores accompanied with frothing mouths and steaming ears.”

384,2020/03/25,The race to find a cure for COVID-19,"While efforts to develop an anti-COVID-19 vaccine are encouraging, safety issues are paramount

The novel coronavirus has infected more than 4,00,000, people worldwide and led to the deaths of more than 17,000. The epicentre of the pandemic has shifted from Wuhan district in China to the highly developed Western world. Countries such as Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S., which have some of the most advanced health systems in the world, have come under tremendous pressure and seem unable to deal with this health crisis. With no specific therapy or vaccine available at present, it is imperative that we fast-forward the development of efficacious vaccines and drug therapies against COVID-19. However, it must be emphasised that because vaccines are given to large populations, safety issues are paramount. The world is dealing with an unprecedented and unimaginably serious crisis. Therefore, the speed of vaccine development is crucial.

Encouraging developments

The race for developing an anti-COVID-19 vaccine has begun. Reasonable scientific rationale and the information needed for vaccine development are available to all stakeholders in academia and industry. A large number of candidate vaccines based on different vaccine platforms, including delivering the virus genetic materials (RNA, DNA) or using synthetic biology to produce key viral proteins, have already been developed. In fact, Phase-I safety trials of an experimental vaccine, jointly developed by scientists at the National Institute of Health and at Moderna, a biotechnology company, has already been administered to healthy volunteers for its safety and immunogenicity. Although based on some earlier experience of vaccines of other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the speed with which the experimental vaccine has entered safety trials is unprecedented. Another vaccine jointly developed by China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences and CanSino Biologics has reportedly been cleared for early-stage clinical trials in which more than 100 healthy volunteers are scheduled to receive the vaccine. The Serum Institute of India has also recently announced its readiness to start safety trials following animal experiments. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, more than 20 vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of development and will be ready for Phase-I safety trials. While these developments are encouraging, several questions will need to be answered for these candidates to move further.

Although it is quite evident that humans mount a strong immune response and clear the viral load, the nature of the immune response and how to trigger it safely through vaccination will be key questions to address. Some early, but limited, studies from China have suggested that monkeys can be infected with this virus but can be protected from reinfection. How long the acquired immunity in humans will last is another important question to be asked before experimental vaccines move forward. We will need to know this because if the immunity is transient, then humans will be susceptible to reinfections. Before moving to Phase-II trials in a large number of healthy volunteers, we also have to ensure that the immune response induced by vaccination does not lead to any disease enhancement, as has been observed in cases of some experimental vaccines against the dengue virus, and in animal studies with an experimental vaccine against the SARS virus.

Also Read All about COVID-19

It is absolutely imperative that anti-COVID vaccines are developed as fast as possible and by pushing all reasonable vaccine candidates through animal and human clinical trials. However, it is also clear that it will not be possible to roll-out any efficacious vaccine for at least another year. An all-out effort to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 must continue if we have to stop its spread.

With COVID-19 playing havoc across the world, therapeutic interventions, not only for curing severe cases of the disease but also for protecting all front-line healthcare workers, are urgently needed. Since developing new drugs is a complex and lengthy process, scientists and pharmaceutical companies have rushed to investigate and use drugs that have already been approved by regulatory authorities. Using available molecular and structural biology information on the virus, a group of scientists have analysed all interactions of the viral proteins with human proteins that are crucial for the virus to enter human cells and use the host cell machinery to rapidly reproduce itself. Of the nearly 70 short-listed molecules that may interrupt these key interactions, 24 happen to be already approved drugs which can now be tested in laboratory animal models as well as humans. However, the re-purposing of several drugs, alone or in combinations to treat COVID-19 patients, have already been reported. There are many success stories of curing patients of COVID-19 doing the rounds in different parts of the world, but these have managed to create more confusion than hope. Without any appropriate controls, careful dosing and safety concerns, such small experiments can only do more harm than good.

Controlled randomised trials

Given the urgency of finding a cure, it is absolutely necessary to find out unequivocally what works well and what does not. For that conducting carefully controlled randomised trials is the only way to go. In a welcome move, the WHO has announced clinical trials called the ‘Solidarity Project’. Under this four drugs or drug combinations will be tested in many countries around the world. These candidates include the anti-Ebola drug, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, anti-HIV drugs, and the Ritonavir/Lopinavir combination, with or without Interferon-beta. Many countries have already signed up for these trials and all drug companies, including CIPLA from India, have agreed to supply sufficient quantity of drugs needed. The European counterpart of the trial, Discovery, will conduct these trials in countries including France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. The pharma company Roche has also decided to initiate large, randomised Phase-III trials of its arthritis drug Actemra for its safety and efficacy in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. It is complex and tedious to conduct randomised, large multi-centric trials. Quickly getting all the stakeholders together is laudable and underscores the notion that everyone needs to fight the deadly virus together. Hopefully, these trials will lead to tangible drug therapies against COVID-19.

It is most heartening to see scientists in academia and industrial partners coming together to fight a monumental public health crisis. The battle between pathogens and humans will continue but let us hope that we win the present one sooner than later.

385,2020/03/25,COVID-19 and a city’s anatomy,"How the virus is changing the world and lives

The public health crisis enveloping the world has spared no city, and Washington, DC, where I am normally based, is no exception.

Soon after returning from his trip to India, the city’s most high-profile resident, U.S. President Donald Trump, held his first COVID-19 press briefing. He announced that Vice President Mike Pence would lead the effort against the virus. That Mr. Pence had been criticised for his public health record as Governor of Indiana added to the growing sense that Mr. Trump was taking things too casually and not responding adequately to the challenge. In the days after the briefing, more changes came to Washington, DC — it was as if people were finally and officially allowed to worry about COVID-19.

“It’s coming towards us,” one man was heard telling his companion on the Circulator, a local bus, referring to a case that had emerged in Rhode Island. Just the day before, the administration had announced a ban on travellers from Iran, and travel advisories for South Korea and Italy.

Spread of the virus

There was an awareness that the virus was stalking DC by the end of the first week of March, as reports of infections at the Conservative Political Action Conference and American Israel Public Affairs Committee emerged. Across the county, in Washington State, schools had closed, leaving many parents, especially those on a lower income or those without family support, wondering what they would do about childcare. By the time schools closed in DC and teleworking had kicked in, another problem had emerged: how would parents work from home and also home-school their children?

While it was only during the week before last that a significant number of offices in DC started moved to teleworking, not everyone could practice social distancing as the virus spread. Some workers did not have a choice about their interactions at work – for instance, the store cashier, the concierge at an apartment building, the cab driver. People in these positions are often minorities or have low incomes, adding to their risks of making it through these times unscathed.

Some who could practice social distancing apparently chose not to. Groups of younger Washingtonians, dressed in green for St. Patrick’s Day, were seen on the streets. Younger people have been criticised in the U.S. for a ‘business as usual’ approach to socialising and taking their Spring Break.

Grey clouds and silver linings

People working in the gig economy or running small business have also been impacted. For instance, Uber drivers reported a loss of passengers and small business owners have had to grapple with letting go of employees to keep their businesses afloat.

At supermarkets, people jostled for space in the aisles, some buying what looked like a month’s worth of groceries, emptying out certain categories of food. Department stores ran out of hand sanitisers, thermometers, and even toilet paper. Notices limiting purchases were seen at several stores in the city.

Last week, Mr. Trump appeared to step up the use of what some have called xenophobic language to describe the pathogen, making references to the “foreign” or “Chinese” virus. This has some foreigners in DC worried. A woman in her early forties, Ellen (last name withheld), whose senior citizen parents were visiting DC from Belgium, told The Hindu that her parents had decided to return to their home, despite Europe being the epicentre of the pandemic. “They didn’t trust the health care system here and the political response,” she said, concerned that ventilators, which the U.S. does not potentially have enough of, would be reserved for U.S. citizens.

However, there are some silver linings to the many grey clouds. People are stepping up to help. For instance, with restaurants closing, Chef José Andrés is converting his outlets into community kitchens. “People have to eat,” Mr. Andreas said, as per The Washington Post. Some stores have reserved hours for those above 60 and other more vulnerable groups.

The virus is changing the world and lives, and DC is no exception.

386,2020/03/25,Services at our doorstep,"Similar to health workers, delivery workers are the new front-line force keeping citizens’ lives running

The ‘ferrymen’ of Wuhan, who have been providing groceries, food and medicines to citizens isolated in their homes, have been the backbone of cities that have been most hit by the novel coronavirus. In China, ride-hailing company Didi and others have a dedicated workforce and resources to provide free transport to health workers. Delivery infrastructure or digitally enabled micro-logistics are key to how citizens navigate their ‘social distanced’ lives during the pandemic.

Delivery technologies are providing a key form of infrastructure that can be mobilised at short notice, dynamically and at scale. The mix of multi-side market economics, an on-demand workforce, and algorithmically managed tasks make this mobilisation possible. This is what enabled Didi to launch food delivery in 21 cities in response to the pandemic. Delivery workers, similar to health workers, are the new front-line force keeping citizens’ lives running.

New protocols

In India, how are companies navigating the threat their delivery personnel are under? Major delivery players in India have responded by publicising consumer awareness, restricting dynamic pricing (Amazon and Flipkart) and contact-less delivery protocols. Ola offers ₹1,000 a day for lost income for up to 21 days for drivers or their family members who contract the virus. Flipkart is reportedly mapping impacted areas to ensure that delivery agents are aware and least affected as they continue to offer relief to elite and middle-class households who have been the first-wave of likely infected citizens.

However, company follow-through is in question. Reports show that delivery platforms have not yet implemented some of these protocols. Indian mobility platforms have not yet offered to extend or waive loans and rental fees for lease drivers like Didi did for China in the month of February.

Digital delivery infrastructure is novel in form because of its socio-technological nature. Companies like Uber, Didi and Swiggy have pushed out a notion that their responsibility is to maintain the ‘technological’ half — hygiene on their apps, keep their algorithms working and offer ‘decent’ payouts to their flexible, contracted workforce. Like with other kinds of infrastructure it appears mute, working efficiently in the background. However, the bodies of delivery personnel remain unnoticed, invisible. Companies use this rhetoric to make consumers like us believe that they can’t do more than these tasks, obfuscating the fact that they can and we can hold them accountable for more than they claim.

Facing risks

It is only when such infrastructure breaks or is in decay that public concern around it grows. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the risk faced by delivery agents. They are unable to take a break from work, work from home, or access the superfluous resources that white-collar and professionals in other fields are deriving from their employers. Delivery personnel face severe exposure to the virus without paid sick leave, without work, and daily payouts. Gig Workers Rising says delivery personnel don’t choose to work during the pandemic but rather, they are being forced to, potentially putting the public at risk. Daily-wage workers in construction will possibly receive compensation from the U.P. government for their lost wages. Yet, platform delivery personnel, who are vital to allowing urban life to continue, have no proposed protections or rewards for their work.

Acknowledging the mix of delivery personnel and app-based delivery companies as infrastructure rather than the sole mandate of private companies can deliver better outcomes for personnel. It nullifies corporate marketing and propels the services into public governance. Indeed, government orders noting the lock-down of many districts note delivery as an essential service in most metros. Recognising the key infrastructural role that delivery personnel are playing in the pandemic opens up a set of responsibilities for the government to take on.

A new reality?

If governments around the world are ready to nationalise key infrastructure (like Spain’s private hospitals), can we use the food delivery workforce to deliver tests or essential medicines to those affected? With the Delhi government banning all dining-in and allowing only delivery, is the pandemic a time to think about a new form of regulation that brings private, socio-technological infrastructure into the public fold in times of crises, eventually to be released back into the forces of the market? Can the app service and app worker’s status as public infrastructure bolster a better interpretation of social protection that lasts beyond this crisis?

387,2020/03/25,"In riot aftermath, it’s scorched health care too","As north-east Delhi shows, a population losing trust in the care system can affect other health-care indicators as well

The impact of riots on health services receives scant attention, more so when there is a communal angle to it. While the narrative around deaths receives some attention, the deeper insidious effects are glossed over. This will also impact not only the health of the population but also crucial medical responses in a time like the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Here is one such story, although not unique.

After the riots in north-east Delhi, in February, a volunteer called our medical team: “Twenty-two-year-old Noor Jahan (all names have been changed), a pregnant woman, is scared to leave her house. Could you please send a doctor to examine her?” On visiting her, we learnt that the woman had lost all her belongings, including her prescriptions and medications, while fleeing her house in Shiv Vihar as it was being torched.

Seeking refuge with her distant relatives and with her delivery date just a week away, she was gripped by fear and anxiety at the prospects of visiting the Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital which was nearby. Anecdotes of the communal hostility her neighbours had faced at this hospital had left her unnerved. She ended up delivering her child at the faraway Sucheta Kriplani hospital, in an unfamiliar environment.

A zone of poor health

North-east Delhi is the most underdeveloped region of Delhi and is marked by all the socio-demographic determinants of poor health outcomes: a significant proportion of the population is from the migrant and minority communities; there are high rates of illiteracy, rampant unemployment and poverty; overcrowding; unsanitary conditions, and a non-existent health-care infrastructure.

Yet, despite the fear, a medical camp in Chand Bagh, set up for a few hours using a mobile van, immediately draws the attention of more than 600 people. While the most common complaints are fever, a runny nose, and body aches, a disconcertingly high proportion of young adults complain of ‘ghabrahat’ (anxiety). On further questioning, they report poor sleep and appetite, inability to concentrate, and experiencing constant worry, all signs of underlying mental health problems. Further, due to adverse social circumstances, many patients with chronic medical conditions have not been able to visit their doctors. We saw several of these patients who now have a worsening of chronic diseases such as elevated blood pressure and asthma.

Naeem, 25, was in agonising pain. He had a deep cut above his left eyebrow, and was bruised all over after having been beaten up by a mob. Yet, he did not see a doctor. Alarmed by the large number of incarcerations, he had stayed at home. His fears were not unfounded. In the follow-up after the riots, the Delhi Police are estimated to have rounded up over a 1,000 individuals, most of them young Muslim men. Interference of the police in health systems and a lack of patient privacy protection laws have changed the health-seeking behaviour of certain sections of the populace.

Zeeshan, 36, had been admitted to hospital with fractures in both legs and a stab wound in his left arm. After two days of hospitalisation, they wanted to discharge him. His pleas to stay on as his house had been vandalised and his health was poor had to be turned down. The resident doctor had to tell him that despite their understanding of his concerns, he had received all the care needed and that as the hospital was overflowing with patients, beds were needed. Zeeshan had to be told that the hospital could not do anything to help him even if he did not have a safe place to go back to.

During our visits to the riot-affected localities, we noted many burned and looted houses. Even more malicious was that goons had damaged water pipes and looted water purifiers. With open drains and an unplanned sewerage system, there is a real threat of Salmonella bacteria seeding these pipes. Salmonella, the bacteria responsible for typhoid fever, will be hard to eliminate. If not managed properly, people will suffer from recurrent typhoid fevers and diarrhoeal infections, leading to downstream consequences such as child malnutrition and antimicrobial resistance.

Way forward is collaborations

These examples demonstrate how the riots have exposed and deepened chasms in the health systems. A broken health system and a population that has lost trust in health-care providers will amplify the challenges of managing the COVID-19 epidemic in Delhi and worsen all other health-care indicators. Rectifying these shall necessitate a deliberate and comprehensive strategy by the State not only at the infrastructure and policy levels but also at the moral and philosophical levels.

The government must collaborate with local municipal bodies, partners in civil society and members of the local community to devise sustainable solutions. They must build a maternity ward with labour room services so that women do not have to travel to faraway, unfamiliar and hostile hospitals to deliver. A mohalla clinic for primary care is a must in the area as demonstrated by large queues outside the medical camps, which are often organised in an ad hoc manner depending on available resources. Psychologists are needed to provide therapy to the riot-affected children, adults and citizens confined to their houses out of fear. Similarly, physiotherapists should be recruited to prevent long-term physical disability. The sewerage systems should be fixed, water pipes restored and measures such as chlorination for water hygiene instituted at a house-to-house basis.

People should be at the core of health systems and policy design. Systems and policies that drive citizens away from hospitals have to go. An initiative by the Delhi government, in the form of the “Farishte Dille Ke” (The Angels of Delhi), offers hope. Similarly, it ought to set an example for other States by changing health-care privacy laws to protect patients from police interference and also empower them to get medical care.

What is most shocking is the loss of trust in health-care providers on account of the communal underpinnings of the situation. In the short run, the medical community and the government should conduct peace marches in north-east Delhi to assuage fears. In the longer run, just like the “happiness curriculum” in schools, it should start a “humanities curriculum” for medical professionals so that they provide more empathetic and compassionate care.

388,2020/03/25,Death by fireworks: on violation of rules in hazardous industries,"Violations of rules in hazardous industries can be tolerated only at the cost of human lives

Unsafe working conditions and improper handling of inflammable raw materials continue to endanger lives in the fireworks industry. Last week, 11 workers were charred at a fireworks unit in Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar district. Police data show that in the past decade, at least 239 people have perished and over 265 injured in 142 accidents in fireworks units. Such tragedies have not been confined to Sivakasi, deemed the fireworks capital of the world, where most such units are concentrated. Illegal cracker units functioning in a few other parts of the State have also led to loss of a significant number of lives. In and around Sivakasi, the manufacturing of firecrackers in makeshift unlicensed units, rough handling of chemicals by untrained and unskilled workers, spillage or overloading of chemicals during the filling process, and working outside permitted areas have been identified as major causes for past accidents. In the recent tragedy too, the workers were engaged in manufacturing ‘fancy aerial crackers’ for which the unit did not have a licence. Preliminary investigations suggest that mishandling of chemicals could have triggered an explosion.

Occasional accidents in an industry dealing in explosive materials may seem inevitable. But the probability of such mishaps can certainly be reduced by adopting safe work practices, complying with rules and through cohesive monitoring by Central and State licensing and enforcement authorities. Crackdowns against violators have been few and far between despite illegal sub-leasing of works to unlicensed cottage units becoming a widely acknowledged practice in the industry. The Tamilnadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association has also complained about the unlicensed units, a parallel industry in itself spread across a dozen villages. The Chaitanya Prasad Committee, which examined, among other things, statutory and administrative shortcomings that led to the death of 40 workers at Om Shakti Fireworks Industries in 2012, noted the “conspicuous absence” of proper inspection mechanisms at various government departments. It also found a lack of coordination between Central and State authorities dealing with the regulation of fireworks industries. The committee recommended making sub-leasing of works by licensed units a cognisable penal offence; mandated inter-safety distances between sheds covered with earthen mounds; and provision of a smoothened pathway with a width of 1.5 metres, as part of industrial safety measures. Ground reports suggest these recommendations continue to be ignored, with sub-leasing of works still rampant. Regulators understandably complain of a lack of manpower in checking violations. The number of players has exponentially grown since the 1980s with 1,070 licensed units employing an estimated 10 lakh workers now. But safety is non-negotiable. The governments must walk the extra mile to enforce rules in a hazardous industry and prosecute violators. The industry too must self-regulate in its own interest.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/death-by-fireworks-on-violation-of-rules-in-hazardous-industries/article31156452.ece
389,2020/03/25,The reign of Shivraj: On Chouhan's fourth term as CM,"The BJP government will have to manage the changed political dynamics in M.P.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on Monday night, proved his majority in the Assembly on Tuesday. This is his fourth term as Chief Minister. After three consecutive terms, he had lost the election in 2018. He mustered the support of 112 MLAs for the trust vote which was hurriedly organised overnight and was missed by 92 Congress MLAs and two independents. Two BSP MLAs, one of the SP, and two independents who were earlier supporting the Congress government that collapsed last week, voted in favour of the trust vote. Mr. Chouhan has said his government’s immediate focus would be in tackling the coronavirus crisis that is testing the capacity and will of the State. He has also asked all MLAs to leave for their constituencies and take the lead in managing the crisis. The downfall of the Congress government was engineered by the resignation of 22 of its MLAs. These and two more seats in the 230-strong State Assembly remain vacant. The actual strength of the government will be tested in and after the by-elections to these seats. It is a different question whether the Congress can regroup itself and challenge the government.

With the return of the BJP government in M.P., the political turn in the State in 2018 has been proven short-lived. The party had faced a setback in M.P., Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh where it lost power to the Congress before bouncing back in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The Congress could not sustain its gains, and has now ended up losing a government. But it goes beyond that and shows the party as a weak challenger to the BJP. To begin with, the Congress victory was nebulous and narrow in M.P., and its fortunes were compromised by debilitating factionalism within. It cannot be a viable political alternative to the BJP unless it gets imaginative in building sustainable and strong social and class coalitions. In places where it has done so, the party has been effective in elections and governance, including in neighbouring Chhattisgarh. The exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who has since joined the BJP, could actually be used as an opportunity by the Congress to promote better rooted leaders from diverse social backgrounds, stepping beyond dilapidating feudal fortresses. The BJP in the State will also need to achieve a new equilibrium, now disrupted with the entry of Mr. Scindia. Mr. Chouhan has emerged as a strong leader, but there are others waiting in the wings too. The change of guard in M.P. will unsettle existing equations in both the parties, beyond State boundaries.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-reign-of-shivraj-on-chouhans-fourth-term-as-cm/article31156451.ece
390,2020/03/25,"Elders, dependent on others for help, at a loss on how to tackle the lockdown","More pain in store for them, say activists

The lockdown has created unexpected problems for the elderly. And, for those living alone, the issues are more stark.

Jothi*, an 88-year-old woman, had a cook coming in daily. Everything was fine until Tuesday. The cook came on her two-wheeler, finished her chores and left.

Now, with the country-wide shutdown, she is afraid to step out.

On Wednesday, she managed to make her way to the workplace but is worried she cannot do it in the days to come.

Ms. Jothi says she cannot ask the cook to stay as the latter has a large family of her own. It took her several months to train the cook and the octogenerian is worried that eating other kinds of food will cause health problems.

Ms. Jothi’s problem can be solved if she is able to contact the tahsildar or the local sub-inspector and explain the position at home by providing a letter, S.M. Chellasamy, treasurer of the Tamil Nadu Elders Welfare Association, said. But Ms. Jothi is wary of letting people know that she lives alone.

A resident of Mylapore, whose mother is bed-ridden after a stroke, has been wondering how to get a physiotherapist to help her.

“She used to undergo physiotherapy daily. But the therapist stopped her visits after the lockdown last week. She is afraid older people will contract infection as she visits many other old patients,” he said.

B. Meenakshi lives in Virugambakkam. Her mother-in-law requires an attendant round-the-clock. Ms. Meenakshi had a paid nurse to tend to her during the day. Following the lockdown, she requested the attendant to stay with the family.

“She is with us for some days. I am planning to call for a replacement next week,” she said. The arrangement would prevent daily visits. Her apartment complex has strict rules about entry of visitors, she added.

Pensioners’ woes

Beyond these concerns, what is worrying is that in the first week of April, elders come to banks to collect their pension, said T. Sadagopan, an activist in Pattabhiram. The pensioners come in large numbers to banks, he said.

“Major nationalised banks such as SBI, Indian Bank and IOB have the largest number of pensioners. People must place their thumb impression to get their pension amount. Does the government have an alternative to this,” he asked.

391,2020/03/25,Metrowater to maintain supply at current level,"With people largely home-bound, no spike in demand seen

Chennai Metrowater plans to maintain supply at the current level, on the ground that demand has not spiked in the city amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

At present, the city is being supplied with 650 million litres of water a day (mld). Of this, nearly 500 mld is being supplied through pipelines. Though frequent hand-washing is being advised to prevent the spread of COVID-19, with most people at home, there is no spike in demand for water so far, according to officials.

“We are monitoring the situation and there has been no marked increase in demand so far. We have adequate resources to sustain water supply through the summer. Poondi reservoir is continuing to receive 470 cusecs of Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh. We are ensuring uninterrupted water supply to the city,” said a senior official.

The water agency is also assisting the civic body in its fumigation drive by helping to hire tankers and fill water from its distribution stations.

It has already helped with 100 trips to carry out disinfection in the city.

The number of trips is expected to be increased to 500 in the next few days, the official added. While Metrowater has reduced administrative functions, it is continuing with operation and maintenance work with minimal staff on a shift basis as per the guidelines.

Personal protective equipment is being procured for field workers, said officials.

“We are operating about 5,000 tanker trips daily. Residents may continue to book for tanker supply on payment through our ‘Dial for water’ online service. Helpline (044-45674567) for grievance redressal is also in place for residents to register their complaints,” said an official.

However, only repair work in the pipeline network would be carried out during the nationwide lock down. Provision of new connections under ‘Azhaithal Inaippu’ scheme, call for bids and construction projects except for few like the maintenance work in Nemmeli desalination plant have been suspended, officials added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metrowater-to-maintain-supply-at-current-level/article31168032.ece
392,2020/03/25,Police to seize two-wheelers of violators from today,"Police chief calls for responsible behaviour to contain COVID-19

City Police Commissioner A.K.Viswanathan has warned that the police will seize bikes of motorists who venture out despite prohibitory orders being in place, with the exception of those who come under the exempted categories.

“On the first day, we appealed to motorists to stay at home. But we will take action from tomorrow,” he said at a press conference on Wednesday on the first day of the lockdown. “Those falling under the exempted categories should carry their office identity cards. Only they will be allowed,” the police chief said.

Reacting to a question on youngsters using the empty roads to race, he warned that this was not a holiday season. “All of us should behave responsibly to prevent the spread of the disease. People at home should advise the youngsters and ensure that they follow the rules. If they don’t, strict action will be taken,” he said. The police registered three cases against people who violated prohibitory orders. While one case was in Seven Wells Police Station limits, two were registered and five youngsters arrested and released on bail in Choolaimedu police station limits.

Regarding quarantined people who step out of their homes, he said that they had been booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule), Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act and Section 51(b) of the Disaster Management Act. He said that people can also alert the police if they find that their neighbour has symptoms and is hesitant to reveal it. Their identity will not be revealed.

“A total of 30 teams comprising police, health and Corporation officials have been formed to track the quarantined persons,” he said. He said that protective gear has been procured and will be provided to police stations when a need arises.

Few vehicles on the road

On the first day of the lockdown, a majority of the people stayed indoors but a few cars and bikes were still on the road. At a few places, policemen were seen appealing to the motorists not to venture out. On Anna Salai and Radha Krishnan Salai, policemen were seen with folded hands asking people not to come out. One motorist even fell at the feet of a police inspector on Anna Salai. However, in many places motorists complained that the checking was not done properly. “There were barricades, but policemen were not checking. If people are allowed to roam outside the purpose of the lockdown will not be fulfilled,” said Rehna, a resident of Poonamallee High Road. A senior police officer clarified that there were 10 check points on the city’s border. “Apart from essential services, other vehicles are not allowed to enter or leave the city. In the city, barricades are placed every 500 m, but checking is done every 1.5 km,” said the officer.

Despite workers of essential departments like electricity, Secretariat, civic body and transport being allowed to function during the lockdown, several Tangedco workers complained about police harassment.

A senior official of Tangedco said though the City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan had instructed police officials to allow electricity staff to pass after showing their cards, a few policemen were harassing the operations and maintenance staff.

393,2020/03/25,One major private hospital in a block to be a COVID-19 facility,"A hospital in a block to be specialised

Outlining the strategy to be adopted in the private sector to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said the government was exploring the idea of taking one major hospital in a block — with 200 to 300 patients — and converting it into a specialised unit to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients.

“We are planning to do this in order to not expose other patients in hospitals to the infection. Not all hospitals in the private sector may have facilities that will allow for isolation, segregation and be able to follow the stringent protocols that we specify. So we have decided to take one major hospital in each block, in tier 1, 2 and 3 cities and have them take all cases, as and when necessary,” he said.

He held meetings with hospital representatives in the city, including those from MIOT Hospital, MGM, Saveetha, Fortis Malar, Billroth, Kauvery and Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre. All private hospitals expressed their willingness to co-operate with the State government in dealing with the pandemic.

Already, Apollo Hospitals and CMC Vellore have been co-opted into government efforts to test and treat people.

394,2020/03/25,"Police launch apps to track, help, record location of home quarantined persons","Cobuddy, launched by Tiruvallur police, has a facial recognition feature

The Tiruvallur police have launched a platform, that includes an application with facial recognition features, to communicate and track those under home quarantine.

A total of 15,298 people are under home quarantine in the State. Since Tuesday the police have booked three persons, in Kodambakkam, Koyambedu and Anna Nagar, for leaving their homes despite being quarantined for having symptoms.

In Tiruvallur district, a total of 171 persons are under home quarantine. Hence the Tiruvallur district police, with NotionTag Technologies, have launched Cobuddy — a platform which includes a mobile app for tracking the quarantined.

This will help the government track, communicate effectively and eventually coordinate delivery of essentials to the doorsteps of the quarantined person. Once the person downloads the application, he will have to take a picture of himself to register. “The application will help the police and health officials to track the quarantined person. Besides, the person cannot leave the phone at home and sneak out as random messages will be sent throughout the day asking him to click photograph for face recognition based attendance,” said P. Aravindan, Superintendent of Police, Tiruvallur.

Besides, the platform can also be used by the health workers to monitor the condition of the quarantined person and communicate with them. “They can get feedback on their health. There will also be a SOS button for the quarantined. The platform will also have a heat map indicating places where the quarantined persons are located,” said Vijay Gnanadesikan, director, NotionTag Technologies.

Another app

Meanwhile COVID - 19 Quarantine Monitor application, developed jointly with the help of Chennai-based Pixxon AI Solutions, an artificial intelligence solution provider for video surveillance, was launched by K. Jayant Murali, ADGP Law and Order, on Wednesday.

“The details about quarantined persons will be collected from the Health department and messages will go to all of them asking them to download the application. Once this is done, it will give the exact location of the person. Through this system, the police and health officials can check whether the person is moving out. We will then advise them not to go out,” said Rohith Nathan, Superintendent of Police, Sivaganga.

This application was the brainchild of Mr. Rohith Nathan.

T. Muthu Kumar, CTO, Pixxon AI Solution and Girish Ramaswamy, partner, said that the application will assist the police in monitoring and this is not for the use of general public.

396,2020/03/25,"Corpn. allows online firms to deliver groceries, essentials","Commissioner insists on contactless delivery by staff

The ban on operation of food delivery services such as Swiggy and Zomato has given rise to confusion over whether delivery of groceries, milk and vegetables — through applications such as Big Basket and Amazon Pantry — fall under ‘essential services’.

Several instances of trucks of groceries and vegetables being stopped and delivery executives harassed by the police were also reported.

However, Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash clarified that delivery operations of groceries and vegetables would be allowed in Chennai on the condition that the staff followed protocols of “contactless” delivery.

Protocols a must

He said that staff of delivery companies should use personal protective equipment like masks, gloves and caps, right from production to delivery.

“No contact delivery should be followed at delivery locations. Companies that break the protocols at any point of inspection will be barred from delivering further,” he said, adding, ""companies that break the protocols at any point of inspection will be barred from delivering further.""

Sanjay Dasari, whose company Sunny Bee sells and delivers essential farmers’ produce to other businesses and individual customers, said that he was working with local authorities to obtain necessary permits to make it safe for staff and products to be delivered safely by Thursday.

Big Basket and Amazon Pantry online delivery portals informed app users that deliveries had been stopped due to the lockdown and that they were working with authorities to get the services back up.

“We are unable to do non-milk essential deliveries for a few days due to restrictions imposed by authorities on movement of goods and people. There are clear guidelines provided by the government to enable essential services. We are working with relevant authorities to enable operations for the same as soon as possible.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday assured people that the government had made arrangements to ensure the supply of essential commodities such as vegetables, milk, meat, medicine and other provisions.

During his televised address to the people of the Stat, he said that they need not panic, as arrangements had been made to ensure smooth supply of essentials. He reiterated that people should exercise physical distancing, even while going out for essential supplies.

The 21-day lockdown across the country by the Centre was “not a vacation”, but a government order for safety of each family, he said. Since district borders were closed, he requested people against going out of station.

“Those who have arrived from foreign countries should voluntarily come forward to exercise self-quarantine. If they fail to do so, family members, relatives, neighbours can alert local bodies, the Health Department or the police,” he said. Reiterating the importance of washing hands, the Chief Minister said that handkerchiefs should be used while coughing or sneezing and strongly advised against crowding.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to provide a special assistance of ₹4,000 crore to the State for taking precautionary measures and financial relief measures over the loss being caused by COVID-19.

While funds to the tune of ₹3,000 crore were needed for strengthening the health infrastructure and for essential equipment and medicines, ₹500 crore was needed to pay 50% wages for the wage employment lost in March, and expected to be lost in April and May. Another ₹500 crore was needed for providing a relief package for workers of the unorganised sector in the State.

In this unprecedented situation, the government’s revenues had also taken a hit and the expenditure needs had risen considerably, he said, requesting that the fiscal deficit limits of 3% of GSDP be relaxed for the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21. The lockdown for 21 days would add to the huge strain that the economy of the State had already been put under, he noted.

Further, an additional borrowing of 33% above the level permitted for the fiscal year 2019-20 may be allowed for 2020-21, to enable States to meet the additional expenditure requirements, the Chief Minister said.

Since a large number of industries and businesses, especially MSMEs, faced considerable loss of production, and cash flow was heavily constrained, making it very difficult for them to meet their tax and bank loan interest payments, Mr. Palaniswami sought the rescheduling of bank loan repayments, at least for two quarters, without treating them as NPAs.

Many businesses, especially MSMEs, were facing a difficult situation, and “would face collapse without adequate and timely support”, he pointed out, and said: “We eagerly await the announcement of the economic and financial relief package,” he said.

Pointing out that the supply of PDS commodities was to be ensured, he requested that stocks of foodgrains available with the FCI be released to the States and Tamil Nadu, at BPL rates.

“Tamil Nadu is vulnerable to the virus, because a large number of international passengers transit through the four international airports and the four major ports in the State. Tamil Nadu also adjoins States where the outbreak has initially been more severe. Hence, while immediate measures have been taken, we will need to prepare for a significantly higher case load in the coming weeks and months,” he said.

Listing out the efforts being taken by Tamil Nadu in the fight against COVID-19, he said that 10,000 beds had been earmarked in government and private hospitals, as isolation wards, across the State. “We have scaled up procurement of requisite medical equipment, including ventilators, hospital beds and PPE, drugs and medicines and deployment of health human resources,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iv4k82/article31167798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THECR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/state-to-ensure-supply-of-essentials-seeks-4000-cr-from-centre/article31167799.ece
399,2020/03/25,Pregnant women to be monitored,"In the wake of the COVID-19 disease, the Health Department has taken measures to closely monitor pregnant women who have their expected dates of delivery in the next two months.

“We have drawn up plans at micro and macro levels to take care of pregnant women who have their expected dates of delivery over the next two months. We have identified a total of 1.5 lakh pregnant women, of whom 11,000 are at high risks. We will follow them up regularly,” said Health Secretary Beela Rajesh. Village health nurses will conduct follow-ups on the women, she said, adding: “Each VHN will follow up a maximum of 20 pregnant women. They will call them everyday over the phone. In case of high-risk pregnant women, they will be brought to the district-level Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care centres. For others, we have asked primary health centres (PHC) to be ready to receive them. Vehicles at the PHCs will bring them to the facilities. These are drop-off vehicles which will now pick them up,” she added.”

In addition to this, to avoid exposure to persons reporting to these healthcare facilities with fever, the Department has scheduled antenatal clinics in the afternoon. “The general OP functions in the morning, during which persons with fever may walk in. We are re-altering and re-working to ensure that pregnant women are not exposed to those with fever,” she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pregnant-women-to-be-monitored/article31167753.ece
400,2020/03/25,Special care for Chennai residents in the times of Corona,"Two neighbourhood associations express their concern in simple but definitive ways

In these times, residents may pointedly look in the direction of their Associations for guidance and leadership, and also some measures that will make the mundane aspects of life easier to handle. This scenario can be readily associated with gated communities, where, by dint of their very nature, this expectation is usually high, and bound to be higher now.

So, when a neighbourhood association watches out for its residents in an unusual manner, it is more of a heartening thing. And in these times, such gestures can be quite a balm — residents of these two neighbourhoods can't agree more.

Recently, the neighbourhood association at Vivekanandapuram First Street placed a bulk order for hand sanitizers — not a case of hoarding here — so that residents would be spared the trouble of making multiple trips to the pharmacy. The order is said to have been made for the benefit of all households in the neighbourhood.

S. Murali, the Association's president, says “As we bought one hundred 500-ml sanitizers, we got a huge discount from the pharmacy.”

While residents have to pay for the sanitizers, some sanitizers have been kept aside for free distribution to conservancy workers.

Handy lists

Annai Indira Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Velachery recently went to the trouble of finding out about the provision stores in the neighbourhood and its precincts, that are open (and have not shut down temporarily on account of the lockdown) and making a list of them. Similarly, a list of pharmacies that can be expected to be open till late in the day were also listed. These lists were then shared on the Association’s WhatsApp group to ensure residents don't have to beat around the neighbourhood looking for some essentials they may want.

“Not all provision stores are opened now at Annai Indira Nagar. Therefore, we thought of sharing information about those stores that can be expected to be open. Pharmacies are indispensable, and so we also got list of them done. We have advised residents to keep the bills issued by the shops with them so that they can show it to the police as proof that they stepped out of home for an entirely valid reason,” says S. Kumararaja, an office-bearer of the Association.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/n5b0wy/article31165448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dcspray,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/special-care-for-chennai-residents-in-the-times-of-corona/article31165449.ece
401,2020/03/25,Valasaravakkam resident supports the local police in campaign to check Coronavirus spread,"Dheenadayalan is said to look for opportunities to help the khaki-clad personnel

The local police can count on him to lend them a helping hand whenever they launch any new initiative in the locality, be it increased patrolling or a new traffic decongestion measure.

That is 42-year-old M. Dheenadayalan, a resident of Valsaravakkam and a friend of the local police force. He interacts with the police personnel with the easy familiarly of a long-time associate. In his garage, he repairs the vehicles of the local police – the patrol jeeps and the official vehicles of police vehicles. It is a work he has been carrying out since 1996, but his popular standing with the local police derives from their view of him as an enabler.

A week ago, when the local police were putting their heads together on how to run a campaign highlighting the need for social distancing and taking all the other precautionary measures to stop the spread of the novel Coronavirus, Dheenadayalan pitched in with an offer of support.

He took up the work of having posters and pamphlets printed for the campaign, and met the costs involved.

“Dheenadayalan is a socially conscious resident of the locality. After getting the nod of our higher-ups, we supported his move to provide free pamphlets on COVID-19. For such campaigns, we primarily use such awareness materials sourced from the government stores, but what he offered has been of help too,” says M. Selvam, inspector (traffic wing), Valasaravakkam police station.

Dheenadayalan is also said to have joined with the local police, going from door-to-door and heading to busy junctions, to assist them in the campaign.

The posters and pamphlets, which carry the messages provided by the local police, were distributed not only within the Valasaravakkam police station limits, but also in areas under the jurisdiction of a few other police stations -- Virugambakkam, Royala Nagar, West Mambalam and Vadapalani – that are in the T. Nagar Police District.

Royapettah police also benefited from his generosity, receiving over 1,000 pamphlets on COVID-19.

Dheenadalayan, a mechanic who moved from Triplicane to Vasalavakkam many years ago, sets aside three to four hours every day towards helping the local police in traffic regulation, helmet awareness campaign and similar work.

During the 2019 monsoon, he gave away rain coats to around 100 police personnel, drawn from Valasaravakkam, Royala Nagar and West Mambalam police stations.

“As I am working with the police for many years, repairing their vehicles, I understand them better than most other residents in the locality. So, I wanted to help them and others in a small way,” says Dheenadalayan.

The larger campaign

In this COVID-19 awareness campaign by the police stations under the T. Nagar police district, key junctions and roads in the region, including Mega Mart junction in Alwarthirunagar, Nesapakkam Main Road, Arasan tree junction, Arcot Road, Porur junction, Ashok Pillar, South and North Usman Road, Duraiswamy subway and Vadapalani junction, were covered.

Each police station was provided with at least one sound system for the purpose. Police patrol vehicles with hand-held speakers ensured the messages were echoed well into the interior streets in the T. Nagar police district.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/olwtyo/article31161610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dcvalsarvakkam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/valasaravakkam-resident-supports-the-local-police-in-campaign-to-check-coronavirus-spread/article31161611.ece

The Greater Chennai Corporation has rescued a 65-year-old Japanese man who was found roaming on the streets near Albert Theatre, on Wednesday.

According to police, Satoro Somaya (65) was found by Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) officials in Egmore.

The Shelter for Urban Homeless team, under the Greater Chennai Corporation, has rescued and accommodated close to 2,200 homeless persons and those stranded in the city in the wake of the lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “The number will increase from Wednesday as buses have been stopped,” said an official.

As on date, homeless persons have been accommodated in 46 shelters. “We have got them to stay in community halls too. Since Tuesday, many migrant workers have been coming in.

407,2020/03/25,Those violating home quarantine will face action: Health Minister,"we will take stringent action and block their passports, says Vijayabaskar

Persons who violate home quarantine instructions and are found moving out of their homes will face stringent action under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, and their passports would be blocked, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar warned on Tuesday.

“When we analyse the 18 patients, who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the State, we found that there is transmission from husband to wife, wife to husband and son to mother. This is why we have been repeatedly insisting on following the instructions issued for home quarantine. The respective Collectors, Superintendents of Police are monitoring those under home quarantine. We have put up stickers on their houses and posted homeguards outside their homes. Despite all these measures, we are finding people violating the quarantine instructions,” he told reporters.

As on date, a total of 15,298 persons are under home quarantine across the State.

He said the government would not remain spectators if such violations continued.

“At this stage, Tamil Nadu needs to do this. Those who travelled from abroad have to mandatorily isolate themselves and stay at home for 28 days. If not, we will take stringent action and block their passports. There are provisions to take action under the Public Health Act,” he cautioned.

The special, exclusive hospital for COVID-19 patients at the Omandurar Government Multi Specialty Hospital will be ready to take patients from Friday, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said about 40 ventilators have been installed, and the hospital has on its rolls 178 doctors, 192 nurses, 80 paramedical technical staff, 150 housekeeping staff and security personal to attend to patients. There are a total of 220 isolation beds, 130 intensive care beds, 38 ventilators, a 24x7 emergency clinic, laboratory services, a team of civil and electrical people, generator back up, dietary services.

He also sought to explain his statement on the floor of the House on Tuesday that the epidemic was spreading like wild fire. “Some have interpreted that to claim I said we have entered community transmission. That is not at all the case. Of the 18 cases in Tamil Nadu, we have established travel history with 16 and in two cases, it was contact with people who had travelled abroad.”

“In fact,” he added, “I was referring to the progress of the epidemic globally. We have the data on number of cases, on a 15-day interval, beginning January 21, this year. The statistics show clearly that there has been a massive, exponential growth from Day 45. If this is the pattern globally, in nations badly affected by the epidemic, then we better be prepared to face this onslaught as well.” (See table)

Door delivery of drugs

The Minister also added that for patients with chronic conditions including HIV, TB, and insulin-dependent diabetics, the government’s hospital-on-wheels will deliver two-months’ drugs at their doorstep. In case they face any problems, they may approach the district administration for assistance.

The government was running a trial to use drones to disinfect large complexes.

409,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Tamil Nadu to geo-fence thousands of quarantined people,"Mobile app to monitor health status live

Thousands of people who are quarantined with symptoms of COVID-19, a majority of them with a foreign travel history in the last two months, across the State, will be linked in a mobile application designed to access their location live and restrict their movement with geo-fence technology.

In a joint operation, the Department of Health & Family Welfare and Tamil Nadu police accessed the details of at least 60,000 passengers who travelled abroad since February 1, 2020. The names with contact particulars were sent to the respective city/district in the State asking police/health officials to check the health status of the passengers and their family members.

“The immigration authorities have the details of passengers who arrived from foreign countries. We will make sure that these passengers who were advised isolation or home quarantine adhere to the health advisory. A special team will closely monitor their location and health condition. The geo-fence facility will alert us if the quarantined people move out of the designated place of isolation,” Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.

He said prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code would certainly help in breaking the chain of Corona virus spread in the community. Asked about senior citizens living alone, the Minister said all District Collectors were advised to do the needful to the elderly calling district helpline numbers for any assistance.

The app that can be downloaded on iOS and Android is part of a comprehensive technology solution mooted by a young IPS officer R. Rohith Nathan, Superintendent of Police, Sivaganga, and his wife Dr. Kaveri Subbiah, a paediatrician, to the Government of India last fortnight. The model was designed to track people who came in contact with those infected or having severe symptoms of COVID-19.

Though the plan includes analysis of the digital footprints of confirmed or suspected patients by perusing call details, tower locations to shortlist those who came in close contact with them, the State initially plans to launch geo-fence to control the spread of the virus and protect the uninfected population. There would be a feature for health officials to make a video call to a particular patient to check his/her health status live and prescribe medicines accordingly, official sources said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vao2zh/article31157933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THGEOFENCING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/state-to-geo-fence-thousands-of-quarantined-people/article31157934.ece
410,2020/03/25,Medical internship to be extended,"DME instructs deans to extend CRRI by a month

Medical interns, whose one-year Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship (CRRI) comes to an end on March 28, will now have to work for another month in the wake of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The Directorate of Medical Education (DME) has instructed deans of all medical colleges to extend the internship by one month for all CRRIs.

In a circular issued on Tuesday, the DME has instructed all deans to give an extension of one month for all CRRIs completing their posting this month, and also arrange for immediate posting of the new batch of CRRIs. The existing batch comprises nearly 3,000 interns.

An official said the interns were doctors entering the service, and it was important for them to continue to be in service at a crucial time like this. “This is an epidemic. So, they will continue to be in service. They will help the doctors and be involved in patient care services. We will provide all protective equipment for them,” he said.

The new batch of interns, also known as house surgeons, have been asked to join on March 26. “The existing batch has been trained for a year. But the new students will need training. We will train them in the meantime and get them ready,” he added.

However, this has raised many doubts among the CRRIs. CRRIs of the Tamil Nadu Medical Students Association said as of now, there is no clarity on what basis the internship period is being extended. “We understand this is for COVID-19 management. As per our bond, CRRI is for 365 days. With this extension, we do not know if we will be junior residents, what our salary will be, and our accommodation,” an intern in one of the government medical college hospitals said.

In one district, a women’s hostel was being vacated for being converted into a quarantine facility, and the students were moved to other hostels. “This is leading to overcrowding. What will happen if three or four students are put in a single room. This will increase the risk of infection,” a CRRI said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aaco2e/article31157901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THMEDICALPROFESSIONAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/medical-internship-to-be-extended/article31157903.ece

Passengers wanting to leave the city had assembled in bus stops at Taramani, Velachery, Tambaram, and Perungalathur to take the long distance buses. Buses from STC Villupuram operated from Adyar Indira Nagar depot were packed with commuters.

L. Abishek, who had postponed his travel after not getting any bus on Monday, said there were quite a number of buses operated on Tuesday and the buses were not packed with commuters.

A senior official of the State Transport department said more than 500 buses of State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) and Villupuram State Transport Corporation were operated from the city to various destinations.

Many buses were empty

The senior official said unlike the scenes witnessed on Monday night, the authorities had to operate over 400 MTC buses to various places such as Kancheepuram, Tiruvannamalai and Tiruchi on Tuesday and most of the long distance buses did not even have minimum passengers. However, the transport authorities shut the Koyambedu bus terminus by 4 p.m. well ahead of the lockdown time of 6 p.m.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/t9usr8/article31157801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THCMBT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/transport-department-operates-a-number-of-long-distance-buses-to-clear-rush/article31157802.ece
413,2020/03/25,Corpn. to keep tabs on those under home quarantine,"‘Violators will be taken to government quarantine facilities’

Chennai Corporation officials and the police will gather information from neighbours about home quarantined persons stepping out of homes. Residents welfare associations have been advised to take necessary measures for social distancing, officials said today.

Once the Corporation officials find that the residents on home quarantine have come out of their homes before the stipulated time, the persons will be taken to government quarantine facilities. In case people have information about such people wandering during the quarantine period, they can call the Corporation Control Room at 044-25384520, and inform the officials.

The Chennai Corporation has readied 400 beds in hospitals such as Communicable Diseases Hospital in Tondiarpet, secondary care facilities in Injambakkam, Tiruvottiyur and Manali.

Chennai Corporation Commissioner G.Prakash said “one infected person can spread the infection to one lakh persons. Zonal officers and health officers, be ruthless in your approach. If you are soft, you are violating your professional ethics. Being ruthless and strict is the only option. We will have to teach those who violate norms a lesson. Otherwise they will spread the disease. Be strict in quarantine follow up. When you shut down an establishment, officials should not have any ulterior motive.”

It has also started shutting down IT companies that fail to adhere to ""social distancing norms"" to contain the spread of COVID-19. According to the government order for COVID-19 infection prevention and control, exempted industries have been permitted to operate at 50% of the strength on rotation basis.

Persons have to maintain a distance of one metre, as part of the social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Mr.Prakash said all the 4,196 residents in the city on home quarantine have to be advised to remain indoors. The civic officials are also exploring options of geo tagging such persons on home quarantine.

Responding to civic officials who pointed to instances of residents in high income neighbourhoods violating home quarantine, Deputy Commissioner (Health) Madhusudan Reddy said, “The police will accompany the Corporation workers to homes where residents have been quarantined. Those who violate home quarantine norms will be brought to government quarantine homes, which will be a hospital or a hostel or a school. We can send the message very strongly to the people that these officials of Corporation will go to any extent to lock you down under the existing rules,” Mr.Reddy added.

On Tuesday, Chennai Corporation shut down an IT company in south Chennai after officials found that the risk of spread of COVID-19 was high because the company permitted crowding of employees on its premises. The employees were allowed to work, sitting in close proximity. Chennai Corporation officials who analysed the data of the company found that the employees were frequent travellers who increase the risk of spread of COVID-19.

Six hours after the premises was sealed by the Chennai Corporation, the IT management agreed to adhere to social distancing norms, following which Chennai Corporation officials desealed the premises.

Chennai Corporation on Tuesday shut down most of its office buildings, asking residents to communicate through social media such as Twitter and Facebook, However, Ripon Buildings will remain open 24X7 to facilitate COVID-19 prevention.

At a meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Prakash directed the police to allow the functioning of pharma companies in areas such as Manali, to facilitate supply of medicines. Many police personnel have ordered the pharma companies to shut down, demanding No Objection Certificate from the Chennai Corporation. ""Such companies have been allowed to operate. So there is no need for NoC,"" he said. In the case of Chennai, Chennai Corporation Commissioner is the competent authority to decide whether a service is essential.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/v5rweb/article31157793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th25chennai-corporationcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-to-keep-tabs-on-those-under-home-quarantine/article31157794.ece
414,2020/03/25,Chennai goes into lockdown,"Eight entry points to city closed; streets deserted

The usually bustling city wore a deserted look since Tuesday evening after the State came under a complete lockdown as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Policemen took over the streets after 6 p.m. to enforce Section 144 of Cr.PC and announcements were made on public address systems asking people to stay indoors.

As a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced restrictive measures in the State from 6 p.m on Tuesday till March 31. The public and private transport, including autorickshaws and taxis, will not be allowed to ply. There will be no inter-district and inter-State transport. Shops selling groceries, milk, vegetables, poultry and fish will remain open. All other shops should be shut.

In the evening, Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan issued the order under Section 144 of Cr.PC prohibiting assembly of more than five persons at public places in Greater Chennai police limits from 6 p.m. on March 24 to 6 a.m on April 1. Those who contravene the order will be subject to prosecution under IPC.

Speaking to media, Mr. Viswanathan said that eight entry points into the city will be closed. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said that only retail traders will be allowed into Koyambedu market. “If thousands enter the market, our sanitisation efforts will not bear fruit,” he said. Many thronged the vegetable markets and groceries since morning to stock up vegetables and essential commodities. After 6 p.m, the number of vehicles and people on the road gradually started reducing and by 8 p.m., the streets became deserted. The usually bustling Dr. MGR Chennai Central Railway Station wore a deserted look and usual sound of blaring train announcements fell silent. All the entries into the station were blocked by the police personnel. “I have never seen the station so empty in my lifetime. This shows the intensity of the problem,” said a policeman

No MTC buses

Though the lockdown was supposed to be from 6 p.m., MTC buses returned to their respective termini by 2 p.m. The Dr. MGR bus terminus was also shutdown around 4 p.m. and the entry points were barricaded. “On Tuesday alone, close to 500 inter-district buses were operated for people to reach their home towns,” said an official from the transport department.

Though the beaches were already shut for the public already, the arterial Kamarajar Salai was also barricaded and policemen advised the motorists to reach home at the earliest and stay indoors. The traffic police utilised two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter to patrol the service lane. On Anna Salai too, the police asked shop keepers, other than those permitted, to down the shutters.

At important junctions, including Nandanam, policemen, with the help of public address systems, warned people to stay indoors and explained about the intensity of the virus. “If you are safe, your family will be safe. If you venture out, you are not only bringing danger upon yourself, but also on others,” said one of the messages.

Lines in front of shops

In Tiruvallur, the police will be making announcements through public address system and asking people to stay indoors. Tiruvallur police is planning to draw lines in front of shops selling essential commodities to ensure social distancing.

“People can purchase essential commodities. To regularise the crowd in front of these shops, we will be drawing lines in front of the shops. We will take action if more than three persons gather on the road,” said P. Aravindan, Superintendent of Police, Tiruvallur.

Meanwhile, B. Shamoondeswari, Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram, said that a total of 32 teams, comprising a policeman, one revenue and one health official, has been formed. “They have been allotted different parts of the district and they will monitor ATMs and shops selling essential commodities. Lines have been drawn outside shops to ensure people maintain social distancing,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/w87bgz/article31157762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THCORONALOCKDOWN6,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-goes-into-lockdown/article31157763.ece
415,2020/03/25,Airport abuzz ahead of suspension of flights,"Hundreds of passengers thronged the Chennai airport to leave the city and fares went up manifold as the city prepared for a lockdown. Domestic flight operations were suspended from midnight. As soon as the announcement came, by around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, many rushed to the airport and by midnight, nearly 10,500 people flew out of the city to different destinations and about 8,500 people arrived here. This continued the whole of Tuesday as well, airport sources said.

Usually, passenger traffic will be about 35,000-40,000; but after the outbreak of COVID-19, in the last few weeks, the traffic had dipped significantly and only 8,000-10,000 travelled. But on Monday, there was a sharp rise and the number touched nearly 19,000, sources said.

According to officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI), on Tuesday too, the domestic terminal witnessed a spurt in traffic. “We will know the exact number of people who travelled on Tuesday only after monitoring for a 24 hour period,” an official said. There were also many who came to the airport and left, deeply disappointed, as the flights were cancelled in the last minute. “If the flight capacity is low, then the airline cancelled the service and it has become a huge problem for passengers,” he added.

Flight fares that had nosedived after the COVID-19 outbreak went up manifold suddenly. Till recently, the flight fare from Chennai to Bengaluru was around ₹ 900-1,000, suddenly it spiked to ₹ 3,200-3,500. Similarly, the fare to New Delhi that was about ₹ 3,000 has now gone up to as much as ₹8,000-₹ 9,000. The fare to Hyderabad that was ₹1,200 till recently grew as high as ₹7,000. “Now, there is no other means to travel to places like Delhi as trains have been cancelled. So, we saw that people are prepared to pay any amount and get back to their hometown now,” a source said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/airport-abuzz-ahead-of-suspension-of-flights/article31157752.ece
416,2020/03/25,Apartments in Chennai frame strict rules for residents,"Some of them have barred entry to domestic helps, cooks

Resident welfare associations in many complexes have issued advisories following the threat of COVID-19 infection. Some are in total lockdown, while others have laid down stringent rules.

Ganga Sridhar, a resident of Dwaraka in Mandaveli that houses six flats, said the gates remained locked all day. Of the two elderly security staff, one had been sent on leave. The other lived on the campus as he had no family. All domestic helps had been given leave. Everything, from milk to courier items, is dropped in numbered baskets at the gate.

The challenge is keeping the children engaged, she said. Since there are elders and children, including toddlers, they have to be careful, Ms. Ganga said.

Sobha Merrita Owners Association managing committee member P. Jayakumar said handwash and hand sanitisers were being provided at the gate. Their advisories keep track of the changes regularly.

“We decided not to allow vendors inside. Earlier, vendors were allowed twice a week inside the premises. Now, we ask residents to go to the gate and make their purchases. We have many senior citizens and our association is helping them get essentials and medicines,” he said. The association closed the swimming pool and gym over a week ago. Even walking within the campus is restricted.

Villa Espana Residents Welfare Association (VERWA) has issued three guidelines since March 22. From banning car wash to vacating and moving in, they have decided newspapers will be left at the gate and picked up by residents later. They have also issued an advisory to all to give their domestic help and cooks leave till March 31.

In the first advisory, the association said 22 delivery boys came to the complex every day.

A complex with four apartments in Madipakkam has taken similar precautions. “We have more senior citizens than youngsters. So we have decided to bar entry of all people. We decided to buy newspapers on our own instead of having them delivered,” said Dharani Ravi, a resident.

A township in Sholinganallur with around 1,500 houses has instructed residents to not allow domestic help and housekeeping staff. This is in addition to its earlier advisory. “The first thing to be cut was the biometric entry for residents. We now ask the security to open the gates,” a resident said.

In an apartment complex in Saligramam, residents have been instructed to hand over clothes for ironing over the compound wall.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/apartments-in-chennai-frame-strict-rules-for-residents/article31157746.ece

419,2020/03/25,Collector warns people against violating rules during lockdown,"Seventy-four persons are in home quarantine in Tiruvannamalai district

With the view to prevent the spread of coronavirus, restrictions have been imposed by the Tamil Nadu government across the State. These came into effect from 6 p.m. on March 24 and will be in force till 6 a.m. on April 1.

Some rules which people have to adhere to during the lockdown are: no public or private transport, including auto and taxis will be allowed. Inter-district and intra-state transport will also be shut.

All shops, except those dealing in essentials like groceries, milk, vegetables, poultry and fish, will remain closed. Construction work, except those required for emergency purposes, will be stopped. But workers must be paid wages during this period.

Announcing the modalities of the lockdown announcement made by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday, Tiruvannamalai Collector K.S. Kandasamy said 15 entry points to the district and 26 village checkposts would be manned by officials from health, revenue and police to screen the passengers as well as the stocks being to the district.

He said during the lockdown period, meeting of five or more persons is prohibited.

Those violating the rule would be arrested and prosecuted accordingly, he warned. Seventy-four people were in home quarantine in the district and they are being monitored by health officials, he said. Stickers attached with geotags have been pasted on doors and the wrist bands of quarantined individuals for monitoring purposes, Mr. Kandasamy said.

He sought the cooperation of the people to prevent the spread of the virus in the coming days, which he claimed were crucial.

422,2020/03/25,HC's administrative committee to take a call on functioning of courts,"Committee comprising top seven judges would meet again

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lock down from midnight to fight the pandemic COVID-19, Madras High Court officials said, the Administrative Committee comprising top seven judges would meet again to decide whether courts across the State would continue restricted hearing of cases or suspend their operations for some days.

It was only on Monday that the committee decided that all courts would continue to function and hear extremely urgent cases alone despite promulgation of prohibitory orders by the State government under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure from Tuesday. The committee ruled against shutting the doors of the court though there were requests to that effect.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justices Vineet Kothari, R. Subbiah, M. Sathyanarayanan, N. Kirubakaran, M.M. Sundresh and T.S. Sivagnanam decided that the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai as well as its Madurai Bench shall function with just two Division Benches and three single benches for next three weeks and that judges would be deputed on rotation basis.

The cause list (list of cases to be heard by the court on a given day) was also reduced from over 520 pages to just around 20 pages and the Chief Justice issued a slew of orders and circulars aimed at restricting the court proceedings and causing minimum trouble to its staff during the imposition of prohibitory orders by the State government under Section 144 of Cr.P.C.

The CJ made it clear that until the situation normalises, all anticipatory bail petitions should be filed first before the jurisdictional principal district and sessions courts. It is only if such petitions get dismissed by the district courts, should the lawyers and litigants approach the High Court, a circular issued on his instructions read.

Pointing out that public prosecutors in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai as well as its Madurai Bench would find it difficult to obtain instructions from policemen spread across the State during imposition of prohibitory orders, the Chief Justice said, it would be far easier for prosecutors in district courts to obtain instructions from the local police.

He also went around the High Court premises on Tuesday morning and made sure that social distancing was maintained in each of the seven court halls where restricted number of cases were being heard. He further ordered that each of the restricted number of seven court halls were located at a safe distance from each other to avoid crowding of lawyers in the corridors.

In a separate circular, Registrar General C. Kumarappan ordered that only minimal number of staff should be deputed for the court proceedings on rotation basis. He also informed the court staff regarding transport arrangements made by the court administration to pick them up and drop them from places close to their residence.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hcs-administrative-committee-to-take-a-call-on-functioning-of-courts/article31156963.ece
423,2020/03/25,Ironing out wrinkles in India’s pandemic response,"Some critical weaknesses in the country’s health system can come in the way of a credible strategy to combat COVID-19

Much concern about the novel coronavirus in India is understandably about the number of cases and related deaths. It is important to remember that the vast majority (80%) of COVID-19 cases will be mild. The estimated mortality rate varies considerably between 3% to 0.25% of cases, and is much higher among the elderly. Mathematical models and the experience of China, Italy, and now the United States, suggest that COVID-19 is likely to infect a significant number of Indians, though this can change due to current physical distancing and lockdown measures. Notably, wealthier countries with stronger and better financed health systems such as Italy and China have struggled with containing COVID-19. As such, it is prudent to understand how well India’s health system can respond to COVID-19, especially since it is unclear how long this disease will persist. We believe that there are some critical weaknesses in India’s health system that can prevent a credible response to COVID-19.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

State-to-State coordination

In truth, we do not really know how widespread the epidemic is in India because such a small number of people have been tested and many mild cases go undetected. To what extent India’s ongoing efforts to control COVID-19 using physical distancing and isolation will be successful is yet unknown. It is likely that, as in other countries, there will be regional or sub-regional disease hotspots, rather than a nationwide outbreak. The higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in States such as Kerala and Maharashtra suggest this (though this could also be due to more testing). This highlights the importance of approaching India’s COVID-19 response from the perspective of State health system capacity. Second, it is unlikely that States which experience a COVID-19 hotspot will have the resources to manage the outbreak independently. As such, it is critically important to put in place well-functioning between-State and within-State coordination mechanisms that enable efficiently leveraging resources such as doctors, nurses, equipment, supplies from elsewhereand direct them to regional/sub-regional hotspots.

Ramping up hospital capacity

Addressing the scarcity of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds in India is critical for providing clinical support to severe COVID-19 cases. Without flattening India’s COVID-19 epidemic curve, our current hospital capacity is so low that it will be quickly overwhelmed if infections surge. India has around 70 hospital beds and 2.3 ICU beds per 100,000 people. To put this into perspective, China (Italy) has 420 (340) hospital beds and 3.6 (12.5) ICU beds per 100,000 people, and both these countries struggled to care for the severely sick. According to our rough calculations, based on estimates from recent studies, in a hypothetical State with a population of 50 million (about the size of Andhra Pradesh), with the national-level endowment in hospital and ICU beds and bed occupancy of 50%, assuming there are currently 10 COVID-19 cases with a doubling rate of five days (5% of the cases hospitalised and 16% of hospitalisations need ICU care, median length of stay 12 days), without any mitigating measures, the ICUs will fill up in six weeks and hospital beds in about eight weeks from now. This will happen sooner in States with lower hospital capacity.

It is critically important that India puts in place a strategy to ramp up hospital and ICU capacity, as well as provision for essential equipment such as ventilators and personal protective equipment for health workers. In both China and Italy, hospitals were rapidly constructed to accommodate infected patients. It is doubtful that we can construct new hospitals as quickly as China or even staff them adequately. Therefore, it is important to consider alternatives, such as, extending current hospital capacity, hospital trains that can easily move from one location to another, or converting university dormitories into treatment centres. Tapping the resources in the private sector is particularly important. India’s health system is highly privatised and most of the country’s health-care capacity in terms of human resources, hospital beds, laboratories, and diagnostic centres is in the private sector. Recognising this, several State governments have initiated action, such as enlisting private laboratories for testing and using the private hospital bed capacity to treat positive patients. More of this is needed, as well as, engaging private hospitals in planning and coordinating the COVID-19 response.

Health workers are crucial

Health-care workers are a critical resource for the COVID-19 response. They go into communities to carry out preventive care, trace potentially exposed people, and treat the infected. The success of countries such as South Korea and Singapore in controlling the spread and mortality due to COVID-19 has been credited to the ability of health workers to locate, test and treat cases. This requires a substantial number of health workers, and India faces an acute shortage of them. India has around 3.4 qualified doctors and 3.2 nurses and midwives per 10,000 population; in contrast, China (Italy) has 18 (41) doctors and 23(59) nurses per 10,000 population. Moreover, health workers in India are mostly concentrated in the urban areas and there are huge disparities between States (Bihar has 0.3 and Kerala has 3.2 doctors per 10,000 population). Importantly, nurses have been in the forefront of caring for infected people elsewhere; India, has far fewer nurses than both Italy and China. These characteristics of India’s health workforce will affect its COVID-19 response, particularly in rural India and in States with fewer health workers. While increasing the health workforce in the short term is difficult, it is important to consider task shifting and multi-skilling strategies where a variety of health-care workers (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy doctors, nurses, as well as general and specialist doctors) are engaged. Because it is highly likely that certain regions in India will become COVID-19 hotspots, to contain these outbreaks it is important that human and other resources can be flexibly shifted to these areas from other parts of the country.

Primary-care providers, whether they are formally trained (e.g. medical officers, nurses, auxiliary nurse and midwives, pharmacists), or lay workers (accredited social health activists) or informal workers (rural (not registered) medical practitioners, or RMPs, drug shops) will likely be the first contact health workers for COVID-19 patients. For example, more than 70% of the outpatient visits in India are to private providers, the majority of whom are RMPs. Engaging these primary-care providers in the COVID-19 response is important. For one, they are critical for contact tracing, a strategy that has been successfully used in South Korea and Singapore to contain the virus. Because primary-care providers will encounter patients in early stages or with mild forms of the disease, they play a crucial role in treating and referring patients. While this may not be easy to accomplish, COVID-19 response strategies should involve engaging these primary-care providers and providing them information on preventing the spread of COVID-19, danger signs or where to refer in case of serious illness.

Health worker safety

Health workers also take on a disproportionate share of infections. Health worker safety is particularly important for India because it already faces a shortage of doctors and nurses. In China and Italy, the fight against COVID-19 has taken a huge toll on health workers. One of the enduring images from Italy is of an exhausted nurse lying face down on her desk. As a recent article in The Lancet notes, estimates from China’s National Health Commission show that more than 3,300 health-care workers have been infected as of early March and, by the end of February at least 22 had died; in Italy, 20% of responding health-care workers were infected, and some have died. Health workers also face physical and mental exhaustion, which affects their morale, in addition to the infection risk. Protecting health workers in the forefront of the COVID-19 response will be critical. Procuring and ensuring the widespread use of personal protective equipment (e.g. masks, gloves, gowns, and eye wear) in the care of all patients with respiratory symptoms needs to prioritised. Such actions will be particularly important if there is a prolonged response to COVID-19.

India like other countries faces important health system challenges in mounting a credible response to COVID-19. Many of these issues are not new. Addressing these health system issues will require much effort, financing, and, in some cases, not even entirely possible to remedy in the near future. How India deals with these health system issues in the days to come will make all the difference.

We are lucky there was no Opposition-organised protest against the janata curfew on Sunday. Otherwise the Opposition has the general strategy or tendency to oppose any directive by the ruling party. A self-imposed, once-a-week curfew is a good thing to be practised; it will bring down pollution levels, in the big cities at least. Going forward, it would be a good idea to restrict private vehicles and some public transport systems on Sundays. The Central and State governments should give thought to promulgating a weekly-once curfew for the betterment of citizens.

Amid the gloom and trepidation following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is some cause for hope, in the form of a series of ‘feel good’ articles. Some have taken to writing on social media focusing on the positive aspects of the lockdown, by imploring people to be positive, giving out tips for creative utilisation of one’s time, and of experts sharing their knowledge on improving the environment, apart from highlighting cases of young and hardworking Samaritans helping people. These people are an example of new term, “caremongering” — there is an article on the BBC’s website on this subject. This is a part of the healing process and a component of the fight against the pandemic.

Moving ahead, such initiatives will be needed in these difficult times.

Mockery of democracy

The backdoor entry of Shivraj Singh Chouhan as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, close on the heels of Justice Ranjan Gogoi’s ignominious entry into the Rajya Sabha, should be perceived as yet another blow to the democratic and constitutional edifice of the nation. The ruling establishment appears to have lost all sense of fair play and decency.

Our rulers have no qualms in mocking people by upturning their democratic will. Elections have lost their meaning. The judiciary cannot afford to be seen as losing peoples’ faith. The inert Congress Party, which is totally cut off from the people, appears to be interested only in waging Twitter battles. Unless citizens close ranks and find alternative ways to assert their rights, the tentacles of authoritarianism are bound to tighten.

425,2020/03/25,How fitness enthusiasts in Kerala capital continue to stay in shape despite lockdown,"Even as lockdown over the coronavirus scare keeps fitness aficionados cooped up in their homes and social distancing becoming the norm, there are many who do not give up on their fitness goals

For Hyderabad native Sanjay Tapse, who has made the city his “home” for the past 12 years, Zumba is a “passion”. It all started two years ago when the ISRO engineer attended a workshop on the fitness programme. “I wanted to stay in shape but hitting the gym was not really my cup of tea. I love to dance and so Zumba suits me,” he says. However, as with multitude of other fitness enthusiasts in the city, Sanjay’s routine too has now taken a hit owing to the restrictions imposed to break the chain and stop the spread of COVID-19.

With social distancing becoming the norm, several fitness aficionados prefer to “stay at home”, while also looking at alternative ways of staying fit. Despite fitness centres remaining shut and crowds at public places thinning, many are not giving up on their fitness goals. Like Sanjay, who has switched to doing light exercises at home. “I’m practising a bit of yoga and doing stretching exercises. I am controlling my diet as I’m less active these days since I can’t go for Zumba,” he says.

Walkers may have a hit a wall but many are finding other ways of staying active, like tattoo artiste George Fernandes from Mudavanmugal who has been in the habit of walking about 4 km every morning. A former bodybuilder, he shifted primarily to walking and cycling to stay in shape. I have, however, stopped stepping out for my morning walks for now. My work-out experience has come in handy and I’m doing a lot of free-hand and body weight exercises these days. I also use resistance bands, skipping ropes and dumb bells,” says the 33-year-old.

Cycling enthusiasts too have applied the brakes for the time being. Cyclist Priya Balan says she has found an effective alternative to keep the momentum going — ‘rapid walking’ on the terrace of her house. “I think we should be respectful of the government directives as now is a time to think about the collective health and not individual benefits. However, it’s, of course, difficult when you are forced to take a break from something you have been doing for so long. It almost feels like having to give up a good habit,” says Priya, who otherwise goes cycling at least thrice a week, often with her friends or on her own.

With fitness centres coming under the lockdown, gym-hitters and bodybuilders are trading heavy-lifting for simpler home work-outs, with or without equipment. Like Karate practitioner Vaideesh Kumar C from Jagathy who now practises his martial art moves coupled with basic body weight exercises such as push-ups and chin-ups at home. “In any case, I was planning to refrain from going to the gym when the directive to close such places down came. I felt it safer not to share gym equipment for now,” he explains.

Do’s and don’ts Abhilash Viswam, Consultant Physiotherapist at Meditrina Hospital, says those who work out on a regularly can continue their routine at home as they might be familiar with the do’s and don’ts. “However, in case of resistance training, it is advisable to lessen the weights and increase the reps to avoid injuries,” he says. Abhilash suggests ground exercises are ideal and people can do brisk walking at their homes for cardiovascular fitness. “Above all, stay hydrated,” he says.

Fitness trainers point out that gymnasiums are not just a place for pumping iron but an opportunity for social interaction as well, especially after a hard day of work. Venugopal Unnnikrishnan of Belaire Health Club, however, questions the “motivation factor” in working out at home by oneself. “It’s often that sense of fraternity that brings many body-builders back again to the gyms. Nevertheless, it’s possible to do lot of ground exercises at home, but targeted muscle-building may not be easy as they require specific equipment. However, beginners can check out YouTube videos of certified trainers for work-out tips,” he adds.

The sports scene in the city has virtually come to a standstill, with summer camps and training sessions for kids too called off. Tennis lover M S Krishnakumar says he can’t wait to pick up the racket again. “Normally, I play the game at Trivandrum Tennis Club almost every morning. I’m currently doing skipping, jogging and so on to maintain my stamina,” says Krishnakumar.

For former badminton player Jose George, who runs Ajit and Jose School of Badminton in Kowdiar, shutting the academy does not deter him from imparting training for some kids with potential, thanks to his video tutorials. “They cannot afford to be off for long and we have charted a training schedule using short video clips for instructions and feedbacks,” he says. Jose now keeps himself on top of the game with “wall practice”, a training method, at his residence. “Now that I get more time, I’m also watching a lot of iconic badminton matches and highlights on YouTube,” he says with a chuckle.

For some, like Kalaripayattu trainer Ajith Kumar T of Maruthi Kalari Sangham near Poojappura, it’s also a matter of livelihood. Only last week, he made it back to the city after a training camp in Kolkata, which was eventually called off before completion. However, Ajith has since been in “quarantine” as a precautionary measure, which has disrupted his training and exercise routine. “What’s worse is that our Kalaripayattu demonstrations slated for the coming weeks in many districts have been cancelled, affecting our source of income,” he says. Ajith is hopeful that things will start to look up soon.

Many deem practising yoga as beneficial not only for physical fitness but also for an overall sense of well-being, and writer and filmmaker Sreebala K Menon attests to this. She feels these are tough times and underscores the importance of staying calm. “As a yoga student and practitioner of meditation, I find yoga more than just physical fitness act. Personally, I have now dropped everything because of the present situation and this helps me simply sit at a tranquil spot just to listen and observe,” she says. As yoga is something that can be practised on one’s own, she says the lockdown hasn’t really affected her routine.

426,2020/03/25,Covid-19: Breathing through a lockdown,"If you make a habit over the next 21 days, let it be pranayama, to promote mental and physical health

I’m writing this piece an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s 21-day lockdown. The last time I was under lockdown was during vipassana, and that was only 10 days. I remember standing, peeking over the boundary wall of the small women’s compound in Dhamma Salila, Dehradun, watching a couple of trucks go by at a distance. How lucky they were to be free. I pledged I would never commit a crime because I didn’t want to be in jail. Not that I would. Obviously.

But it was also on that sixth night of vipassana that I felt bliss for no reason. We usually feel happy because of a promotion, a baby, new love, something from the outside. But here I was, lying in bed, eyes closed, a big smile on my face for no reason whatsoever. That day I understood why people chose to take sanyasa — if I could feel blissful in this way from within, I didn’t need anything external.

It is a roundabout way of saying that we have more than 10 days. A full three weeks or the required 21 days to form a new habit. During vipassana, we were meditating for about 10 hours a day. We were also not talking or looking at each other (or trying our best). We went through boredom, pain, anguish, trauma, sadness, glee, and peace all in a day’s work. Our last proper meal was at 11 am. Full disclosure: I did smuggle in a small bowl of muesli and a couple of paracetamols, which came in handy when I had migraines.

This time, however, it is different. We have 21 days with full connectivity, with food and at least some time to spare. Some of those things you wanted to do but never had the time can happen now. While most experts would suggest meditation, I disagree. If you’re already in a state of anxiety and depression, then, without the guidance of a meditation guru, you might multiply the negativity.

The journey within begins with the breath. Whether your mind is in another continent, on another person, or several months ahead in the future, your breath has the power to pull it back to the present. I recently recorded a series of podcasts called Holistic Healing with RedFM. For one episode, I was interviewing Mala Baruah, a meditation teacher based in Delhi. She advised that the moment you open your eyes in the morning, take 25 deep breaths, tracing its movement down your spine and back up. Instant peace.

When you’re stressed, the first thing you do is stop breathing. In this time of anxiety and uncertainty, nothing is more healing than breath work. The yogic practice of nadi-shodhana or alternate nostril breathing must be an essential daily habit. If after 21 days you emerge with the habit of practising only that, you will be transformed. Author, vaidya and alternative medicine expert, Dr Robert Svoboda, says that alternate nostril breathing for 20 minutes every day is enough in itself. It clears your nasal passages, increases energy, enhances immunity, calms your nervous system, and bestows clear, glowing skin.

In yoga, the correct sequence is asana, pranayama, then dhyana. We practice asana and attempt dhyana, but most of us lack the patience for pranayama. After you practice this for 20 minutes (change hands if one arm gets tired), sit for two minutes in silence. You won’t even need to make an attempt because meditation will happen naturally.

During this time, we need to form habits that can be sustained when life gets back to normal. If we aren’t transformed by this experience, our time is wasted. Positivity is a habit, as is drinking enough water and applying castor oil on lids and lashes. Use these days to heal and nourish. Oil your hair, try oil pulling, give yourself a face massage. The benefit of the home office is that work can happen simultaneously. Use your connectivity to educate yourselves and set personal goals. You will face your demons and feel the burn. But we need this to elevate our consciousness. Remember that even gold is made with fire. This is your time — make it golden.

427,2020/03/25,COVID-19 | Mumbai Police get in touch with home delivery platforms to ensure seamless service,"Home delivery portals say unable to provide essential goods

Amidst increasing confusion over the terms and conditions of the nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Mumbai Police on Wednesday started reaching out to e-commerce platforms to ensure that essential commodities are delivered to citizens without any hitches.

Mr. Modi, in his televised address on Tuesday, had said the country would be under a complete lockdown for the next 21 days. Hundreds of people poured out on the streets even before his address was complete to stock up on groceries and other essentials, as there was scant clarity over availability of essential commodities.

By Wednesday, several delivery portals started sending messages to their customers, stating that they were unable to deliver goods due to “unforeseeable circumstances”. The Mumbai Police, after being apprised of the situation, started getting in touch with representatives of these platforms.

“We are talking to officials from e-commerce platforms like Big Basket, Nature’s Basket and Grofers and understanding the issues faced by them while delivering to their customers. We are also getting details like the outfits worn by their executives and conveying to all police station personnel, so that the executives can go about their jobs unhindered,” Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said.

Mr. Ashok said the other option being discussed at the moment is to provide stickers or banners for vehicles ferrying supplies to the loading centre of these platforms, so that their supply, too, is uninterrupted.

Attempts were being made to reach out to as many delivery platforms and have one-to-one conversations with their representatives to ensure a smooth delivery system for essential commodities.

“The idea is to minimise the need for the common man to step out of doors. There might also be some confusion about the rules of the lockdown, which may need to be cleared first. Doubtless, safety and sanitisation measures while delivering the commodities to the customers will also be part of the discussions,” Mr. Ashok said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tu2lix/article31168430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/266BMSOCIALDISTANCING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-mumbai-police-get-in-touch-with-home-delivery-platforms-to-ensure-seamless-service/article31162370.ece

A Canadian, who landed a home stay option in Kalina through an online portal, was left stranded after members of that residential society refused him entry in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak and its infamy as the one being spread by those coming from abroad.

Brian Melson (55) came to India on February 4 on a tourist visa and has since been asked to vacate a hotel in Marol in Andheri as well as accommodation in Khar in view of the coronavirus scare, his friend Vijendra Joshi said on Tuesday.

Mr. Melson then contacted an online portal providing home stay options and he was allotted accommodation in a housing society in Kalina.

Mr. Joshi said Mr. Melson spent the last 24 hours in the lobby of the Kalina housing society and he was making arrangements to shift him to Pune.

“It is distressing. A cab driver said he would charge ₹14,000 to ferry us to my home town in Pune,” Mr. Joshi said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kalina-housing-society-turns-away-canadian/article31159340.ece
429,2020/03/25,Bomb blasts convict from Bangladesh nabbed in Navi Mumbai after 16 years,"Hussain crossed border via West Bengal after getting parole on medical grounds

The Thane Crime Branch has arrested a 52-year-old Bangladesh national, who was convicted for setting off three bombs in his home town in 2002. Mufazzal Hussain had obtained parole on medical grounds in 2004 and had gone on the run since then.

Hussain is a native of Ilispur village in Khulna, Bangladesh. Officers said he was staying at Koparkhairane in Navi Mumbai under the name of Mafeezul Mandal and was picked up by the Unit I on the basis of a tip-off.

“Our information indicated that the accused was an illegal immigrant and was evading the authorities in Bangladesh. We picked him up on March 19 and when he was unable to produce any documents either proving his Indian citizenship or certifying that he was visiting the country, detained him,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The officer said after questioning, Hussain gave up his true identity and also confessed to be a wanted man back home. “Based on inquiries, we have ascertained that Hussain had exploded three crude bombs at a mosque in Ilispur — one on the premises and two outside — in 2002, killing one person and injuring several others. The offence was a fallout of a rivalry between two local gangs, and Hussain belonged to one of them. He was arrested, and sentenced to life imprisonment.”

Hussain also damaged his arm in the blasts, and in 2004 managed to obtain parole on medical grounds. He then crossed the Indo-Bangladesh border via West Bengal and came to Maharashtra, where he has been living since then. The officer said he had been doing odd jobs for a living and no criminal records in his name had come to light in India so far.

“We have booked Hussain under the Passport Act and have initiated the process of deporting him to Bangladesh. Usually, the process takes around two months but it might take longer in this case owing to the COVID-19 crisis,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3g1giq/article31158138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200324-WA0010,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bomb-blasts-convict-from-bangladesh-nabbed-in-navi-mumbai-after-16-years/article31158133.ece
430,2020/03/25,"Non-bailable warrants against Mirchi’s wife, sons","The three accused failed to appear in a money laundering case registered by ED

A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday issued non-bailable warrants against late gangster Iqbal Mirchi’s wife and his two sons after they failed to appear before the court in a money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The central agency had filed a case of money laundering against Mirchi’s wife, his sons and 13 other accused in December 2019 stating that Mirchi had bought properties in India and abroad using money earned through illegal activities.

ED in their case had claimed that Mirchi’s wife Hajra Memon, and two sons Asif and Junaid, were the beneficiaries of the assets earned by Mirchi through proceeds of crime. The ED has listed them as the top three accused.

The agency had last week approached the special PMLA court for warrant against the three as they failed to appear before the court or investigating authorities even after several summons.

The special court, while granting the non-bailable warrant observed, “The application has been served properly with summons for the three to appear before the court, but the accused have failed to appear. Hence, issue open-ended warrants against them.”

The ED has alleged that Mirchi purchased three assets in Sea View, Marium Lodge and Rabia Mansion across the city in 1986. Officers claimed Mirchi was involved in narcotics smuggling and operated an extortion racket for several years, and listed eight cases to prove his involvement in criminal activities since 1984. A case filed in 1994 at MRA Marg police station was the basis to initiate a money-laundering enquiry against him.

The ED claimed Mirchi used the trust as a front and began negotiating with several developers to redevelop their properties. Between 1981 and 2010, the original tenants were replaced with Mirchi’s relatives. The agency claimed that by 2005, almost all tenants were Mirchi’s nominees and were planted by Humayun Merchant in connivance with Haroun Yusuf, both of whom are his aides.

In 2007, a deal was finalised between the trust and a developer, Joy Home Creations Private Limited, after a meeting with Mirchi in London. In 2010, Mirchi allegedly threatened the developer to withdraw, as he failed to make payments as promised. Later, in 2010, M/s Sunblink Real Estate Pvt. Limited took over the project. The agency claimed Ranjeet Singh Bindra was the broker for the deal and was to get ₹40 crore to ₹50 crore as brokerage from Sunblink. As part of the deal signed between Merchant, Joy Home Creation and Sunblink Real Estate, the tenancy rights were transferred to Sunblink for a consideration of ₹225 crore.

Most of the payments were done in 2010 and around ₹43 crore was to be paid by November this year. The agency claimed that ₹127 crore has been paid to Merchant till date. However, as per the records, payment of ₹60 crore has only been made to Merchant, while the rest was transferred through hawala channels. Referring to the statement of a witness, ED claimed a payment of 90 million dirham was made to the UAE through hawala, which was then used for purchase of a five-star hotel in Dubai.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/non-bailable-warrants-against-mirchis-wife-sons/article31158129.ece
431,2020/03/25,Malad man booked for defying home quarantine advisory,"112 offences registered for violating terms of curfew

The Malad police on Monday booked a 56-year-old man after he was allegedly found outdoors despite having been advised home quarantine for 14 days.

According to the police, the Malad resident was spotted by a patrolling police team near Liberty Garden on Monday evening. The police intercepted him after they saw that he had a home quarantine stamp on the back of his hand.

“Inquiries revealed that he had returned from Dubai on March 16 and had been advised home quarantine till March 30. After this, we registered a case against him,” an officer said.

He said the accused has been booked for disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant and negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life under the Indian Penal Code.

Meanwhile, the police have till date registered 112 offences against various individuals and establishments for violating the terms of the curfew imposed by the State government. Police officers said the highest number of offences was registered against commercial establishments that were found to be operational despite not selling essential goods, at 53. Hawkers came second with 18 offences, while civilians indulging in undue public assembly ranked third with 10 cases.

The police have since Monday deployed special squads to check on those advised home quarantine after being examined at the airport, while random checks are also being conducted all over the city jointly by police and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation personnel.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8nb5lb/article31158121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMHOMEQURANTINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/malad-man-booked-for-defying-home-quarantine-advisory/article31158122.ece

A home quarantined man from Sanpada has approached the police through Twitter and WhatsApp after he found his name in a list of COVID-19-positive cases being circulated on WhatsApp.

The 59-year-old former Director General of Information and Public Relations has alleged he is facing embarrassment and humiliation as a result. He and his wife, a retired MTNL employee, had returned from an international trip on March 16 and are home quarantined since. “My wife is a cancer survivor and has been mentally disturbed with all this. As per the government’s instructions, we got screened at the airport and also filled the form given by the Health Department during immigration. I am well aware of the precautions to be taken after returning from a foreign country, and we are following the same.” he said.

The harassment, he said, began on Saturday. “The list has 42 names, their address and contact number. It does not specify what the names are about but the ones who received it get the wrong impression that this is the list of infected persons.” Ever since, he has been getting calls from people asking if he has the virus. “We wish to register a complaint to avoid further humiliation, social boycott and embarrassment but since we are quaratined, we can’t do that. However, I have WhatsApped various officers in the police department and my daughter has tweeted it tagging the Navi Mumbai Police,” he said.

“A patient’s name will not be disclosed. When one is a suspect, he has a stamp on his hand and it is in the public domain. However, this is a case of a different nature. We will register his application with the cyber unit and enquire into it,” said Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/whatsapp-mills-term-sanpada-man-a-patient/article31158115.ece
433,2020/03/25,Dubai-based businessman dies at Kasturba; State’s toll now at 3,"65-year-old with hypertension, diabetes was on a visit to city

A 65-year-old man, who tested positive for COVID-19, died within hours of being admitted to Kasturba Hospital on Monday. The Dubai-based businessman had come down to Ahmedabad along with his wife to take treatment for spondylosis and had visited Mumbai to spend a few days in his Kandivali house.

The death toll in Maharashtra has reached three and all the deaths have been reported from Mumbai.

The senior citizen, who had underlying conditions like hypertension and diabetes, had developed fever and cough but he continued to take his pain relief medication along with paracetamol. He landed in Ahmedabad on March 15 and came to Mumbai on March 20.

On Monday, he developed severe breathlessness after which he was taken to a local physician in Kandivali who immediately referred the patient to Kasturba after hearing his travel history. “The doctor refused to even touch the patient,” said a relative, adding they had a harrowing time to get an ambulance to ferry the businessman to Kasturba.

The patient reached Kasturba around 3 p.m. and was immediately put on ventilator support. “We were informed about his death around 7.30 p.m.,” the relative said. The patient’s samples came positive for COVID-19 after he had passed away.

The patient’s wife, daughter, and son-in-law were present in the hospital but were asked to stay away from cremation. His two other daughters, who are based in Jaipur and Dubai, could not come down. Only one relative carried out the final procedures and the deceased was cremated at the electric crematorium in Shivaji Park as per infection control protocol.

Breaking away from the protocol observed in past cases, the wife, daughter, and son-in-law were not immediately admitted to Kasturba. Since the family was grieving, they were allowed to remain at home and will be sent for testing at Jogeshwari’s HBT Trauma Care Hospital on Wednesday. Civic officials have quarantined the entire building where the couple spent the last three days.

Filipino buried in Mumbai

The 68-year -old Islamic scholar from the Philippines, who died after testing positive for COVID-19, was buried at a cemetery in the central suburbs. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said a few community members helped in the last rites and a video of the process was sent to the victim’s family in the Philippines. “There is a set protocol for infection control for a burial. All the guidelines were followed,” he said.

The patient was shifted to Powai’s Hiranandani Hospital on Sunday and he developed respiratory distress and renal failure.

434,2020/03/25,Five doctors on airport duty quarantined,"CM asks police to show restraint against those stepping out

Addressing the State after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of a nation-wide lockdown, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said he had informed Mr. Modi that Maharashtra had already announced such measures two days ago.

“There will be no change in the announcement of opening of essential services and exemption to them from the lockdown. The State has already taken the measures and these will continue,” said Mr. Thackeray, adding that even he felt scared after hearing Mr. Modi talking about a 21-day shutdown. “But it is important to defeat this pandemic,” he said.

He also announced a WhatsApp number (+912026127394) for citizens to ask questions regarding coronavirus and fact-check their information.

Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party slammed Mr. Modi for creating panic among the citizens by failing to clarify in his speech that essential services would remain unaffected. “This is a lockdown and not demonetisation, where one should wait till 8 p.m. to announce the decision. Had it been early in the morning, it would have given people enough time to prepare and know the details,” the party’s State president Jayant Patil said.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Thackeray directed the police to show restraint, following reports of police officials using force to disperse citizens stepping out of their homes. However, he asked citizens to cooperate with the government orders by not venturing out unnecessarily.

He also asked companies and individuals providing essential goods and services to display their names and services in bold on their vehicles, and said their employees must carry identification.

“Despite the lockdown there are instances where people are coming on the streets. I can understand that people have to come out to buy vegetables, milk, medicines or other essentials. But we need to be more serious. I have instructed the police as well, regarding the same. The police should verify the reasons behind people coming out on street,” he said.

Meanwhile, the State government earlier in the day issued an amendment to the lockdown order, exempting all ports and related activities including movement of vehicles and manpower, operations of container freight station and warehouses and offices of custom house agents, and essential services of railways.

The amendment also added that all urgent pre-monsoon related works, water supply services, production and manufacturing units of essential items, including sugar, dairy units, animal feed and fodder units, are exempted from restrictions.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/five-doctors-on-airport-duty-quarantined/article31158102.ece
435,2020/03/25,Committee to take call on APMC market shutdown,"Office-bearers, vendors, mathadi workers to decide date of reopening

The plan to shut the APMC market till March 31 may not be final, with office-bearers of the market, mathadi workers, and vendors forming a committee on Tuesday to take a call on it.

“Shutting down of the market would mean inconvenience to many, hence we had to find a way to come out of this. By Wednesday, in another meeting, we will finalise the plan of action,” said Anil Chavan, secretary of APMC, who will head the committee. Tuesday’s meeting focused on how to control the crowd, security, health, and discipline to be followed in the market. “The market will be closed on Wednesday but will be opened before March 31 after a system is in place,” said Sanjay Pinglay, secretary of APMC vegetable market.

The committee has decided to use sanitisers, masks and take all possible precautions to not let people crowd into the market. In the absence of such a system, 10,000 people will, as usual, crowd the market, he said. “Many people have stocked up vegetables for at least three to four days and before that gets over, the market will open.”

Mathadi workers, who had stopped coming to work, have also been asked to return, even if in smaller numbers.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, prices of vegetables, especially the leafy variety, had soared by nearly 40%. “The trucks coming in from other districts could not reach the market due to the sealing of borders. In the next few days too, the number of trucks could decrease, leading to an increase in rates,” said Ramdas Pavle, a vegetable vendor in the APMC market.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/482jc5/article31158103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMCORONA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/committee-to-take-call-on-apmc-market-shutdown/article31158100.ece

437,2020/03/25,Index patients among eight discharged,"The couple test negative in two consecutive samples; all of them to be in home quarantine for 14 days

Mumbai’s first COVID-19 patients — a senior Andheri couple who were part of a 40-member Dubai-Abu Dhabi tour group — were among the eight patients discharged from Kasturba Hospital on Tuesday.

The 70-year-old man and 68-year-old woman had tested negative in two consecutive samples and had completed 14 days in the isolation facility. The two, the city’s index patients, had tested positive on March 11.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made an exception for the discharge of the six other patients who had not completed 14 days in isolation but had tested negative in two consecutive tests. “

All these patients are now asymptomatic and have recovered. Keeping them in the isolation facility would also mean putting them at risk as there are many other positive patients. We, therefore, decided to discharge the patients after consulting the doctors,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said.

Another senior citizen from Kamothe, who was also part of the Dubai group, was also discharged. Similarly, a 49-year-old man who had returned from the U.S. and his 68-year-old domestic help from Ghatkopar were discharged. These three patients were shifted to the isolation facility at Bhabha Hospital in Kurla from Kasturba on Sunday.

“I am relieved to go back home,” the Kamothe man, who was in an ambulance arranged by the BMC to ferry him home, told The Hindu. He said none of his family members were positive but he was concerned about reactions from people when he got back home. “I will remain under home quarantine for 14 days as advised by doctors,” he said.

Among the eight discharged from Kasturba was a three-year-old girl from Kalyan. Her mother continues to be in the isolation facility at Kasturba while her father is admitted to Jaslok Hospital and is said to be critical.

Fear of being stigmatised by building residents was among the main concerns of those who left Kasturba.

“All those who were discharged can’t step out of their houses for 14 days. Our doctors will constantly check on them,” BMC’s deputy executive health officer Dr. Daksha Shah said.

She said home testing facilities were now available and if needed, samples of those under home quarantine, who developed symptoms, could be collected at the doorstep. “About six to seven samples were collected from homes on Tuesday.”

Augmenting facilities

The civic body is in the process of scaling up the quarantine facilities to accommodate up to 2,000 people. “We are also in process of taking over a small hospital which can be a quarantine facility only for women,” Mr. Kakani said. Over 400 people, including one pregnant woman, are currently in the quarantine facilities.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mpryny/article31158091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bm-Corona,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/index-patients-among-eight-discharged/article31158086.ece
438,2020/03/25,"Mumbai hits panic button, comes out to shop after PM’s speech","Social distancing not maintained as people queue up for vegetables, groceries

The Prime Minister said ‘lockdown’, and Mumbaikars came out in full force, masks on their faces, shopping bags in their hands. And for those few hours on Tuesday evening, social distancing was nowhere in sight.

In a panic reaction reminiscent of 2016, when demonetisation was announced, hundreds of citizens poured out into Mumbai’s streets in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing a nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19.

The PM, in an address to the country at 8 p.m., declared that India would be under lockdown for the next 21 days to fight the pandemic. With the State already under lockdown since Monday, most shops were shut and only those selling essential supplies were operational on Tuesday.

Even before Mr. Modi could finish his address, people rushed out of their homes to stock up on essentials like groceries and medicines.

Powai residents descended on the streets in their swanky cars and sports utility vehicles to buy whatever vegetables were available in Powai Vihar market.

“Barely a few minutes after the Prime Minister concluded his address, the road in our locality was flooded with headlights of cars searching for parking space in the narrow lane. The vegetable vendors, it appears, were expecting this kind of an announcement because late in the evening they started sorting the vegetables,” said Prakriti Sharan, a research scholar at School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, who is currently in Powai.

“It was saddening to see frail elderly women jostling with people in long queues in front of vegetable vendors. There was no social distancing and it was like all hell had broken loose,” Ms. Sharan said.

South Mumbai too saw residents rushing out to vegetable markets and grocery stores in Grant Road, Colaba and other areas, but most shops had run out of stock. Those that did have stock, saw some jostling and pushing. At one shop in Grant Road, a few people volunteered to ask everyone to be disciplined, queue up and maintain distance. Meat shops had run out of chicken and mutton by 9 p.m.

Large crowds were also seen at chemist shops. Assurances that these shops would be open through the lockdown did not seem to be working.

The civic-run market near Thane railway station observed a sudden surge of customers at around 8.30 p.m. with people buying vegetables to last them as long as possible. Shops had already run out of essentials like milk, bread and eggs by then.

“Some of my regular customers are calling to tell me to put aside five litres of milk but I don’t even have half a litre left. If this evening is hectic, tomorrow is going to be worse, as people will flock from the morning itself, when the fresh supply comes in,” a general store owner in the market said.

“I have people buying something like six to seven types of vegetables in the biggest bags they have, and making me promise to set aside some more while they return for a second trip. Doing business at a single place for years gets you a lot of regular customers and you can’t turn any of them down,” said Saiprasad Shirke, a vegetable vendor.

Similar scenes were witnessed in various pockets of Mira Road and Bhayander. Bakeries saw the maximum crowd as people rushed to stock bread, eggs and milk among other essentials. Police personnel stationed near Maxus Mall who were earlier stopping motorcycles and sending people back home could do nothing to stop people from crowding the streets to shop for essentials.

Long queues were noticed at grocery stores in Navi Mumbai, with cars parked all around. These places were almost empty for the past few days with a handful coming through the day to buy supplies. A similar scene was observed in medical stores.

Vegetable and milk sellers confirmed that supply was on till Tuesday morning but said they are unsure about Wednesday, despite the State government assuring essential supply. Everyone, including the wholesalers, is still ascertaining exactly what the lockdown entails.

Believing that the 21-day lockdown would also mean a dearth of cash, people rushed to ATMs to withdraw money.

“My mother panicked so much that she forced me to the ATM thinking we won’t be able to withdraw money in next 21 days,” said Anant Joshi, a Belapur resident.

Citizens were seen taking to Twitter, tagging the Mumbai police in tweets about crowds in their localities. The police issued advisories asking people not to panic and also increased deployment on the roads to avoid untoward incidents.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/doe0w4/article31158083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bm-Charkop,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-hits-panic-button-comes-out-to-shop-after-pms-speech/article31158084.ece
439,2020/03/25,"BMC starts disinfecting hospitals, toilets","All public places will be sprayed with solution of sodium hypochlorite

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been disinfecting hospital premises and public toilets using sodium hypochlorite, considering the large number of people who visit these places. Further, it will be disinfecting all public locations that see crowds.

On March 22, a police constable stationed at Kasturba Hospital complained of sore throat and was admitted there for a test for the virus. Even as his reports are awaited, the BMC is taking urgent measures to disinfect hospital premises on priority.

On Tuesday, it took up the large-scale disinfection of Nair and KEM hospitals, and a dispensary in Antop Hill. It has drawn up a schedule to disinfect every municipal hospital at a fixed timing, including the crucial Kasturba and SevenHills hospitals.

This is being done by the Mumbai Fire Brigade using quick response vehicles that spray a diluted mixture of sodium hypochlorite, a type of bleach which is highly effective for cleaning surfaces.

Besides, over the next few days, the fire brigade will also be using the same process to disinfect areas that are still seeing footfall, such as municipal markets and offices. A plan id being drawn up to do so.

“Sodium hypochlorite was not available with us in such large quantities but we procured it from our contractor on an urgent basis. Once the hospitals and quarantine centres are done, we will disinfect other establishments that see people turning up for essential services,” P.S. Rahangdale, chief fire officer, said.

The civic body’s G North ward office staff also disinfected toilets in Dharavi where people do not have individual toilets and therefore rely on public toilets.

Several public representatives like Shiv Sena’s Abhishek Ghosalkar, Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Ameet Satam and Sena corporator Amey Ghole have undertaken disinfection of housing societies in their wards.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/u43q2m/article31158060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMDISINFECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-starts-disinfecting-hospitals-toilets/article31158061.ece
440,2020/03/25,10 fresh positive cases take State coronavirus tally to 107,"Four from Mumbai, three from Pune among those testing positive for COVID-19

Ten new positive cases of the novel coronavirus were reported from the State on Tuesday, taking the total count of cases to 107. With the death of a senior citizen reported from Mumbai, the death toll in the State now stands at three.

Four of the fresh cases were reported from Mumbai, three were from Pune, one from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), and one each from Satara and Ahmednagar districts.

The patients from Mumbai include a 37-year-old woman with a travel history to Italy and a 36-year-old man with a travel history to Dubai. The travel history of the two others — a 65-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man — was being probed.

Of the total COVID-19 positive patients, 58 have been reported from the MMR.

With Tuesday’s three cases, the number of positive cases in Pune district has reached 31. The number of patients in Pune city stands at 19, while Pimpri-Chinchwad has recorded 12.

While the new Pune cases include contacts of a previously diagnosed positive patient as well as a case with a history of foreign travel, the Ahmednagar patient who tested positive is said to have no history of foreign travel.

This is the third patient in Ahmednagar to test positive for COVID-19. Authorities are trying to trace the contacts of the latest positive case. Till now, 208 suspected cases have been screened, of whom 117 people have already been discharged.

Meanwhile, a 63-year-old man from Satara, who recently returned from California, became the second person to test positive in the district on Tuesday. “He had complained of sore throat and fever a few days ago and was immediately placed in an isolation facility. His sample report from the National Institute of Virology tested positive for the virus,” Satara district civil surgeon Dr. Amod Gadikar said.

On Monday, a 45-year-old Satara woman, who had a travel history to Dubai, and four of a family from Islampur tehsil in Sangli with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 positive cases in Maharashtra’s sugar heartland.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1b8id3/article31158055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMDOCTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/10-fresh-positive-cases-take-state-coronavirus-tally-to-107/article31158056.ece
441,2020/03/25,Cabin crew members fly against time to land home,"As all domestic commercial flights were temporarily suspended from midnight on Tuesday, the headache for crew members on duty was to end flights at their home bases instead of other cities. There are many whose families are being harassed and ostracised in certain areas.

Knowing the problems being faced by airline pilots, cabin crew, and ground staff, airlines also worked on a war-footing to get the crew and aircraft at home bases where they can remain till April 14.

Videos of cabin crew members from two different airlines — one from Air India and another from IndiGo — alleging discrimination by neighbours and vendors in local markets around their residences went viral making the whole grounding exercise even more important from a crew repatriation point of view.

Air India reacted with a statement, which said it is alarming to note that in many localities, vigilante resident welfare associations and neighbours have started ostracising the crew, obstructing them from performing their duty or even calling in the police, simply because the crew travelled abroad in the course of their duty.

On Tuesday, most flights on leading sectors like Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Bengaluru went with near full loads indicating that passengers were heading to cities where they would have to spend rest of the lockdown period.

A Vistara spokesperson said, “We are operating today on a reduced network for our customers and to bring back operating and layover crew back to their respective home bases within deadline.”

A SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline had booked many of its crew on other airlines so that they could be home with their loved ones and ensure social distancing till flying resumed on March 31. “We have ensured that all operating crew reach base stations tonight. Some will be travelling on other airlines to reach their home bases. All their tickets have been provided by the airline.”

A Mumbai-based crew member of Air India has been told by her society to look for alternative accommodation. “Is working for a national carrier and getting back our people safely back home a crime? My society called up my husband to inform me that we should move out and manage something elsewhere as a precautionary measure. I am very proud and fortunate that I am one of the many who are helping people in this pandemic,” she wrote to the airline.

An Air India spokesperson said these vigilantes had conveniently forgotten that many a spouse, parent, sibling, child and near and dear ones had been brought home safe from affected countries, thanks to the heroic efforts of these Air India crew.

The videos on Tuesday also resulted in Union Civil Aviation Minister (MoS independent charge), Hardeep Singh Puri, and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal express regret and warn the perpetrators against such behaviour.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/otkt6a/article31158075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cabin-crew-members-fly-against-time-to-land-home/article31158027.ece
442,2020/03/25,Petrol pumps in Pune directed to stop sale of fuel,"Only vehicles ferrying people involved in dispensing essential services will be allowed to fill fuel

The Pune district administration on Tuesday directed all fuel pumps to stop supply to vehicles not engaged in dispensing emergency and essential services in a bid to eliminate vehicular movement on roads and compel the public to obey lockdown orders issued in the State.

Issuing a directive under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Pune District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said only those vehicles ferrying people involved in dispensing essential services or engaged in emergency medical services to contain the spread of the pandemic or carrying people in urgent need of medical help would be allowed to fill fuel at petrol pumps.

‘Freedom of action’

Deputy Chief Minister and Pune’s Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar said the State police and district authorities have been given complete freedom of action to implement lockdown orders and carry out State blockade, district blockade and communication shutdown as they deem fit in order to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Reiterating that the supply of essential commodities like foodgrains, vegetables, milk and groceries would not be affected in any way, Mr. Pawar exhorted citizens across Maharashtra to stop congregating in large numbers at market yards and grocery stores.

In a bid to facilitate movement on roads for those employees of companies and industries exempted from the lockdown, the Pune Police will be issuing digital permits. Employees can mail the authorities at Punecitypolice.grievance @gmail.com to secure digital permits, which will be issued after furnishing requisite personal and company details as well as that of the official necessary for the operation of services. If stopped by the police, the employee concerned will need to show a copy of the email with his ID card.

The Pune Police have also activated four dedicated WhatsApp numbers to answer queries and entertain requests regarding the lockdown orders with respect to permissions for vehicular movement. The numbers are +91 9145003100, 8975283100, 9168003100 and 8975953100.

Cracking the whip

Meanwhile, police authorities across the State were seen enforcing the lockdown, often brandishing sticks and using force to drive away two-wheeler and four-wheeler riders and sending them packing to their homes.

Police personnel and home guards were seen hitting violators with batons and sticks in Aurangabad, Nashik, Kolhapur and Hingoli, while a mild lathi charge was carried out in Nagpur to break up an assembly of more than five people.

443,2020/03/25,4 held for hoarding over 25 lakh masks,"They planned to sell them at high prices in the black market once scarcity struck

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted a racket where over 25 lakh face masks were being hoarded to be sold on the black market at high prices, taking advantage of the ongoing crisis and the fear that it has generated in people’s minds.

According to officials, the three-ply and two-ply N95 masks were seized from a godown in Sahar village on the basis of a tip-off received earlier this month.

In a press conference held at the Unit XI office in Bandra on Tuesday morning, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said, “Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh had received information seven to eight days ago that the masks, of which there is a severe shortage in the State currently, are being hoarded in large quantities. Senior police inspector Mahesh Desai, in charge of Unit IX, then contacted the accused as a buyer and said that he wanted to purchase the mask in bulk.”

Working on the information, Mr. Desai and his team raided the godown in the early hours of Tuesday and seized 9.6 lakh disposable masks, arresting four accused. Based on the initial questioning of the accused, the Unit IX went on to seize a further quantity of 15.61 lakh masks from another godown in Bhiwandi. Officials said the collective market value of the seized masks comes up to ₹14.13 crore.

The four accused have been identified as Mihir Patel (46), Shahrukh Sheikh (23), Balaji Nadar (36) and Ghulam Ali (30). The police said there are several others, including the mastermind of the racket, who are yet to be arrested. “The accused had started buying the masks from wherever they could as soon as the scare first began and had been hoarding it since then. Their intention was to hoard as much as possible, wait till there was an utter scarcity and then start selling them for as high a price as they could. We are ascertaining if they had already started selling them or were still waiting,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection I) Akbar Pathan said.

The accused have been charged under the Essential Commodities Act and have been remanded in the Crime Branch’s custody till March 27, officials said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4h5wkk/article31157990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4-held-for-hoarding-over-25-lakh-masks/article31157991.ece

Mr. Thackeray also requested charitable trusts to help with the distribution. He said, “In some places, charitable trusts have come forward to ensure distribution of food. I have given firm orders for smooth facilitation of transportation and distribution of stocks as we have enough supplies for the next few months.”

Earlier, daily wagers, who are not covered by the National Food Security Act and the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, complained about not receiving their quota of rations. “We received hundreds of complaints from Mumbai and parts of Chembur that the poor are not getting their daily rations. We fail to understand why the government took 48 hours to issue orders,” said food security activist Gorakh Avhad.

445,2020/03/25,Goans unprepared as 21-day lockdown begins,"Mechanism will be finalised to ensure supply of milk and groceries to people, says CM Pramod Sawant

The 21-day all-India lockdown came as a shocker to many in Goa as citizens of the coastal State have not stocked up on essential groceries and vegetables since the Janata Curfew announced by the Prime Minister was expected to be lifted on Wednesday.

The Opposition parties and locals pointed out that the State government had casually extended the Janata Curfew from one day on March 22 to three days. On Tuesday, it was extended to March 31 by Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, who said a necessary system to ensure the supply of essential services will be in place in the next three days.

All major municipal markets in the capital city, Panaji, and the towns of Mapusa, Margao, Vasco and Ponda, which were shut down since Sunday, were allowed to remain open from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. After holding an all-party meeting, Dr. Sawant said Goa has had no positive cases of the coronavirus and the government wants to keep it that way. While the fish markets were officially shut, some vendors sold kingfish and mackerel for a premium at ₹800 and ₹400 a kg, way above the usual prices.

“After taking suggestions from all political parties, we have decided that it is time to take some hard steps. Goa will have a 100% curfew. No shops, including milk, fish, vegetables vendors, will be open. Only government emergency services will be available,” Dr. Sawant said. Admitting that people of the State will face issues, the Chief Minister said the steps were taken for the protection of people’s health.

As many people had been unable to stock household essentials, Dr. Sawant informed that given that it was a lockdown with social distancing and arresting community spread being the aim, district collectors and mamlatdars would be meeting to finalise a mechanism to ensure the supply of milk and groceries to the people of Goa. “A system will be worked out over the next two to three days,” he said.

Last week, the Goa government had sealed its inter-State borders to passenger and tourist traffic as well as imposed Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent mass gatherings. “Tourists should not come to Goa before March 31. Beaches, restaurants and many public places will remain closed in the wake of COVID-19,” Dr. Sawant said.

Leader of the Opposition and Margao Congress MLA Digambar Kamat said the all-party meeting demanded the government to ensure the supply of basic commodities and make sure that no one goes hungry. “I have urged the Chief Minister to address the State as contradictory statements have emerged, creating confusion in the minds of people,” Mr. Kamat said.

Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai, who was part of the all-party meeting, said the announcement of a lockdown should have been accompanied by clarity on how people will be provided with groceries. “I told the Chief Minister it is ethically wrong to make the announcement to Goans after 11 a.m. when the markets were shut,” Mr. Sardesai said.

Many residents took to social media. “I am in Goa. They told us we would have a one day lockdown on Sunday then extended it to March 25, then to March 31, now finally the whole country for 21 days. They said do not panic and buy. What does my family and pets eat for the next few weeks? We cannot make our food last so long,” a local posted on social media.

446,2020/03/25,Thane resident makes hoax calls to avoid going to office,"Accused told police his employer was violating curfew orders

With black marketeers and fraudsters being quick to capitalise on the ongoing novel coronavirus frenzy, mischief mongers don’t seem to be far behind.

A Thane resident, unwilling to go to work while most around him were enjoying work from home, allegedly made hoax calls to the police with false complaints about his own workplace on Monday evening. The police were not amused and slapped a case under the Disaster Management Act against him.

Part of select few

According to the Kasarwadavli police, the accused, Shreyas Gawas, works with a private firm that provides back office support to private banks. The police said Mr. Gawas was among the 10 to 15 people selected to come to work to maintain the company’s servers while the rest of the staff was permitted to work from home.

“Mr. Gawas first called the Thane Police control room on Monday evening and said a large number of people were working at his office, which was in contravention of the curfew orders issued by the government. The information and his contact number were conveyed to us and we sent a team to the spot. However, we found Mr. Gawas’s claims to be false,” senior police inspector Kishore Khairnar said.

A constable then contacted Mr. Gawas, who insisted that his information was correct. The constable told him that nothing of the sort had been found at the spot, and cautioned him against spreading rumours in the current atmosphere. Mr. Gawas, however, made several more calls to the control room and the constable, insisting that he was right and demanding action against his employers.

No heed to warnings

“We repeatedly warned him saying now was not the time to indulge in rumour mongering and that it would attract severe penalty. However, he still did not desist, after which we registered a case against him. Inquiries so far indicate that he committed the offence to cause problems for his employer as he did not want to go to work. He is yet to be arrested,” Mr. Khairnar said.

Mr. Gawas has been booked for giving false information to a public servant with intent to use his lawful power to harm others and making a statement conducive to public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and provisions of the Disaster Management Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/thane-resident-makes-hoax-calls-to-avoid-going-to-office/article31157953.ece
447,2020/03/25,MSEDCL staff won’t collect meter readings this month,"Bill will be computed based on average usage over 12 months

Amid the current lockdown in the State due to the rising number of cases of the novel coronavirus, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) will not be sending its staff to collect meter readings this month.

Instead it will compute the month’s bill on the average meter reading for each consumer over the last 12 months. Consumers also have the option of recording their meter readings using the Mahavitaran app.

An MSEDCL official said they were following directives issued by the Maharashtra Energy Minister, Nitin Raut. “All our field staff are prepared and on duty to cater to any disruption in electricity. We have set up a total of 17 control rooms across the State,” a senior MSEDCL official said.

MSEDCL will also not disconnect the meters of any of their consumers until March 31. A senior MSEDCL official said, “All the bill payment centres of MSEDCL will be functioning. We have taken adequate measures to ensure that social distancing is maintained everywhere. We have also ensured the availability of hand sanitisers at these centres. Other payment centres such as banks will have to take a call on whether they want to provide this service too.”

The official said there was an excess supply of power as peak demand had reduced from around 20,000 MW in the first week of March to around 18,000 MW. He attributed this dip to many industries suspending operations due to the lockdown imposed across the State.

The MSEDCL is the State’s largest power distribution company and caters to nearly 2.6 crore consumers.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vxqljk/article31157925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMELECTRIFICATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/msedcl-staff-wont-collect-meter-readings-this-month/article31157926.ece

On Tuesday, the eve of Gudi Padwa, the Marathi New Year, Health Minister Rajesh Tope appealed to all religious leaders to work as ‘messengers of health’ and educate people on joining the fight against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

In his address to the State on social media, Mr. Tope said only two of the positive COVID-19 cases in the State are serious. Mr. Tope said, “It is extremely satisfying for me to inform you that patients with the novel coronavirus are being cured. We can discharge 15 patients at any time. Only two patients are in the intensive care unit. The rest are stable.”

Since the maximum positive cases of the disease have been detected in Pune and Mumbai, Mr. Tope urged people living in other areas to stop ostracising those arriving from these two cities.

Mr. Tope said an environment of unnecessary fear has been created in the State and it should not persist. He said, “Having cough and cold does not mean the patient is suffering from the novel coronavirus. There are reports that private medical services are being closed and refusing to treat patients with cough and cold. This should be avoided at all costs.”

Meanwhile, in response to Mr. Tope’s appeal to people to come forward and donate blood, the Maharashtra Youth Congress has started organising blood donation camps. Satyajit Tambe, president of the Maharashtra Youth Congress, said, “It was noticed that there was an increasing shortage of blood in medical centres in the State. So we have started blood donation camps at various centres, blood banks and hospitals. To avoid crowding, we have started a registration process.” He said tokens will be issued and the donor can arrive at the centre at the designated time. “Our target is to collect 10,000 bottles of blood,” Mr. Tambe said.

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray made an identical appeal for blood donation and appreciated the work of various organisations that have been organising blood donation camps.

Food available

Meanwhile, Chhagan Bhujbal, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Rights Protection Minister, said people need not worry about food supply as the State has enough stocks to last for six months. He said despite the restrictions on movement of vehicles, the supply of essential commodities will not be affected. He also urged people not to resort to panic-buying.

Mr. Bhujbal said, “We appeal to citizens not to go in groups to purchase vegetables. People should avoid crowding as there will be no lack of supplies. We request citizens to file complaints with the police and the revenue and consumer protection units against those involved in hoarding or black marketeering essential commodities such as masks and hand sanitisers.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/zuf37/article31157891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMSUDARSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/patients-are-being-cured-dont-create-atmosphere-of-fear-tope/article31157892.ece
449,2020/03/25,Chef Floyd Cardoz dies of COVID-19 in New York City,"Chef Cardoz was the co-owner of two successful restaurants in Mumbai – The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro and had earlier this month launched a third venture, the Bombay Sweet Shop with the same team.

Chef Floyd Cardoz, the 59-year-old restaurateur based in the USA, has died. On March 18, Chef Cardoz had tested positive for COVID-19 at a New York hospital.

Hunger Inc, the company that runs the restaurants, said in a statement: “It is with deep sorrow that we inform you of the passing away of Chef Floyd Cardoz (59 years), Co-Founder, Hunger Inc. Hospitality, on March 25, 2020 in New Jersey, USA. He is survived by his mother Beryl, wife Barkha and sons Justin and Peter.

“Floyd tested positive for Covid 19, in USA, on March 18th and was being treated for the same at Mountainside Medical Centre, New Jersey, USA.”

The company had earlier confirmed that the restaurateur-chef had tested positive for the virus. “As a precautionary measure we have informed the Health Department in Mumbai about the same,” it said. “We are also reaching out personally to people who have interacted with him during his visit to India, so they can take necessary medical advice should they indicate any symptoms...”

Chef Cardoz was the co-owner of two successful restaurants in Mumbai – The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro and had earlier this month launched a third venture, the Bombay Sweet Shop with the same team.

The news of Chef Cardoz’s demise has stunned the culinary world. Food writer Roshni Bajaj Sanghvi who has known him for a decade said, “Chef Floyd elevated the way we looked at Indian food, both here and abroad. He showed us how Indian cuisine should be celebrated. He was a friend, a genius chef, and a warm, genuine, remarkable human being, with a sparkling personality. He will be so deeply missed.”

Gauri Devidayal, who owns The Table and Mei13 said, “Chef Floyd was a global icon in the food world and one of the first chefs to put Indian food on the world map with his restaurant, Tabla. He is someone that not just the Hunger Inc team, but everyone looked up to. His mark on the restaurant industry in both New York and Bombay was remarkable and it’s unimaginable to think he is no more because of this dreaded virus. I wish his personal and restaurant family all the strength in the world in this difficult time.”

The Mumbai-born Chef Cardoz with Goan origins had originally trained to be a biochemist. He shot to fame when he won the top honour of the television reality show, Top Chef Masters Season 3 with an upma dish with a twist. A product of IHM Dadar, Mumbai’s hotel management school, Chef Cardoz successfully ran New York’s acclaimed, Tabla restaurant for 12 years before it shut down in 2010.

Most recently he ran the popular Soho Indian restaurant, Bombay Bread Bar which was formerly known as Paowalla for three years. Food critics had called it a “magical love letter to Indian bread.”

Food writer, Aatish Nath said, “Chef Floyd Cardoz always had wry smile on his face and was quick with suggestions when it came to what to eat, at both O Pedro and Bombay Canteen. More recently, at Bombay Sweet Shop there was a sense of pride in what the team at Hunger Inc, in which he was a partner, had created. It was clear that Cardoz took pride, rightfully, in what he had built in the country and the city of his birth in addition to his legacy in New York City. He was seen as an ambassador for Indian food, which again brought him back to India on the most recent season of chef David Chang’s Netflix show, Ugly Delicious.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/fgtnkq/article31165567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FLYD,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/chef-floyd-cardoz-dies-of-covid-19-in-new-york-city/article31165568.ece

Are you missing your family, and the joys of community? You are not alone. MetroPlus talks to people who are in self-isolation all over the world to demonstrate that now, more than ever, we are all in this together

Giulia Grimaldi — Turin, Italy; Digital Content Editor

I have been locked down in my apartment since Wednesday, March 11. I live alone, with my laptop, a few cactuses and a stuffed cat. I am on the fourth floor of a used-to-be-lively neighbourhood in Turin, Northern Italy.

On the first Sunday, I woke up at sunrise and sneaked out for a quick run. I hate running. But the urge of moving and watching the city still half asleep was so big I didn’t really think about it. I guess I just wanted to fool myself into believing everything was normal. Well, it isn’t. But going out is not the answer. It is crystal clear now that we have to stay at home. It doesn’t matter if I am healthy and young: I have to do my part and not put others at risk, not compromise the weakened healthcare system.

From questioning reality to looking for a conspiracy theory is a quick step when you spend the whole day sitting alone with your thoughts. I have decided to limit my news reading to a few selected sources and to speak about it only with a few informed people. I am self-isolating myself from opinions and avoiding chit chat over the virus: that’s necessary for mental stability.

My recipe is one hour of trusted newspaper reading in the morning, a news update around 6 pm and, sometimes, wine and talks with friends on the Zoom app. Oh, and I almost forgot, it is important to silence the many WhatsApp forwards.

Once I have made my home safe (from germs and misinformation) I work on my routine like never before. I am finally getting up early, eating a healthy breakfast and exercising everyday. Most importantly, the excuse “I don’t have time” has expired. I have time to read all those books I bought and never opened, watch all the movies on my list, write all the books I have been playing in my head. If I don’t do it now, it feels like I never will.

Some days can be harder than others and it is just fine to take care of ourselves in different ways. I call my grandma every day, and am now wondering why I didn’t do it before. She is in lockdown too, scared and bored, so I ask her to guide me over the phone while cooking, learning a lot and reminding myself why I need to stay at home. Because I want this thing to end soon so she can cook me a proper meal. And I can hug her.

It is not an easy time, uncertainty may keep you up longer than usual at night, but it is useful to meet yourself for real, to understand you are lonely but not alone. And to be sure that when everything is over, we will take care of the things that matter with greater consciousness.

Anjali Venugopal — Paris, France; Home chef

A little over a month ago, we sat on a flight to start life from scratch in the City of Love, Paris. I’m a lawyer who gave up Law to pursue my passion that is food, and my husband, Sriram Govind, currently works with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, headquartered in this stunning city.

We were merely beginning to get acquainted with our freshly-minted Parisian lives when COVID-19 made its appearance. And now, we are in the midst of a lockdown and mandatory quarantine. We are on Day 14 of complete social isolation in our 700 square feet apartment and it has not been effortless. We are allowed to step out for medicines or groceries. However, only one person from each home is allowed to step out at a time and that too armed with a form that must be filled out with an appropriate reasoning.

Anjali Venugopal (left) | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

The police and military have been deployed to take the rule flouters to task. Sriram has been working from home, which seems to be keeping him busy and in reasonably good spirits.

I am a self-employed private chef who is in the nascent stages of setting up shop in Paris. As someone who thrives on the hustle of running a small business, I now realise how much time a day holds, especially when I cannot cook as much as I would like to, lest we should run out of our limited stock of groceries.

Normally, I make elaborate and hearty meals based on culinary styles from across the Indian subcontinent. I used to look forward to cooking something new every day because cooking at home was my practice ground for the work I do. However, now, lunches comprise not more than rice, dal and a simple thoran (a Kerala dish), and sometimes chicken curry. Meals are no longer time-consuming and cooking has now become a chore and that is not something I am familiar with.

But every time I find myself fidgeting, I remind myself of all the instances when I wished for more time. I have been trying to make the most of these days with things that bring me joy — trying out recipes without the pressure of cooking for an audience, working out, speaking to people whose voices I haven’t heard in a long time (thanks to all things new in technology).

New routines such as late afternoon tea dates on the balcony and movie nights with wine are slowly taking shape. Despite the grim atmosphere around, I refuse to forget that this is probably the most time we are all going to be blessed with to focus on things that make life worth living.

Fran Gillespie — Fortingall, Scotland; Senior citizen

My husband David and I are retired and live in Fortingall, a small village in the Scottish Highlands. With its picturesque thatched cottages and an ancient tree reputed to be the oldest in Europe, it draws thousands of visitors a year.

Now it seems bizarre and unreal to see the place deserted, and everyone keeping to their homes. Our own lives have not changed significantly, we’ve just starting gardening after a long, cold wet winter, and I’m tackling the spring-cleaning jobs I’d be doing anyway at this time.

But we are very conscious of the effect of this disaster on some of our neighbours. The hotel which is central to the village shut two weeks ago, one neighbour had a flourishing catering business, another runs a garden care concern. Now that lockdown has been announced, for them and their families, there’s a grim few months ahead.

A couple of weeks ago, when the government advised the British population to stay at home as much as possible, to keep a minimum of two-metre distance when talking to anyone and to look after the ‘elderly and vulnerable’, my immediate reaction was to call some of my neighbours who are frail and in their eighties, and offer to do shopping or collect prescriptions.

Then we were suddenly inundated by offers from people to do the same for us, and I realised with surprise that as we are in our late seventies we come into the ‘elderly and vulnerable’ category ourselves! It is the first time I’ve been made to feel old.

A crisis like this brings out the best in almost everyone, and the worst in just a few. The hotel owner offered to do shopping for anyone who needed help, as did the girl who delivers our post. Together with others in the village we’ve set up a WhatsApp group so anyone who needs any help can alert the community.

A local bakery, which normally just supplies retail outlets, announced that they would be coming round all the villages in this area with a van twice a week to deliver bread and essentials and would collect anything else needed and deliver it free of charge.

How has our life changed? Visits by our grandchildren during the Easter holidays are of course cancelled, as is our holiday in Turkey in May. We miss the social activities — in my case, the weekly church services, community choir practice, a lunch club, committee meetings for various societies, meeting friends for coffee and chat. Now we phone each other frequently to make up for the social gatherings.

Compared to so many, we are extremely fortunate, with no job to worry about, and a beautiful countryside in which to take solitary walks.

Elena Coello-Muscone — Valencia, Spain; former Travel industry executive

I resigned my job in New York City and came to Spain to attend to family matters. I am not working currently, and I live alone with my dog Theo in Valencia, the third-most important city in Spain (after Madrid and Barcelona). Here (unlike in the US), working from home is kind of unusual except in large multi-national companies.

The country closed down on March 13 and will be shut till April 10. All businesses are closed except markets, supermarkets and pharmacies.

Before the COVID-19 crisis, my life was quite active. I used to give private English classes to children between the age of 10 and 14 years, walk on the beach and travel a lot within Spain as well as abroad.

Elena Coello-Muscone | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

After the state of emergency was introduced, the only thing I am allowed to do is go out for 15 minutes through my block to walk Theo, and nothing else.

The first thing I do when I get up is to take Theo out for 15 minutes (we walk three times a day). Then I do some exercise and yoga. The rest of the morning is spent in housekeeping.

After lunch, I take a nap for about an hour (since siestas are kind of mandatory here in Spain). Then I do some reading, and talking on the phone with family and friends from abroad who are interested in the development of the events here. After dinner, I watch movies or series on both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Local television is impossible to watch as the channels are always talking about COVID-19.

Employees have been sent home to collect “unemployment” which is paid totally by the government. I have spoken with my former co-workers in the New York travel industry and they are all working from home. They tell me that the only calls they receive are to cancel travel reservations for the whole year.

Geetha RK — Barcelona, Spain; Entrepreneur

I watch the lady cleaning the restaurant’s entrance door with a sense of disquiet. She wears gloves and is rubbing sanitiser liquid to parts of the door. Then, when my husband requests the waitress to serve our pizza cut into slices, she politely declines. Touching food is not allowed once food leaves the kitchen. New rules.

That was the last time I dined at a restaurant. The next day, the Spanish Prime Minister announced a fortnight of quarantine where social and economic life as I know it, ended.

Geetha RK | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

I am now in the second week of quarantine. How has my life changed? Well for one, I’m washing hands frequently. Lady Macbeth would have learnt a trick or two about it from the numerous WhatsApp videos.

There are fewer clothes to wash and iron. Meal times are a family affair with the entire family sitting down together. Chores become jobs. There are runs on the supermarkets initially, but the madness has subsided and there is no shortage of essential commodities. Supermarket queues and delivery times are longer though. Masks, gloves and hand sanitisers have become scarce and valuable, creating a new class of “haves” and “have-nots”.

The street has become my stage and passers-by, my players — dog owners giving non-owners like me the comeuppance, walking their pets several times a day; the man striding purposefully and joyfully, to the supermarket with his shopping stroller; the delivery boy going about his food delivery; birds strutting on empty carriageways; a rainbow drawing stuck on a window; the 8 o’clock ritual of clapping hands; playing bingo and “I spy” with neighbours across the street; balcony concerts of singing, dancing, music. Life’s joys have become simpler.

Spain’s Internet data traffic is now the fifth highest in the world. This is one time the Internet and social media have shed their devil’s horns. From being stigmatised for keeping people disconnected from the outside world, to keeping us all connected in these dystopian times, it makes me wonder what would life under quarantine be without memes, videos and gifs that make me laugh, reflect, stay informed, be warned?

Nikhil Prabhakar — Dublin, Ireland; Software engineer

I have not been out during the day in several days, which has been hard because the weather in Ireland has been just absolutely beautiful. My routine keeps me occupied during my solitude. I wake up, I shower, I make my bed, I read the news and I sit down to work.

Lately, I have noticed myself keeping an ear out for the mail slot in my front door — even though the only mail I get is for the previous tenant. So my excitement for the day is to scour the return addresses on envelopes to see who my predecessor won’t be paying this month.

Nikhil Prabhakar | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

My quarantine is really not that isolating, if I were being honest. I’m on video calls everyday, with family, with work colleagues and with friends. And, on more than one occasion, I have had to mute WhatsApp conversations or tear myself away from Facebook so I can focus on work.

I will watch the odd sitcom while I am cooking or eating but I have not really binge-watched anything, as I would have expected to.

Having recently moved to Ireland, I have procured Dubliners and Ulysses by James Joyce — books I had tried to read when I was in college but was never able to get past the first page. They continue to serve as an inspiration to do almost anything else.

The Health Services Executive in Ireland makes a distinction between self-quarantine and self-isolation. You are asked to self-isolate if you have all the symptoms for the infection. You try to stay away even from close family and generally behave as though it is the 14th Century and you have the plague.

Self-quarantine is a little less restrictive and applies when you are asymptomatic but you have visited a country or been around a person who was symptomatic. You can still go out but you assume that you are infected and you restrict your movements so as not to infect anyone else.

I go to our corner store (Mellons, run by a lovely, sleep-deprived couple with three kids) for milk and eggs, or to grab one of their fresh breakfast breads. I also go out for a walk but I try to be out when there is no one about. Luckily the Irish have been taking social distancing seriously so it is not hard. You never get closer than six feet from another person — so it makes for some very funny-looking, long queues to get into grocery stores.

I miss my daily interactions at work and I miss going out for a drink with friends, but on the whole it hasn’t been too bad.

Sandra Nijhof — The Hague, The Netherlands; Marketing and Communications Manager

Suddenly, we are realising what a challenge it is to be at home given the uncertainty of how many weeks it is going to be due to the Coronavirus! With five members — my husband, three teenagers (15, 18 and 20) and I, we are varied and not necessarily people who want to do everything together, as a group.

I work with the International Institute of Social Studies. First, there is official work to be done on a daily basis: making sure we have the right files at hand, testing new tools for online meetings (that were introduced in a jiffy), Skype calls, IT frustrations and more. Quite a full agenda while also keeping an eye on the news: how is the situation in our country, how is it developing elsewhere? And how are our parents? Now we are not allowed to see them (they are in the vulnerable elderly category) so we sent them presents. Such a relief that at least the post works as if nothing has changed.

Sandra Nijhof | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

For the kids, the initial excitement of an unexpected extra holiday disappeared very soon as the schools re-started within a few days with online classes and homework. But there is also a lot of insecurity and uncertainty over finishing the academic syllabus, the new schedule for exams. One of my kids is not able to cope with that in an easy way. So complaints keep coming up: my throat is aching, I have a headache, is it the virus? So, I constantly have to keep him in good mood and motivated which is not that easy when so much about the disease is still so unclear.

Being all together all the time while you have to get on with normal things can be hard. The kitchen was never used so intensely as it is these days. Only if everybody cleans up their own mess, that would make life much easier. We all have some ways to distance ourselves a bit from the others.

There is time to have a long bath and read the newspaper. I found myself a nice app for some fitness and yoga to do early morning when the house is tidy and quiet. The children brought an impressive barbell with some weights into our little garden to continue with their power training.

Zorana Franciskovic — Subotica, Serbia; Garment industry executive

Serbia has been in state of emergency since last Sunday. People above 65 years are not allowed to go out at all. Schools are closed, and kids from middle school (and as far as I know, high-school too) have educational programmes on TV and online support from their teachers.

Zorana Franciscovic | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

At first I was really scared. I didn’t know what to expect. Production at my company, which makes women’s garments, has stopped. We in the administration have been coming in, because we need to finish work from the previous week and also to provide information to employees.

I used to go to the gym four times a week, but with the new rules, I am getting my fitness regimen at home with the help of Shawn T workout videos.

Also, thank God for modern technology, because I can stay in touch with my family with whom I am really close, since the emergency was declared.

We have enough things at stores around the city, so there is no need to hoard supplies. It is very difficult to fit all the things that need to be done until 5pm and to stay indoors for more than half the day, but I hope that people know that if we respect the measures given out by the government, this will pass sooner.

Nicole Antoinette Lewis — San Diego, USA; Teacher and entrepreneur

I recently stumbled upon a quote by Mandy Hale — “When you find yourself cocooned in isolation and cannot find your way out of darkness, remember that this is similar to the place where caterpillars go to grow their wings.” When I am feeling low, I turn to the cycle of the caterpillar and butterflies for guidance.

California has been under lockdown since March 20. I am used to working 30 hours a week at Digital Media Arts College and also teaching yoga to kids at a nearby elementary, two hours a week.

Nicole Antoinette Lewis | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

But for the last week I have been home. I miss my little yogis but I want them to be safe. Even though I am home, I wake up and put on something pretty. I like to look good for myself and always find ways to implement self-care into my daily routine.

I am using this “stay in” time to “go within”. Being creative is my norm, I am constantly dabbling in the arts, but currently, I am crafting candles. I have also started working on my poetry again. I am into aromatherapy and have a passion for herbs, spices, pretty flowers, and essential oils.

The environment is everything to me. I love setting the mood with candles, calming music, beautiful paintings, and food cooking on the stove.

While I live in San Diego, the rest of my family is in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey and they are all under lockdown. I speak to my mother three to four times a day. I have always been a germaphobe but I am now obsessive with disinfecting everything after every use. It all seems so surreal.

I first heard of COVID-19 on the news around the end of January. I was scared but also felt like it was far away and wouldn’t really affect me. I realised the situation was really bad about two weeks ago when my work shut down their offices and then everything else followed suit like a domino effect.

San Francisco issued a “shelter-in place” ordinance on Monday, March 15, but I’ve been “sheltering” since the Friday before that, when my office required us to work from home.

I know some friends of friends who have contracted Coronavirus and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time when people start to show symptoms. While this can be incredibly anxiety-inducing, I’ve tried to keep busy to take my mind off of the state of the virus.

I’m extremely lucky I get to work from home and that makes the days pass by fairly quickly. My company is heavily impacted by the virus so we’ve been all hands-on-deck, working late nights and weekends. I also try to wake up around 7 am, workout, shower and make breakfast. While I eat, I check my emails. If I don’t have a chance to work out in the morning I’ll try to run during my lunch break to get some fresh air. It’s hard to ‘turn off’ when working from home so I usually work till 6.30 or 7 pm.

I try to make each day as normal as possible —except I wear comfy clothes. I usually walk to work, so to make things a little more normal I sometimes get up and walk around the block in the morning. My boyfriend and I are planning on having ‘date nights’ where we dress up and order in. I’ve also tried to synchronise my ‘virtual’ fitness classes with my in-gym teaching schedule.

Nicolas Grandi — Buenos Aires, Argentina; Filmmaker, artist and educator

I live in a pretty, green neighbourhood. Even before the lockdown, it has always been very quiet. It’s a family house, and I have my living and working space in the first floor.

Autumn is already here, it’s windy and still mildly warm. Sound has become the biggest protagonist. Two linden trees are still like guardians, clapping leaves. The train that’s a few blocks away runs once in a while. Once or twice a day, some fragment of a conversation can be heard.

People are allowed to go to the pharmacy or to get food. The rest is on halt. I’m quite a hermit so I don’t feel any anxiety, but I know it’s also due to my privileges. Silence is helping me focus on my writing (thesis). Not having the need to respond to obligations has reshaped fully the feel of the days. I am wearing my lungi throughout the day.

Nicolas Grandi | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Somehow, by the fifth day of the curfew, many of us felt the need to get in touch. WhatsApp, Facebook, phone calls. Over 30 in one day. ‘How is it going?’ ‘How are you dealing with it?’ ‘What have you been doing?’ I even had a conversation with a friend of a friend of a friend from Bangalore who is married to a Belgian woman. They are travelling in a camper through Latin America.

The lockdown got them in Patagonia, luckily in a wonderful area full of lakes with enough provisions. But they felt the need to speak with somebody in English as their Spanish is of no use, just in case they needed to get away for whatever reason. Foreigners are highly distrusted, unfortunately. But then everyone becomes a source of mistrust.

The questions that come out in most conversations are what will happen after this? 50/50 possibilities of a deep change in our living systems: welfare or The Handmaid’s Tale. So uncertain. But as far as it goes, this halt is making me focus on the present, on my writing, caring of the self and those who I interact with, rethinking priorities. Life first, then we’ll find ways to tackle with the economical disaster once more.

Yokina Wu — Guangzhou, China; Homemaker

I first heard about COVID-19 on Christmas Eve. For the next 20 days we thought of it as a form of pneumonia. I live in Guangzhou which is around 1,000 kilometres from Wuhan. Since I didn’t know anyone from there, I thought we have no connection with it.

Around January 20, my husband’s colleague had planned to go to Hubei for the Chinese New Year holidays and found it strange that tickets were easily available. He thought they were fake tickets and asked my husband to check too. The tickets were truly available. But just as he booked them, his parents called, asking him not to come as the situation in Wuhan (in Hubei province) was dangerous, and there was going to be a lockdown. That’s when we got anxious.

Yokina Wu | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

When we heard medical teams would come to our province, we were less anxious and went to the nearby hot springs on January 23, as well as shopping for the holidays.

Everything seemed normal till my colleague’s home town Shantou went under lockdown. We heard our neighbouring province Dongguan and ours too might follow suit, so we returned. Guangzhou never locked down but shut down the shops, large restaurants, wet markets and places of entertainment. Mail services were delayed. But supermarkets and small shops were open. And we could use apps to order food and drinks.

A lot of services normally stop during holidays, so we had anyway stocked up for two weeks. My family and I did not go out for eight days. The buses and underground were still operating, though.

The holidays ended on February 8 but people were not allowed to go back to work and all the schools, kindergartens, colleges were shut down. I felt the whole world was slowing down. I live in the oldest business district of Guangzhou and I have never seen the roads so empty.

Our schedule changed. We treated it like an extended holiday and I had more time. My family would not getup before 10 am, so my husband ate his breakfast alone. I would play with my daughter in the garden.

My husband and I watched NBA together. Our television network made a series of songs and stories for kids about the virus and how to protect yourself, and my daughter enjoyed watching them everyday.

I made Japanese plum wine at home, and made a ball for my kid with bubble wrap so she could play all day and not disturb the neighbours. Learning at home with my daughter became our everyday task — online school is busy and messy. She also had music classes online.

As people were encouraged to stay home, there was a discount on orders for delivery. Our government has provided every citizen a QR code that contains record of places travelled to over 40 days and health information. We just show it, and can travel around China except Hubei.

Abdul Qadir+ — Doha, Qatar; Senior Business Strategy Manager with a telecom firm

Though Qatar had no confirmed infections in the beginning of March, the scenario changed as people living out of the country moved back to the capital Doha to rejoin their families.

The company where I am employed has issued ‘work-from-home’ (WFH) permission for most of its staff to increase social distancing. I interact online with colleagues and get tasks done. WFH allows you to relax your dress code, but of course, when it comes to formal video conferencing, I make sure I am dressed properly.

I realised that while working with the TV on was good initially, it could be a distraction after sometime. So I keep it switched off these days.

With no lunches, birthday parties, distribution of chocolates and sweets among colleagues, WFH has become a healthier option, as I find that I can fit in walks and exercise breaks into my daily routine. You can also get a short nap during the afternoon.

I usually call it a day at 5.30 pm, but I can keep going longer if at home. At work, you keep thinking of the traffic snarls and hence hit the road early.

Though working from home has increased my productivity, I miss the warmth of interacting with colleagues, sharing jokes and chitchat in office. I hope things will get back to normal soon, not just for me, but for everyone around the world.

Vidya Kannan — Singapore; Banker

I am aware of the seriousness of COVID 19, but I haven’t put my existence on hold due to it. Singapore never went in for a lockdown, and the government took up extensive contact tracing and quarantined families of all infected people.

From February 8, I have been working from home. Malls, bars and cinema halls were open and we just got the update about closure of these places from March 25. Transport is fully functional, but people have chosen to tone down non-essential movement.

My five-year-old daughter goes to her school everyday and only extracurricular classes conducted by part-time teachers have been cancelled. My father-in-law’s visa extension process took no more than 90 minutes in a hassle-free manner during this time.

In a way, I like the pace at which my life moves on now. I am not rushing to anywhere, travel time is saved and I spend it for the family, with the family. We get to eat meals with the family. I spend more time with my kid, doing creative stuff such as masks and art work. My husband and daughter have made snakes-and-ladders from scratch and they play this board game everyday. She also plays with a group of children when possible.

I have not missed my weekly music classes, and I have time for 30 minutes of guided meditation these days. Similarly, I do online yoga five days a week with a teacher based in Chennai. I love how I can exercise, meditate, work, spend time with family and give everything more than I used to.

Gayatri Nair — Chennai, India; Photographer

At the outset, I have to say, this crisis has made me acutely aware of how privileged I am. Even talking about our struggles during these various phases, of uncertainty, quarantining and lockdown, seems so frivolous when such a large majority of the population is under threat of being seriously affected, be it their mental and physical health, their wages, their business, their families and more.

I work at a non-profit arts foundation and we started working from home a week ago. Actually, productivity has been good so far. We are thinking of new ways of working. We already worked in the cloud so sharing content has been easy. Since most of our work is community-focused, we are trying to curate digital educational content and organise virtual events.

However, its the non-working hours that seem to be challenging. We live with four dogs, in a house facing the beach, so I really can’t say I’m “stuck at home”. There’s a lot of outdoor space.

But still, like everyone, I feel anxiety and look for ways to keep the mind occupied. I’ve been cooking more, doing more chores around the house. I used to like cooking things out of fancy cookbooks, then I lost the groove. But now, I’m finally enjoying cooking simple stuff. Dal, simple summer veggies, soup, stir-fry, fried rice; the no-brainer kind of cooking, that let’s me play with what’s in my pantry. I’ve called friends and family I haven’t spoken to in months ( a habit I hope will stay). Every morning, my workout buddies and I video conference on Zoom to workout together. I’ve restarted learning German via the Duolingo app. I’ve even started learning to hula hoop watching YouTube tutorials. My count is 10 so far.

452,2020/03/25,"It’s an exciting time for magic, says illusionist Neel Madhav on ‘You Got Magic’","Illusionist Neel Madhav combines his bag of tricks with travel destinations in his latest TV show, ‘You Got Magic’

“But how did you do that,” is an expression that Neel Madhav often encounters in his profession.

The Mumbai-based illusionist, who has made a brand for his tricks that combine magic with mentalism, neuro-linguistic programming, and criminology, is back home. But he has been up and about in the last few months, touring 13 Indian cities for Sony BBC Earth’s You Got Magic and enthralling audiences with his bag of tricks.

“Street magic for television is very different from a stage show,” says the 27-year-old, “Here, you have to show the trick.”

That is exactly what he has done in You Got Magic, which promises to combine the thrills of travel and magic. Neel Madhav’s travel stories not only include the ‘must dos’ and ‘must sees’ but also include interesting facts to make the experience more exciting. “There was a lot of interesting experiences, especially because of the varied culture that India has to offer.”

The best among them, according to him, was Kerala’s Thrissur. The timing of his visit could not have been more perfect; it was during the Onam festival, when all of Kerala was up and celebrating. “Thrissur was amazing; we filmed when the ‘Tiger festival’ was on. What was most interesting to see was the communal harmony because there was no religious association with the festival.”

The sight of three girls — a Muslim, a Christian and a Hindu — walking together was among the various images the camera following Neel captured. “It looked right out of a movie scene.”

So, how does he design his tricks? “In some places, we plan it, but in others, we just go with the flow. I get most excited when I can conjure up a trick within a few minutes, based on the resources available on ground. Sometimes, those are the ones that get the best reactions.”

With his latest show, Neel hopes to throw light on offbeat travel options and also create more awareness on magic among the general public. “Magic is an untapped market. Till now, a lot of people, especially in rural parts, think that such “miracles” can be done only by foreigners. That is changing now,” says Neel, who considers international magicians like Dynamo, David Blaine and Criss Angel as his role models, “It’s an exciting time for magic at the moment.”

Appeals for contribution

Appealing to entrepreneurs, public sector undertakings and others to contribute to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to meet the additional expenditure needed to tackle the spread of virus, Mr. Narayanasamy said he had contributed a month’s pension as a parliamentarian to the fund.

458,2020/03/25,Social distancing leads to drop in footfall at banks,"There are 128 urban and 62 rural branches of various banks in U.T.

Footfalls came down drastically in banks across urban and rural Puducherry which functioned under the revised business hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. as the Union Territory went into lockdown on Tuesday to break the chain of COVID-19.

Banks, which were among the essential services exempted from the lockdown, had introduced various safety measures such as hand sanitisers for customers and protective gear for staff. These were as per advisories of the Reserve Bank of India, Government of India, Indian Banks Association and other authorities.

“While most urban branches of banks reported a roughly 50 per cent reduction in customers, the demand for services was relatively higher in rural centres,” a spokesman for the State-Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) said.

The revised business hours are in place till March 31 in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. There are 128 urban and 62 rural branches of various banks in Puducherry and over 300 ATMs. “Adequate cash has been loaded at ATMs,” SLBC spokesman said.

Digital transaction

Banks have also encouraged customers to utilise digital transaction modes and to avoid walk-ins to bank/ATM as far as possible as a precautionary measure. But, for those who turned up at branches, banks provided all basic essential services of cash deposit and withdrawal, clearing of cheques, remittances and Government transactions to customers. Measures were also in place to avoid overcrowding in branches through social distancing between customers.

Hand sanitisers and awareness boards on the novel coronavirus and recommended safety precautions were also kept across ATMs in the city. “There has not been any circular on reducing duty staff across branch offices. This has been left to the discretion of the respective branches,” the SLBC spokesperson said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/r27phb/article31158549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25PONDYSLOTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/social-distancing-leads-to-drop-in-footfall-at-banks/article31158550.ece

Even the prominent Goubert fish market wore a deserted look.

Vegetable and grocery vendors kept buckets of turmeric mixed with water as disinfectant. Customers were asked to dip their hands before any transactions.

Though some small outlets selling household items were opened in the morning hours, police forced them to close down. Jawaharlal Nehru Street, the main business hub, remained completely shut.

Auto-rickshaws, share autos, taxis and public utility vehicles were off the roads.

However, there was a steady flow of people to the town on two-wheelers forcing police to intervene. People were asked to go back home and stay indoors to prevent them getting exposed to the virus.

461,2020/03/25,"Amid the lockdown, popular children’s stories are also going live","In this time of social distancing, a host of storytellers and children’s book creators are using technology to bring the magic of stories into your homes

It is nearly 2.30 pm, and my four-year-old is jumping around. “Is it time, is it time?” she squeals excitedly. “A couple of minutes more,” I tell her, as I check the Instagram handle. Soon, my daughter is sitting in front of my phone, engrossed as freelance graphic designer Shradha Mohan reads aloud from Handa’s Surprise by Eileen Browne. I get 10 minutes of peace and quiet to drink a cup of tea.

In the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, fractious children — and parents — are more home-bound than they are used to. But that does not mean story time stops. A number of storytellers are taking to social media, especially Instagram, to do online reading sessions.

“Parents are feeling the pressure in having to engage their children in meaningful activities while balancing work, leaving them with very little ‘me time’,” says Dipna Daryanani, educator and co-founder of the children’s clothing brand Love the World Today. So Dipna decided to use storytelling, something she incorporates in her theatre and dance workshops, to help out parents by doing readings online.

Shradha has been doing informal storybook readings since last August. “We usually meet at someone’s home, where I read a book out loud and then do an activity based on the story,” says Shradha. “But when schools closed down early due to COVID-19, we decided to stop the meet-ups.”

But the kids missed the stories and since she would read a book (or three) to her five-year-old daughter, Aadhya, everyday, she decided to read on Instagram instead, so that other kids could join in. And so started Happy Hour Reading. “So many kids tune in,” says Shradha, “They send me voice notes after, which is my favourite part, telling me what they liked and felt about the book.”

The kids seem to love the readings and want more. When Janaki Sabesh, in collaboration with Lil Trails, did an enactment of Gajapati Kulapati by Ashok Rajagopalan on Instagram, the response was immense. Avanti Natarajan, an architect and one half of the Instagram handle Lil Trails, which she runs with her husband Rajavel Sundar, says, “We had 500-odd views during the Instagram live and, when the video went up, around 6,000 views over two-three days.”

Writers to the fore

It’s not just storytellers, even the Indian children’s book community has come together to keep kids entertained and engaged. Bijal Vachharajani, a children’s book writer, says, “With everything going on and all the unease, I wanted to see if we could do something to help. I put the word out on a children’s book group, asking if any writers and illustrators would like to read online.” Almost immediately, Bijal had nearly 15 volunteers.

This led to #ThodaReadingCorona (the hashtag is the brainchild of author Roopal Rashomani Kewalya). As part of the line-up, there’s children’s book author Venita Coelho, author and illustrator Anupam Arunachalam, author Anita Roy, and illustrator Krupa, among others.

“They will all be reading from their own works,” says Bijal. “And after the storytelling, there will be an activity the kids can do.” While some of the readings will be for the little ones, there will be a few for middle-graders as well. The sessions will be on Instagram and Facebook. The initiative will go on for the next month at least, as more children’s book creators have signed up to participate.

The online storytellers plan to keep things going as well. Lil Trails has collaborated with Golpo – Tales Unlimited to host Online Story Fest, where Avanti and Rajavel will be interacting with Janaki. There will be storytelling, dramatised readings, and sing-alongs. Dipna will be doing storytelling thrice a week and will nominate others to read as well. For the foreseeable future, Shradha is planning to read a children’s book out loud every day, along with her daughter, and will also share insights about the book’s design and illustrations.

As Dipna puts it, “You know how they say it takes a village to raise a child. In this case, it’s a digital village lending a hand.”

In these confusing times, our kids need stories more than ever. Bijal adds, “We are all in this together and will overcome what’s happening. And in the meantime, we hope books and stories will be a safety net for children to retreat into and allow them to be in their own world for a bit.”",children,https://www.thehindu.com/society/w94tie/article31162881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MPHappy-Hour-Reading,https://www.thehindu.com/children/amid-the-lockdown-popular-childrens-stories-are-also-going-live/article31162888.ece
462,2020/03/25,COVID-19 | 200 booked for lockdown violation in Thiruvananthapuram,"Police frown on ‘unnecessary travel’, seize 85 two-wheelers, 19 autorickshaws and 13 cars

The police on Wednesday registered cases against more people in the district for violating COVID-19 lockdown stipulations.

According to official figures, 134 cases were registered in the city on Wednesday as against 160 on Tuesday, while 66 cases were registered in rural Thiruvananthapuram.

The city police also seized 85 two-wheelers, 19 autorickshaws and 13 cars for ‘unnecessary travel’ violating the restrictions.

The owners would be issued notices and the vehicles released. However, a second offence would lead to the cancellation of their registration, City Police Commissioner Balram Kumar Upadhyay said.

Slightly better

Compared to Tuesday, however, the situation in the city was slightly better. Movement on city streets had thinned down considerably with the police frowning on unnecessary travel and registering cases on Tuesday. Across the city, police teams hailed down private vehicles and questioned the occupants as to the reasons for travel.

“Movement came down by around 20% on Wednesday.

The number of cases registered in the city have also come down from 160 on Tuesday to 134,” Mr. Upadhyay said. “But we need to tighten the measures. Lockdown means lockdown,” he said.

Flats and apartments have been directed to maintain a register at the gates to keep tabs on the entry and departure of the occupants. They will undergo daily inspection by the police.

Against occupants

Action will be taken against occupants who violate the restrictions, the City Police Commissioner said. Action will be initiated against apartment office-bearers who fail to adhere to the direction, he said.

Additionally, domestic workers and home nurses should either be provided accommodation at their places of work or should be asked to stay away for 21 days, the police said. Food, LPG delivery staff, employees of supermarkets, vegetable stalls, pharmacies and grocery shops also should be provided accommodation by their employers.

The Kerala High Court has been shut down till April 14 in view of the countrywide lockdown. The decision was taken by a full court meeting held on Wednesday.

A full Bench led by Chief Justice S. Manikumar extended by a month all the orders of bail or anticipatory bail that may expire during the lockdown period.

The Bench made it clear that the right of personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 should not at any rate be infringed upon by the arrest of an accused except in matters where arrest is inevitable.

The court, however, made it clear that the directive would not be applicable to issues relating to public order and law and order and any action taken by the State to combat the current crisis. The State was at liberty to take decision in respect of heinous/serious offences.

In the event of an arrest, the constitutional obligation under Article 20(2) should be followed in letter and spirit, the court observed.

No coercive action

The court observed that it was expected that the State government, local self-government institutions, and PSUs would not take any coercive action, as the people had no opportunity to approach the court during the lockdown period.

464,2020/03/25,Fear of shortage dominates second day of lockdown,"Govt. scrambles to keep supply lines operational

The fear that essential supplies might run short dominated the second day of the COVID-19 outbreak-related lockdown in the State on Wednesday.

Marketplaces appeared empty of fish and vegetable vendors, and the few hawkers on the street sold their wares at inflated prices. People complained that traders increased rates of onion, tomato, and egg. Chicken and meat stalls were scarce across the State.

With inter-State supply chains disrupted, the government scrambled to ensure the availability of pulses, edible oil, and other essential provisions.

District administrations have sought the help of inter-State truckers and wholesale importers of essential commodities to keep markets and stores well supplied.

The government struggled to convince Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to allow freight movement across borders.

There were complaints galore that aggressive police patrols forced bakeries shut, prevented vegetable stalls from opening for business, and turned back fish lorries and street vendors.

Emotions ran high across the State when the police confronted people who ventured out on to the streets.

Street quarrels

It resulted in street quarrels and arguments, prompting the police to break up brawls.

At Perumbavoor in Ernakulam, the police grappled with two youths who attempted to attack officers. In several localities, the State restricted large gatherings at funerals and weddings. At Adoor, the police booked a priest for leading a giant funeral service.

So far, the police have booked 402 people on the charge of violating the social distancing norms imposed by the State to prevent the spread of the disease.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan appealed to the public again to cooperate with the authorities, shed old habits, and adjust to the new norms. The restrictions appeared harsher in Kasaragod. The district, which faced a steady rise in COVID-19 caseload, is still considered a high-risk locality. A total clampdown is on in the district since Saturday.

The police have sent reinforcements to the district to back the district administration.

There is a total ban on traffic and pedestrians, unlike other localities in the State where the lockdown appeared relatively less severe.

The government tightened up the blockade on Wednesday by closing the State’s borders to Keralites returning from other regions.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose said Keralites need to hunker down in their current locations till the COVID-19 threat receded. The State could not extend any concession that could jeopardise public health. Even persons on foot are not allowed into Kerala.

Law enforcers also frowned on inter-district travel. They allowed only two persons in private vehicles.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the State has ordered local self-government Institutions (LSGIs) to start community kitchens at the panchayat and municipality ward levels to ensure that no one suffered due to hunger or want of medicine following the economic distress caused by the lockdown in view of the COVID-19 threat.

Briefing presspersons on the day’s COVID update here on Wednesday, Mr. Vijayan said volunteers in protective gear would reach the food and medicines, if necessary, to the homes of the poor, aged, and chronically ill. The LSGIs should start helpline numbers so that citizens could request assistance at any hour.

Government agencies should give priority to the welfare of cancer patients, those requiring dialysis, and also citizens suffering from heart diseases. The CM said the State would bring homeless persons and those who sleep rough on pavements and shop verandahs under its safety net. The LSGIs should open specialised centres for transgender people who could not provide for themselves.

Essentials

The government would intervene forcefully to curb hoarding and price rise. Discussions would be held with the governments of neighbouring States to ensure uninterrupted supply of fresh vegetables from Mysuru, Bengaluru and Ootty. The government would seek the help of traders and use the network of the Civil Supplies Corporation and Consumerfed to procure and distribute foodgrains and other provisions. The 25 godowns of FCI in Kerala together had stocks for eight months.

The Kerala State Pharmaceutical Development Corporation could forego tender norms to procure the raw material required for making hand sanitisers and other common medicines from the open market. Retired doctors would be enlisted in the drive against COVID-19.

The government had prioritised the procurement of paddy. Collectors would monitor harvesting activities using machines in Palakkad, Kottayam, Thrissur and Alappuzha. They would also ensure that the harvested grain stalks reached rice mills in time for processing.

He said welfare pensions would reach 57 lakh beneficiaries on March 27. A high-level meeting convened by the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here decided to to make panchayats an essential service during the lockdown. Horticorp would also be made an essential service for the supply of vegetables and fruits. The home delivery network would be extended to service more families.

466,2020/03/25,"State still under COVID threat, says CM","He announces measures to mitigate hunger

The threat of COVID-19 outbreak hangs like the proverbial Damocles Sword over Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

“Kerala is still in the danger zone. The peril of the virus spreading rapidly in the community is very real. People should remain indoors and venture out only if there is a pressing reason. We should ensure that the sword does not fall on our head or chest because of our design,” he said.

The State government had no choice but to tighten social restrictions further, he said. The Cabinet would give more teeth to law enforcers to enforce social distancing norms imperative to control the outbreak by amending the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, through an ordinance.

The provisions of the new law would give the government power to close the State’s borders, seal places of worship, regulate gatherings, restrict socialising, ban traffic, close down educational institutions, shut hostels and hotels, and arrest those who endanger public health and exert extreme control over civic life in the event of an outbreak.

Mr Vijayan said the economic distress caused by the lockdown could foment hunger. The State had ordered Local Self Government Institutions (LSGIs) to start community kitchens at the panchayat and municipality ward levels to ensure that no one suffered due to hunger or want of medicine. He had earlier announced free rations for all ration cardholders.

Volunteers in protective gear would reach the food and also medicines, if necessary, to the homes of the poor, aged, and chronically ill.

LSGIs should open specialised centres for transgender people who could not provide for themselves.

The government would intervene forcefully to curb hoarding and price rise, the CM said. It had talked with its counterparts in neighbouring States to ensure that vegetables, fruits, eggs, milk and poultry continue to be freighted to Kerala from other regions without any hurdles at border check posts.

Mr Vijayan also ordered the closure of toddy shops. He said people need not be “distressed”. He hinted that the government might find a way to ensure the availability of liquor in the legal market in due course.

Railways have joined the efforts to ensure availability of essential commodities through freight services during the lockdown period in the State.

Though passenger services have been suspended till March 31, more than 100 wagons were placed in various Food Corporation of India godowns in the Palakkad Railway Division on Tuesday. Another 42 wagons arrived in the division, railway sources said.

As many as 474 rakes had essential commodities such as foodgrains, salt, edible oil, sugar, milk, fruits and vegetables, onion, coal, and petroleum products as on March 23. Of the 891 rakes loaded in the entire network, 121 were of iron ore, 48 of steel, 25 of cement, 28 of fertilizer, and 106 of container. Personnel deployed at good sheds, stations, and control offices are working round the clock to ensure smooth supply of essential items.

Social distancing is being advocated as the way to beat COVID-19, and shops too are coming up with ways to regulate crowds.

At Big Bazaar, home delivery is being actively encouraged, says operations manager Robin Xavier. Payment can be made on delivery.

Only the food and household goods sections are open at the store.

People are let in after a temperature check and hand sanitising.

Safety stickers to ensure distance between customers are in use at the weighing and billing counters and customer care desk. Employees are deployed to ensure that the precautions are being observed and to manage the customers. Announcements urging customers to follow the instructions are made every half an hour.

Mr. Xavier says they are taking care to ensure that not more than 15 customers are present on a floor at a time.

At a margin free market at Poojappura, only five persons are allowed in at a time. Tokens are issued to others. However, things are not going as planned, admits the owner.

The whole point of issuing tokens is to prevent crowding outside the store. However, people still stand together.

Even at the billing counter, the customers are loathe to stand at a distance from each other.

471,2020/03/25,Civic body focusses on surviving health crises,"Corpn. Budget allocates ₹25 cr. for medical support scheme

The city Corporation’s Budget for the financial year 2020-21, presented by Deputy Mayor Rakhi Ravikumar on Tuesday, reflected the unprecedented health crisis of the times, as one of the biggest of allocations went for a fund to fight such diseases. The first item in the Budget speech was a ₹25-crore allocation titled ‘Nadinte athijeevanam’, for medical support, provision of food and other items and awareness campaigns to fight diseases such as COVID-19.

The city Corporation’s ₹1,151.57 crore Budget for the financial year 2020-21 is a balancing act between social welfare, infrastructure development and service delivery. The estimated expenditure witnesses a slight reduction from the ₹1,213.22 crore estimated last year, out of which the Corporation managed to spend ₹958.67 crore, as per the revised estimates. The revised surplus in the previous year’s revised Budget is ₹222.57 crore, while this year it is estimated to be ₹ 136.55 crore.

One of the novel additions in the Budget is a fund of ₹5 crore for social infrastructure innovations, with the aim of promoting innovative solutions from start-ups for scientific processing of sewerage and solid waste. A city sanitation hub is also being planned at ₹5 crore, with aerobic bins, material recovery facilities and other waste management facilities. Decentralised septage treatment plants will be set up at ₹2 crore.

An allocation of ₹4 crore has been set aside for free Wi-Fi hubs across the city. E-Sakshya kiosks will be set up at 10 important points in the city, from where the public can take printouts of various documents.

Housing

Housing gets a hefty allocation, with ‘Snehasadanam’ project for constructing houses for those owning land has been allocated ₹30 crore. In addition, ₹10 crore has been allocated for construction of houses for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the LIFE project. An amount of ₹1 crore has been allocated to make necessary arrangements in view of the State Cabinet’s recent decision to accord permission for commercial establishments, including restaurants to function round-the-clock.

472,2020/03/25,Stocks start to dwindle in shops,"Lack of delivery persons, delays at check-posts hit arrival of goods

As stricter measures come into force in the State as part of a lockdown to limit the spread of COVID-19, people rushing to buy essentials such as grocery and vegetables have started experiencing stock shortage.

At a margin-free market at Poojappura, stocks are already dwindling. “Things were fine till Tuesday, but now rice and pulses are hard to come by. Distributors say they have only adequate stocks of urad dal (uzhunnu). We have essential items for a couple of days more, but after that it is going to be a problem,” says the shop owner.

In fact, he says, a few product brands have stopped arriving though orders were placed a week ago in some cases. On inquiry, they were told by the companies that they did not have people to deliver the products.

B. Vijaya Kumar, general secretary of the Grain Merchants’ Association, says stocks are arriving but delays are occurring both at inter-State check-posts and within the State despite the government’s assurances. He cites an instance of a truck from Kalady being held up at Karunagappally on the ground that it could not go to other districts. Only after more trucks started queueing up was the vehicle allowed to pass through.

There needs to be a mechanism to ensure that trucks are let through once officials are convinced that they posed no risk to public health. More such delays will create a scarcity, making things difficult for the people, he says.

Also, labourers from different parts of the district who work in the Chala market encountered a lot of problems from law-and-order personnel during their trips. The merchants’ association would meet to decide what was to be done in such a situation, he says.

At e-stores too

Depleting stocks are also plaguing e-stores. Shaman Hanif, business head of Kada.in, which is focussing only on supplying essential items these days, says they also do not have enough stocks. Kada.in gets its stock from wholesale vendors but they too are bogged down by the same problem. “We were delivering things till Saturday, but on Sunday, we started feeling the pinch.”

Despite the government’s assurances, the situation on the ground is not very encouraging, he says, adding that there is uncertainty about the situation in the days ahead. Mr. Hanif says they have elderly people among their clients, but find themselves unable to supply them essential commodities. Orders for next Monday had crossed 150, he says, adding that the size of orders too has multiplied.

‘Govt. intervention’

Prohibitory orders will be clamped in the district, banning gatherings and unnecessary travel, from 7 a.m. on Wednesday. The district administration decided to enforce strict measures in view of the lack of self-restraint and utter disregard shown by the public towards the need for social distancing in view of the COVID-19 outbreak on the first day of the lockdown in the State capital on Monday. The numerous instances of violations prompted the police to resort to aggressive tactics that brought visible changes later in the day.

Contrary to the government guidelines, the public came out in large numbers to the streets and thronged groceries and supermarkets. The shutters of juice shops and tea stalls that attracted gatherings also went up in various parts of the district, despite not being essential service providers.

Stringent steps

Taking a serious view of the situation, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said that the government would not hesitate to adopt stringent steps against those violating the lockdown. Soon, police personnel led by District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram city) Balram Kumar Upadhyay took to the streets and ordered the closure of commercial establishments that were not part of those exempted from the purview of lockdown. Mr. Upadhyay also exhorted the public to avoid unnecessary travel and crowding in provision stores.

Calling for greater self-restraint, Mr. Upadhyay flagged the instances of people coming out for their morning walks, compelling domestic helps to work despite the restrictions, and motorists travelling in large numbers, mostly for avoidable purposes.

As many as 160 cases were registered by the City police for various violations on the day. Two cases were reported in the Thiruvananthapuram Rural police limits.

The first day of lockdown also witnessed confusion during the early hours with the police disallowing commercial establishments to commence business at 7 a.m., despite being announced so by the Chief Minister.

Confusion

The government order issued later had stipulated the working hours as from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., causing confusion among the law enforcers. It was later clarified that the latter timing was only for Kasaragod. The Chala bazaar and other markets witnessed delay in receiving goods, owing to the stringent checks at the district borders.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) and airlines have reduced the number of personnel working in various wings of airports in the wake of the ban imposed by the Centre on domestic and international flights in the country.

As the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked the Airport Directors to make available airports for operation of special flights for medical and relief purposes, armed forces and the Coast Guard, a total shutdown is not possible.

While operating airlines have asked the personnel working in the airport offices to avail themselves of leaves and others to work from home, the AAI has reduced the number of staff in the administrative and other wings and has encouraged them to work from home.

The personnel working in the Air Traffic Control, CNS, Radar, Fire Services, Operations, ground lighting and other key wings cannot be scaled down as the airspace is open for other flight operations.

476,2020/03/25,Borges has fitness levels to maintain,"We’re all doing our best to stay indoors, says MCFC’s versatile midfielder

Rowlin Borges is a tireless box-to-box midfielder, well-known for endurance on the pitch and versatility as a defensive midfielder for Mumbai City FC.

The India international is back home in Nuvem (Goa) trying to maintain a level of fitness during self-isolation.

Following a regimen

Players usually assemble for the ISL pre-season at a fixed date after India commitments are done. Instead, with the restrictions on assembly of people, Borges, 27, is following a regimen devised by MCFC’s Head of Rehabilitation & Medical Services Dr. Sandeep Kurale.

“I'm in great physical condition. I'm trying to maintain fitness levels. We're all doing our best to stay indoors without compromising on our fitness routines,” he said.

Borges is working on strength, core enhancement for injury prevention and plyometric exercises to improve power. He was rated one of MCFC’s two fittest players (besides midfielder Bipin Singh) last season.

The India international, who was part of the first team at the AFC Cup in the UAE, made 15 league appearances for MCFC, taking charge in the midfield after play-maker Paolo Machado was injured.

The purpose of this advisory, followed by feedback via videos and periodic readings, is to give coaching and support staff fitness parameters of each player ready for screening and preparation.

New coach

MCFC will announce a new coach following Jorge Costa’s exit this season.

“When a new set of people come in, they’ll know certain things have been followed in the off-season. It will be easier for them to implement tactics,” Borges said.

“The team coach or strength/conditioning coach will ask for certain data from the previous year. They will check aerobic conditioning and compare it with parameters they have in mind. Before starting the off-season, the players do the MAS (Maximum Aerobic Speed) test, involving runs over 60m for five minutes up and down the ground continuously and distance covered is calculated.

“This is the basic aerobics data we share,” he said.

Borges and other players elsewhere relay the readings periodically.

“We send players’ videos and email about the specific data they should record and update during the off-season. From the readings, we know exactly if a player is able to reach the required fitness level in the pre-season.

“Two other aspects we focus on is injury prevention and bodyweight. Players are told what to avoid when eating home-cooked food after long stretches away from home during the league.”

Changes at the top

The Mumbai franchise underwent a change of ownership pattern, following the Abu Dhabi-based City Football Group (CFG) picking up a majority stake in the club and setting up CFG-India to oversee football operations in India.

The Abu Dhabi group owns Manchester City FC in the Premier League.

Apart from changes in team management, to be announced in the near future, a new chief coach will also be named, following the tenure of Portugal’s Jorge Costa’s ending in 2020 after two seasons.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ntgchi/article31166927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24BORGES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/borges-has-fitness-levels-to-maintain/article31166928.ece

For lunch, we serve as many as 150 plates of sambar rice and the same extent of curd rice,’ says P. Saraswathi, in-charge of the unit. Idlies are sold for ₹ 1 each and sambhar rice for ₹ 5 a plate while curd rice costs ₹ 3 per plate.

Most of the customers at this unit constitute travellers alighting from or boarding trains at the Tiruchi Junction. With the closure of eateries, more customers are expected. ‘We are prepared to serve a larger crowd. In fact, the Corporation has arranged food for all sanitary workers from our canteen from today onwards,’ she said.

Citing a large presence of customers at the Gandhi Market even after the promulgation of the prohibitory order, he told traders that retail business should be dropped and even wholesale trade must be carried out only during night.

U.S. Karuppaiah, a wholesale trader, said the idea mooted by the Collector for conduct of wholesale trade in night was acceptable. As per the agreement, wholesale trade would be carried out between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. the following day. Buyers of the vegetables and fruits would, in turn, ensure supplies to customers at the retail points.

481,2020/03/25,Normal life not affected in rural areas,"There was no sign of normal life getting affected in rural parts of Thanjavur district as farmers and cattle rearers went about their usual work amidst the nation-wide lockdown promulgated by the Central Government in view of COVID-19 virus scare.

A group of people was even engaged in the trapping ‘kendai’ fish from water pools on the Grand Anaicut Canal bed near Aalakudi and a farmer was busy preparing his field for summer crop cultivation taking the help of his friend at Kallaperambur.

At Aalakudi, Kallaperambur, Seeralur and other hamlets near Thanjavur, the impact of the curfew did reflect in empty streets and children remaining indoors.

“While adults understand well the purpose behind the curfew, children are a bit dejected over not being able to mingle with friends. People from the villages who had worked in shops and other business establishments in Thanjavur were assisting farmers in the village to whom they had leased their land holdings,” said Ramesh of Aalakudi.

Nevertheless, youngsters went about travelling between villages on motorcycles. The crisis did not deter a group of teenagers from playing volleyball near a temple at Seeralur. In the vicinity, a group of girls was found engrossed in games on mobile phones.

Karuppayi of Aalakudi, an old woman, resented the attitude of the younger generation in the crisis situation. Endorsing her view, Sekar of Kallaperambur mooted restrictions on supply of petrol to private vehicles to confine people to homes effectively so as to break the chain of spread of the viral infection.

Vehicles defy orders

Two-wheelers, cars and autorickshaws were going around here on Wednesday despite prohibitory orders. The number of vehicles was not much but the skeletal staff at petrol bunks had a tough time in ensuring compliance of safety protocols issued by the health department to contain spread of COVID-19 virus. Ensuring a safe distance amongst customers turned out to be an ordeal.

“On an average, we use to attend to 50 to 60 two-wheelers at peak hours in the morning and today two of us have handled nearly 30 to 40 motorcycles/scooters,” said an employee at a petrol filling station near the Thanjavur Railway junction.

On their part, the police intercepted motorcycles and cars at important junctions including New and Old Bus stand areas, vicinity of the Railway Junction, Marry’s Corner, Gandhi Road and the Medical College Road to determine the need for them to go out.

488,2020/03/25,Last leg of overhead electrification works suspended,"The project was under way from Mayildathurai junction to Thanjavur junction

The ongoing overhead electrification works on the main line section’s last leg from Mayildathurai junction to Thanjavur junction has been suspended in the wake of COVID-19 scare.

The electrification works, which was apace on the 70-km stretch was suspended from Saturday till March 31 keeping in mind the safety of workers and project officials at the site, said a senior official of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL).

RVNL, a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railways, is executing the overhead electrification project on the 228-km main line section from Villupuram junction to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam.

The organisation completed the overhead electrification works and energised two portion in phases — from Villupuram to Cuddalore Port junction and from Cuddalore Port junction to Mayiladuthurai junction. Electric loco-hauled passenger trains were being operated from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai and back following statutory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, post-inspection.

The final leg of the electrification project was taken up in full swing thereafter on the remaining broad gauge stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur. However, due to COVID-19 threat, the works had been completely suspended now, the official said adding that there was no supply of critical parts and components required for the overhead electrification works as the companies supplying them had also shut down.

Most of the companies supplying the OHE parts were based in north India. The RVNL had targeted to complete the electrification works up to Thanjavur by June. However, the project completion was likely to get delayed due to suspension of the remaining works as a fall out of COVID-19, the official further said. It would definitely take time to remobilise the resources and in receiving the necessary components required for the project, the official said.

Meanwhile, the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE) successfully conducted a trial run of an electric locomotive on the newly electrified stretch from Tiruvarur to Karaikal via Nagapattinam and Nagore on Tuesday.The trial run was conducted on the 53-km stretch following completion of electrification works. The trial run of the electric loco was from Tiruvarur to Karaikal and back at a speed of nearly 75 km per hour, a senior CORE official told The Hindu.

The official further said there were still some minor works that remained to be completed. However, it had been put on hold temporarily in the wake of COVID-19 scare. The trial run was imperative ahead of inviting the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Southern Circle, Bengaluru, to carry out mandatory inspection on this newly electrified stretch.

The CRS inspection on the electrified stretch from Tiruvarur to Karaikal was scheduled to be held on March 28. But it was postponed until further orders due to COVID-19. Only upon completion of inspection by the CRS and after obtaining his statutory clearance could electric loco-hauled trains be operated from and to Karaikal.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/last-leg-of-overhead-electrification-works-suspended/article31157225.ece
489,2020/03/25,MSME sector urges govt. to sanction relief package,"Association calls for postponement of GST and Provident Fund payment

Micro, small and medium enterprises have urged the State government to offer a relief package to tide over the crisis caused by COVID-19.

In view of the production and business loss, the Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries' Association has suggested postponement of GST (Goods and Services Tax) payment.

In a list of suggestions presented to the Tamil Nadu Small and Tiny Industries Association (TANSTIA), for further representation to the State Government, the Secretary of TIDITSSIA S. Gopalakrishnan said the SSI industries must be provided with subsidy for payment of salaries for workers.

There must be relaxation in the deadline for payment of provident fund and medical insurance, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said while committing the support of the TIDITSSIA for the efforts taken by the State Government to tackle the crisis caused by COVID 19.

Petition to CM

The MSME sector, which has been going through a testing time for the last two years, has already been affected in the aspects of statutory payments, non-availability of skilled labour, non-availability of raw materials and zero exports. The COVID 19 has resulted in economic shutdown, cancellation of orders, underutilisation of capcity, reduction in manpower, reduced output and revenue, the situation of non-payment of term loans and wages due to working capital constraints, and the tough situation created by GST and BS6 implementation, S. Anburajan, TANSTIA president, and M. Hindunathan, General Secretary, said in a petition they submitted to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

The TANSTIA sought from the State government deferment of power bills, property tax, professional tax, and statutory taxes by six months. The loans taken from State financial institutions must be re-scheduled for six months at an interest rate of 5% for existing and new enterprises.

Likewise, SIDCO instalments and allotment payments must be deferred by six months.

The Electricity Board's minimum demand/ average charges need to be waived off and only the actual usages must be charged. TANSTIA being the apex body of MSME associations, its representative must find a place in the proposed monitoring committee, the petition said.

A demand for increasing the capital subsidy to 50 % with the same ceiling of Rs. 50 lakh was also raised.

The TANSTIA also urged the State government to prevail upon the Centre to defer payment of ESI, provident fund, and GST and thereafter waive interest for payment of the instalments for 12 months.

Deferment of advance tax and IT return filings by six months; instruction to banking and non-banking financial institutions to hold all recovery process of principal and interest amounts; a freeze in declaration of any MSME as Non-Performing Asset and keeping Sarfaesi Act on hold till March 2021; extension of letter of credit and packing credit; honouring of pending payments immediately by public sector units irrespective of the invoice date; payment of wages to workers covered under ESI and also others by the Employees State Insurance Corporation at the time of curfew; and one year moratorium till March 31, 2021, for repayment of principal and interest amounts to banks for all term loan and other loans.

Importers facing a financial crisis due to the fall in value of rupee against the US dollar have to be suitably reimbursed, TANSTIA emphasised.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/msme-sector-urges-govt-to-sanction-relief-package/article31157216.ece
490,2020/03/25,Delta region enters lockdown as Section 144 comes into force,"Assembly of more than five persons in public places prohibited; Gandhi Market in Tiruchi to function as usual; travel to be permitted only in emergency situations

Promulgating Section 144 under the Cr.PC in Tiruchi district, Collector S. Sivarasu on Tuesday said residents would not be allowed to venture out of their homes except for buying essential commodities or in emergency situations.

Speaking to reporters, he said the prohibitory order had been promulgated under extraordinary circumstances arising out of fast spreading COVID-19 pandemic. Assembly of more than five persons was not permitted in public places. Police had powers to take action against violators.

Mr. Sivarasu said there was no need for panic buying as Gandhi Market would function as usual. There was no bar on lorries and trucks transporting vegetables, fruits and vegetables to the market. Grocery stores, oil and other merchants could transact business as usual. However, they should not give room for over-crowding.

He said hospitals, dispensaries, clinics, chemist shops, optical stores, oxygen cylinder units, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment service units, health related manufacturing units, including masks and sanitation products manufacturing units, would function as usual..

Food articles such as rice, pulses, edible oil, spices and condiments, processed food, milk, bread, fruit, meat, eggs, fish and other essential and perishable products could be transported. Similarly, there were no issues in selling and transportation of dairy and items required for poultry such as feed and fodder.

Mr. Sivarasu said that each and every individual had a responsibility to join hands with stakeholders to contain the spread of the virus. They should cooperate with the government.

Under no circumstances, they should indulge in partying and get-together. Social distancing and hand hygiene were key elements in containing the virus from community spreading, he emphasised.

Thanjavur

Thanjavur town on Tuesday eased into the curfew slowly with roads witnessing substantial movement of vehicles and people even after 6 p.m., when the State government enforced curfew across Tamil Nadu.

Though police teams were seen moving around the town from 5.30 p.m., announcing that the prohibitory orders would come into effect at the stroke of 6 p.m., several commercial establishments, particularly snacks, flower-vending and juice shops, tried to extend their business hours by a few minutes. However, they received a stern warning from the patrolling teams.

Public transport, including autorickshaws, went off the road by 7 p.m. When intercepted by the police, some of the autorickshaw drivers could be seen pleading that they were headed for their shed or house and that the passengers would be dropped enroute.

Once the curfew period began, most of the eateries started shutting down service and encouraged customers to accept food parcels as directed by the State government. But the tea shops had wind up business as they could not offer tea in parcel since the use of plastic covers had been banned.

“I must think twice before lifting the shutters of my shop tomorrow since it will be hard to comply with the crowd restriction rule in this business,” said Ramu, who runs a tea-cum-snacks shop at Mangalapuram on Medical College Road.

On the other hand, Mallika, who runs a kiosk near Municipal Colony on the same road, said she was hopeful that she could carry on with her business since the flow of customers to her shop always remained normal in view of the nature of goods available for sale at her outlet.

Meanwhile, Collector M. Govinda Rao in his capacity as District Magistrate promulgated an order under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code on Tuesday evening prohibiting congregation in public places in the interest of public health and quarantining all suspected cases of COVID-19 and foreign returnees for such a period and in such a manner as decided by local health officials.

491,2020/03/25,Elevated corridor proposed for Tiruchi,"It is one of the development plans outlined in Highways department grants tabled in Assembly

The State Highways Department will soon prepare a feasibility report and a detailed project report for construction of an elevated corridor from Anna Statue near Chinthamani to the railway junction in the city, reviving a proposal mooted some years ago.

The major project is one of the development plans for the city outlined in the department grants tabled in the Assembly by the Chief Minister, according to Collector S. Sivarasu.

The two reports will be called for the elevated corridor, by-pass roads for Manachanallur (phase II) and Manapparai and construction of a new bridge across the Kudamuritti on Tiruchi-Karur Road, Mr. Sivarasu said in a statement citing the Assembly proceedings.

The proposal is essentially revival of an idea mooted some years ago. Although the distance between the two points is hardly six km, it takes about 45 minutes for a commute by public transport on the stretch, essentially due to the narrow roads and heavy traffic congestion.

The Chathram Bus Stand, Mainguard Gate Junction, Gandhi Market and Warehouse Road are among the major traffic bottlenecks on the route. The Corporation toyed with the idea of building an elevated corridor between Chathram Bus Stand and West Boulevard Road some years ago, but did not pursue the project seriously.

Subsequently, the Highways Department mooted the idea and submitted a report to the government on building an elevated corridor between Chinthamani and the railway junction a few years ago after former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was elected from Srirangam constituency. The proposal remained in cold storage and seems to have been revived now.

Though the government’s move has warmed the cockles of many a city resident’s heart, a section of them, however, entertain doubts over the feasibility of the project, especially in the light of the enormous delays that many of the infrastructure development plans in the city has suffered due to land and other issues in recent years.

Rejecting it an as “outright eye wash” and impractical project, N. Ramakrishnan, a civic activist, points out that the proposed corridor will have to run along narrow and congested roads where heavy development has taken place.

There are scores of buildings, he says and wonders whether they can be demolished.

“The authorities should focus on feasible and workable projects, without affecting anyone. Instead, officials should try and widen the road, wherever possible, especially between Anna Statue and Chathram Bus Stand,” Mr. Ramakrishnan says.

He also called for a consultative meeting with stakeholders and residents before finalising such proposals.

While welcoming the effort aimed at developing the city infrastructure, C.Balasubramanian, Advisor, District Exnora and a former member of the District Road Safety Council, observes that it will be good if such a project materialised. But he too wonders whether it will be feasible to build an elevated corridor through narrow roads in the city.

Echoing similar sentiments, K. C. Neeelamegam, State Advisor, Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam, feels that even if the project is deemed feasible, it may take years for completion.

Citing the incomplete multi-level bridge near the railway junction and delay in completing many other projects in recent years in the city, including construction of Palakkarai Road Overbridge, Mr. Neelamegam says a project as big as an elevated corridor should not meet the same fate.

However, Highways department sources say a feasibility study will first be conducted before the detailed project report is prepared. Such a major project will entail an investment of about ₹1,000 crore and all aspects will be considered.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/o9dl0i/article31157188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY25-CHATHRAMBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/elevated-corridor-proposed-for-tiruchi/article31157189.ece

The authorities say spraying of disinfectants is being done in the morning and evening in major areas within the jail premises. New prisoners are being put in a separate block fora few days to ensure that they have no fever or other symptoms prior to lodging them with other inmates in the blocks.

The authorities add that the Prison Bazaar functioning at the entrance of the Central Prison adjoining Tiruchi-Pudukottai National Highway has been shut in the wake of COVID-19 scare since there is movement of public to buy eatables from the bazaar run by a group of convicts.

All other prison industrial activity inside the jail are going on. Around 120 inmates have been released on bail and on own bonds on Tuesday. This is to reduce the inmate strength. They were involved in petty and other cases.

Hours before curfew, a large number of people thronged the city markets to purchase vegetables and other essential commodities. Gandhi Market and other commercial hubs in the city witnessed milling crowds. Grocery stores also saw last-minute rush as people stocked up essential commodities.

At the Central Bus Stand, there was heavy rush in buses heading to neighbouring towns and villages. Some persons even travelled atop the roofs of the buses.

495,2020/03/25,Lockdown: Chittoor police turn Samaritans,"Food packets distributed to destitutes and elderly

Though there was hardly any sign of celebration of Ugadi in Chittoor town on Wednesday under the shadow of COVID-19 lockdown, the Chittoor police swung into action to celebrate the auspicious occasion in a unique way – caring the hungry and have-not's caught in lockdown effect at public places.

After the announcement of 21-day nation-wide lockdown, Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar hit upon a humanitarian idea to help the destitute and elderly moving in public places to overcome the pangs of hunger on the Ugadi festival. It was immediately put into action.

The voluntary organisations, operating old age homes and doing charity works, were contacted, seeking their cooperation for the noble cause. In Chittoor, the Amma Vodi ashram and some youth of Lalu Gardens locality could prepare food packets of sambar rice, pulihora, and curd rice for distribution to about 500 persons. As Ugadi special, vada and sweet were added to the food.

Deputy SP (Chittoor) K. Eeshwar Reddy and Chittoor II-Town Circle Inspector P. Yugandar launched the distribution at noon at the new APSRTC bus station, private bus station, surroundings of railway station and at corners of some of the arterial junctions in Chittoor.

The police personnel and volunteers could spot the sick and destitute persons and elderly under helpless conditions and distributed food packets and water sachets to them. The beneficiaries, several of whom have been hungry since a couple of days, were overwhelmed at the gesture.

At Puttur, Deputy SP D. Muralidhar and his team prepared food packets for about 300 persons and distributed them to the destitute and elderly at public places.

Apart from Puttur, the gesture covered the target group in Nagari, Karveti Nagaram, Nindra, and Satyavedu circles. Similar activity from the police in cooperation with the public groups was conducted at Palamaner and Madanapalle sub-divisions.

Activity to continue

Meanwhile, the SP sought the police at their respective divisions to consider making arrangements to provide safe shelter to the destitute and elderly stranded at public places in view of the lockdown. The SP said that the police would continue distribution of food packets to the needy till the corona threat subsides.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/bq1mhy/article31167626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-VJ-CHITTOORPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/lockdown-chittoor-police-turn-samaritans/article31167627.ece

498,2020/03/25,Foreign returnees should continue home quarantine till April 14: Collector,"‘Passports of those violating the order will be seized’

East Godavari District Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy on Wednesday directed the foreign returnees to continue their home quarantine till April 14.

In a joint meeting with the district officials and police led by East Godavari SP Adnan Nayeem Asmi here, Mr. Muralidhar Reddy has warned that the passports of those who failed to do so would be seized.

499,2020/03/25,Decentralising and shifting Rythu Bazars to large open spaces is working in Vijayawada,"The idea of the Agriculture Marketing Wing is yielding results as panic buying is subsiding

“Move apart to collectively fight the coronavirus” is the unanimous call given from every possible platform by the forces dealing with the dreaded virus.

Rythu bazars in the city that had witnessed unprecedented crowds due to panic-buying in the aftermath of the lockdown have embraced innovation to counter the situation effectively.

Smaller and spread out

Space and de-centralisation of the vegetable markets is what officials of the Agriculture Marketing Wing are looking at. To de-congest these markets, the locations have been shifted to nearby open grounds or more spacious arenas. For instance, the Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazar has been moved to the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium, the one at High School Road in Patamata to the open grounds of the Zilla Parishad High School on the same road, the Bhavanipuram one to the Punnami Ghat on the banks of River Krishna. Two relatively smaller markets at Ajit Singh Nagar and at Payakapuram have been merged for now and put up at the sprawling Makineni Basava Punnaiah Mini Stadium at Ajit Singh Nagar.

“We are planning more such de-centralisations to reduce the size of the crowds. In the next few days, 10-15 more such markets will come up. The idea is to multiply these vegetable markets taking them closer to the buyers and ensure that the crowd is spread evenly,” said M. Diwakar Rao, Deputy Director, Agriculture Marketing Wing.

‘Inside the box’ idea

The space enables the department to keep buyers at distance. Boxes have been drawn on the floor and each buyer is expected to confine to the space while moving forward in a queue towards the vegetable stalls amidst continuous announcement through public address system on the need to maintain discipline. Also, to either cover their faces with a mask or use a handkerchief in view of the highly contagious virus.

Sources said in view of the public demand, the department is actively considering increasing the time limit from the existing 6 a.m. to 9 a.m by an hour or two. “In the first two days, there was panic-buying as most people believed that vegetables would go out of reach in view of the lockdown. But now they seem to understand that the entire process is only being regulated,” said Mr. Rao.

Hurdles, but crossing them

The department is also trying to address hurdles like disturbances in the smooth transfer of the vegetables from farmers to hamalis who bring the loads to the market. “Responding to complaints from the local hamalis that their vehicles are being stopped due to the lockdown, we took up the matter with the police department and have been assured that it will be a hassle-free exercise,” said Mr. Rao, Moroever, barring a small drop, 80 per cent of the farmers are selling their produce at these rythu bazars.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/mb8eq3/article31169124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26VJRYTHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/decentralising-and-shifting-rythu-bazars/article31162513.ece

501,2020/03/25,Safety of staff on emergency duty is a challenge: E.A.S. Sarma,"He writes letter to Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney

With the entire country in a lockdown mode for three weeks with a likelihood of it being stretched further, a number of steps needed to be taken to effectively handle the COVID-19 situation. Protecting municipal, health and police personnel engaged in emergency work and providing essential supplies to people are challenging tasks ahead, former Union Energy Secretary E.A.S. Sarma has said.

He underlined the importance of putting in place a response system to minimise the exposure of those in charge of implementing the lockdown.

In a letter to Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, he has suggested that industries should be roped in to contribute as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) for manufacturing masks, gloves, test kits and personal protection equipment. The service of jail inmates may also be utilised, he said.

Expressing apprehensions over the shortage of ventilators that might arise in the worst scenario in the weeks ahead, Mr. Sarma suggested that Andhra Pradesh could ask the industrial units to manufacture the equipment.

Supply of commodities

With a huge demand for essential commodities, Mr. Sarma said the government should give a serious thought to tying up with hyper markets and retail chain stores to operate mobile outlets. “It will reduce pressure on daily markets. Organising home delivery by roping in big departmental stores is another alternative that can be explored,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/safety-of-staff-on-emergency-duty-is-a-challenge-eas-sarma/article31168013.ece

504,2020/03/25,COVID-19 threat mars Ugadi celebrations in Vizag,"People stay indoors on Telugu New Year

The complete lockdown in view of the coronavirus threat took the sheen of Ugadi celebrations in the city on Wednesday.

As all temples remained closed, vehicle buyers performed pujas on their own, in the absence of priests. Though all vehicle shops have downed their shutters now, people who bought vehicles before the lockdown hoped to perform puja on the auspicious day for Ugadi is the first festival in the Telugu almanac.

Vehicle owners and their family members were seen parking their new bikes and cars on the roads near Sri Sampath Vinayaka temple at Asilametta and perform puja as the otherwise busy stretches had no vehicular traffic in view of the lockdown.

Meanwhile, the Telugu New Year celebrations turned out to be low-key affair at households, despite all family members being home. Scarcity of neem flowers, the main ingredient for ‘Ugadi Pachadi’, at rythu bazaars and the high prices dampened the festival spirit.

‘Panchanga Sravanam’

There was no mass gathering for ‘Panchanga Sravanam’ (reading of almanac). However, scholars read out what is in store for different persons, based on their birth stars, for the entire year. The Ugadi greetings were remained confined to social media platforms as people wished their near and dear ones on WhatsApp.

The restrictions on the movement of vehicles and social distancing norms also robbed the festival of its charm as a majority of the people seemed to have understood the gravity of the COVID-19 threat.

506,2020/03/25,Sanitation staff scared of working at COVID-19 quarantine facilities,"Minister asks officials concerned to initiate immediate measures

Even as three positive coronavirus cases have been reported from the city and the number of people under quarantine are increasing gradually, the quarantine facilities set up for the suspects are allegedly facing issues related to food and sanitation.

A few pictures of food parcels being given to the people placed under quarantine at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) surfaced on social media platforms a couple of days ago and the district administration faced criticism for providing food in polythene packets.

On March 23, when Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao visited the quarantine facility at VIMS, a few persons pointed out poor sanitation, especially when it came to maintenance of toilets.

It is learnt that the quarantine facility at the Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD) has similar issues which were discussed during a review meet conducted by Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas on March 24.

The Minister took a serious note of this and instructed the authorities concerned to initiate immediate measures.

Staff crunch

In response to the issues related to poor sanitation, Joint Collector M. Venugopal Reddy said that many sanitation staff were frightened to attend duties at the quarantine facility at VIMS and at the isolation ward at GHCCD due to coronavirus scare. “We will allay their fears by providing safety gears and explaining them about the situation,” the Joint Collector has assured to the Minister.

According to Mr. Srinivasa Rao, sanitation workers of the GVMC are scared because they are short of masks, hand sanitisers and safety gears. “Several unions of the sanitary workers have complained that the civic officials are not bothered though they work round the clock. The GVMC needs to provide basic facilities to the workers,” the Minister said.

Collector responds

GVMC Commissioner (in-charge) P. Koteswara Rao assured to sort out the issue immediately. “Many sanitation workers are not able to attend duties due to transportation issues. We will sort out the issue by make proper arrangements,” he said.

Responding to the allegations pertaining to poor quality food, Collector V. Vinay Chand said that the packing was bad. “The food quality is really good. It was just about the poor packing.

507,2020/03/25,Social distancing made a norm at rythu bazaars,"Half of the counters have been shifted to nearby grounds

Officials from the Marketing Department have succeeded in controlling the rush at rythu bazaars in Visakhapatnam by shifting half of the counters at the markets to nearby grounds, thus achieving the much-needed social distancing in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

A posse of police personnel was deployed at all rythu bazaars before they opened on Wednesday morning. Standing at the entrance, police teams appealed on loudspeakers for calm and asked the public to go to other rythu bazaars if there is crowding at one particular market.

Police asked the public to come wearing masks, and in the absence of a mask, cover one’s mouth and nose with a handkerchief before entering the rythu bazaaar. Police also informed the public about precautions to be taken to tackle COVID-19 and also spoke about the lockdown orders. Customers were asked to stand in queue at a distance of one metre from each other.

“When we came to the rythu bazaar yesterday, we were worried at the mad rush and returned home. Such arrangements should be appreciated,” said S Ankitha, an engineering student who came to buy vegetables at A.S Raja grounds, where some counters of MVP Rythu Bazaar were shifted.

The Marketing Department, civic staff and police have begun marking all permanent and temporary rythu bazaars, where people are supposed to stand. Markings at all rythu bazaars will be finished by Wednesday evening or Thursday morning.

DCP (Law & Order-I) S. Ranga Reddy, who inspected the markings at A.S Raja Grounds and M.V.P Colony, said that they are ensuring that visitors stand at a fair distance from each other.

Buses for farmers

A number of farmers working at the rythu bazaars complained to Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao at the Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar that they are facing trouble in reaching the rythu bazaars from interior villages and suburban areas of the district due to the prevailing lockdown. The Minister was inspecting the rythu bazaar along with Joint Collector L. Siva Shankar on Wednesday.

Mr Srinivasa Rao in turn instructed the Joint Collector to take steps to run special APSRTC buses from Devarapalle, Anandapuram and Sabbavaram as a majority of the farmers from those areas come to the local rythu bazaars with vegetable loads. He also said that if the farmers have auto-rickshaws, the administration should give them vehicle passes to ensure that supply of essential commodities is unaffected.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/xw2xc9/article31167596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26VZ3RYTHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/social-distancing-made-a-norm-at-rythu-bazaars/article31167597.ece

He is neither insouciant, nor ignorant. But braving the coronavirus spread alert, a 35-year-old dairy farmer, Jiddu Krishna, chose not to stop supplying milk to nearly 35 households to feed the children within five kilometres area from his village in East Godavari district.

A native of Repooru village near Kakinada city, he rears 10 buffaloes apart from procuring milk from the other dairy farmers in his village to supply to over 50 regular customers on a two-wheeler.

Only for children

The young farmer has determined to continue the milk supply to his customers with children. He, however, has stopped supply to over a dozen regular customers who do not have the need to feed children, in and around Kakinada city. At the same time, he did not hike the price of his farm produce to exploit the demand.

“I have made up my mind not to stop the milk supply to households with children during the lockdown period. However, I made it mandatory that I will stop supply to those who do not buy it for children,” said Mr. Krishna, himself a father of two children.

Caring for others, and self

“Many families made a request that they could not afford to change from the milk that I supply to various packaged milk brands suddenly. Such a genuine request made me continue the milk supply. On the other hand, I could do nothing with the milk if it is unsold ”, added Mr. Krishna. He is also not accepting new orders.

On the precautions he is taking in these scary times, Mr. Krishna averred: “ I do not touch any utensil or bottle brought by my customers to collect milk.

The traditional fervour and gaiety associated with ‘Kotha Amavasya’ festival, which falls a day prior to Ugadi, was missing with most of the temples remaining closed and imposition of curbs on mass gatherings, to check the spread of COVID-19, in the city on Tuesday.

A small group of women devotees were seen performing pujas to the sacred tree outside the temple of Goddess Nookalamma at Dondaparthy. Most of the temples remained closed from Sunday in view of the nationwide ‘Janata Curfew’, followed by the lockdown announced in the State till March 31.

Though raw mangoes arrive in the market, weeks before the Telugu New Year Day (Ugadi), most Telugu families abstain from eating the raw fruit till Ugadi. They start consuming it with ‘Ugadi Pachadi’ on the Telugu New Year Day.

The availability of ‘neem flowers’, which is one of the ingredients, which go into the preparation of Ugadi Pachadi, and mango leaves, used to decorate the entrance of homes, was comparatively very less at the Rythu Bazaars this year.

Meanwhile, a noticeable change is evident among the public on the second day of the lockdown on Tuesday. A vast majority of them have started using masks or some cloth to cover their face, when they come out of their homes. They are also implementing the social distancing norms at banks and other public places, to the extent possible.

Most of the thoroughfares and even streets in residential colonies wore a deserted look as people largely remained confined to their homes.

Appeals were made on public address systems from temples and mosques asking the people of surrounding areas not to come out of their homes, to check the spread of the virus that was threatening to wipe out mankind.

Messages in Hindi and Telugu, were heard on the mike from a mosque at Hussain Nagar beside the National Highway at Marripalem to participate in the lockdown voluntarily.

Banks, LIC and financial institutions are advising their customers to use mobile and Internet banking to avoid the prospect of visiting the branch to limit the possible spread of coronavirus. Banks functioned with skeletal staff members and rendered only essential services like cash withdrawals and receipts.

The employees of the Marripalem branch of Visakhapatnam Cooperative Bank wore masks and gloves as they permitted customers to withdraw and deposit cash.

To make sure that people are able to buy the essential commodities such as milk, eggs, groceries, vegetables and medicines, we will relax the clampdown from 6 a.m, to 10 a.m., he added.

“During this four hour period, people can move out and buy whatever is required, but the movement is restricted within two kilometre radius from residence,” said Mr. Vinay Chand.

According to him, there is no shortage of essential commodities and trucks carrying essential commodities are being allowed to ply without any hindrances. “The checkposts have been instructed to allow both inter-district and inter-State trucks carrying any essential commodities. We are making arrangements to see that the supply is non-stop and logistic chain is not affected,” he said. A senior officer from the Civil Supplies Department, adequate stock of rice, sugar, pulses and other essentials have been kept ready to meet any eventualities. The GO passed on Tuesday night does not impose restriction on trucks carrying essential commodities, but imposes restriction on all public transport, keeping the basic social distancing protocol in mind.

Autorickshaws and four-wheelers have been restricted to carry only two persons, apart from the driver. Two-wheelers cannot carry a pillion rider, said Mr. Vinay Chand. Earlier, S.V. Ramana, Managing Director of Visakha Dairy, assured that there will be no shortage of milk or milk products, despite the lockdown. Visakha Dairy assured the public that they were making all efforts and working 24X7 and their farmers and employees were committed to ensure that there would not be any disruption in supply of milk or milk products.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/9w9wt9/article31169276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07vzsbe01localG3477D3CJ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/officials-face-challenges-in-ensuring-supply-of-essentials/article31157467.ece
512,2020/03/25,Rythu bazaars to be shifted to nearby spacious grounds,"In the wake of COVID-19 scare and to control the rush at the local rythu bazaars which could possibly spread flu from one person to another, the district administration has decided to shift the rythu bazaars to nearby spacious playgrounds. The officials are also mulling to put markings at the vegetable stalls to make sure public follow the social distancing protocol. The decisions were taken during the District Level Committees Meet over the COVID-19 situation, which was held here on Tuesday.

Ever since, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had announced complete lockdown in the State, rythu bazaars are seen packed with public rushing out to buy essential commodities. Without taking the concept of social distancing seriously, people were seen jostling at the vegetable counters. The officials observed that lack of adequate space in the bazaars is the reason behind the situation.

Taking a serious note on the issue, the Marketing Department and the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) have decided to run rythu bazaars from nearby grounds and at large vacant spaces, playgrounds.

One of a official from Marketing Department said “In case of Seethammadhara rythu bazaar, the stalls/counters could be shifted to nearby private school ground opposite to it. In case of MVP rythu bazaar, it could run at the nearby A.S Raja Grounds,”

Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao suggested to the GVMC Commissioner (In-charge) P. Koteswara Rao to look for shifting the rythu bazaar stalls to nearby municipal school grounds. He also suggested the Marketing Department officials to also consider reducing the number of counters.

“It is not necessary to shift complete rythu bazaars. Some stalls could be shifted to nearby grounds. If we do that, public will be divided. By having rythu bazaars at spacious grounds, we can make sure that public can maintain distance among themselves,” he said. The district administration is working on to complete the shifting procedure within 24 to 48 hours.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/6sbkse/article31157405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-VZ-RYTHUBAZAAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/rythu-bazaars-to-be-shifted-to-nearby-spacious-grounds/article31157407.ece

514,2020/03/25,Officials identifying high-risk areas in district: Health Minister,"‘More number of foreign returnees are in Seethammadhara, Gajuwaka, Anakapalle’

To mitigate the COVID-19 scare, the officials are identifying high risk areas across the district to take additional precautions to make sure all the people who were asked to be under home quarantine in those localities are following the norms.

According to Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, Seethammadhara has been identified as high risk area with as many as 649 foreign returnees followed by Gajuwaka and then Anakapalle.

“High risk areas does not mean that those living in that area is risky, but the officials need to have strict vigil over the people who are placed under home quarantine in the areas. Meanwhile, the Police Department should also ensure proper enforcement in those areas during this lockdown period,” the Minister said during the review meet on Tuesday.

Responding to the Minister, District Collector V. Vinay Chand also said that they are identifying all areas where about 100 or more number of foreign returnees are under home quarantine and make sure the areas are under proper vigil. The district administration will implement lockdown more strictly, he assured.

Panic complaints

According to the officials, the control rooms set up for COVID-19 in the district are receiving hundreds of calls on a daily basis from public across various areas. Most of the phone calls are believed to be from panicked public complaining about foreign returnees in their localities and asking the officials to shift them to hospital.

“The control room has received nearly 580 phone calls in the last couple of days, in which most of the calls are from public who have panicked over the presence of foreign returnee in their area. They ask us to shift the foreign returnees in their locality to quarantine or isolation, fearing that virus will be spread in the locality,” said District Collector V. Vinay Chand.

The Collector said that public should understand that if a person returns from abroad, it does not mean that he/she is infected with virus.

He explained that any foreign returnee is being asked to isolate himself in the house initially.

They would be shifted to isolation wards, only if develops symptoms as per procedure.

The district administration is making sure all the foreign returnees are following the norm, he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/hj11f1/article31157288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-VZ-HEALTHMINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/officials-identifying-high-risk-areas-in-district-health-minister/article31157289.ece
515,2020/03/25,Police crack the whip as people violate lockdown orders,"38 cases booked against violators, says DCP

Cracking the whip on people who were found violating the lockdown orders, the enforcement agencies have booked cases on people who were found moving on roads without any reasons. While a few police made youth to do sit-ups, some administered pledge to violators that they would not repeat such mistakes and stay at home.

Despite lockdown orders, a large number of public came on to roads on Tuesday morning. Teams of police had arranged barricades at many areas and asked the violators to return. A few citizens were found entering into heated argument with the police at a few places. However by the afternoon, the enforcement was doubled and police also acted strict against the violators by booking cases. On Tuesday, a video surfaced in social media that police made two youth do sit-ups near NTR statue, Beach Road. The video has been widely shared on WhatsApp. A few motorists and auto-rickshaw drivers were also beaten by the police at several areas. Crime Wing police from Dwaraka police station, who had arranged checkpost at Seethammadhara, administered pledge to some motorists. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law & Order-I) S. Ranga Reddy said that the city police had booked 38 cases against persons who were found moving on roads without any necessity. The violators include two wheelers, four-wheelers and even auto-rickshaw drivers.

516,2020/03/25,Data | How prepared are India's States in health infrastructure to tackle COVID-19,"Andhra Pradesh had the lowest hospital-population ratio while Bihar had the lowest bed-population ratio

With just one sample testing centre for 12 crore people, the lowest doctor-patient ratio and the least number of hospital beds per patient among States, Bihar is poorly equipped to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. Many other big States also have low beds-patient and hospital-patient ratios.

State of testing centres

The chart plots the number of COVID-19 sample testing centres against the average number of people served by one testing centre across States. While Maharashtra has the highest number of testing centres and relatively better coverage, the State is still under-equipped to detect cases as one testing centre is available for 1.02 crore people.

517,2020/03/25,Our Coronavirus lockdown reading list for you,"There have been plenty of viruses in the literary world. This time, we look at the ‘Contagion’ equivalent for books: about pandemics, real and imaginary

Many people are talking about Dean Koontz’s The Eyes of Darkness (first published in 1981) as having predicted the coronavirus pandemic. The book talks about a fictional virus called Wuhan-400, developed as a biological weapon. However, in the initial editions, the virus was called Gorki-400 after a city in Russia, where it is supposed to have originated. It was changed to a Chinese city sometime in 1990s.

Even Asterix fought a Coronavirus in 2017 (Asterix and the Chariot Race). But there’ve been plenty of viruses, bacteria and more in the literary world. For those who would like to read about pandemics — real or imaginary — here’s a list.

‘A Journal of the Plague Year’ by Daniel Defoe (1722)

In 1665, London was ravaged by the Great Plague (bubonic plague) and Defoe’s novel takes the form of an eyewitness account. Praised as an accurate and technically correct account of that horrifying time, historians believe the book was based on the diaries of Defoe’s uncle since the author himself was just five years old in 1665.

‘The Plague’ by Albert Camus (1947)

The book is about a plague-stricken city in Algeria (the city of Oran actually suffered an epidemic of cholera in 1849) but is open to multiple readings: Third Reich, hyper-capitalism, mankind’s greed and tendency to overreach itself. No matter what you think, it remains relevant 73 years after its publication.

‘The Andromeda Strain’ by Michael Crichton (1969)

A military satellite returns to Earth carrying an extra-terrestrial organism that manages to wipe out an entire town in Arizona by clotting people’s blood, before scientists get involved in the fight to stop the organism from mutating and spreading. Definitely a page-turner.

‘The Stand’ by Stephen King (1978)

And in this one, a pandemic of modified influenza finishes off pretty much the entire world. The survivors band together in different groups that then have to confront each other to continue to exist. A Complete Uncut edition was published in 1990.

518,2020/03/25,Ways to avoid binge eating during lockdown,"How are you doing, snack wise? Don’t reach out for that bag of chips.

Ahead of the Janata Curfew and the lockdown, many went into overdrive, panic buying and piling shopping carts high with large bars of chocolates, colas, and chips. It’s anyone’s guess if a cartload of snacks can be spaced out and consumed in moderation.

Working from home has become the new normal until the COVID-19 outbreak is curbed, and there’s always the danger of indulging in unhealthy snacks. How does one tread cautiously?

Maintain a routine. If you’re an early riser who normally clocks in a 45- to 60-minute workout, keep at it. Clock in to work at the same you would usually, and do the same clocking out. While this may seem like it has nothing to do with eating wisely, it does, because you’re setting your body and mind up for a day as you would have done it in pre-Corona times. You’re less likely to look at the day as a time to indulge. Hyderabad-based nutritionist Deepa Agarwal says we must be aware of when we’re eating because we’re hungry and when we’re ‘comfort eating’ in times of stress.

Steer clear of: Aerated drinks, chocolates and candies, chips and other junk food

Say yes to: Fresh home cooked food using non-perishables such as rice, dal, pulses, millets and available vegetables. Include peanuts, roasted chickpeas, a variety of roasted seeds, and fruits, as snacks if possible.

Stick to your daily fitness routine, at home.

Plan menus. Check your fridge the previous evening, and look at meals as prep time and cook time, since many of us don’t have live-in help. You can split this into a morning-evening routine. Think of nutritious breakfasts, lunches and dinners, and mid meal snacks that you won’t regret later. Limit caffeine intake and include roasted chickpeas and a variety of nuts as snacks. To break the monotony, Sridevi Jasti (@vibrantlivingbysridevijasti on Instagram), a nutritionist, suggests occasionally swapping regular breakfast with fruits or dinner with a salad steeped with roasted nuts and seeds that are a good source of calcium, protein and zinc: “Pumpkin seeds are rich sources of zinc, which is an essential mineral to build immunity.” If you can, opt for local and seasonal produce.”

Start the day well. Deepa suggests beginning the day with green tea or lemon honey water, and keeping to healthy breakfasts such as poha, upma, idlis with sambar or dosas with sambar, or oatmeal. “Have buttermilk or nimbu (lemon) juice mid-morning. Rice or roti with dal, subzi and curd for lunch. In the evening have green tea with some sprouts or roasted murmura. Dinner could be soups or fruits (if available) or repeat one of the breakfast options with reduced portions,” she adds.

Maintain a food diary. This will ensure you don’t eat out of boredom or loneliness. Video calls with team members, for those working from home, might be morale boosters too. On social media, look out for Rujuta Diwekar’s 14-day meal plan called The Quarantine Plan, primarily using non perishables.

Skip the sugar. Sridevi asserts that this is the time — more than ever — to focus on building immunity, gut health and steer clear of sugar-laden eats or fried food. “About 70% of our immunity comes from maintaining good gut health. When we overload our body with the wrong choice of food (such as overly processed food), the gut bacteria get compromised. As it is we are stressed about the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis and many of us are forced to work from home, so we need to help our body deal with the changes and not shock it further,” she says. Need a sweet booster? You could do almond or peanut butter on apple slices and top them with raisins. But she also suggests experimenting — by adding nuts to traditional coconut chutney and topping it with green chillies. Or, a plate of sliced cucumbers with black salt and cumin powder.

Know we are all in this together. So if you slip up one day, don’t beat yourself up. Try and tie up with a friend so you check in on each other over the phone, if you’re home alone. “We are all in this together,” says Deepa.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pzbtnf/article31162662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM25PEANUTCHIKKI,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/snack-smart-and-maintain-a-food-diary-to-avoid-binge-eating-during-lockdown/article31162668.ece
519,2020/03/25,"Amid the lockdown, Chennai quizzers take to WhatsApp to host games","H-129 is taking its signature hybrid of pub quiz and game show to WhatsApp, with questions revolving around what you come across when reading the news, or blogs, or scrolling social media

Is it a pub quiz? Is it a boardgame? It’s a little bit of both, actually, and since Chennai’s quizzers and boardgame enthusiasts won’t be holding gatherings anytime soon, they are now holding sessions on WhatsApp.

Considering its origins as a discussion group for serious issues, H-129 has had a couple of interesting changes in direction. Now, they are not only an increasingly popular name in the city’s pub quiz circuit, but are also entertaining over a hundred people on WhatsApp. To hear co-founder Aditya Dhathathreyan explain it, the core concept is pretty interesting: “We built a digital gameboard on a computer, and usually project on a screen at our events, so the eight or 10 participating teams can see how they are progressing. If you answer a question correctly, you get certain resources or points that help you build your strategy and progress in the game.”

The questions aren’t cut-and-dry either. “It’s not about trivia, but about what you come across when reading the news, or blogs, or scrolling social media, that you don’t directly associate with trivia facts. For example, when Apple came out with air pods, what came out on Twitter and in the news drew analogies between the air pods and a bunch of disconnected things... some noticed how they were shaped like hair dryers, others saw how they resembled certain kinds of Pokemon. Our questions revolve around these comparisons, so they are workable questions, as opposed to a proper quiz where you have to know the one correct answer.”

An H-129 event in Chennai in the days before social distancing

Since that elaborate setup was not possible for their edition this month, when all gatherings came to a precautionary halt, they moved the entire format to WhatsApp, with a couple of changes. “We have a common group of over 100 interested participants [named Quarantine Chaos]. From there, those who participated on March 22 got divided into teams of six (you could choose your team or be assigned random people) who made smaller WhatsApp groups of their own. The questions, final replies and scores were in the main group, while all internal discussions happened in the smaller one,” explains Aditya. He calls it a dry run, a version that just had questions, not the game.

They could not set up the complete, digital boardgame version online at short notice, but plan to do it from the next edition. “There are two ways: either we take screenshots of how the game is progressing and share it on WhatsApp, or interface between Google Hangouts and WhatsApp. So we link the two platforms, put up the questions on the main WhatsApp group, let the discussion happen in the subgroups, put up the scores on the main group and update the board on Hangouts,” he says, adding, “We will be holding weekly or bi-weekly events from now on.”

The founders of H-129, Chennai

Aravindan Sudarsan is now part of the team to help out with this aspect, while avid quizzers Krishnan Ayalur Seshadrinathan and Prasanna Sugumaran continue to be the quizmasters, like they have been since 2017 when H-129 was still called Kootam, and was held in flats and drawing rooms. “Kootam was just a discussion group for interesting facts. But I wanted to make it a bit more interesting, so I invited Krishnan and Prasanna to hold a Kuttam quiz. It was a huge hit, there were about 30 participants, all of us packed into my bedroom,” he remembers with a laugh.

From that, Kootam eventually evolved into Porkalam, a game-plus-quiz designed especially for The Board Room’s opening night in Mylapore. Porkalam 1 and 2 took place in June and July of 2019, and went up to four editions by the end of that year. And why did they change the name to H-129? “That is the flat where we created it all.”

520,2020/03/25,Undisturbed mass nesting of Olive Ridleys at Odisha’s Rushikulya rookery,"Turtles are safe as tourists and locals stay away from the coast due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

Restrictions in place for the COVID-19 threat is saving lakhs of Olive Ridley turtles from possible intrusion by humans, especially tourists, while they are continuing mass nesting at Odisha’s Rushikulya rookery.

According to the Forest Department’s enumeration, over 2,78,502 mother turtles have nested at this coast till Wednesday morning. Since Tuesday evening, over 72,142 Olive Ridleys have arrived at the beach to dig nests and lay eggs.

Day-time nesting

Olive Ridleys began mass nesting at the Rushikulya rookery from around 2 a.m. on March 21. Later in the day, the unusual phenomenon of day-time mass nesting took place at the coast. As a large number of mother Olive Ridleys are still in the sea near this coast, mass nesting is expected to continue for some more nights.

This event normally attracts hundreds of people to the spot, with Forest Department personnel spending considerable time and effort in controlling the crowds of tourists as well as locals. But this year, the COVID-19 lockdown has ensured no such disturbance occurs for the turtles.

No trawlers

Proper maintenance of cleanliness and provision of protection to the turtles at sea since November 2019, when the turtles mate, are major reasons for the large scale mass nesting of Oliev Ridleys at Rushikulya this year, said Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Amlan Nayak. Two trawlers, two speed boats and a country boat are being used by Forest Department to patrol the sea, in order to prevent fishing trawlers from plying along the coast. Trawlers did not cause any deaths of turtles as a result.

In 2019, mass nesting of Olive Ridleys did not occur in Rushikulya, in contrast to 2018, when “double mass nesting” occurred in February and April, with nesting figures rising above 4,73,000.

Cyclone’s aftermath

October 2018’s Cyclone Titli, and the floods that followed, left huge piles of waste over about 8 km of the Rushikulya coast, which had to be cleaned with excavators. It has been estimated that minute particles of the waste had remained, keeping the nesting Olive Ridleys away in 2019.

This year, the beach has received thorough cleaning at regular cleaning long before mass nesting commenced. The Forest Department also set up 11 off-shore camps early this year to monitor the beach.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tbksk0/article31166565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RIDLEY-IN-ODISHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/coronavirus-lockdown-undisturbed-mass-nesting-of-olive-ridleys-at-odishas-rushikulya-rookery/article31166566.ece

The news of Tokyo Olympics’ postponement is yet to sink in but India’s hockey captains Manpreet Singh and Rani Rampal are confident that they will take the disappointment in stride while working hard for the next one year.

“We had just finished the day’s evening session when chief coach Graham Reid informed us about the postponement of the Olympic Games,” Manpreet said.

Yet to sink in

“I think the news is yet to sink in for us. We were mentally gearing up for our first match on 25th July, so the disappointment is surely there but it is important for us to now look at the positives,” he added.

The Indian men’s and women’s teams have shaped up well over the course of the last year, winning big competitions such as the FIH Series Finals and the Olympic Qualifiers in front of the home crowd in November last year.

Fine start

The men’s team made a fine start to the season this year with a fantastic outing in the Pro League while the women’s team was stoked after its tour to New Zealand earlier this year.

522,2020/03/25,Coronavirus | Why 21-day lockdown period?,"There is scientific basis and epidemiological significance for the 21-day lockdown period announced by PM Modi.

Is there any public health/epidemiological significance to the 21-day lockdown period announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi?

It seems that rich scientific data has fed this decision to announce a 21-day lockdown period. In fact, 21-day quarantines have been discussed elaborately in the context of Ebola and the calculations are based on the estimated incubation period of the virus in a human host. The 21-day quarantine value is derived from interpretations of outbreak data, past and present, public health experts said.

Median incubation period

“In epidemiological terms, the logic is that we have arrived at an incubation period of 14 days. Give another week for the residual infection to die out, for the tail end, to be entirely safe, and you arrive at 21 days,” says Tamil Nadu’s Director of Public Health K. Kolandasamy. This being a new coronavirus, they have estimated that the median incubation period (the time between the entry of virus to the onset of symptoms/ disease) falls within this period.

Watch | Your COVID-19 queries answered

Science Daily recently reported of a new study in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine “that calculates that the median incubation period for COVID-19 is just over five days and that 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Researchers headed by Nicholas Reich, Associate Professor in the School of Public Health and Home Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, reportedly examined 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. They conclude that ‘the current period of active monitoring recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [14 days] is well supported by the evidence’.”

Most accurate models

Prof. Reich, it said, heads a flu forecasting collaborative that has produced some of the world’s most accurate models in recent years.

Breathing space

Dr. Kolandasamy further explained that in the interim, the lockdown or quarantine also creates some breathing space — to convince people of the seriousness of the situation and build positive public opinion, carry out disinfection of all buildings, vehicles and surfaces, and allows hospitals to prepare themselves for the next phase of operations. “We cannot stay at home indefinitely, but we must make our sacrifice count, so people need to follow these instructions strictly, as if their life depended on it.
